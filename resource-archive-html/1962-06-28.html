<div align="center"><b>BREACH OF PRIVILEGE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Announcement by Mr Speaker)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have found the time to read through the Memorandum addressed to

all  Honourable  Members by the Chairman of the Singapore Trade  Unions  Working

Committee  (Committee of Liaison Officers of Trade Unions) and  dated  the  25th

June, 1962.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have as yet received no complaint by any Member of a breach of

privilege, it is my duty as Speaker and guardian of the privileges of Honourable

Members  and of this House to sound a note of warning to all who wish to address

Honourablc Members in any matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well established that it is a breach of privilege for any person to do

anything which tends to impair, impede or fetter the free judgment or actions of

any Member in the services he gives to this Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Memorandum contains certain passages which may well be construed to be an

attempt  to  influence by veiled threats Government Back Benchers in their  free

judgment  and  conduct in relation to the Referendum Bill and matters  connected

therewith.  If  that is so, then there has been a grave breach of privilege  and

the offenders, if found guilty, would be liable to heavy penalties laid down  in

the Legislative Assembly (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Ordinance, 1962.

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>PUBLICATION OF PROPOSED CONSTITUTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>IMPLEMENTING PAPER COMMAND 33 OF 1961</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Prime Minister (a) when it is anticipated

that  the  proposed Constitution implementing Paper Command 33 of 1961  will  be

published: and (b) whether he will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



consider putting the issue of closer relations with the Federation to a  referen

dum after the publication of the proposed Constitution.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the constitutional provisions to give effect to

Paper  Command 33 of 1961 will be published for implementation after the  people

have   expressed  their  choice  on  the  mode  and  manner  of  the  inevitable

reunification of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya. If the people's choice

is  for  a merger with local autonomy for Singapore, particularly in respect  of

education  and labour, then the implementation of Paper Command No. 33  of  1961

will be proceeded with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the suggestion of the Member for Anson appears to be reversing the or

dinary  chronological order of events, for in the unlikely event of the majority

of  the  people supporting the complete merger proposals like Penang or Malacca,

US  has  been proposed by the Barisan Sosialis, or like Johore as has  been  pro

posed  by  the United People's Party, or like one of the States in  the  present

Federation  in  complete and unconditional merger as proposed  by  the  Workers'

Party,  the  task  would  then  be a relatively easy  one  of  Simply  including

Singapore  in  the  present framework of the Constitution of the  Federation  of

Malaya.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Does the Prime Minister not consider that the publication of the

draft  Constitution  spelling  out the agreement  would  assist  the  people  in

understanding  exactly what is intended and help them in making up  their  minds

for the purpose of voting at the referendum poll?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> With great respect, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would say that there

is  no  surer  way  of  adding confusion than to put  in  formal  constitutional

language  the provision& which have been spelled out in ordinary simple language

in  the  heads  of agreement contained in Command Paper No 33 of 1961. I  think

the Member for Anson will remember that the  constitutional arrangements that he

arrived at in 1956 although uncompleted certainly made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



easier reading and easier understanding than the ultimate Order in Council which

embodied  nearly all the provisions to which he agreed in 1956  other  than  the

articles or sections for the Internal Security Council.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Would the Prime Minister not consider that in the light of

experience  and  procedure in Australia and Switzerland among  other  countries,

that  the mode should be to call for a referendum after the proposals in precise

form have had the approval of Parliament?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Prime Minister has answered it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think it is

necessary  so  far as I can that I should leave the Member for  Anson  under  no

misapprehension  on  this  matter. I would say  that  it  is  the  duty  of  any

Government to ensure that things are presented simply and clearly to the people.

As  the Member for Anson himself knows, eminent legislators like the Member  for

Queenstown  can  make grave errors as to the meaning of merger like  Penang  and

Malacca.  The  Member for Anson has had occasion to withdraw on  behalf  of  the

Member  for  Queenstown the proposals set out by the Member for Queenstown,  all

because  he misconstrued the Federation Constitution to mean what he thought  he

could make it mean. I do not know about the comprehension range of the people of

Australia  or New Zealand on the English language, particularly for legal  forms

and precedents, but in our circumstances and in our clime, I suggest that we had

better  speak in simple, precise amid easy language - monosyllabic if possible - so

that everybody can understand what is intended, and let the lawyers who are  men

trained  for these jobs, legal draftsmen and parliamentary draftsmen to  execute

our intentions.

<div align="center"><b>APPLICATION OF LABOUR ORDINANCE TO DOMESTIC SERVANTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for Labour whether Government will

consider applying the Labour Ordinance to domestic servants.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Wee Toon Boon) (for</b>

<b>the Minister for Labour):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I am asked to reply. This matter has been receiving attention

for  a  considerable time in view of the need to be sure that no unrealistic  or

impracticable measures are introduced whose immediate effect would be to deprive

thousands of these workers of their livelihood and thereby further aggravate the

present unemployment situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I understand the circumlocution, there is

no  intention of applying the Ordinance to domestic servants. But would the  Par

liamentary Secretary consider at least issuing regulations for guidance of  good

employer  relations in respect of domestic servants so that  the  employers  may

have a model with which to apply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Come, come, Mr Marshall.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in that respect, the Member for Anson can

rest  assured that though employers arc not obliged to give certain benefits  to

the employees under this Ordinance, but nevertheless when domestic employees are

aggrieved because they are not given sufficient notice of termination  of  their

service or -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Or otherwise maltreated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> - maltreated they always consult and seek the assistance of

the  Labour  Ministry.  We  have  always assisted  them  in  getting  sufficient

compensation or adequate notice of termination of their service.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I had in mind rather the question of whether the Government

would  assist  employers to recognise the limitation of hours and conditions  of

work, and  if it does not wish to apply the provisions whether it  would  issue

some regulations for guidance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, domestic servants are different from

factory workers. Therefore, it has to be left to the conscience of the employers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



to  impose fair working conditions on their domestic servants. I hope  that  the

Member for Anson will set the example.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>INCOME TAX</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Penalty for late payments)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for Finance (a) what is the policy of

the  Commissioner of Inland Revenue in the exercise of his discretion in respect

of  the  imposition of the 5 per cent penalty for late payments  of  income  tax

during  the  currency of the year of taxation; and (b) whether the Minister  has

any  information  as  to the policy of the Comptroller  of  Income  Tax  of  the

Federation of Malaya in respect of similar statutory discretion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, late payment of income tax is not a

problem  to  wage  earners  and  salary earners  who  can  arrange  for  monthly

deductions to be made from their pay to the Income Tax Office, lt is a  question

lacing businessmen and capitalists. It is therefore refreshing to note that  the

Workers' Party is taking up the cudgels for the capitalists. The Commissioner of

Inland  Revenue  has discretion to remit penalty or extend the date  of  payment

where  there  are good reasons to do so. Normally a seven days' grace  is  given

before  the  fine is sent and penalty imposed. Where a taxpayer is  able  to  de

monstrate  that  he cannot meet payment by the due date because of  his  absence

From  Malaya or sickness or other reasonable cause, remission of penalty may  be

granted  on the individual :merits of the case. Deferred payment is also allowed

in  the case of a company which has commenced trading and instalments of payment

are allowed on the second year of tax as a matter of practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount received by way of penalty in 1961 was $285,000 in Singapore. the

amount in the Federation was about $259,000. I have no exact information  as  to

the  policy of the Comptroller of Income Tax in the Federation of Malaya in  the

exercise of statutory discretion in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



respect of the imposition of penalty. However, to judge by the amount of penalty

imposed in the two territories, I would say that one territory is not very  much

out of line with the other.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The Workers' Party is interested in justice for all. The workers

or  capitalists would inquire whether the Minister would consider  remission  of

penalty  where there is payment within the year of taxation. Where, for example,

the taxpayer pays the 1962 tax during 1962.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Such cases would arise when new companies are being

established. As I mentioned in my answer, instalments and deferred payments  are

allowed as a matter of practice.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE (CMD. 11 of 1962)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of Supply [1st Allotted day].



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Minister signify the recommendation of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara before the Committee proceeds?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance and Acting Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance and Acting Minister for Culture (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> I so signify.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Cmd. Paper 11 of 1962. The summary is at page 3.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 49-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head 49, Ministry of Culture. There are amendments standing in

the name of the Member for Tanglin and the Member for Havelock.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 49 be reduced by $10 in respect of new

subhead "Temporary Staff for Television Service".*



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Low Por Tuck.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the list of posts under Schedule A, I notice a very important

omission:

that whereas for the Broadcasting Division there are three posts for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



Programme  Assistants  in the Budget Estimates for 1962,  looking  after  school

programmes  and  such  like educational items, here I see  no  provision  for  a

similar  post.  Sir, we know that as an educational medium,  television  is  far

superior to radio broadcasting or the cinema. In fact, television will  reach  a

larger  number of young people in their homes,, whereas in the case of a  cinema

theatre, they must go to the theatre and buy tickets. In the case of television,

children can just press certain buttons or turn certain knobs and there the film

will be brought to their own homes. If, therefore, in a television programme the

films  shown are not suitable for our young people, then I am afraid the  object

of  the Government in helping the young people will be defeated. In view of  the

fact  that more than half of the people of Singapore are young people, I  should

think  that posts similar to those provided for the Broadcasting Division should

also  be provided here. Very likely it may be due to an oversight because  there

are  three  phases, and this being only the first phase, maybe the  thought  was

that  it  was not necessary to include it since there will be just a  three-hour

programme and only one hour will be for the news and the rest will be for films.

But  the  selection of the films then becomes a very important thing unless  the

Government is going to invite the Programme Assistants in charge of Schools from

the  Broadcasting Division to assist also in the Television Section  until  such

time as they are able to provide for separate posts for Programme Assistants  in

charge of Schools. Sir, I draw attention to this omission so that the Government

will  remedy  it  so as to prevent the wrong type of films from being  televised

with harmful effects to the young.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to know whether the Government would advertise all

these posts in Schedule A, or whether in fact they are at present working.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

inquire  whether Government would consider allocating one channel of  television

for use by an independent nonprofit authority to be appointed in accordance with

statutory provisions so that the people of Singapore can have the opportunity of

at least one channel where they can get honest news and views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are conscious that the philosophy of the Government with reference to Radio

Singapore  is  that  they  are  perfectly entitled  to  utilise  it  for  biased

propaganda  purposes  and,  in fact, for party purposes.  All  we  ask  at  this

juncture - recognising  that it is too much to ask that an  organisation  of  such

vital importance to the nation for the dissemination of news and views should be

in  independent hands - we wish to inquire whether they will permit  one  channel,

not  depriving themselves of anything, but to permit one channel to be used  and

paid  for  by  a  non-profit independent authority appointed in accordance  with

provisions of a statute to that effect.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, I fully share the fears expressed by the

Member  for  Tanglin  that care should be taken to see that morally  undesirable

films are not transmitted over the television network.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> What about news?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I will come to that in due course. The Member for Anson

must  really learn to contain his impatience. Then there might be a  better  co-ordination between his tongue and his mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as I say, I fully agree with the sentiments expressed by the Member for

Tanglin.  But I think he is technically wrong in saying that there has  been  an

omission  in  respect of the establishment of a television station. Broadcasting

is  broadcasting,  and television is completely a different activity.  Also  one

must not he too hypnotised by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>



words.  We  may call in the broadcasting service a grade of officers,  programme

assistants. In the television service they may be doing similar duties but under

different  names.  May  I  refer the hon. Member for Tanglin  to  the  grade  of

producers  - 10 producers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What do they produce? Lux Soap?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> They are Division I posts and none of them are programme

assistants.  Also  there is the Chief Executive (Services),  Grade  F,  and  the

Chief, Production Facilities and Films. In this hierarchy there will be officers

whose  responsibility  it  is to vet and arrange programmes  to  ensure  certain

standards of taste and decency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as for the Member for Havelock, these posts will be advertised when men

are  required.  In fact, two months ago some lost have been advertised  and  the

Public  Service Commission have made selections for some of those and are making

selections for others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Arson now wants an independent television service. How nice,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, if we can afford this sort of thing. He says  the  authority

should  be  independent, non-profit making. But the trouble with  this  sort  of

venture is that when you have a fairly small number of receiving audience, there

may  well  be  a  loss.  It is not a question of making a profit, but  avoiding

losses.  Our  calculation is that the television service  will  make  losses  of

several  million  dollars a year for quite some time before  it  recoups  losses

through  advertising revenue licensing fees. So if the Member for Anson can  let

me  know,  in my capacity as Minister for Finance, not in my capacity as  Acting

Minister  for  Culture,  any philanthropic organisation  which  is  prepared  to

shoulder  part  of  the  losses that we are going to  incur,  then  I  shall  be

delighted to receive his suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe

that the Four-Year Plan of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>



Government  can only have this part concerning T.V. materialised. We  also  know

that  in carrying out the T.V. services, the Government is trying to help itself

with political propaganda and therefore, at the present juncture, the Government

has  stepped  up its speed in setting up a temporary station in Bukit  Batok  in

order to facilitate the propaganda work of the P.A.P. Therefore, I hope that the

Acting  Minister for Culture will assure this House that the T.V. service  will

not be taken advantage of for the purpose of political propaganda of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to find out from the Acting Minister for Culture

concerns  this. As far as I know, there are two surveying teams,  one  from  New

Zealand  and  the other from Japan. Can the Minister concerned  tell  the  House

whether  in, the future T.V. service which country will be responsible  for  the

assistance given to the T.V. service in Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Is the Minister not aware that, in fact, on television it is

possible to have several channels, and an additional channel to the one proposed

would  not  entail proportionately equal expense, and would he  be  prepared  to

consider  the  question of renting a channel to an independent television  body?

Would  Government  consider  bringing in a Bill to create  such  an  independent

television body?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the only so-called independent television

bodies  who  may  be  interested in running either the  whole  or  part  of  the

television  service would be commercial companies who will want to make  use  of

the facilities purely to make profits, if there is any question of renting out a

studio  room  or  television  time  to  them,  it  is  obvious  that  the   only

consideration between them and the Government would be just how much money  they

would make.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that is the sort of independent television authority that the

Member  for  Anson  is  thinking of. On the other hand, if  he  is  thinking  of

something independent, like the British



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>



Broadcasting  Corporation, then the question is: who is going  to  put  out

the  money  to pay for what can be fairly substantial losses in  the  first

few  years  of operations? So until we get clear answers to these problems, I do not think it is worthwhile to pursue the subject here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Choa Chu Kang expresses fears that this would be used as

unfair  propaganda. He is entitled to his views, but we do not share  them.

So  I do not intend to pursue this argument further. As for assistance from

abroad,  it is true that we have two missions; one is from Japan  and  that

is  concerned mainly with the technical aspects of setting up a  television

service - where should the site of the transmitting station be; how fast  can

it  expand; and whether the cost could be covered up in the long  run,  and

so  on  and so forth. The Australian experts came here to advise us on  the

details of setting up the service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> New Zealand.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> New Zealand.

The  details  of setting up the service were, e.g., what staff to  recruit,

what  equipment to buy, how to tender for them, and so on and so forth.  We

shall,  of  course,  get  the benefit of expert  assistance  from  whatever

source  is  available. But we are at the same time training our  own  local

personnel in these new techniques, and every year anything between  half  a

dozen  and  a  dozen  technicians  are being  sent  abroad  for  study  and

training.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am sorry to pursue this, Mr Speaker, but it seems only

to

be  partly understood and I do ask the indulgence of this House since it is

a

matter  of  some  importance. The Minister did refer to the British Broadcasting

Corporation.  But,  of  course, he is aware, as we all  are,  that  in  the

United  Kingdom the potent influence of the radio and television is not  in

the  hands of Government or of any political Party. It is, in fact, in  the

hands  of  a  non-profit public body created by statute. I  appreciate  the

Government in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>



the circumstances it finds itself in, and I will elaborate no further their wish

to  maintain  control of both radio and television. But could we not  create  an

independent  radio and television body by statute empowering it  to  rent  at  a

rental  paying  the  Government for a wavelength on the air  and  a  channel  in

respect  of  television? And they could recoup themselves by power  to  take  in

advertisements.  These  have been tried out and have been  found  successful  in

other  countries. As I have pointed out, the additional cost  of  a  channel  in

television  is not proportionate to the original cost of establishment,  and  it

could  easily  be borne by the advertisements which would be attracted  to  this

independent  television channel. Would the Government consider,  at  least,  and

investigate the possibilities of the creation of such a body?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> From time to time we are indebted to Members of the

Opposition for making valuable contributions to the problems that confront us. I

am quite sure if the Member for Anson will elaborate on his plan and put it on a

document, it will receive proper consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is one thing just striking a bright idea across the sky, but it is another

thing  formulating it in a coherent, practical and feasible manner. I  am  quite

sure  the  Member  for Anson is capable of putting it on a  document,  both  the

structural consideration of creating an independent body and the running of  one

channel in the same studios. I do not know myself how these things are done, how

the  B.B.C. and the I.T.F. do it. I am told they have two completely  different

outfits - one  set  of  studios  run by the B.B.C. and  another  one  run  by  the

commercial  T.V. outfit. These are problems which I do  not  think  either  the

Minister  for Finance (in his capacity as Minister for Finance or otherwise)  or

the Minister for Culture is in a position to speak with any authority, let alone

myself;  but no doubt the Member for Anson has spent some time before  he  makes

the suggestion of just hiring out one channel, and if he will spell out all the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



implications,   I  give  him  the  undertaking  that  it  will  receive   proper

consideration and a proper reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to express a hope that the Minister will give  an

answer  to  my question, i.e. that the future T.V. service should not  be  taken

advantage of by the Government for political purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next I would like to find out from the Minister concerned, from what countries

will such facilities be obtained for the T.V. service?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I had said, in reply to his first question, that he

is  entitled to his own view, and we to ours. We deny that there is any improper

use  of  radio  facilities, and we deny that there will be any improper  use  of

broadcasting facilities. So no assurance whatsoever is called for from us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second question, the main equipment for the transmitting

station and the studios has been ordered by tender and the successful tender has

been  Marconi Company of Great Britain. Most of the equipment will be  purchased

from  them,  though  part of the studio and outdoor service  equipment  will  be

ordered from Japan.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the assurance given to my

query, may I beg leave to withdraw?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 49 he reduced by $10 in respect of new

subhead "Malaysia Grand Prix".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the First Supplementary Estimates at page 2 we find

that  about $114,000 was received. And it says that "the major portion of  which

was  derived from the sale of tickets and advertisements." Sir, I would like  to

know from the Minister what are the actual figures for sales of tickets and  for

advertisements.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I do not have the figures or the details, but I will be

sending for them in due course.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member wish for a vote?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b> indicated dissent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 49 be reduced by $10 in respect of new

subhead "Malaysia Week".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during Malaysia Week I think everyone of us realised that

posters  put  up  by the Government were really not to boost Malaysia  Week  but

rather  that  the  Government was dirtying the buildings  and  places  all  over

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> What about unauthorised Barisan posters that clustered up all

Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> The other point is that Government restricted other Parties

and  organisations  from  putting  up posters  during  Malaysia  Week.  But  the

Government  itself - of course, that definitely is the P.A.P. - put up posters, all

over  Singapore.  That  is  merely a waste of public funds.  I  would  like  the

Government to ensure that such waste should not be allowed in future.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I intend to give no such assurance, Mr Speaker, Sir,I do

not  know what are his objections. First, it could be an objection to' Malaysia.

That is fair enough. He objects to Malaysia, we like Malaysia; and if we want to

propagate  the  idea  of Malaysia, we do it. That may be one  objection,  and  I

consider that as an invalid objection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, he may say that if the Government puts up posters, then other people

can  put  up  posters.  Well, other people can put up posters.  There  are  laws

regulating  the  putting up of posters, and if they make their application  and

conform  to  the  laws,  then posters are put up. On the  other  hand,  if  they

instigate school kids to put up posters at 3 o'clock in the morning, then  they

are merely looking for trouble. So that may be the second



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>



objection - that if we put up posters, and they should be putting up anti-posters,

then I say that there is provision for that sort of thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the third objection could be that he does not want posters to be put up

at  all.  There is great merit in that proposal. I mean, in a well  ordered  and

rational society, appeals through propaganda such as posters, advertisements and

so  on  will  be  completely unnecessary. In fact, no country in the  world  has

reached  the  stage  of  being completely well ordered and  perfectly  rational.

Therefore,  these  appeals  to human reason, to human emotion  perhaps,  through

various media of publicity are necessary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the money

spent  by  the  Government on Malaysia Week was merely wasted. In the  so-called

"Malaysia Week", I believe you can say that a good amount of money was spent  on

a  variety  concert  put  up on the Padang before the City  Council,  but  which

attracted only a small crowd. Moreover, the purpose of this Malaysia Week was to

mislead the people of the Borneo territories. Malaysia Week was a flop.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Members of the

House  will  remember  that when the question of Malaysia was  debated  in  this

House,  the  Member  for Anson moved an amendment supporting  the  principle  of

Malaysia,  and  I  believe all Parties in this Chamber also  supported  Malaysia

except  the Barisan Sosialis who were opposed to the Tunku's concept of Malaysia

because  they wanted Malaysia to include Indonesia. Now, since the  majority  of

Members  in  this  House support the principle of Malaysia, and  therefore  they

represent  the  majority  of the people in Singapore, it  is  quite  right  that

Malaysia  Week should be celebrated, and if public funds were used to  celebrate

Malaysia  Week,  it  was done to good purpose. I therefore  see  no  reason  why

Members  of the Barisan Sosialis should today say that it was a waste of  money.

It might



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>



be  a  waste  of  money  in their eyes because in their concept of  Malaysia

Indonesia is not included.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> You see, some malicious lies, or falsehoods -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown should take control of himself

and  realise  that  he  starts off straight away on  the  wrong  foot  by  using

unparliamentary  words. He has withdrawn the word "lies".  I  accept  that,  but

perhaps he can contain himself now and start off in' a cool, collected and  calm

manner. Dr Lee.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is typical of the P.A.P. to distort

and twist the Opposition stand, and this is a typical example. They say that we

want  Indonesia to be part of Malaysia. We have never said that, Sir. They tried

to  quote  instances  to  show that our Secretary-General  had  spoken  to  some

correspondents of Bintang Timor and things like that, but this has  been  denied

time  and again. In spite of that, just because the Government has control  over

the  propaganda machinery, just because they have the radio, just  because  they

have rediffusion, just because they have a very friendly Press -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You are getting jealous.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - therefore they can keep on repeating and repeating the

big  falsehood. Everybody knows, Sir - I do not know whether "lie" could  be  used

here,  Sir;  it does not apply to anybody in particular -that if a  big  lie  is

repeated  long enough, some people will come to believe it. That  is  the  whole

strategy  of  the P.A.P. They want to keep on repeating a falsehood  and  they

want  to keep on repeating it so as to fit in with their own strategy of things.

The  present  concept of Malaysia which makes Singapore a so-called partner  and

which  gives Singapore unequal status is not the' form of Malaysia which we  can

accept. The present so-called Malaysia Week was a pure P.A.P. propaganda stunt  in

order to boost their merger proposals.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I am very glad to know that: the Opposition do not

like money spent on Malaysia Week. Obviously it hurts them.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Barisan Sosialis. I do beg the pardon of the Member

for  Anson. The Barisan Opposition do not like it. So obviously what we  did  in

Malaysia  Week has hurt them, and I regret that we did not spend more  money  to

hurt them more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Queenstown said that it was untrue to say that leading

members of the Barisan Sosialis had publicly stated that they wanted merger with

Indonesia. There is one honourable Gentleman in this very House -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Will you quote instances?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> We have quoted, Mr Speaker, Sir, not once but several

times,  not  only in this House but also in the newspapers. There  has  been  no

answer.  I  can  give  the Member for Queenstown several newspaper  cuttings  or

statements issued by the P.A.P. Political Bureau on this very subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> We do not even read them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> He reads them.

He winces every time he reads them. He pretends that he does not read them.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Minister has made his point. All this is completely

irrelevant, of course. It started with a small irrelevancy which is  becoming  a

major  development. But I think the Minister has made his point. There  will  be

another opportunity of discussing this very interesting subject.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> I do not want to start a debate on Malaysia, Mr

Speaker.  Sir,I am quite certain that you would not be allowing us to do  that,

even  if  we  want to, but I do not know whether the Government Benches  want  a

renewed debate on Malaysia and if they do want it by all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



means,  initiate  it  and we are quite prepared to have  a  long  debate  up  to

midnight on Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> We have had one.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, we have had one and the understanding of what happened at that

debate is either not accurate or they deliberately choose to distort what was in

fact  said.  I agree that the Ministry - not the Ministry of Culture -  everytime  I

think of the P.A.P. Political Bureau, I think of the Ministry of Culture. It  is

true that the P.A.P. Political Bureau has been issuing statements quoting -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Quoting you.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - not quoting me, alleging that I had said Malaysia should include

Indonesia.  I do not want to waste more time than is necessary. I just  want  to

say that I never said that Malaysia should include Indonesia.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> What did you say?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The word "Indonesia" was only used in the context of explaining the

original context of Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am getting worried - how often they do

not  understand  what  they  are  saying. I  remember  the  Member  for  Thomson

distinctly  saying - my colleague, the Minister for Law, is busy  in  the  Library

getting  the  relevant passage - "Indonesia is the heartland of Malaysia  and  any

Malaysia that does not include Indonesia has not got a heart." Now, Sir, if that

does not mean he is in favour of Indonesia being in Malaysia, what does it mean?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is completely irrelevant. Perhaps the Member will have an

opportunity  of  answering  that. I think the Member for  Queenstown  has  given

notice of a motion which might let in that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and, negatived.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $970,240 for Head 49 ordered to stand part of the First Supplementary Estimates of Expenditure for 1962.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 51-



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 51 be reduced by $10 in respect of new

subhead "Singapore Infantry Regiment - Second Battalion".



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, I do not see any necessity for having this Second  Battalion.

When this Second Battalion of the Singapore Infantry Regiment is formed, will it

do  honour to the Prime Minister on ceremonial occasions only or will it be used

to repress the people?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Repress you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> I would like to know from the Government the necessity for having this Second Battalion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, we have always known the Member for Havelock to be by

far  the  least  warlike  of all the 13 Assemblymen who  form  the  new  Barisan

Sosialis,  and  I am quite sure that if all the other people in the  Barisan  So

sialis have an aversion for physical collision as we know he has, then obviously

it would not be necessary to have people standing guard over essential services,

like  electricity, water, gas and to maintain the essentials of life which  from

time  to  time  those in charge of the unions in connection with  transport  and

other essential services can threaten the community with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I can assure the Member for Havelock that the Second Battalion really can

do no more than just augment the ordinary static guard duties and the ceremonial

duties  of  the First Battalion. The ultimate objective when all British  troops

are  withdrawn - as  we  are  quite  sure in due  course  they  will  have  to  be

withdrawn - would be to maintain throughout the whole of Malaysia something in the

region of 15 to 20 battalions for the defence of Malaya or Malaysia. I am  quite

sure  he  would  not share the view of those who believe that the  British  Army

should protect our shores.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, his counterpart in the Federation of Malaya, the Socialist Front,

is, constantly passing resolutions for the withdrawal of foreign troops. Surely.

Sir,  those who do not want foreign troops should welcome local troops  to  main

tain  the  integrity of this country from attack, either from within or without

and  those  who have no intention of aiding either the invader from outside  or,

the  subversive from inside should have, no fear of the martial qualities  of  a

Second Battalion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, I can see from Schedule B in the First Supplementary Estimates

of  Expenditure the request by the Government for $1 million that it is intended

just to increase the number of soldiers and officers by a few. I think it is  a

mere  waste  of public money to spend more than $1 million to recruit  not  more

than  400 officers. There is no' necessity at all to have this Second Battalion.

Why  cannot  the Government use' this sum of over $1 million to build hospitals,

schools and other public utility services such as pipes, building roads and  so

on? From these services ,and facilities, the people can derive some benefit. But

now  the  Government  has  spent one million dollars  of  public  money  on  the

establishment of this Second Battalion of the Singapore Infantry Regiment. It is

not  the proper way to spend public money, Mr Speaker, Sir. You will know  that

at  present the Singapore Infantry Regiment's work is only to suppress and curb

riots  and  violence, and perhaps to protect the P.A.P. Headquarters. This  year

there' was an occasion for this Infantry Regiment, combined with the Police,  to

protect  the  P.A.P. Headquarters. Mr Speaker, Sir, as representatives  of  the

people,  we  have the duty to supervise over the Government's use of  the  money

derived from the people in a proper way. We should not spend this $1,040,725  on

something  that  is not necessary. I am of the opinion that the Government  from

now  on should, spend public money on services for the benefit of the people and

not on military Services.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  we  can  understand well the Member  for  Choa  Chu  Kang's

apprehension regarding this Second Battalion of the Singapore Infantry Regiment.

We  can understand his feelings. Mr Speaker, Sir, if in Singapore there are  no

subversive  elements who Want to sabotage Singapore, then there is no  necessity

to  have  such a military establishment, and everybody would agree that the  sum

could  then  be  used to build, say, hospitals, schools and do other  things  to

benefit the people. But under the present practical circumstances we have such a

necessity.  Especially judging from the present and future political situations,

it  is very necessary for Singapore to have this Second Battalion. We know  that

if  the  security situation in Singapore deteriorates and there  is  turmoil  in

Singapore, all  construction  work  such  as  hospitals  and  schools  will  be

frustrated.  Of  course,  if  we want to accept the  proposition  by  the  Vice-President  of  the Barisan Sosialis, Mr Woodhull, to preserve British  military

bases  in  Singapore, then it is not necessary to have a Second  Battalion.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  purpose of having the' Second Battalion is  that  Singapore

will,  by  1963  or before, merge with the Federation of Malaya  and  become  in

dependent. Therefore, it is necessary for us to have our own military forces  to

take  over  the  responsibilities  at present  borne  by  the  British  Military

Services.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir.

you  see how the P.A.P. always contradict themselves. The Prime Minister himself

not  so  very long ago had preached to the whole of Singapore that  it  was  not

necessary  to  have  troops  in Singapore. Even the  Civil  Defence  Corps,  you

remember,  was' dissolved. It was not necessary according to the Prime  Minister

and  also to the Minister for Home Affairs, and you see what he has said  today.

It is necessary to have troops. For what? To make sure that strikers and workers

will  be suppressed: to make sure that if they want to carry blacklegs along  to

break a strike, they make it a military operation. Just to make sure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>



that  if there are people sleeping inside the Work Brigade Camps, the troops can

go in, all ready in battle-dress -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Wake them up!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Wake them up.

And not only wake them up, make them stand in the sun for hours on end. That  is

what  the P.A.P. intend to do. Sir, they have so lost touch with the people that

when the people go along to see the

-Ministers,  the  Ministers lock themselves up and even call special  police  to

make  sure  that  nobody can ever get in to see them. This is actually  what  is

happening today. The P.A.P. dare not have rallies. For example, just to touch  a

little on Malaysia Week -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon.

Member  is  a bit too late. We do not know whether the special guards come  from

the  Second Battalion of the Singapore Infantry Regiment. If they do,  then  the

Member is in order. If they do not, then he is not in order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will skip that part. And see what excuses they give today

for  having  more  troops. They say they hope to keep order in  Singapore  after

Malaysia and they need their own troops. If they talk of defending Singapore,  a

few hundred troops will not make any difference, Sir. The Prime Minister went to

great  lengths  to  convince us in days of old that even a few  thousand  troops

could  not  look after Singapore. He said anybody who controlled the  Federation

could just walk into Singapore, like the Japanese troops in 1942. So what is the

point  of having those few hundred troops? Those troops are meant not to protect

the  people of Singapore but to protect the Headquarters of the P.A.P.  That  is

what  is actually happening, and the training which our local troops are  having

at  the  present  moment  is not the training to meet  the  enemy  from  outside

Singapore, but to see how they can surround blocks and buildings and  to  ensure

that nobody escapes the cordon. That is what is happening, Sir,It is well known

in  Singapore.  They time the operation to see how many minutes  it, takes  the

troops to arrive and to see how many people can get in and get out. That is what

our troops are trained for.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>



Just  to make sure that our own citizens cannot get out of their houses, is that

not  the P.A.P. meaning? While the whole world think of reducing armaments  and

troops,  our Government wants to increase armaments and troops. [Laughter]  They

think  by  laughing  it  away  the people will not notice  their  illogical  and

nonsensical way of doing things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to go into details, but you will remember the incidents we

quoted  of  Singapore  troops  having been used against  workers  and  the  Work

Brigade.  We  had already explained that it was not necessary to use  troops  on

those  occasions. Money that can be saved on such troops can be  put  to  better

purpose. The Member for Choa Chu Kang has already given you an indication as  to

how  money could be used on schools, houses and on improving the services of the

Government  in  general,  especially  the reduction  of  rents.  The  people  of

Singapore  are complaining of the high rentals of our own houses. If  the  money

which  they want to spend on troops could be spent on facilities for the people,

then  at  least they would have some justification. As it is, what justification

have  the  P.A.P. to use more money. It is only meant to repress the  people  in

stead of uplifting them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker.  Sir,  we have seen that the Front Benches of the  Government  are

asking  this House to approve more than a million dollars and they are  laughing

over  this matter. We cannot accept their attitude. According to the explanation

given  by the Minister for Home Affairs, he seems to say that in future, perhaps

after 1963 when the P.A.P. collapse, they will require these troops to take over

the government. Does he mean that?



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I am very impressed by the speech made by the Member

for  Choa  Chu  Kang.  The  Leader  of  the Barisan  Sosiahis,  the  Member  for

Queenstown, says that the establishment of the Second Battalion of the Singapore

Infantry Regiment is really to protect the P.A.P. Headquarters.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is clear that the Barisan Sosialis intend to use violence in stead of conducting the struggle in a constitutional manner. Mr Speaker, we

will  not  use  military forces to suppress the trade union movement  and  other

organisations,  but it has been proved by the Barisan Sosialis  themselves  that

they  intend  to  create confusion in Singapore. Mr Speaker, we have  explained

that  the  duty of the Police is to maintain peace and order. So it is with  the

military,  to  all those who are innocent, law-abiding citizens. They  need  not

have any fear. Only thieves and robbers need fear the police. There is no reason

why  we  should  not welcome the creation of the Second Battalion.  I  think  we

should  eject  all  these foreign troops, but when it is  time  that  we  should

increase  the strength of the local troops, the Barisan oppose it. It  is  clear

that the Barisan Sosialis prefer to see foreign troops on our soil.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> From their own Back-Bencher, from the Parliamentary

Secretary to the Prime Minister himself has come the truth of why they want  the

troops.  The  troops  are  going  to be used,  according  to  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the  Prime Minister, against people who will use unconstitutional

means.  Sir, we have seen how troops have been deployed in a provocative  manner

against the holding of union meetings. Sir, I wish the Front Benches, especially

of the Government, will remember this. In the discussion on the Referendum Bill,

we have been laying great stress on one particular point. That if the Government

will  not allow the people peaceful and constitutional means to fight for  their

aspirations  and  wishes, if the P.A.P. is not going to give  the  Opposition  a

chance to fight peacefully and constitutionally, if the people are not going  to

be given a chance to say 'Yes' or 'No' in a peaceful and constitutional manner,

then,  depending on the temper of the people if things develop, the P.A.P. will

have  to  bear the full responsibility of all the consequences and no amount  of

troops will help the P.A.P. The troops will not help the P.A.P. The P.A.P. dare

not go to a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



general  election. They dare not even hold a rally. When invited  to  a  rally,

they  dare not attend. If they want to make speeches to a crowd, they  want  to

first  put up a show so that other people can go to see the show and listen  to

them incidentally. That is all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The passion with which the Member for Queenstown is

moved  at the prospect of a second infantry regiment has impressed upon  me  two

things.  First,  he has an unholy fear of cordons of disciplined  troops  which,

perhaps in his wilder moments in bed, he dreams will he enclosing upon those who

are  wicked:  and,  second, in the last resort, he has, in  violent  threatening

language, warned the Government that a second battalion is not enough. I concede

that  point when I first speak on this. It has been estimated that for  security

purposes,  maintenance of law and order, in times of insurrection, there  should

at least be five battalions deployed in Singapore and several more battalions in

South  Malaya and several other battalions in Malaysia. We have been  threatened

from time to time by the Member for Queenstown about the use of force: force  if

they  cannot  say  "yes" or "no"; force if Malaysia is brought into  being.  Not

unnaturally, it is the duty of the Government to ensure that, if, I hope, in the

unlikely event of those behind the Member for Queenstown who not only talk force

but  actually  use force and had occasions in the past to have  met  force  with

force, we should not fail in our duty to protect the lives and limbs of our popu

lation.  That is the duty of the Government. That is the duty of any government.

I  need  hardly  remind  the  Member for Queenstown that  the  Chinese  People's

Republic  has  a standing army of 5 million out of a population of 650  million,

about one per cent of the population. It has a total militia of 50 million  men.

The  Indian  Army  is somewhere in the region of 600,000. The  Indonesian  Army,

which  has had to appeal for volunteers, was no less than 370,000 men. This  was

at  a time when on one occasion the Minister for Home Affairs and I had a casual

conversation with an officer of the Indonesian Army who happened to pass through

Singapore. I would say 817 for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>

the  first  regiment  is a very modest number to ensure that  when  dignitaries

like  the  Member for Queenstown attend some of our ceremonial  meetings,  they

are  received  with  the proper decorum and courtesies.  The  Second  Battalion

would  augment this panoply of protocol and courtesies extended  to  those  who

are  peaceful  and  law-abiding. To those who are not  peaceful  and  not  law-abiding,  it  is obviously our duty to ensure that when this wild  talk  should

lead to wild action, the wild men are put away.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had not intended to speak on this amendment

earlier  on.  I  gathered the impression that it was a token amendment  for  the

purpose of raising the inappropriateness of the utilisation of our troops in the

past. With that I would have been in full agreement in so far as the evidence in

my  possession goes. But when the issue is directed, as it seems to be directed,

as to the necessity for a second battalion, frankly, Sir, I must join issue with

those  who deny that necessity. We are a people of one and a half million,  Sir,

with  a  large  city. It cannot be doubted that though a vast  majority  of  our

people  are  peace-loving  and  decent, there have  in  the  past  been  unhappy

incidents  where important numbers have been misled. There have been unfortunate

acts  which have caused damage and personal injury, and in one or two  instances

death.  In  the  context of our experience, Sir, within  the  lifetime  of  this

Assembly  in  the last seven years, we cannot deny the validity for the  request

for  a  further battalion. It is true that troops can be misused and that  power

can  be  abused.  But that is another question. The real issue  that  should  be

before  this Assembly is, are there adequate powers for an honest Government  to

deal  with possible situations where crises of violence are threatened? I am  in

an  acutely embarrassing position of finding myself in agreement with the P.A.P.

on any aspect. But, Sir, I must be quite frank in this instance. I do agree with

them that one battalion is inadequate and that a second battalion is necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I deplore the implication in the speech of the Member for Queenstown that

our people could, in their despair



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>



and  frustration,  which is perfectly legitimate, consider  the  utilisation  of

unconstitutional methods for the expression of that frustration. I do  not  seek

to  wear a halo in this instance. I am not speaking of what is constitutional be

cause professionally I am trained to respect the law. I say, Sir, as a practical

human  being, I face the basic fact that experience has repeatedly  proved  that

where  there  is  violence, only the people suffer, not those in authority.  The

workers  suffer and the poor suffer, and any violence would react a hundred-fold

to  the detriment of our people. There is no way out for the people of Singapore

in  the  frustration  they  suffer from P.A.P. rule  except  the  constitutional

process.  In  the  name  of the Workers' Party, Sir, and  as  a  Member  of  the

Opposition who feels very deeply the dishonesty of the proposed conduct of  this

Government, I say that we do not agree that there should ever be any question of

unconstitutional  conduct and violence. The thought of  such  action  could  but

bring  our  people into grave danger and would be a retrograde step which  would

take us way back into the tragedies we suffered under imperial rule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that in the heat of anger, in the agonising position where, by virtue

of  the  constitutional position, we are fighting a losing fight for decency,  a

rearguard  action that we know will mean in the end defeat by  virtue  of  their

majority,  but in action we must see through. I know that in that  position  one

tends  in one's frustration sometimes to indulge in sentiments which are  wholly

inappropriate. I would suggest that the Member for Queenstown may  well  utilise

the opportunity to speak again in Committee to deface the unhappy implication of

the possibility of unconstitutional violence as a reply to P.A.P. dishonesty.  I

do  support  the provision, Sir, for a second battalion, because I think  it  is

legitimate for an honest Government, and this is a provision not merely for  the

P.A.P. Government.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I just want to say a few words, Sir. This is not merely to

answer the Member for Anson. We never advocate violence but we want to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



warn the P.A.P. against provoking the people into violence. That is what we want

to  tell  the  P.A.P. All actions of the P.A.P. have been designed towards  that

end.  All the time they want to provoke the people into doing something  and  we

want  to warn the P.A.P. again: Do not misuse the troops that are meant for  the

defence of the island against an external enemy. If you want anything for  civil

defence,  you do not use troops. You use the police maybe, or the civil  defence

maybe.  The  P.A.P. have for a long time been advocating that  school  children

should be trained to be policemen. They wanted the citizens of Singapore  to  be

trained not for violence, but to respect law and order; and schoolboys had  been

asked  to  enlist as policemen or police constables in order to attend to  their

civic duties. Troops are never meant to be used inside their own country against

the people. That is what I want to stress. That is what the P.A.P. must realise.

Never provoke the people with the use of our own troops.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister has forgotten what he has said in the past.

About  one year ago, he had on occasion told Members of the Opposition  that  if

they  wanted boxing, then they must observe the Queensberry rules. We  must  not

have  Siamese boxing. But today, the Prime Minister himself wants to  resort  to

Siamese boxing. It is not we who want to resort to Siamese boxing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister has accused us of thinking of violence to destroy the Constitution. As a matter of fact, it is not we who

are  trying to destroy the Constitution, but the P.A.P. It is obvious  that  the

National   Referendum  Bill  is  a  measure  by  which  they  want  to   destroy

parliamentary democracy. It is proof and evidence that they want to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the people of Singapore can now see clearly that the so-called democracy of the P.A.P., the so-called constitution of the P.A.P., is to

resort to military force.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think the general intention of political Parties and their

leaders can often be discerned not only through their actual words, and actions,

but  by the manner in which those words are uttered and the emphasis with  which

they  give  to  their actions. I think the Member for Queenstown,  in  the  last

attempt to score off the rugged edges of his first performance, was hard put  to

sound  like a cat when actually he was roaring like a tiger. You cannot  make  a

tiger  mew.  That is not one of the things which the Member for  Queenstown,  in

spite of his many versatile and variegated skills, can do. As I have said, those

who have no evil intentions can sleep well and nice. As the Member for Anson has

said,  we  have a duty to ensure that those with evil intentions do not  imperil

the  lives,  the  limbs and the safety of the people. The Second Battalion  will

only be a start. Eventually the trouble which those manipulating the Member  for

Queenstown  face is this. Troops cannot defend a colonialist administration,  be

cause more than force is required to sustain the government. But when the attack

is  against  a  popularly-elected administration representing the  bulk  of  the

people,  an  effort  by  an  armed  organised militant  minority  can  often  be

frustrated  quickly,  effectively and easily  by  the  immediate  and  effective

deployment of armed force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give an example of the Work Brigade last year. It was round three in

the  battle between the Communists manipulating the Barisan Sosialis versus  the

Government. There were bicycle chains, tyres and open acts of indiscipline.  Had

there  been  hesitation; had there been fumbling, a few people would  have  been

hurt,  injured  and maimed. But because of the First Battalion, because  it  was

demonstrably clear to anybody who wanted to use bicycle chains, the axe  or  the

iron rod that it would be unprofitable to do so, it turned out in the event that

nobody used these weapons at all. And so we not only did good to society, but we

also did good to the wrongdoer by protecting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



him  by  his  own logic and commonsense from putting himself into  an  untenably

vulnerable position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown has been known for his qualities to charge, often

blindly, and as the Member for Anson has said, it is a losing battle. It is  not

only  losing, but it is lost. It was lost last year in July-that night in  July

when they tried to capture. It failed. It set off a chain of events that brought

about  the  White Paper, merger, Malaysia, Malaysia Week and a  whole  chain  of

inevitable consequences that will culminate in the final expurgation of all  the

evil  forces  in  our  society. The Member for Queenstown  can  only  read  this

morning's  paper. The gentleman who wrote Mr Lim Ching Siong a  letter  through

him  as  the postbox. Mr Wen Lin Chen, from Sarawak. "Leading officials,"  said

he,  "of  the S.U.P.P. constitutional organisation." He was on his way  back  on

voluntary repatriation to China and he was arrested as a member of the vanishing

Communist  organisation. And so the process will go on. But behind  the  process

there  must  always be the ultimate deterrent. Nobody wants to use  any  troops.

Everybody wants the law to be observed. But everybody knows that if you are  not

in  a  position  to  enforce  the  law, nobody will  enforce  it.  If  everybody

understands  that  not only will the law be enforced, but it  will  be  enforced

swiftly and effectively, then it may well be that everybody will conform to  and

obey the rules of the game.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Chairman.

Sir,  the  words of the Prime Minister have revealed the intention,  as  he  has

said, of his political Party. It can be seen in his words, in spite of his suave

delivery, what is P.A.P. intent in the very Bill itself.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> What Bill?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> In the Referendum Bill itself.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> We are on

Supplementary Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is only an aside, Sir. He was talking about parangs



and bicycle chains -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We know, Sir, nowadays there are agents provocateurs who

have  been recruited by the Government and sent to various organisations.  These

people  are weeded out one by one whenever they are discovered. The parangs  and

bicycle  chains  belong to the gangsters recruited by the  P.A.P.  This  is  the

truth, Sir, and a lot of people know about it. He was telling us that if it  was

a  case of troops being used, it was only because a minority wanted to break the

law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No minority. Sir, can break the law against the majority, and if this Govern

ment  had  the  support of the majority of the people in Singapore,  the  P.A.P.

would  not be in such a bad plight today. Let me just give the Prime Minister  a

last reminder. He talked about a losing battle. Sir, whether a battle is won  or

lost  depends  on  the  people and, to quote the Prime Minister  himself  on  an

occasion many years ago, the verdict of the people will be the final arbiter and

the  verdict  of the people is a terrible thing to those who do not  keep  faith

with the people. That is for you. [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I hope the Member for Queenstown is not trying to

intimidate the Chair. He is trying to intimidate the Prime Minister.  I  do  not

know whether the Prime Minister has been intimidated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, part of my duty is to suffer intimidation at the

hands of my political opponents from time to time. I bear up as well as I can. 1

can  assure the Member for Queenstown that there will be no troops used as long

as  the rules are observed. The Societies Ordinance, the Trade Unions Ordinance,

the  Minor Offences Ordinance, they are all in the law. There are people who can

interpret  the law to them. But if the rules are cast aside and the  stones  and

the iron bars and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



the  buses  are turned over, then peace-loving though we may be, the  overriding

interest of peace, security and well-being of the people will require the use of

force to suppress force.

It has been moved as an amendment, in page A2, line 23 - [Interruption]. I hear

generated by the P.A.P. and the ex-P.A.P. over referendum and merger, and it  is

regrettable that the public are becoming more and more confused. The  more  they

carry on this political warfare, the more confused will the electorate be. I  do

net  know what is the object of this deliberate intention to confuse the  public

by  distortions,  counter-distortions, smears and counter-smears.  Merger  is  a

national  issue. In the words of some Members of this House, it means  life  and

death  to  the people of Singapore. Yet the P.A.P. and the ex-P.A.P. choose  to

make  use  of  this national issue as a plaything for them to indulge  in  their

political warfare, calling it round 1, round 2, round

3.    I  do  not know how many rounds they want to have. All I say is  that  the

sooner the rounds are ended and both of them get knocked out, the better it will

be for politics in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Better for the S.P.A., you mean.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, when this Malaysia Plan was first made public by the

Tunku  at  a  foreign correspondents' luncheon in May 1961, the  P.A.P. quickly

jumped on the band-wagon and said, "Ah, ah, now merger is possible:

we  will try and regain our lost political prestige by pressing ahead with talks

with  the  Tunku for an agreement for merger." They did that in order  to  claim

political credit and to save themselves from the doom that was facing them.  But

at  that time, there was great interest over this question of merger - or  closer

association  as I choose to call it - So much so that there was a forum  at  which

representatives  of the P.A.P., the S.P.A., the U.P.P. and the Barisan  Sosialis

were  present. The question was posed as to what was a more desirable method  of

ascertaining the wishes of the people in regard to closer association  with  the

Federation  of Malaya. Was it to be by means of a referendum or by  means  of  a

general  election?  The  Barisan demanded general  elections.  The  others,  the

P.A.P., the S.P.A. and the U.P.P., quite rightly stated that the proper  way  to

ascertain the views of the electorate was through a referendum. So at that time,

even  before agreement was reached between the Government of Singapore  and  the

Government of the Federation of Malaya, the P.A.P. Government was committed to a

Referendum  Bill. So they went ahead with the preparation of a Referendum  Bill,

and in that preparation, of course, their intention was that the Bill should  be

a  Referendum Bill on merger. That is how it came to be that the P.A.P. is  now

saying that the Referendum Bill is

general Bill. They thought at that time they were honest. They thought that  it

would be right and proper that the agreement which they hoped to reach with the

Government  of  the Federation of Malaya would be put to the people  fairly  and

squarely. They thought that in that way they would get the electorate to say yes

to  the  agreement  which they had reached. That was months ago.  In  their  own

words,  that could be round 1 of the fight between the P.A.P. and the  Communist

group in the P.A.P. But when they came to round 3, when they found that if  they

were  to pose only one question, a straightforward question, to the people in  a

referendum, it would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



turn  out to be a majority vote against the White Paper, not because the  people

do  not  want closer association with the Federation of Malaya, but because  the

Communist group in the P.A.P. went out telling the people that the quickest  way

to  get  rid  of this rotten Government was to say "No" in a referendum  to  the

question to be posed by the Government. So they thought that it would be  danger

OUS  to pose one question, because they knew that the Barisan Sosialis had  gone

out  preaching hatred against the P.A.P., preaching that the only way to get the

P.A.P. out  of  office was to vote "No" to the White Paper.  The  Deputy  Prime

Minister  then had to stand up on the Second Reading of the National  Referendum

Bill  and  say - and very few people caught the meaning of the words he  said - "The

result  of  the  referendum need not mean the resignation of the  Government.  A

referendum  is a referendum; it is not a vote of confidence in the  Government."

He  had to say that in order to read just the minds of the people that had  been

contaminated  by  the  smears and distortions that  had  been  pervaded  by  the

Barisani  Sosialis.  So  they thought that one question  would  be  a  dangerous

question,  because  it  would not get a fair answer. It  would  also  result  in

getting the electorate to cast a vote of their loss of confidence in the

P.A.P. Government. Therefore, the

Second Reading of the Bill was delayed. It was delayed for that reason. And  sud

denly,  Sir, the bright boys of the P.A.P. thought, "Aha, now that  we  are  committed to a referendum, how are we going to wriggle out of it? We must at  least

put up some semblance of honesty and decency." They hit upon the idea of saying,

"Ah, let us put two questions:

one question to the White Paper, and another question to be worse than the White

Paper." Therefore, the answer can only be the White Paper, and nothing else.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> What is the other one?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> That was in their minds. If the Deputy Prime Minister wants

to know it, it is this. He said, "There are two types of closer association with

the Federation of Malaya. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



first type is the White Paper where [as the P.A.P. is very fond of saying] there

will be autonomy in education and labour demanded by the P.A.P. Government.  The

second  is  merger  of the Penang and Malacca type where 340,000  non-local-born

citizens would lose their citizenship rights." Sir, if those two questions  were

posed,  surely  the 340,000 non-local-born citizens, who are  in  the  majority,

would  not  vote for the second type. They would say. "This is the P.A.P.  White

Paper, and therefore they want to win." So the P.A.P. knew that in this game  of

"Heads, I win, Tails, you lose", it is easy; we go ahead." Now they had the idea

of  putting  two questions. This may be their Round 6 against the Ban-san.  Then

the Barisan came out with their upper-cut or below-the-belt blow. I do not know.

They said, "In that case, blank votes, blank votes, blank votes."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this, in fact, does not bring credit to the political Parties in

Singapore.  It is not even bringing credit to the Parties that are indulging  in

distortions and counter-distortions. And now all this trouble - they are going  to

ask more than one question. And obviously the Barisan Sosialis, very ably led by

the Member for Anson, came out very strongly for "one question one issue." I can

understand  what  is  in the minds of the Barisan Sosialis - they  want  to  wreck

merger; they want to wreck every opportunity that is offered to us for closer as

sociation,  because it is inimical to the Communist group in  Singapore.  It  is

their death blow. But what I find it difficult to understand is: why should  the

Member  for Anson feel it is a grand thing to lead the Barisan Sosialis  on  the

war-path and cause more confusion in the minds of the people?



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson was a very good colleague of mine in the previous

Government. From my experience working under him and with him, I can  say  this:

he  means well. He means to serve the best interests of the people of Singapore.

And  he  believes that, in moving this amendment, he is doing it  for  the  best

interests of the people of Singapore. But, unfortunately, he has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>

overlooked  the  danger of the Communist game in this fight for  existence.  He

has  in  a way been misled into providing the lead to the group that is  losing

the battle for merger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are against the amendment. This is in answer to the question of the Mem

ber  for  Anson as to why there has been no explanation given to our view  that

the  amendment  is not acceptable. It is not acceptable in this  respect - and  I

have  to  stand here explaining and be misunderstood as wanting to  defend  the

P.A.P.;  to  which I say that the sooner the P.A.P. get out of the  Government.

the better it will be for Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It is this - because a one-question referendum will not elicit the truthful answer. We will

be playing into the hands of the Communists, and we must resist it at all costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, as the Opposition, have no love for the P.A.P. In fact, it was because of

the  intrigues of the P.A.P. who slept with the Communists since they first came

into  existence  and  who, when they sat on this side of the  House,  loved  the

Communists, welcomed and praised them as their comrades and won their  way  into

power,  that they are now in this mess today. If they had played clean politics,

and they should if they were a good, honest government, they would not have been

in  this  mess and have to fight their ex-comrades whom they describe as  heroes

one day and denounce as Communists another day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot allow a one-question referendum, because if that one question were

to  be  posed: "Do you accept Command Paper No. 33?" - "Yes/No", I can say this  :

there may be 90 per cent of the people saying "No", not because they do not want

closer association, but because they want to show their contempt, their disgust,

and  their loss of confidence in the P.A.P. Government. It would not give us the

right  answer  and  it  would create a bad impression in  the  minds  of  people

outside.  They  will be surprised as to why it is that Singapore does  not  want

something for the good of Singapore. Malaya could misunderstand the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



verdict  of  a  one-question referendum by thinking  that  now  that  they  had

decided  to  extend  the hand of friendship to the people  of  Singapore,  that

friendship  had  been  rejected. What would be the  consequences?  I  dare  not

imagine.  Once  the hand of friendship is extended to us but cast  aside  by  a

referendum  that does not give a real verdict, it will be almost impossible  to

resume negotiations for better terms perhaps, or for closer association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, what is very important to us, the S.P.A., a responsible Opposition

in  this  Chamber, is to ensure that the questions to be posed by the Government

in  a  referendum are questions that can allow the electorate to pass a verdict.

The  Minister  for Finance, speaking on behalf of the Government, has  given  an

assurance  to  this House that such questions shall be debated in this  Assembly

before  they are posed in a referendum. I accept the assurance, but  I  do  urge

upon  the  Government to carry out that assurance by suitably amending thc  Bill

to'  ensure  that  such an assurance will be carried out. I gave  an  indication

yesterday,  Sir,  that when the amendment to clause 13 is  under  discussion,  I

hoped  to' achieve that amendment by proposing an amendment to the amendment.  I

will touch on that when the time comes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today is just the second day of the debate, and I do not know what round

the  P.A.P. would like to call it - the 8th or 9th round. But let us make  it  the

last  round for the good of the people of Singapore. Make it the last round.  Do

not  have  any more rounds; the people are getting more and more confused.  Even

the  Leader  of the Barisan Sosialis was getting confused, so much so  that  his

confusion was so badly apparent in the discussion in Select Committee.  I  think

the Minister for Finance kept arguing with him on certain amendments proposed in

the  Select  Committee.  The confusion was so apparent  that  the  Minister  for

Finance had to say that his skull was thick or something like that. I am  trying

to  quote  from  the Official Report. Yes, here it is, Sir, column  474  of  the

Official Report of the Select Committee No. 7, of 17th May:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, the Minister for Health and Law has said that some people's skulls are

so thick that no light can penetrate and no amount of clarification can convince

them.'



<br><br>And what did the Leader of the Barisan Sosialis say?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Let us assume that I have a skull that

thick.'



<br><br>And I will therefore assume that he has a skull that thick.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us put an end to all this political warfare that is going on which is

damaging the interests of the people of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us debate this very important piece of legislation with a calm, cool head

and with only one guiding factor - and let us be guided by this one factor - the  interests  of the people of Singapore should come first, and  not  the  in

terests of any political Party, and in that the S.P.A. is prepared to serve  the

interests  of  the country first. We do not mind what happens to the  S.P.A.  So

long as we have served the country, we shall die satisfied.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is indeed very confusing to see the Member for

Cairnhill  once again expressing support for the Government's arguments  against

this  clause.  I thought, before the Assembly sitting, on reading  the  sort  of

statements  that the S.P.A. issue or listening to none other than the Secretary-General of the S.P.A. at a forum at the University of Singapore, that the S.P.A.

should come into this Chamber and say, "Down with the Referendum Bill because it

is undemocratic, because it is not possible to determine the views of the people

with  a  Bill  of this nature." Even as late as, I believe, last week  when  the

S.P.A. representative at a mass rally at Anson denounced the Bill, he gave  the

impression   that  his  representatives  here,  namely  the  S.P.A.  Legislative

Assemblymen,  would  be  opposing the Bill and  expressing  support  to  certain

amendments  that the Opposition had filed. However, Sir, today it is clear  that

no  matter  what  they say outside the Assembly, inside the Assembly  it  is  ex

tremely necessary for them to support the Government because this is part of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



the deal. And if the S.P.A. does not support the P.A.P., then the P.A.P. will

not  have a majority at the moment. I believe, and as is believed by many people

outside  this  Chamber, that part of the deal is to make sure  that  the  S.P.A.

makes  all  the  noise that it wants to make outside in order to make  political

capital for itself, at the same time to ensure that the Government keeps ticking

and that their scheme of things is put through quite neatly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said yesterday, I do not want to spend time replying to speeches

made  by  S.P.A. Members. I will now come to the amendments before the Committee

today. I wish to start off by saying this:

that  if the Government tells the world that the Barisan Sosialis is up  to  mischief, that we are undesirable social plagues, that our business is to go  about

wrecking  peace  and  tranquility, and that our functions  are  to  confuse  the

people,  I  assure  you,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that we  are  not  what  the  P.A.P.

desperadoes  make  us out to be. But just for the Purposes of  argument,  if  we

accept  the  Government statements on their face value, then we in  the  Barisan

Sosialis  are  bad  chaps; we go about confusing the people; and  those  in  the

P.A.P. are good chaps and they go about helping people not to get confused.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of our amendment to clause 18 of the Bill is to help the

voters get used to the form of the ballot paper before they actually go to vote.

It  is  also suggested in this ballot paper that the question to be posed should

be a simple and straightforward question which will require only a "yes" or "no"

answer. Sir, this is the first time that a referendum will be held in Singapore,

and our literacy rate compared with, for example. New Zealand, is extremely low.

And to add to this we have a multi-racial society where even the literate popula

tion  is  not necessarily literate in English. In this context it is  absolutely

necessary,  if  we want to honestly ascertain the views of the people,  to  make

matters as simple as possible so that the people are not confused or misled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a referendum is to ascertain the views of the people. This we are all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



agreed.  The Government ostensibly agrees that the sole purpose of a  referendum

is  to  ascertain the views of the people, if the Government means what it says,

namely, that it wants to determine the views of the people, it cannot but  agree

that  its responsibilities and obligations are as much the Opposition's, if  not

more, to help the people give their views in the simplest possible manner and to

ensure  that  the  verdict of the people is unequivocal and  that  there  is  no

ambiguity about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government Ministers have time and again suggested that it is the

Barisan Sosialis that seeks to confuse the people. This is nonsense. We are  not

seeking  to  confuse the people or mislead the people. We want to do  everything

possible to hold a referendum in which the issues are put clearly to the  people

and in which the people will be given every opportunity to vote unequivocally so

that  there can be no ambiguity about the verdict of the people, no matter which

way  the  verdict goes. And these amendments before the Committee that  we  have

moved  are  to  minimise confusion. I think any man should be in a  position  to

realise  this.  There  is  no  hide  and  seek  in  this.  The  amendments   are

straightforward.  If the Government are honest in wanting the people  to  decide

clearly,  in  wanting  the  people  to indicate  their  wishes  clearly  and  in

unambiguous form, then they must accept this amendment. They do not have  to  be

afraid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in this Assembly at the time when the White Paper was de

bated, the Government Members repeatedly said that they were confident that  the

people  would  support  their proposals when, in fact, Members  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  said  that  in  their  view the people  would  reject  it.  They  were

confident. They said, "When you say 'the people', you mean the Communists." They

were  confident. If they were confident, and if they are confident now, why  are

they afraid to put the question to the people in the simplest and clearest form,

so  that the people can give their verdict? I say that we are not interested  in

getting  the  people to vote against merger in principle. We  have  opposed  the

White Paper.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>



If  the  White Paper is put to the people, and if the people oppose  it,  it  is

opposition  to  merger  on  terms contained in the  White  Paper.  Sir,  if  the

Government  are  serious  in  saying that they do not  want  the  people  to  be

confused,  then  I do not see, as I say, any reason why they should  not  accept

these amendments which make things simpler and clearer for the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this new clause that the Opposition is proposing to clause 5 of the Bill

is important. It is, in fact, very important. Yet the Government reject it. They

reject  the amendment moved for clarity and simplicity. Yet they have the  cheek

to  come  and  say that we are the people who go round wanting  to  confuse  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the whole Referendum Bill will not serve its purpose if the Government

reject this and the other amendments, this amendment, in particular, which  will

allow  for the submission of only one question to the electorate in a referendum

and  which will make it possible for the people to vote "yes" or "no". Sir,  the

Government in rejecting this amendment in Select Committee revolved its argument

around  two  central  points,  viz, (1) that it may  be  necessary  to  ask  the

electorate more than one question, and (2), that it is not unusual to have  more

than  one  question  posed  in  one referendum, in  that  there  are  precedents

elsewhere in the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take these two points one by one. The Government's

arguments are naive and hypocritical. Their arguments must be exposed  for  what

they  are worth. But before I do that, Sir, it is necessary for me to state that

in  the  debate on this amendment we must bear in mind clauses 21 and 29 of  the

Bill.  Clause  21 enforces compulsory voting. Clause 29 makes all  unmarked  and

uncertain  votes as votes for the Government proposition. These  three  clauses,

Sir,  viz, clauses 5, 21 and 29, put together, in fact, mean the denial of  free

choice  to  the people. It is against this background that we must consider  the

validity of the amendments before the House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fundamental proposition that the Barisan Sosialis makes is that the

basic  human  right  of free choice must be guaranteed to  the  people,  notwith

standing the number of questions, the right to accept, reject or abstain must be

uninterfered with. Irrespective of whatever alternatives are put to the  people,

the  basic  right of the people to accept, reject, or abstain must be guaranteed

and  not deprived by legislation, which is brought in by a Government which  has

lost  the confidence of the people and which survives with one vote on  its  own

side and with the support of a discredited political force like the

S.P.A. This then, Sir, is our basic proposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first point that the Government has used for its argument, I have this

to  say.  I do not think it is that the Government by necessity has to  ask  the

electorate  more than one question at a given referendum. Whether to  have  one,

two or more questions will entirely depend on the Government if the amendment is

rejected.  The  framing of the question, the number of questions  to  be  posed,

etc.,  will  all  be  left  completely in the hands  of  the  Government, lithe

Government  are thoughtful and really care for the views of the people,  if  not

for  anything  else at least for the sake of clarity, they can easily  pose  one

question in one referendum.

On  the  other  hand,  if this amendment is rejected, it  will  also  allow  the

Government,  if they so desire, to pose more than one question. Again,  Sir,  if

the   Government  so  desire,  they  can  also  pose  two  totally  unacceptable

alternatives and use an unfair law to force the people to vote for  one  of  the

two  unacceptable alternatives and deny the people the right to  abstain.  As  a

matter  of  fact, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government have already  indicated  that

this  is  exactly what they seek to do, and it is our responsibility - it  is  the

responsibility of all of us in this House - to  ensure that there is no room in this Bill for such a dishonest referendum.

If  we  allowed  room  for this, then we would, in effect,  be  encouraging  and

condoning the rigging of the referendum.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because it is obvious that whether there should be one or more questions

will depend entirely on the Government, we have moved these amendments. By these

amendments  we  seek  to  prevent foul play. We  seek  to  prevent  a  dishonest

government from rigging the referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an argument used incidentally by the Government Members is that it will

cost  $400,000 to conduct a referendum. Even if it were so - I have not personally

calculated it but I am prepared to take the statement of the Government on this

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- the Opposition cannot accept the argument that because of this cost it is

necessary to have a Bill with the provision to ask for more than one question at

one referendum.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I intend to suspend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair of the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 - ( contd.)



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on clause 5, an amendment to add a new sub-clause. The

Member for Thomson had the Floor. Mr Bani.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I was saying just now, the Government Members

have  suggested that it will cost $400,000 to conduct a referendum. Even if this

was so, the Opposition cannot accept the argument that because this is the cost,

it is necessary to have in the Bill a provision to ask more than one question at

any  referendum,  it  may be that on issues of minor importance,  two  or  three

questions could be asked, provided, of course, the basic right of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



the  people  to free choice is not restricted, provided the people are  not  compelled  by  law  to  choose  one of two totally unacceptable  alternatives,  and

provided the people are not denied the fundamental human right to freely accept,

reject  or abstain. But, Sir, the Opposition, particularly the Barisan Sosialis,

cannot  and will not accept a position where it will give the P.A.P. Government,

which has already indicated its dishonest intentions, a blank provision in  this

Bill - a  Bill  which,  in fact, will deny the people a very  desirable  right - the

democratic right to free choice. It is not the intention of the Barisan Sosialis

to  waste public money by asking that a few referenda held at $400,000 each.  It

has  been  suggested, Sir, in the Select Committee that there may  be  referenda

held  to  determine  questions like whether toddy shops  should  close,  whether

smoking should be prohibited, or whether pipe-smoking should be prohibited.  I

can  only  say, Sir, that to hold a referendum at $400,000 to determine  whether

the  people of Singapore should smoke a pipe, a cigarette or a cigar is  absurd,

and  any argument on these lines is only frivolous in my view. We do not  for  a

moment  believe  that  this National Referendum Bill is  going  to  be  used  to

determine frivolous issues lie that. We say quite categorically that we  do  not

want  three or four referenda held at public expense to determine such  matters.

But,  sir, on matters of national importance, on matters which affect the  lives

of  all  our  people and the lives of all our children and that  of  our  future

generations, on matters like constitutional changes, on matters like  merger.  I

say  that  if  it  is  necessary to hold more than one referendum  in  order  to

determine with clarity the issues, in order to determine with clarity the wishes

of our people, it is desirable to do so even if it will cost $400000 to hold  a

referendum. Therefore, Sir, in thinking of the cost of a referendum, let us  not

disregard  the  importance  of the issue that may be  referred  to  the  people.

$400,000 or a

few million dollars of public money spent in order to determine the people's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



own  future  is money worth spending. In any case, Sir, it is definitely  better

than going round the world and flying over the North Pole.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the second point used in the Government's arguments,

namely  that there are precedents for asking more than one question, I  must  at

the  outset  say  that there is a fundamental difference between the  referendum

examples  quoted and the P.A.P. National Referendum Bill, and that is  while  in

every  referendum held elsewhere in the world, the people were given their basic

right to freely accept, reject or abstain on any question, the

P.A.P.     National  Referendum Bill will deny the people  this  right  to  free

choice. Clause 29 of this Bill absolutely interferes with the people's right  to

free  choice. Sir, in an endeavour to substantiate the arguments, the Government

Members  have  tried  to quote certain examples of the sort  of  referenda  held

elsewhere  in  the world where more than one question have been put.  They  have

quoted,  for  example, New Zealand. I must point out, Sir, that  the  precedents

quoted  by the Ministers in Select committee are completely irrelevant. This  is

so  because  in  the examples quoted, there has always been the  right  for  the

electorate  to reject or abstain in a referendum irrespective of the  number  of

questions posed. And this is fundamental. The Singapore National Referendum Bill

is  unique  in  that it seeks to deny the people the right to  vote  against  or

abstain from voting ii a referendum. This is completely untenable. It is no  use

quoting  examples  if  we  forget the fundamental position  that  basically  the

referendum that the P.A.P. Government is proposing is different from that of New

Zealand, or Australia, or other referenda held in other parts of the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish, Sir, to debate the merits or otherwise of clause 29 of this

Bill  at this moment. Nevertheless, I think to discuss the amendment before  the

House  in  isolation,  in  complete disregard of  other  clauses  of  the  Bill,

particularly  clauses  21 and 29, is not proper. In any case,  it  is  certainly

misleading

if we accept the precedents the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>

Members have quoted without consideration of these clauses, namely clauses 21

and 29.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because the Government has quoted the examples of referenda held in New

Zealand,  to  argue against the amendment before the House, it is  necessary  to

understand  the  fundamentals involved. The Minister  for  Law,  in  the  Select

Committee, quoted three New Zealand examples. The first one was on the time that

hotels should close. The second one was the question on the sale of liquor,  and

the  third  one  was  the question on compulsory military training.  These  were

quoted,  Sir,  as I have said, to substantiate the arguments that there  can  be

more  than one question. I would like to go over the examples that the  Minister

for  Law  gave. The first one, Sir, is on the 8th of May in column  116  of  the

Official Report No. 3. The first example, according to the Minister for Law, the

ballot  paper  was in the following form: "I vote for closing  at  6  p.m."  and

another line - "I vote for closing at 10 p.m." Then, Sir, the Minister gave  the

instructions which have been given to the voter. They are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The voter must strike out one line, leaving untouched the line which shows

the way he wishes to vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the voter strikes out both lines or fails to strike Out one of the lines,

the voting paper will be void and his vote will not be recorded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voting paper so marked is to be placed by the voter in the ballot box.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voter is not allowed to take his voting paper out of the polling booth.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, it will be noted that in this referendum, the voter's free choice

was  in  no  way  interfered  with.  If the  voter  did  not  support  both  the

propositions put to him, the voter was completely at liberty to strike out  both

lines. Such a ballot paper would be rejected. It would be declared void and  the

vote  will  not  be recorded, unlike the P.A.P. referendum where unmarked  votes

would  be  recorded  as votes for the Government. In other words,  Sir,  in  the

referendum quoted by the Minister which was held in New Zealand, the fundamental

right  to  either reject or abstain was given to the voter. This very  right  is

being denied

to the people of Singapore, and therefore, this example is completely irrelevant

in  the  context  of  the Referendum Bill that we are discussing.  It  does  not

support the Government's case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the second example which the Minister quoted, there were three pro

posals put to the electorate. This is also in column 116. The three propositions

put  to  the  electorate were: (1) "I vote for national continuance",  i.e. for

allowing the sale of alcoholic drinks:

(2)   "I  vote for State purchase and control", i.e. for all alcoholic  liquors,

and  (3)  "I  vote  for national prohibition.' In this example,  Sir,  the  same

procedure  was followed. The same instructions were given to the voter,  whereby

if  THC  voter  struck  out  all  the three propositions  or  only  one  of  the

propositions or none at all, the voting paper would have been void and his  vote

would not be recorded. Here again, Sir, the fundamental right of the voter to  a

free  choice  with  no  limitation and with no  imposition  was  given  to  him.

Therefore,  Sir, this example again is one that is irrelevant in the context  of

this  Referendum  Bill  before the Committee. It  does  not  again  support  the

Government's case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the third example given by the Minister for Health and Law, i.e. the

one on compulsory military training, the ballot paper, as quoted by the Minister

in  column 232 [Official Report No. 4 dated 11th May, 1962], says as follows: "I

vote  for compulsory military training" and on the second line, "I vote  against

compulsory  military  training". In this example, Sir, the  voter  was  given  a

fundamental  right to reject compulsory military training or to accept  it.  The

voter  had his fundamental right to either vote for or against or, ii necessary,

to  abstain. If the voter put in an unmarked vote, his vote would not be counted

as  a  vote for compulsory military training. This is not what the P.A.P. intend

to  do in Singapore. I repeat, Sir, this example again is irrelevant because  it

does  not  support the Government's case and it is irrelevant to the context  of

the Singapore National Referendum Bill.







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, Mr Chairman, we cannot accept this precedent which is

quoted  blindly  to  substantiate a case for more  than  one  question  without

regard to the type of referendum that the

P.A.P.     Government is proposing. It is one thing for the Government  to  say

that they do not want to accept our proposal for a simple question requiring  a

'yes' or 'no' answer on the grounds that it may be necessary to pose more  than

one  question.  But  it is entirely another matter for the Government  to  substantiate  this  argument  by  quoting precedents which  are  fundamentally  in

conflict with the Referendum Bill that is being proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Government is confident that the people are in favour of the

merger  arrangements  that they have made, then the  Ministers  need  not  fear

giving  our  people their basic right to choose freely. Put  to  the  people  a

simple  question  requiring a 'yes' or 'no' answer. They  do  not  have  to  be

afraid.  They  keep  telling  the world that the  Barisan  Sosialis  is  up  to

mischief. They keep telling the world that we are out to confuse the people.  I

would  like to know whether the Government would agree to sit down with us  and

work out the

simplest  possible procedure whereby confusion would be minimised,  and  whereby

the   people   would  be  given  every  opportunity  to  give   their   verdict

unequivocably.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the Liberal Socialist representatives were being examined in the

Select Committee, the Minister for Law

at one stage said that the voter can stay

away if he did not want to accept either

of  the  two  propositions. This is on Page C.28, column 55, Sir. I  will  just

read  the  last sentence of Mrs Leon-Soh's answer and then what  the  Minister

for Law had to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'[Mrs Leon-Soh] But, on the other hand, the question is not clearly

framed; it is a question of wanting either (A) or (B), and the voter says,  "I

do not want (A) and I do not want (B)." We are taking it on that level, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Mr Byrne] He can stay away.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister is supposed to be the Minister for Law for the State. It is

his  Ministry  that drafted this Referendum Bill. Surely, Sir,  he  is  not  so

foolish  as  to  be unable to understand clause 21 of the Bill which  seeks  to

make voting compulsory. I do not want to suggest -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> On a point of information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, the Member has given way.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> If the Member for Thomson will read clause 21, he will find that

any  elector  can  stay away, pay $5 and get his name back on to  the  electoral

roll. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I fully understand the implications of clause 21. His name can

be struck off. He can be fined five dollars, depending, of course, on who he is.

For  instance,  if a P.A.P. enthusiast does not go and vote, perhaps,  even  the

five dollars fine may be waived. But if it is somebody else, then quite definitely  his  name will be struck off. But in any case, Sir, it is not necessary  for

the  Minister for Law to tell the people that one can stay away and pay the fine

or  get  one's name struck off. Compulsory voting, as could be seen in the  1959

elections, is known to the people. But is the Minister seriously suggesting that

one  should stay away at home against the law? Is he in fact suggesting to  abet

an offence? Is he encouraging the breaking of a law -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member give way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Chairman, there is one, thing that the Barisan Sosialis can do.

They  can  organise  the  throwing in of blank votes but  they  cannot  organise

abstentions from the polis.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, if ever the Barisan

Sosialis Central Executive Committee needs any advice from the Minister for  Law

as  to  how we should conduct our business, I shall always have him in mind.  We

would  approach him with no hesitation, Sir, if we need his advice.  And  if  we

carry out his advice in practice, I only hope that the Government will not leave

him  unpunished if we are to be punished. Sir, the Minister, as  I  said,  knows

this. Then why did he say, "You can stay away."?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, Sir, it appears to me that either he was trying to bluff Mrs Leon Soh

or he was just being silly for some unknown reason. The point is that, Sir, in a

situation  where, as the Government has indicated, two unacceptable alternatives

are  going to be put to the people: where the people are not going to  be  given

the right to say 'no' and you have also compulsory voting, then the sum total of

all this, as I have said, is a denial of a very desirable democratic right - the

right  of  an  individual  to  say 'yes' or 'no'  or  abstain.  And  pillars  of

parliamentary  democracy; people who preach democracy,  people  who  claim  that

without them democracy will die in this part of the world, are seeking to  bring

this about!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister has time and again laughed it off whenever we say that

the P.A.P. Government is adopting Fascist tactics. He stands up and says, 'Am  I

a  Fascist? Look, I allow you to do this, I allow you to do that.' Sir,  I  must

say  that  I have greater respect for Hitler than our Prime Minister because  at

least Hitler made no pretences. He had the courage and the guts to say, 'This is

what  I  believe in - no democracy, nothing'. But the Government today  have  very

strong  Fascist  tendencies  and  they want to camouflage  them  by  talking  of

democracy and individual freedom, 'We are pillars of parliamentary democracy  in

this part of the world.' It has already been pointed out very many times in this

House,  Mr Speaker, Sir, it is the so-called democrats like them - like  all  the

Chiang Kai-sheks and Syngman Rhees that we have - who spelt doom for democracy  in

this part of the world. It is not the people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>



who  are accused as Communists; it is not the people in the Barisan Sosialis who

will  destroy democracy. It is the men who are drunk with power and want to keep

power at the expense of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Bill stands now, the Government can pose a question in any form.

It  can pose a number of questions. It can also ask the people to choose between

two  unacceptable alternatives and deny them the right to abstain.  If  a  voter

does not wish either of the alternatives, he cannot say 'no', because he is  not

allowed  to  say  'no'. He is legally expected to say 'yes' to one  of  them  at

least.  So, Sir, a voter who does not desire both will be helpless. This  voter,

as  many, many others like him, will not be uncertain as to choose which of  the

two alternatives.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order. It appears to me that he is speaking

on the amendment to clause 29 and not on the motion to amend clause 5.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> What the Member for Thomson is doing is just arguing on the

premise  that  clause 29 will be accepted. Therefore he is just stating  a  fact

that under clause 29 that is so. He is not arguing for or against the merits  of

clause 29. I think in that respect he is perfectly in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Thank you, Sir. He cannot put in an unmarked vote, for that will,

according to the law, be a vote for the Government proposition. Sir, this is the

trick  formula worked out with clause 5 of the Bill as a basis, which the P.A.P.

leadership  has  invented  to get the 'support' of the  people  for  its  merger

proposals, and it is with this trick formula that they feel confident.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say the Barisan Sosialis have been cornered. They say the Barisan

Sosialis  are desperate now; the Communists are desperate - they do not know  what

to  do.  I  tell  them,  Sir, we are not desperate.  We  are  not  cornered  and

desperate,  because we have great respect for the intelligence  of  the  people,

unlike the P.A.P. leadership. We do not have to go and tell the people what to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>



do.  We believe the people know themselves what they should do. So all this talk

of referendum on smoking, toddy shop is just humbug. This Bill has been drawn up

by  the  Government with the sole intention of pushing through the P.A.P  merger

proposals, no matter what bluff they make in this Assembly or outside it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, you will see why the Opposition lay so much importance in this

amendment to include a new clause which will mean only one question to which the

electorate can say without ambiguity, unequivocally yes or no. Who is trying  to

confuse  the people? The Barisan Sosialis or the P.A.P. We are fighting  to  get

the Government to put a simple yes or no question so that the people will not be

confused and helpless. So that the verdict of the people whichever way  it  goes

will  be  clear-cut  and the irony of it is that we are  accused  of  trying  to

confuse the people This is the conduct pf an absolutely dishonest Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every single amendment that has been moved by the Opposition to this Hill

is to minimise confusion, is to help the people to indicate their wishes clearly

and yet the P.A.P. is opposing

it.   The S.P.A. talk a lot outside, but inside here they make certain that  the

Bill  goes  through. The P.A.P. to-day has no other way of surviving  except  by

cheating  the  people,  and  that is exactly what  it  is  seeking  to  do.  The

Government is seeking to rig the referendum. This in simple straight

forward  language  is rigging, and I would say it is not only  rigging,  it  is

shameful rigging. To those Members of this House who sit as Back benchers of the

Government,  who are fully aware of the pressure of the people and who  wish  to

believe  that all this dirty work is being done by the Prime Minister  and  that

the  responsibility is his alone, I say, "You are also responsible." Sir,  every

dishonest  act  of the Prime Minister and his Cabinet is also the responsibility

of  the  Back  benchers,  because without their support, the  Government  cannot

implement its crooked



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



decisions.  As  I say, it is the responsibility of every one in  this  House  to

ensure  that  in this Bill there is no provision for rigging the referendum  one

way or the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new clause proposed to clause S of the Bill is one of the most important

amendments  to  the whole Bill. Without this clause and with  the  inclusion  of

clauses  21  and 29, the Referendum Bill would seek to deprive the  exercise  of

democratic  rights by our people. The Government on the one  hand  says  that  a

referendum  is to consult the people, to ascertain the views of the  people.  It

says  that  a referendum will be held in order to determine whether  the  people

support  the  White Paper merger or not. On the other hand,  Sir,  it  seeks  to

interfere with the people's right to free choice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The referendum that the Government has in mind would, in fact, compel the

people  to vote only yes. The right to say no and the right to abstain  will  be

deprived by legislation. We in the Barisan Sosialis have been accused as  people

who work to wreck democracy. We are not hypocrites, Sir, like those who claim to

be  democrats.  We  are not hypocrites like those who claim  to  be  pillars  of

parliamentary democracy but who are in fact destroying the very foundations of a

democratic  society.  The argument the Government has put  forward  against  the

amendment is untenable. We are told that if a simple question requiring a yes or

no answer is put, the people will be confused. The stupidity of this argument is

clear.  It is absolutely ridiculous for the Government to say that our amendment

which  will seek a yes or no answer unequivocally would confuse the people.  Any

man  who makes a suggestion of this sort, Sir, must be insane. And whatever form

the  question  takes in the referendum, the right to reject or abstain  must  be

given  to  the people. This is denied by the Referendum Bill and any proposition

which denies the people the right of free choice, the right to say freely yes or

no or abstain would be in conflict with the principles of democracy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  this  debate  on  the Referendum Bill threatens to be  the  most  dreary

performance ever in this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Oh, you are not

afraid, are you?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> All the points

that  have  been  made and all the arguments that have been put forward  by  the

Barisan  Sosialis  and  the  Workers' Party had all been  set  out  on  previous

occasions.  You,  Mr  Speaker,  as Chairman of  the  Select  Committee  on  the

Referendum Bill, would have recognized them immediately. If you had listened  to

the  radio  forums conducted by the University of Singapore and Radio Singapore,

you  would  have come across the very same old dreary arguments  used  by  these

Members  of  the Opposition on these occasions. For practical purposes,  if  the

Barisan  Sosialis  and the Workers' Party had been provided with  cuttings  from

tape-recordings of those occasions, they could have played back  their  previous

performances, thereby saving their throats unnecessary effort and our  ear-drums

unnecessary tedium. It is true, Mr Speaker, Sir, that on this occasion we  have

so  far been spared the more lurid perorations of the Member for Anson. You will

recollect  that  on  previous occasions he likened our  proposed  referendum  to

beating  of  wives,  beating  of daughters, drinking of  arsenic,  prostitution,

concubine,  etc. Perhaps sombre reflection, which I concede even the Member  for

Anson  on  occasions is capable of, has convinced him of the absurdity of  these

analogies. So, now, we have to put up with the gramophone record performances of

some  hon.  Members opposite. In all these weeks and months of  cogitation  they

have  not been able to think of a single new idea. Their brains appear  to  have

been  completely dried up. One would have thought that decency requires them  to

spare us the dreary repetitions of half-truths and untruths, but this is not the

case.  These hon. Members set about their business as if they are informing  the

House of startling new discoveries in human affairs. So there is nothing for  us

to do but to meet each and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



every  one  of these arguments again. We shall try on our part to introduce,  if

not a completely new set of arguments, at least a more refreshing approach to  a

very stale subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, every time the Member for Anson speaks on how questions in a

referendum should be framed, he lists out referenda in other countries where one

question  is asked with a yes or no answer. No one denies that this is  the  way

certain countries carry out certain types of referenda, but the Member for Anson

has  conveniently forgotten the two referenda most closely akin to the one  that

will be carried out in Singapore soon. I refer, of course, to the referendum  in

Newfoundland  in 1948 and the referendum, carried out last year  by  the  United

Nations in the Cameroons. Both these referenda were to decide the constitutional

future  of  the  territory concerned. The analogy with  Singapore  is  therefore

close,  but  the  matter  goes  even further than  that.  The  future  of  these

territories is to be decided along certain alternatives, one of which is  merger

with  a  larger  territory. The parallel with Singapore is therefore  exact.  In

Newfoundland,  the choice was whether the country should merge  with  Canada  or

achieve independence by itself. In the Cameroons, the choice was between  merger

with  Nigeria  and  merger with the French Cameroons.  Here  are  the  most  apt

precedents  that we have, and our framing of the question follows exactly  these

precedents, that is to say, the choice of alternatives and not one question with

a 'yes' or 'no' answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Barisan Sosialis and the Member for Anson say that the right to say

"no"  is  a basic, fundamental, inalienable human right. I find it difficult  to

understand this, urge of theirs to say 'no' - an urge which may be appropriate  in

the  case  of a virtuous damsel being assailed with an improper suggestion.  But

the Barisan Sosialis and the Workers' Party are neither virtuous nor damsels. In

constitutional  affairs, I do not see where the right to say  "no"  is  a  basic

human  right.  In the Cameroons, for instance, voters were asked to  drop  their

ballot papers in one





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>

of  two boxes; one box for Nigeria and another for Cameroons. There was no third

box for voters, who did not want either of these a1ternatives. So let us not  be

misled  by  precedents selected and slanted by the Member for Anson of referenda

carried out in other countries. Some referenda support his case, others do  not;

and  I  hope he will admit that too. Those which do not support his case have  a

more  immediate similarity with our own situation in Singapore than those  which

do. So this disposes of international precedents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, both the Member for Anson and the Member for Queenstown have made quite a

fuss  about  the  fact  that this is a general Referendum  Bill  under  wnich  a

specific referendum, that is, on merger, will be held. One accepts this,  and  I

do  not  see  why  this  should call for much excitement among  these  two  hon.

Members.   Some   proposed  amendments  are  unacceptable   because   they   are

inappropriate to a general Referendum Bill, and others are because the Bill will

be  used to carry out a referendum on merger. So what is so extraordinary  about

it? [Interruption]

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, am I to understand from the Member for Anson that this

general Referendum Bill is to remain a general Referendum Bill, but not used for

any specific referendum? Is that what he wants us to understand? The hon. Member

even  offered  the  utterly preposterous suggestion that  in  addition  to  this

general  Referendum Bill, we should have a specific Referendum Bill  on  merger.

Sir,  I can see some point, in logic, if he maintains, that we should scrap this

general  Referendum  Bill  and  in  its place  have  one  specifically  for  the

referendum on merger. I can see some point in this. But I am unable to  see  how

and why we should have two Bills on referendum passed at the same time, both  of

which would be used to regulate one referendum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me get down to the gist of the matter. These people want the referendum to

contain only one question, which will admit only a "yes" or "no" answer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



We  have  stated  quite  correctly  that in a general  Referendum  Bill  such  a

limitation  is  unnecessarily restrictive. The arguments have been  set  out  in

Select  Committee  Reports, and I do not wish to weary this House  by  repeating

them.  But I only want to draw attention to two points. First, I want to discuss

what they hope to achieve by this amendment. Second, I want to show that even if

this  amendment is accepted by the Government, it is defective from their  point

of  view and that the objectives which they had in mind can be frustrated  quite

easily by the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first deal with the point as to why they want one question with a 'yes'

or 'no' answer. The Member for Queens-town said that the original intention was

to  put  up the White Paper proposals for acceptance or rejection. He  is  quite

right.  That  was  our  original  intention and it  still  remains  our  present

intention.  But where we disagreed with the Member for Queenstown  is  this:  he

wants  a  rejection of the White Paper proposals to mean that there will  be  no

merger  whatsoever.  We say that the rejection of the White Paper  merger  would

mean  complete  merger on terms of absolute equality with any of  the  other  11

States  of the Federation of Malaya. In other words, if the electorate does  not

like  the  White  Paper proposals, then they get the type of  merger  which  the

Barisan Sosialis and the Workers' Party had been advocating all the time in this

House.  What  is  so  wrong about this? They want complete merger  on  terms  of

absolute  equality  with  the  other States.  Why  do  they  fear  to  put  this

proposition to the electorate? If they are absolutely honest in wanting complete

merger,  then  they should insist that complete merger should be offered  as  an

alternative to the White Paper merger in the Referendum. In fact, if  the  White

Paper  merger  were  the  only  proposition that  the  Government  puts  to  the

electorate, then he should rise in anger and demand that complete merger  should

be  put  as  an  alternative. Why have they not done so, if they  really  wanted

complete merger?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday four of us, the Members for Queenstown, Anson, the Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



Minister and myself went to Radio Singapore to record the third forum on  merger

and  the  Referendum  Bill.  Some time was spent on which  questions  should  we

discuss. Eventually we agreed to discuss three questions, and they were:  first,

whether the electorate should be able to say 'no' at the referendum:

the second was the question of blank votes, and the third question asked was why

the  Barisan  Sosialis and the Workers' Party objected, to  complete  merger,  a

proposal  which  they  have  advocated all the  time,  to  be  included  in  the

referendum.  Sir, more time was then spent on deciding how much time  should  be

allotted to each of these questions. The two hon. Members in the Opposition said

that the basic issue was the right to say 'no', and that the other two were not

really  very  important so that half the time should be spent on discussing  the

basic  right  to say 'no', and a quarter of the time to each of  the  other  two

questions, including the question why they object to complete merger  being  put

to the electorate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our side we maintained that they had to explain to the people of Singapore

why  they had always, objected to complete merger being put in a referendum, and

we  considered this to be a central issue. We, therefore, proposed that half the

time -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Mr Chairman, you have pulled up Members

who  have grossly misrepresented another Member in the Assembly. I would suggest

that this is a gross misrepresentation of the Opposition part that we have at no

time  resisted  any question of the position of the Opposition being  put  in  a

referendum. It has never been put to us, and it is a gross misrepresentation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is not really a point of order. I think the Member for Anson

could raise that point in argument against the Minister for Finance.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I do not understand it. How is there misrepresentation,

considering  that  the Member for Anson and the Member for  Queenstown  will  be

moving a motion later in this session to say that the question to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>



be  put to the referendum is White Paper merger? There is no mention of complete

merger. What is he talking about?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To continue the narrative, Mr Speaker, Sir, we said, "Give them half the time

to  explain why they did not want to put complete merger to the electorate." But

they  displayed a marked shyness in accepting this opportunity to put their case

straight  before  the public. Eventually, Sir, we compromised and  decided  that

each of the three questions should be given equal time. Now, their reluctance to

deal with this very basic question, "Why do they not want their own proposals to

be  put to the electorate?" does not surprise us, for we know that whatever they

pretend  to  say they have never wanted complete merger or any form  of  merger.

Even  now they are saying that they never really asked for complete merger  like

any of the 11 States.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everyone knows that at the first Radio Forum, the Members for Hong Lim

and  Anson in public rebuked the Member for Queenstown for letting the side down

in  making  a  grave mistake when the Barisan asked for merger like  Penang  and

Malacca. And on behalf of -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order.

Mr  Chairman. If this is going to go on, then you will appreciate that we  will

have  to  reopen  the  issue  of merger, and we will be  discussing  Penang  and

Malacca.  I merely ask: is this relevant to the amendment before the House? If

you so consider, then I myself would like ample time to answer it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not think the Minister for Finance has gone too far over the

rails. He is just making a statement of fact.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> He has taken 15 minutes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member for Anson not interrupt when the Speaker is on his

feet?  The Minister for Finance is relating just a statement of fact. He is,  in

fact,  not  arguing  as to whether or not the White Paper  merger  is  a  better

proposition than the Penang





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



Malacca  type of merger or any other type of merger. If he does that,  then,  of

course, he will be irrelevant.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I charge the Barisan Sosialis with being downright

dishonest  when  they said they wanted complete merger. In the  first  instance,

they  asked  for  complete merger like Penang or Malacca. Then, realising  their

error,  they added a new condition which demands that the Federation  Government

should  treat  Singapore on better terms than any of the  11  States.  In  other

words,  what the Barisan Sosialis want is not complete merger for Singapore  but

super-merger.  This  is  not  a proposition that can be  seriously  entertained,

except by those whose real intention is to frustrate merger.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b>

What about Brunei?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Nee Soon says, 'What about Brunei?' If they

want  merger on equal terms with Brunei, we will put it to the public. There  is

no  trouble  about that. But do not ask for super-merger. That does  not  happen

anywhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, both they and the Workers' Party are committed to a policy of complete

merger.  In  any reasonable man's understanding of the words 'complete  merger',

the  terms  must  be  like  those enjoyed by anyone of  the  11  States  of  the

Federation - no better than these and no worse than these. In fact, the Member for

Anson has laid down his policy in no uncertain terms. I quote from Hansard  Vol. 15 No. 7, dated 23rd November, 1961, column 557. He was referring to -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'a dog-eared copy of the very first and the only party platform of the Workers'

Party  on its formation in December of 1957. In the very first paragraph and  in

the very first sentence, it says,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The basis and framework of all policy must be recognition of the fact that

Singapore  is geographically, ethnically, and economically part of  Malaya  and

the  only healthy ultimate solution is integration with Malaya on an equal basis

with other states..."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he went on to say in column 562:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I believe that if the issue were put to the people of Singapore, "Do you want

unconditional merger complete, or do you want the P.A.P. White Paper?" we  would

have 90 per cent of the people voting for unconditional and complete merger.'



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Nine nought.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Ninety, nine nought, 90 per cent of the people voting for

unconditional and complete merger. This statement is remarkable for two  things.

First,  we find that the Member for Anson has displayed on this occasion  occult

powers  of  prediction,  powers which I never thought  he  possessed.  He  must,

therefore,  be  congratulated on the astounding accuracy of prediction  on  what

questions will be posed in this referendum. Whether he succeeded by guess or  by

God I do not know, but I would not grudge him praise, whichever way it is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next, the Member for Anson, at that time at any rate, believed that 90

per  cent  of  the electorate would vote for complete and unconditional  merger.

Obviously, he is not in the same ebullient mood of buoyant optimism as he was on

the 23rd November last year.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I would ask about

P.A.P.'s dishonesty.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, is it dishonest to put in the question which he finds so

natural and so right? [Interruption] I beg your pardon?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am obliged to the Minister. If the Minister would put our

position in our words. I have already offered to pay a thousand dollars  to  the

National Union of Journalists. We are not running away from it; we would be very

happy, but knowing the P.A.P.'s dishonesty, we know they will not. They will put

our words according to their interpretation.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, may I ask the Member for Anson: if we were to frame the

alternatives in the way he has put it, would he be happy?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not

think

we  should  go  into details like that. The Minister for Finance  has  gone  on

record  to  say that these questions will be debated in this Assembly.  So  that

that is the time to debate.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> So be it, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if he is of the same frame of mind us he was in last year, I think he

would he the last person to suggest that there should be only one question  with

a "Yes" or "No" answer. But what strikes me as beyond comprehension is his anger

that  the Government should carry out the referendum in exactly the manner which

he  thought so natural several months ago. Why is it blatant dishonesty in  June

1962  to  do what was so obviously right in November 1961? That .is to  put  two

alternatives  for  the  people's choice - White Paper merger  and  complete  and

unconditional merger. Sir, if he wants complete and unconditional merger, to use

his  own  words, "on an equal basis with any of the, other States", why does  he

object to this choice being offered to the electorate as an alternative to White

Paper  merger?  More especially so as he is convinced that 90 per  cent  of  the

electorate will choose complete and unconditional merger. Why does he  say  that

complete and unconditional merger is like drinking arsenic, beating one's  wife,

going  into  prostitution and other perverted forms of human conduct  which  his

morbid imagination conjures up every now and then?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this brings me to the point raised by the Member for Queenstown. He said

that  we had originally intended to pose the White Paper proposal for acceptance

or  rejection. He meant by this we wanted to put the White Paper proposal  in  a

form  of  a question which only admits of a "Yes" or "No." answer. Sir,  how  he

gets  this  curious notion I do not know. But he now admits that if  the  choice

were  given  to the people between White Paper merger and complete merger,  this

would put Barisan Sosialis in a "zugzwang".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At long last the awful truth has dawned upon him, and I must congratulate him

on his realisation of the dire straits in which he finds himself, belated though

his  perception comes. But he will recollect that when I first told him that the

Barisan  Sosialis was in a "zugzwang", it was not this year, but well into  last

year that it happened. Sir, time does not permit me to check through Hansard  to

identify the date but this may be a useful piece of research for the hon. Member

to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to say that there has been a recent switch in our policy on referendum is

untrue.  Right from the beginning we were fairly certain of the outcome  of  the

referendum  we propose to carry out. There was no hasty change of  intention  or

design, as a result of a reappraisal of political trends. The P.A.P., Sir, makes

long-term  forecasts fairly accurately and, in addition, allows for  the  inevit

able  margin  of error and inaccuracy for which special precautions  are  always

available. This is the way to handle a troublesome situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Member for Queenstown is still not convinced of what I say, may I

refer  him  to the parable of the inquisitive camel, which I brought up  in  the

Select  Committee? This stupid and inquisitive camel - I am referring, of  course,

to  the  Barisan Sosialis - is led to the belief that there is a fish in the  mud-hole.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Are you referring to merger?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No, I am not referring to merger. Eventually the camel,

wanting to know more about the fish, goes nearer to the mud-hole and falls  into

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this parable is intended to show that the Communists and their stooges in

the  Barisan Sosialis made their basic error, not in recent months or weeks, but

as long ago as last July, August and September, when in complete dishonesty they

claimed that they wanted full and complete merger. They think that they can  get

away  with this dishonest pretence. Sir, the time for reckoning is not far  off.

The day of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>

retribution  is at hand. Once they said that they wanted complete  and  absolute

merger, then there was no escape for them. Sir, how different the position would

be  if they had, right from the beginning, said that they did not want merger on

any  terms whatsoever. They were instructed by the Communist underground to  say

that  the  next stage of the constitutional development of Singapore  should  be

internal  self-government with internal security in the hands of  the  Singapore

Government  so  that they can save their own skins. If they had  stuck  to  this

M.C.P. underground official line steadfastly and without deviation, they  would

not have been in their present predicament of having their bluff called.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you ask for complete merger, you ask for complete merger, not for super-merger. This attempt to wriggle out from complete merger by saying that you

really  wanted super-merger is too obvious and dishonest a maneuver  to  deceive

anybody.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, now, Sir, the camel is in the mud-hole and there he remains until he is

carried out by persons who want to take charge of naughty and inquisitive camels

arid to put them in their proper places.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You are the camel, then.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Some people are trying to make a pretence of being quite

jolly about the situation. I congratulate the Member for Thomson on his show  of

resolution. But, Sir, we were not born yesterday.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You are optimistic, you know.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> We are optimistic, confident and relaxed. We face the

future as Mao Tse-tung says -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> When?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> This was after -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Let us hear about Mao Tse-tung [Laughter].



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> This was after the third annihilation campaign which the

Kuomintang forces mounted against him and they were defeated and routed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



every  time, and Mao Tse-tung said, "When your strategic position is  sound  and

when  your  tactical disposition is complete, you can face the enemy  with  ease

and'  poise."  That is the happy position we find ourselves in  today.  We  face

everything with complete ease and poise. We are not ruffled, even by the threats

of the Member for- [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I take it that that quotation comes from a book and the

book is available in the Library.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> This quotation comes from Mao Tse-tung's Selected Works. I

think it is Volume 2. It is in the library.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Mao Tse-tung is a real Communist.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The open front leader of the Communists in the Barisan

Sosialis paid the Prime Minister and myself a most handsome compliment. He said,

"These are the people who study the Communist classics and use their tactics and

strategy to put them in a fix." That is a very big compliment. Why should we not

do  it?  In a democracy, Sir, are we democrats disallowed, the freedom  to  read

Communist classics? I am sure the Member for Thomson would not say so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You had better



give me a few books.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I now come to the second feature of the proposed

amendment.  I said, before that even if the Government accepted this  amendment,

it could still frustrate the objective which the amenders have in mind, namely,

to  block merger. Now. Sir, let me transfix the point that we can easily  devise

the  question  in accordance with the requirements of this amendment  and  still

have  merger, whatever the answer is. We can frame the question like this.:  "Do

you prefer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



complete merger to the White Paper merger? Answer 'yes' or 'no'." If the  answer

is  'yes',  you  get complete merger. If the answer is 'no', you get  the  White

Paper  merger.  All the conditions of the clauses are followed,  but  the  camel

still  remains in its mud-hole. So this amendment really is an example of  inept

draftsmanship,  just  as  the amendment we discussed yesterday  was  clumsy  and

inept.  They wanted to have the questions put to the referendum to be  discussed

in  this Assembly. They dealt with the wrong clause of the Bill, amending it  in

such a way that it became constitutionally ridiculous. May I, therefore, suggest

to  them, the Barisan Sosialis and the Workers' Party, that they should pay more

attention to the finer points of legal draftsmanship?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis have been so obsessed with having questions

with an answer of 'yes' or 'no' that they said through their representative, Dr

Lim  Hock Siew, at the forum of the University of Singapore, that they  did  not

mind whether there is one question, two' questions, or five questions put to the

referendum, provided the answer is 'yes' or 'no' to each one of them. And if the

electorate were given the choice to say 'no', they would, not mind whether blank

votes  counted  one  way  or  the other. Sir, these  are  very  rash,  bold  and

inadequately considered views. If we were to take Dr Lim at his own  words,  it

does  not  require much ingenuity to frame the questions in such  a  way  as  to

frustrate the Barisan Sosialis' attempt to wreck the merger referendum. Sir, the

point  is not whether there should be one question to which the answer is to  be

'yes'  or  'no'. This is merely a matter of legal draftsmanship  on  which  they

slipped  up  so badly. The real issue is this: should the Communists  and  their

stooges  be given a chance to wriggle out of their open commitment for  complete

merger and so wreck the referendum by dishonest and fraudulent misrepresentation

of  the issue? They claim that in a democratic state they have the right to  use

democratic  privileges to jam up the democratic processes. Sir,  only  the  most

innocent of people believe that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



democratic  state is so feeble, so flabby, and so powerless as  to  provide  its

enemies, who wish to destroy democracy, all the facilities and encouragement  to

do  so.  They  may  feel that the democratic system should allow  itself  to  be

corroded and destroyed in this manner. We of the P.A.P. say that it is the  duty

of  the  democratic state to set up defences in sufficient strength to deny  the

enemy any opportunity to do this.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can understand the Minister preparing and

reading a written speech for that tour de force of abuse and falsehoods. I  will

ignore the abuse. Let me come straight down to the falsehoods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, "The Barisan Sosialis and the Workers' Party have always objected to

their  type  of merger being put to the people in a referendum", and  he  cannot

understand our reluctance in that we do not want our proposals to be put to  the

electorate.  Mr Speaker, every human being is expected to have  a  memory  that

lasts  at  least 24 hours. Not 24 hours ago, Mr Speaker, I had  to  meet  these

gentlemen  across  the  Floor in Radio P.A.P. There was a loaded  question  from

Utusan  Melayu.  Let me read it, Sir, so that you can have it accurately,  from

the official transcript; it is not mine:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Barisan Sosialis and the Workers' Party have in the earlier stages asked

for  complete merger. Why are they now objecting to this question being  put  to

the people in the

referendum?'



<br><br>My  reply,  in the hearing of the Minister, was that the first part was  correct

that, in so far as the Workers' Party was concerned, we believed, we believe and

will  continue to believe, in a complete merger. As to the second  question,  it

was  completely  inaccurate to suggest that we were reluctant that  that  matter

should  be  put.  In fact, Mr Chairman, I have stated, in the  hearing  of  the

Minister who still repeats that falsehood, that we are reluctant to have it  put

to the referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Marshall, they say that they will put the alternative. Do you want the

P.A.P. proposals or do you want complete merger?'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



I  say  to  you  that  I  am prepared - the journalists were present - to  donate  a

thousand  dollars  to  the  National Union  of  Journalists  if,  in  fact,  the

alternatives are put.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. This is not a point of order. It is only to ask the

Member to speak a little slower because of the difficulty in translation.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged.

Sir.  And  I  said that, in fairness, the alternative should be the  alternative

which we proposed in all solemnity to the motion for merger on 21st November

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- an alternative, Sir, which you will find on the day it was proposed by the

Member for Queenstown, and strongly supported by the United People's. Party  and

by  the Workers' Party on 21st November, 1961, at col. 406 of the Hansard,  Vol.

15, No. 5.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You wanted super merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I shall come to that falsehood in a minute - one at a time. I know

it  is  very embarrassing. I do not know, but perhaps it is not embarrassing  to

him. I am feeling how I would feel if I were doing this sort of thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this was the amendment. We sought to introduce the words:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'genuine merger of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya, with Singapore

entering  the  Federation  as  the  twelfth state  and  with  all  its  Citizens

automatically becoming Federal Citizens on Merger Day.'

<br><br>Sir,  that deals with the first falsehood that we do not want our stand  put  to

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I almost feel apologetic with the respect that I normally have for the traditional august nature of this Assembly, which one is apt to forget

sometimes in the light of the unprecedented conduct of the Government to use the

word  "falsehood".  But  there is no other word, Sir,  which  could  fairly  and

squarely  pin  it down in the light of the fact that it was but 30  hours  ago - yesterday, between 12.30 and 2.00 p.m., this was stated in his presence, and his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



answer  was, "This is a bribe." I said. "It is not the P.A.P. that I am offering

the  bribe  to." The National Union of Journalists can hardly assist me  in  it,

Sir.  That is the first falsehood. They said, "Ah, yes." Now, Sir, we went right

off.  They  did  not accept the challenge. Would they put the  position  of  the

Opposition  as enunciated by them after consultation and fully supported,  which

they defeated' with the Front Bench of the Opposition by I think it was 32 votes

to 17 with two absent on 6th December.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, let us pin this falsehood once and forever, and I am prepared to sit

down  to  receive'  the  answer. Would the Government be  prepared  to  put  the

alternative  in the form that the Opposition want? And, Sir, I added  this.  You

know,  Mr Speaker, never I think - and you have known me for a long time - have  I

ever  alleged that I could at most but guess at the wishes of the people. Nobody

knows it. And when I expressed my own views as to the possible result, those are

my  own  views, but I would say this that even if our proposals were put to  the

people, I say that they are entitled to say yes or no to each, that there should

never be any question because the Opposition Parties say they believe the people

want  one  thing  and  the Government say they believe the people  want  another

thing,  that  the people should have no right to reject both the Government  and

the  Opposition proposals. We are no gods. We are human beings. Some of us  seek

in  sincerity to assess what is wanted, to assess how good it is, to assess  how

far  it  should  be taken, and I, in so far as the Workers' Party is  concerned,

even if that were put, I would insist that the people, should have the right  to

reject and categorically and clearly to reject my proposals if they deem fit  to

do  so.  They should have the unequivocal right to say yes or no to  either  the

Government proposition and/or the Opposition proposition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the second falsehood - that we asked for super merger. I do not have

to  prepare  or  get prepared by one of many paid stooges any speech  to  answer

this. The second falsehood that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>

was  perpetrated in that tour de force of abuse and falsehood is that we seek  a

super merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, first let us look at the terms again: "genuine merger of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya, with Singapore entering the Federation as

the  twelfth  state  and  with all its Citizens automatically  becoming  Federal

Citizens."  That  was our amendment which was defeated by the  P.A.P. with  the

S.P.A. and U.M.N.O. in support. Where is its super position?



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We ask for integration. Do you think that when Newfoundland entered Canada the

citizens  of Newfoundland did not become Canadian citizens? You know that  since

1948  the  Federation has had provisions whereby persons living  in  Penang  and

Malacca could have Federal citizenship. Do you think that when the eleven States

joined  together,  the  Federal citizens of Penang or  Malacca  did  not  become

Federation  citizens?  Now, Sir, Penang did not have any Singapore  citizens  or

Penang citizens. Malacca did not have any Singapore citizens or Malacca citizens

and  the issue as regards our citizens should be dealt with in the same  way  as

the  citizens  who were Federal citizens and that this can be  done  is  clearly

shown:

it  was  in the mind of the Federation parties and the Alliance which helped  to

formulate  the  Constitution whereby under Article  22  the  Government  of  the

Federation  is given the power to grant citizenship to those in new  territories

who are citizens of the new territories which join it. So, Mr Speaker, that  is

the second falsehood, that we asked for a super, super merger -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order. An application to move a business motion. I

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair of

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, one other point in respect of this falsehood, that

we  are  seeking a super merger - something that nobody has, something  that  the

arrogant Singapore Commun.sts want and their stooges. Mr Speaker, you have been

referred during a bag and unhappy sitting in November and December of last  year

to  the widespread publicity given to polIcy statements of the Prime Minister of

the  Federation  of Malaya wherein he indicated in the clearest  possible  terms

that he was prepared to take in Brunei, Borneo aid Sarawak with full Federation

citizenship for the Brunei citizens and the British subjects in the  other  two

territories.  So where are we asking for this super merger? That is  the  secoid

falsehood, Sir. Then he said - and this, Sir, but for the fact that it  is  tragic

would  make one laugh; prepared for him no doubt by somebody and I wonder if  he

understands the words he uses - "What would the reasonable man's understanding  be

of  complete merger?" Yes, do they know what a reasonable man is? Can  they  put

themselves in the position of a reasonable man? Do they really think  they  can?

Have  they  made  any  effort  to  talk on an honest  man-to-man  basis  with  a

reasonable  man and ask of him, "What do you understand by the phrase  'complete

and  unconditional merger'?" Do you understand that there are going to  be  half

our  citizens who would be deprived of citizenship? Sir, to put the question  is

to answer it, except for those who are deaf to all logic, to all

reason,  to all good sense. For the P.A.P. Front Bench to talk of the reasonable

man  is  almost blasphemy. He said, Sir. "What is wrong, that in  June  1962  we

should  not do what the Member for Anson said we could do in November of  1961?"

The  Member for Anson has at no time. Mr Speaker, ever considered it proper  or

said  that  it  was  proper that the people should have questions  put  to  them

without  being  given  the  right to say yes or no to  each  question  as  every

civilised  country  has  offered.  The  Minister  for  Finance  has  offered  us

Newfoundland - I hope it was not done cleverly. I should like to think that he  is

not just that dishonest but shall we say he has glossed over the manner in which

the  voting took place, whether in respect of the three alternatives, they  were

given  the  chance to say yes or no in respect of each of them. But he  has  put

forward the issue of the Cameroons.

The Cameroons, and I may be wrong here in my history, Mr Chairman, were a trust

territory  under  the  United  Nations and  it  could  be,  after  thorough  and

exhaustive examination and various commissions going to the Cameroons, that they

decided  that  there  was no other alternative, because nobody  wanted  anything

else:  either the question of going into Nigeria or the question of  going  into

the Cameroons. There was never any demand for the right to say yes or no, it was

never  queried by anybody within the Cameroons if you would care to look at  the

United  Nations report in that respect. It was put very frankly, Sir. But  here,

what  is  being threatened is not that we are going to put the only two possible

issues because they admit themselves through the Prime Minister

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- they have said ad nauseam; to talk about radio or gramophone records, Sir,

nowadays  is  really  to  bring people's minds to the  Prime  Minister  and  his

performances on Radio Singapore - but he has said that if you ask 624,000 citizens

what  type  of  merger  you  want,  according  to  him,  you  will  get  624,000

alternatives. So, Sir, it is not a question - unless they are going to somersault again and I must confess, Sir, that I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>



have  reached the stage where I do not believe that anything we say on this side

of  the  House can convince them except perhaps the power to out-vote  them;  it

does  not  look  possible,  in view of the statement  made  by  the  Member  for

Cairnhill - but  for  the  record  let us pin down  these  falsehoods.  There  are

according  to  the  P.A.P. 624,000 possible variations of  merger - one  for  each

citizen. So it is not that they are exhausted. Now, why do they refuse the right

to say no? Why?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Minister for Finance said that he missed my lurid analogies of mistress and prostitute, of beating his mother, his wife or his daughter and

he  asked,  in sneering terms, whether calmer judgment has made me  realise  the

inappropriateness - or  perhaps he used an abusive word, I  cannot  remember  them

all - that  this was not appropriate. Mr Chairman, not at all, not at all.  These

analogies  likening  the  alternatives to the alternative  offered  of  being  a

mistress or being a prostitute - the essential quality between all these analogies

is  the  quality  of -  how shall I say it - unacceptability to the  normal,  decent

person; giving the alternative of one unacceptable alternative and another  that

is  even  more  unacceptable. And it is far from inappropriate to say  that  the

present merger proposals are somewhat equivalent to offering us the position  of

a  mistress coming to my home, joining my board but she cannot have the  dignity

and status of my bride. Nor is there so grave a discrepancy and so inappropriate

that  one  can complain about the interpretation that they put about  joining  a

State  with the deprivation of our citizens of their citizenship being different

from that of inviting us to be a prostitute. Mr Speaker, if they prefer, and it

is  the  same to me, I have earlier said it is not fair to say to your daughter,

"You must marry A or B." She should have the chance to say yes or no to either.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we had the extraordinary performance - not extraordinary, one should become accustomed to this by now - of the Minister standing up and saying,

"This is a specific Bill," and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



three  sentences later saying, "This is a general Bill for a specific  purpose,"

and  then  going on to say, "It is a general Bill and why should not we  have  a

specific  referendum  thereunder?" Mr Speaker, we all  know  that  general  pro

visions  apply in individual cases but they are general provisions because  they

are intended for all cases that may be applicable thereafter. But he stated that

this  was a specific Bill and that is why it was inappropriate that there should

be only one question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to draw your attention to this Minister's statement on the 15th of May, 1962, to be found in column 309 of our Official Report from

Select Committee, and that is to show you that though this is supposed to  be  a

general  referendum Bill he admitted that the present clause 29 was in fact  for

the  specific purposes of dealing with the Communist threat on merger.  We  will

come to the Communist threat. But I want to use the exact words so that I should

not misquote him. Now, Mr Speaker, your question after he had quoted himself - he

has  a delightful habit of respecting himself and admiring himself so much  that

he  is always quoting himself. Now, Sir, he quoted himself over the whole column

and then you asked him when he drew breath:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Chairman: May I now ask the Minister whether he has indicated, by his

reading  of the extracts, that the New Clause (A) [that is, our clause 29]  has,

in fact, been introduced to meet a situation of that nature in regard

to a referendum on merger?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr  Goh Keng Swee: I would say, Mr Chairman, not generally, but in particular

reference to the present situation,...'.



<br><br>Now,  Sir,  what  does the Minister for Labour and Law say in  respect  of  that

clause?  I  know  he  says all over the place - it is peppered with  his  protestations - that this is a general Bill. But look at the revised transcript of the Hansard of the 16th of March, 1962, Sir -

[Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am delighted to hear him turning again because he cannot open

transcript dated 16th March, 1962 [Vol. 17, No. 3, col. 270], the last few lines

where he stated that the New Clause (A) was introduced specifically for the  purpose of a referendum on merger. I will read it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In the same way, the Government would be failing in their duty to the people

and would be acting foolishly if they did not take the elementary precaution  of

preventing the

referendum from being manipulated -'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Member is reading too fast. I am sure there

is difficulty in translation.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am so sorry. I appreciate that. I will read it again slowly:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In the same way, the Government would

be failing in their duty to the people and

would  be  acting  foolishly if they did not take the elementary  precaution  of

preventing  the  referendum from being manipulated by what  would  amount  to  a

boycott  of  the  referendum through the tendering of blank and unmarked  ballot

papers which can be organised to serve

the  ends  of  those  Communists and pro-Communist groups  who  are  hostile  to

merger.'

<br><br>Sir, since they have introduced clause 29

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- or perhaps they would like to deny it now, they have the opportunity; nobody is

going  to be surprised now, but if they would like to deny it they can, so  long

as they are on the record; I will treat it still undenied and still their policy - specifically  for the purposes of the merger proposals of the P.A.P.,  why  can

they not consider introducing specific questions or question for the purpose  of

the merger proposals? After all, here are specific provisions in a general Bill,

call  it a hybrid Bill, not to use an offensive term, although a hybrid Bill  is

known  technically as meaning something else. Let us use that term here to  mean

one  that is a cross between a general and a specific. They have here clause  29

which  is  specifically for merger. Could we not have also some provisions  with

reference to saying 'yes' or 'no' and to the merger proposal question?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come to the Member for Cairnhill. I must confess that I am so

unaccustomed in this Chamber to hearing a Member of the Assembly referring  with

courtesy to a political opponent with whom he is in strong disagreement  that  I

trust that you will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



grant  me the indulgence of expressing my surprise and my appreciation  for  the

courteous  manner  in  which he referred to me and his  acceptance  of  my  good

intentions. Sir, he asked, why do I lead the Barisan Sosialis? Heaven forbid!  I

think  both the Member for Queenstown and I would deny that strenuously, Sir,  1

am  sure they do not like to follow that. He has suggested it, and shall we say,

if  I  might  change a little without changing the meaning. Why am  I  with  the

Barisan  Sosialis  on this matter of having one question one issue?  I  must  be

satisfied that that would lead to the Communists rigging the merger proposals. 1

think that is what he said, Sir. Now, the question there is a fair one and it is

unfortunate  that  he did not elaborate on why and how the  rigging  would  take

place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately we are in Committee, and it would be helpful - very helpful, Sir - if we could know. But I would like to ask this. I told him frankly that I am

associated with this amendment and with this attack on the Referendum Bill,  and

with  his  strenuous,  and  I  do  assure  him,  his  sincere  efforts  for  its

amelioration,  because we believe that it is essential for our welfare  and  the

healthy development of democracy that the people should be honestly dealt  with.

It is as simple as that. And if we deal dishonestly with them - those whom we seek

to  attract  to the democratic way -  it would be a retrograde step and  it  would

take us a long time to recover from it. I would ask him, Sir, does he think that

if  one  Question was put to the people, the question that was accepted by  this

Assembly,  it  being  that the merger proposals are the  first  step  which  are

acceptable to the welfare of the people, is he then saying that he thinks they

would  reject  it? Because he says they would wreck it. If he does  think  that,

does  he  think  that  the  majority  or our  624,000  people  would  be  acting

voluntarily  or  under compulsion? If voluntarily, Sir, surely it  is  the  very

essence  of the democratic process that a man, no matter how humble,  no  matter

how ignorant, if he is a citizen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



of age and sane, should have the right to express his views. That is part of the

strength and the defects that we reach a healthy balance. Does he now deny  the

right  of  the majority who do not believe in merger, according to him,  to  say

"no"? If so, why, Sir? Because they are confused? Would the Member for Cairnhill

not  admit that the only confusion of which we have any evidence so far  is  the

calculated  confusion created, perpetrated and maintained  by  the  P.A.P. with

reference  to'  this  Penang  and Malacca bogey?  Does  he  know  of  any  other

confusion?  Yes,  Sir,  let me be fair. There is the confusion  of  second-class

citizenship. True. There is that and I know the Barisan did not like me  when  I

said  that  "second-class  citizen" was an inappropriate  phrase,  that  it  was

distinct  citizenship. But assuming, and I accept that is a  totally  inaccurate

way  of describing it - distinct citizenship; let us say that there are people who

believed  that, Sir, and who are merely confused, although, in so far as  I  can

see,  the major campaign is this humbug and hypocrisy that is being manufactured

by  the  P.A.P. in respect of Penang and Malacca. But let us say that it is  the

Barisan  who talk of second-class citizenship. I will ask you this, Mr Speaker.

Right, I am confused. I have swallowed hook, line and sinker this talk of second-class  citizenship. Am I therefore not entitled to vote, because I am  confused?

Has  a man who is confused no right to vote? Since when has democracy sought  to

distinguish  the  confused  and the not confused? How  many  of  those  opposite

Benches  are  not confused? Or on the Back Benches? The Front Benches  know  not

what  they  are  doing.  Oh! yes, the Back Benches will begin  to  wriggle  with

embarrassment,  I  hope. So, Sir, I would ask the Member for Cairnhill.  He  has

posed  a  fair  question, and he has the chance, and I would ask him, in  these

cases  if  the  people would freely vote against the White Paper, are  they  not

entitled  to  do  so?  Surely he is not suggesting any  matter  of  coercion  or

compulsion?  It  is  the essence of democracy that no matter  how  confused,  or

humble or stupid a man may be, he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



is  entitled to say "yes" or "no" , and to make his choice. He says, and I think

he implies it, to have one question, one issue, would wreck the referendum - the

merger proposals. He did not indicate either what other question he had in mind.

I  want  to say this to you, Mr Chairman. I  recognize that there can be  other

questions  -  legitimate  questions - and I want to say  to  myself,  I  am  not

intransigent as regards one question, so long as the people have a right to  say

"yes"  or  to say "no" to each. In the context of the merger proposals, we frame

this  amendment  because  it  seems to us that there  was  but  one  appropriate

question, and that was the question posed by the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, you are not unaware of the accepted constitutional understanding of a referendum that it puts to the people something approved of by the

Legislature  for  their confirmation and what has been approved  are  the  White

Paper  proposals. The Opposition stand has been rejected and frankly,  from  the

constitutional  standpoint, it does not seem appropriate . I  do  not,  for  one

moment,  believe   that  there is any milk of human  kindness,  or  a  sense  of

sportsmanship, or a sense of democracy or even a sense of decency on  the  Front

Bench  that would put the Opposition point of view to the people. You have heard

the  Minister for Finance last night say proudly, "What do you think the  P.A.P.

is? A philanthropic organization that is going to help the Barisan Sosialis with

its  point  of  view? Of course it is not." There is no understanding  of  these

things  on  the part of the Front Bench. This era of the P.A.P. is  an  era  of

tragedy  which the people of Singapore will  remember for a  long time.  And  we

are all praying that it will end, and that it will end quietly, and without much

more  damage to us. The sooner we bury them, Sir, the cleaner the air  will  be,

and  the more scope there will be for democracy. So it is not the question  that

they are seeking to pose our question. I am

Asking the Member for Cairnhill - since he posed a fair question - what question

has  he  in  mind  that  could  probably be  posed  which  would  frustrate  the

machinations of the Communists? Mr Chairman I want to ask you, Sir, it is not  a

little



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 228</b></font><br><br>



fantastic to suggest that the Communists in Singapore could intrude and in fact,

influence the voluntary act of voting of the majority of our 624,000 citizens? I

would say that is an absurdity. [Interruption] Oh, let us have an end to all

these falsehoods. He has been replied to. This is another Dr Goebbels - repeat

and repeat like a foolish, worn-out gramophone record that is dusty, dirty,

bankrupt and broken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, let me return to the Member for Cairnhill, who has

urged me to an effort at understanding and who has put a fair question which I

am trying to deal with. I do ask what further question would he like'? Would he

like to indicate them? I would go so far as to say, Mr Chairman, that he has

not, in fact, dealt with the last limb of our amendment. The first one was that

there should be one question, the second is that there should be one issue, the

last part is that every elector shall be required to answer such question. He

can put each question. He can put each question with a 'yes' or 'no'. Would he

like to move that amendment or would he like to deal with the question as a

whole? I have not given up hope, as the Barisan seems to have given up hope,

that the S.P.A. would in fact dissociate themselves from a dishonest referendum.

I have heard the Member for Cairnhill in Select Committee. You will remember,

Sir, that we were indebted to him for a conciliatory and constructive effort and

I do hope that we will see no change of that stand in this Assembly now. I would

inquire whether the Member for Cairnhill is, in fact, interested in supporting

that part of the amendment which requests that there should be an answer of

"yes" or "no" to the question, although he objects to the single question and

the single issue aspect.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, much

already has been debated, discussed, argued from all parties in Singapore on

whether there should be one simple straightforward question in the coming

referendum. We have listened to all the twists and turns and arguments put

forward by the Government and I do not wish to repeat here the same old

arguments. But what I must do now is to explode one of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



points raised by the Minister for Finance, which, on the face of it, looks very

convincing. In  his  speech the Minister for Finance has said  that  under  the

Opposition's  united  amendment, the Government can still ask:  "Do  you  prefer

complete  merger  to White Paper merger?" I think, Sir, if  the  Government  is

prepared to be dishonest and to go to any lengths, however much we tie  them  up

in  Bills, Ordinances and by-laws, they still can wriggle out to suit their  own

convenience. However, I wish today to quote from a book written by J. F. S. Ross

from  the  Assembly  Library called "Elections and Electors".  Commenting  on  a

referendum, at page 23 of his book, Mr Ross said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The essence of the referendum, of course, is that it puts a question to the

general body of citizens. Now, any fool can ask a question, but to ask the right

question,  and  to ask it in the right way, is quite another matter.  Experience

shows  that large numbers of people will misunderstand even simple questions  if

there  is  the  least chance. It needs great skill and care  to  make  questions

foolproof.  Moreover  to  ask  questions on controversial  issues  requires,  in

addition, a high standard of integrity; for if the questioner is unscrupulous he

may so word the question as either deliberately to mislead the answerer, or else

to  suggest to him a particular response that the questioner desires to receive.

In  short,  the referendum offers too many opportunities of misunderstanding  on

the  one hand, and of manipulation on the other, to permit of its acceptance  as

generally suitable for purposes of government. Further, even if we could be sure

of putting impeccable questions and receiving faultless answers, we should still

have  to  confine  the  use of the referendum to comparatively  few  and  simple

issues.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is nothing to prevent the Government, if it so

desires,  from  asking any question. They can have a referendum to  ask  such  a

question:

"Do you prefer an S.P.A. Government to a P.A.P. Government?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read in another book by C. S. Emden, "The People and the Constitution", that

he  mentions  that  in  1945,  Churchill, at the  conclusion  of  his  Coalition

Government, suggested a referendum to authorise the maintenance of the  existing

Parliament until the end of the war against Japan. This referendum was not  held

because  of  the  opposition  of the Labour and  Liberal  Parties.  Now  if  Mr

Churchill in those days had insisted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



that the referendum should be held, he had two ways out. If he wanted to hold an

honest referendum he would put the question simply by asking for a simple  'yes'

or  'no'. He would frame the question: "Do you agree that the present Parliament

should  continue  until the end of the war with Japan?" What  he  wanted  was  a

simple 'yes' or 'no'. But if Mr Churchill were politically bankrupt, but  still

wanted  to  cling to power and hold a dishonest referendum, he  could  pose  two

alternatives: "Do you want Churchill to govern the country?" and  "Do  you  want

Chamberlain  to come back to power?", or as the Minister for Finance  said  just

now: "Do you prefer a Hitler or a Mussolini to Mr Churchill?" Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  shows  that a referendum can always be manipulated. That is  why  we  have

supported the amendment to clause 5 so as to minimise the risk of the referendum

being manipulated. That is why we have thought that the question to be asked  in

the  coming  referendum should be a simple straightforward question requiring  a

simple answer - 'yes' or 'no'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the amendment put forward by the three Opposition Parties

is  accepted  by Government, we believe there will be less room for unscrupulous

governments,  not  only  now, but also in the future, to  manipulate  referenda.

However, on this occasion, I doubt whether we can make this Government see  some

sense. It is prepared to go against the people and to dishonour its pledges. You

remember, I mentioned once in this Assembly that the Deputy Prime Minister wrote

to the Opposition Parties on 6th September, 1961, the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There has not been and there will not be any secret deal between the

Federation  Government and the Singapore Government. The agreement in  principle

on  the  two points I have enunciated has been published. When the deliberations

of  the Working Party are completed and agreement is reached, they will also  be

published. The people can then either accept or reject them.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the words are very clear, unequivocal and unambiguous.  "The

people can either accept or reject them", which means the White Paper proposals.

To accept means to say yes and to reject is to say no. The Deputy Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 231</b></font><br><br>



Minister  has given a pledge to all Opposition Parties and the contents  of

his letter could be translated as this: Do you want the White Paper - yes  or

no?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Minister for Finance in his speech yesterday and today has

confirmed  the  pledge and he has given reasons why his  Government  is  dis

honouring  the  pledge.  Sir, our analysis, in  this  instance,  happens  to

coincide incidentally  with the Member for Cairnhill's analysis just now.  Why  does  Government  want  to dishonour its pledge? At yesterday's debate, the  Minister

for  Finance remarked that it was because the Barisan Sosialis  had  put  up

proposals  for  a  different type of merger. Now, Sir,  this  is  merely  an

excuse.  This  type of argument does not hold ground, firstly,  the  Barisan

Sosialis  is not the only Opposition to the White Paper proposals. Secondly,

it  has claimed that the P.A.P. had distorted its intentions. Thirdly,  when

the  White Paper was put up for debate, the Barisan Sosialis' stand in  this

Assembly was clearly one of automatic conversion of Singapore citizens  into

Federal citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper has been agreed between the Singapore and the Federa

tion  Governments as a form of constitutional proposals. As far as we  have

been  informed,  there save been no other types of merger  proposals  other

than the White Paper merger proposals. As far as we know, no other types of

merger proposals have been discussed between the two Governments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to ask the Government, "Has the Federation Government said that

Singapore  can  choose any type of merger it wants?" We hope the  Government

will  give  an  answer. Sir, why does the Government want to  dishonour  its

pledge  which  it has given in speeches by the Prime Minister  in  July  and August 1961, and in a letter sent to Opposition Parties by the Deputy  Prime

Minister? We feel that the Government has changed its mind, because  in  the

early  stages  of the talks with the Federation, the P.A.P.  Government  was

confident  that  its proposals could be acceptable to the  majority  of  the

people.  This  confidence  was based on the premise  that  the  people  will

swallow the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 232</b></font><br><br>



bait  of  the so-called autonomy in education and labour. Therefore, the  Government  committed  itself not only to a referendum but also to  a  straightforward

question  with  a 'yes' or 'no' answer. However, later, the situation  developed

rapidly.  The  people did not swallow the bait but instead asked  for  automatic

conversion.  Therefore,  the  Government was having  second  thoughts  when  the

Referendum  Bill  came  up for Second Reading. The people  had  known,  and  the

Government  had known itself that it will lose in a straightforward  and  honest

referendum.  However,  the  Government after having committed  itself  to  a  referendum  must  find a way out. This was found by the skilful and artful  manipulation  of  putting a second alternative which will be worse than  the  original

proposal. Faced with two bad alternatives the voters will have to abstain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is nothing now which this Government is not prepared to do, lt is

already politically bankrupt, and it makes no difference whether one is bankrupt

once  or  bankrupt  ten times. The Government can argue that  it  has  not  gone

against  its pledge. It can say, as it had said in the Radio forum,  "You  still

can  reject  the White Paper by voting for the second alternative,  and  if  you

cannot make up your mind, don't worry, the Government will do it for you." As  I

said  just  now, it Churchill wants to be politically dishonest, he  can  always

say,  "If you don't want me to be the Prime Minister for another few years, then

you  can  vote Chamberlain in." Mr Speaker, Sir, this is all twisted logic  and

dialectics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not feel that we should waste the time any more of this House. We

have  gone  through and made countless arguments in debates and forums  on  this

extremely important issue. Both the Government and Opposition Parties have  more

or  less exhausted all the arguments and I am convinced that nothing will change

the  Government stand. However, it is important for us to know which side of the

arguments  has been more convincing and acceptable to the people. The best  way,

Sit, -is to decide in a by-election. I will resign from the seat of Hong Lim  if

Government  gives us two undertakings; one, not to force through the  Referendum

Bill in its present form



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 233</b></font><br><br>

until  the  verdict of the people is obtained: two, not to delay or to  postpone

the  by-election  sine die but to have polling day on or before  31st  of  July,

1962. Mr, speaker, Sir, I will not try to embarrass the Front Benches of the Government by challenging them to resign one seat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will fight on two simple issues - clause 5 and clause 29; that is the question to be put and the blank votes.

If  the  Government  wins,  I say that the people agree  with  the  Government's

arguments  but  if the Government loses, then the Government should  accept  the

Opposition stand. Sir, there are no personal feelings or rancour in this  offer.

I  am  not  acting without due consideration and without realising  my  responsi

bilities  as an Assemblyman of this House. However, on clause 5 hinges the  fate

and the destiny of our political and constitutional future and, therefore, it is

important  that  the  people must give their verdict before  we  press  on.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, the destiny of the country is at stake and it all hinges on clause

5 and clause 29. I ask the Government, why not let the free and true will of the

people he the judge of the undemocratic clauses in the Referendum Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, one outstanding feature of today's debate is that after the Opposition  has

put  up  so many meritorious arguments to back up their stand on this amendment,

the  Government has said nothing and made no reply whatsoever to  these  various

arguments. All we have heard from the Government is a heap of abuse and a lot of

frivolous talk about the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister who spoke yesterday spoke in the most lighthearted vein. The Minister for Finance who spoke today spoke with his usual cheekiness,

heaping insults and sometimes talking nonsense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall not belabour this House by repeating the various valid,

meritorious  and sensible arguments to people who have schizoid  tendencies  and

who are unable to see arguments and to listen to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 234</b></font><br><br>



them, but who have already made up their minds that they are right and everybody

else is wrong. The schizoid tendency of certain people in Government is all  too

well-known.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. May I have that word again? I do not know whether it is

parliamentary or unparliamentary?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> 'Schizoid', Mr

Speaker,  Sir  - S-c-h-i-z-o-i-d. I am afraid it is a medical term, describing  certain

mental illness in which the patient is unable to listen to reason.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Just like the case of the Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> More like the Minister for Law.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Probably it is more like most Members of this Assembly,

including the Speaker. I do not know.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said throughout this debate,

only  two  Front Benches have spoken, and neither one of them has  seen  fit  to

answer the arguments put up by the Opposition. Dr Goh Keng Swee -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Minister for Finance.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was just paying heed and attention to a

circular which, I believe, was circulated by the Clerk.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Perhaps the Member is suffering from schizoid. I just

called the Member up for calling a Member of this House by his name, instead  of

saying the Minister for Finance.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with due respect, I might refer you to the

circular which I find some difficulty in understanding. Part II of your circular

says  that  in  Committee  of the whole Assembly and in Select  Committees,  the

Speaker  is  to  be  referred to as Mr Speaker, the Deputy  Speaker  is  to  be

referred  to  by name, i.e., "Mr Mammen", and any other Member by  name,  i.e.,

"Mr . . . ".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 235</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Member is probably suffering from schizoid. If he

looks  at  the heading of that letter it is "Form of addressing the Chair,"  and

any  other Member might possibly be in this Chair. If the Deputy Speaker happens

to be away, this Assembly elects a Member to the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance in his speech

just now spent more than half



of  the time heaping abuse and the other half of the time talking of things hypo

thetical and unrelated to the issues that we are faced with today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Minister of Finance, he says that the amendment was put in

for  two purposes. The first is that the Opposition hopes that by this amendment

to  limit  or  restrict the Government on its questions in the  referendum,  and

thereby  to frustrate the P.A.P. Command Paper No. 33 type of merger.  Secondly,

he says that even if this amendment was accepted and approved by this House, the

Government would still be able to rig a referendum because he quoted that  under

the  new circumstances - the circumstances in which the amendment applies - it would

be  possible for the Government to pose a question thus: "Do you prefer complete

merger or Command Paper No. 33 P.A.P. type of merger?"



<br><br>7.52 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Deputy SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, Sir, this kind of attitude reflects only the machiavellian machina

tions behind the brain of the Minister for Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we all understand that a referendum is a procedure

for  the  ascertainment of the views of the people - the electorate - on matters  of

national  importance. Now, we see very clearly that, insofar as  the  P.A.P. is

concerned, a referendum is not for the purpose of ascertaining the views of  the

people but to sustain them in office and for that they are even prepared  to  go

to  the  extent  of spending $400,000 on a referendum just for  the  purpose  of

having one over the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column : 236</b></font><br><br>



electorate  by  posing a question in which the electorate has  Hobson's  choice.

That was the Minister for Finance. He thought he was clever, but I think that is

more machiavellian machination than cleverness, that to have one over the people

for  the  purpose of sustaining one's own political longevity is  certainly  not

clever. It is either abusing or cheating. He then went on to quote at length the

words  of  the Member for Anson. He said that the Opposition stand was  that  we

were  prepared  to  accept  complete merger and in his usual  machiavellian  and

cunning  way  he  distorts complete merger as something akin to the  Malacca  or

Penang type of merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think our stand on the matter has been very clearly

put  up by the Member for Anson who has gone to great lengths to quote the  full

part  of  our stand, that is, insofar as we are concerned, complete  merger  can

mean  only one thing - the genuine reunification of the territories and the people

resulting  in  automatic  conversion in citizenship  and  in  Singapore  getting

proportional representation in the Federal Parliament. The Minister for  Finance

keeps  on harping on his theme that we can get only what the other eleven States

got.  But  the  Prime Minister himself at the Radio Forum,  during  one  of  the

moments  when  he thought he was clever, stated that the various States  of  the

Federation of Malaya got into the Federation at different levels. For  instance,

he  said  that Pahang got in on better terms than Johore and Johore  got  in  on

better  terms  than Penang or Malacca. And all this business of  getting  in  on

different  terms  or  better terms took place before  Merdeka  Day.  The  proper

provision  of  the  Federation  Constitution that  should  apply  would  be  the

provision  for these various States to get in before Merdeka. But, Sir,  we  are

not  now  near  Merdeka  Day. We are, in fact, more than five  years  away  from

Merdeka Day, and therefore any new State that should get into the Federation  of

Malaya  must get in under the provisions of the section of the Constitution  which  provides for the admission of new States, that particular section  in  the

Federal Constitution that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>



permits  negotiations to be made between the various parties  on  the  terms  of

merger.  We  are  not asking very much, Sir. We are asking  only  for  the  safe

guarding  of the democratic and political rights of the people of Singapore  who

have  already acquired them. There is no reason why they should be lost or given

up; not even for saving the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is really no merit in the arguments put up by the Minister for Finance.

If  the Minister for Finance is sincere, let him put up the stand of the Barisan

in  the  referendum. Let him not just put up something which  he  has  not  even

discussed,  nor a White Paper produced, nor a full debate taken  place  in  this

House, if he is really going to be sincere about giving the people a choice, and

not  Hobson's choice, it is for him to debate the Barisan stand and the  Barisan

merger in this House fully, so that in the process of that debate the people  of

Singapore  will  understand  the implications of  the  Barisan  stand,  and  subsequently  will  be persuaded by the Barisan Sosialis that the Barisan  Sosialis

stand is the correct stand and then they will vote for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister in his speech yesterday also did not touch upon the various arguments put forward by the Opposition. He only harped on one

point - that the Referendum Bill is a general Referendum Bill and therefore it  is

ridiculous  to restrict the Government to one question. First I will  deal  with

this aspect of his argument. It is my contention, Sir, that a referendum is only

held  when there is a matter of national importance. Only a feebleminded Cabinet

would  actually hold a referendum at the cost of $400,000 of public money simply

for  the ascertainment of whether one should smoke a cigarette or a pipe. If the

P.A.P.  Government did that, it would be an indication, not only of  the  P.A.P.

leadership's  political  bankruptcy,  but  also  of  its  feeble-mindedness  and

senility, a sure indication that it is better off in the grave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, the Deputy Prime Minister, in trying to justify himself that the Assembly should not limit or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



restrict  the  Government in the posing of questions in the  referendum,  spoke

lightly  and  in  a light vein, and quoted, for example, that  if  we  were  all

thirsty -   and  he suddenly became kindhearted and offered us a drink - what  drink

would we have? Granted if the bona fides of the Deputy Prime Minister were good,

if  he  had offered me that drink in his private and personal capacity, I  would

certainly accept it from him. But, Sir, that premise cannot hold for the  P.A.P.

The  bona  fides of the P.A.P. are no good. The intention of the  P.A.P. is  no

good.  How  can the people accept a drink from a Government whom they know  will

most certainly serve them poison? Even if they are thirsty, it is better to  die

of thirst, because it takes longer to die of thirst, and in the period of dying,

rain  might always come, than to die by poison, when one goes off like a  light.

And that is what the P.A.P. leadership has in mind for the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest, Sir, even if the P.A.P. insists upon calling this Bill, the

Singapore  National Referendum Bill, a general Bill, and to make  provisions  so

that  the Bill becomes not unnecessarily restrictive, it should still allow  the

voters  a choice. Even if the Deputy Prime Minister was good and honest  in  his

intentions, when he offered Coca Cola, or Pepsi Cola or Green Spot - Mr Mammen, I

am  just  quoting these various trade names out of convenience. I  by  no  means

indicate  that I own any shares in them. Even if the Deputy Prime  Minister  had

good  intentions to offer thirsty people drinks like that, surely he should have

the same good intentions to allow people to say "no". People may be allergic  to

Coca cola, people may be allergic to Pepsi Cola, and if the range of drinks that

is  offered is unlimited, then, perhaps, one can insist on a definite "yes". But

the  P.A.P.'s offer is limited. It is limited down to two choices - the devil  and

the deep sea. Under those circumstances clause 29, which permits blank votes and

uncertain votes to be in favour of the Government, will surely bring in  a  neat

profit for the Government - a big crop of abstaining votes, because no man would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



choose the devil or the deep sea, when the alternative to live in prosperity and

happiness is there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since none of the other Ministers have spoken yet, it is not possible for me

to  remark on their exceptional performances in this House. But I notice,  when

the  Member for Thomson was speaking earlier, the Minister for Health  and  Law

interrupted to say that when he advised the people of Singapore not  to  go  to

the  poll  in  order  to show disgust for the P.A.P., it was  something  legal. Perhaps  it may be considered legal in so far as income tax avoidance is  legal

and  income tax evasion is illegal. But then the Minister for Heath and Law had

much  deeper implications when he gave that advice. I will only refer  to  this

in  passing, Sir. Clause 21 subclause (8) provides that anybody who has  failed

to  vote  and  who, under subclause (7) is unable to give satisfactory  reason

for  his  failure to go to the poll will have his name struck off the list  and

his  name  will only reappear in the revised version of the electoral  roll.  I

know  what  the Minister for Health and Law is thinking about. He  is  thinking

that  should the Barisan Sosialis advise the people to do such a thing, in  one

fell  stroke  he  would be able to get the Barisan supporters and  perhaps  the Barisan  candidates off the electoral roll and refuse to revise  the  electoral

roll,  as  we  have seen in Hong Lim and then subsequently having  an  election

with  the  Barisan Sosialis members and supporters on the electoral  roil.  The Minister for Health and Law sometimes exhibits shrewdness. Perhaps it  may  not

be  shrewdness really on his part. Perhaps he was sincere when he  cracked  the

joke.  Perhaps  he has not thought about this matter that the Barisan  Sosialis

can  be  fixed legally in a way like this. Now I think he understands. And  now

he knows -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> What a clever man!



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> - that these

things can be done. He knows also that the Barisan will not fall into that trap.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, in so far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we

are quite prepared to accept the Government's posing of two questions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



in  the referendum, provided the first question reflects the Government's merger

proposals  and  the  second  question reflects the  Barisan  Sosialis'  and  the

Workers'  Party's merger proposals, which have been quoted so often that  it  is

unnecessary for me to quote them in full. The essence of our stand is  that  all

our  citizens must have their citizenship automatically converted and that there

must be proportional representation in Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government is prepared to accept that, we are prepared to go to the

masses and to persuade them that our stand is the correct stand and that, having

accepted  that, we would want to have a general election so that the people  can

choose afresh a new Party to represent them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Bill before the House is the

National  Referendum Bill which has been presented to the House for the  purpose

of a referendum on merger. Naturally, if it is a Bill for a number of referenda,

the  provisions  should, as far as possible, be for general application,  and  I

therefore  rise  to  oppose the amendment proposed by  the  Members  for  Anson,

Queenstown and Hong Lim whereby they propose the insertion of a new paragraph to

clause 5 of the Bill to limit the question that is to be put to electors in  the

referendum to just one single question so that the answers may be just a yes  or

a no.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we concede that the Opposition Members as represented by the Barisan

Sosialis,  the  Workers'  Party  and  the United  People's  Party,  have  quoted

precedents  of  referenda held in various countries where  there  was  just  one

question  that was put to the people. But that does not necessarily  imply  that

every  referendum should be with one single question. We have, in fact,  on  the

Government  side quoted good precedents of countries where referenda  have  been

held  in  which more than one question was put to the electorate in the case  of

New  Zealand and more especially in the case of Newfoundland and the  Cameroons,

the last of which was, in fact, conducted by an impartial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



world  organisation - the United Nations. My colleague, the Minister for  Finance,

has  very  ably drawn the attention of this House to the fact that in connection

with  the  proposed referendum which we shall taco in Singapore  there  are  two

cases:

that  is, the referenda held in Newfoundland and in the Cameroons, in these  two

eases, the issues were similar to the issue which we face - that of merger of one

country  with  another.  Therefore, Sir, it  is  possible  to  pose  alternative

questions for: the people to decide which they would prefer - A or B, or even C

or  D.  There is no necessity for the Government to tie its hands. In  case  the

issue that is to be decided at the referendum requires one question, so shall it

be  posed. But where it may be necessary to put more than one question, then  it

is up to the Government to put two or more questions to the electorate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the last Member who spoke in this House, the Member for Nee Soon,

argued against himself. The amendment wants to limit the referendum to just  one

question. What the Barisan Sosialis, the Workers' Party and the United  People's

Party  object  to  is  the possibility of the Government posing  more  than  one

question and the second question would put them in a spot. Before the Member for

Nee  Soon  sat down, he said the Barisan Sosialis would be quite happy  to  have

more  than one question, provided the second question would be framed in  accord

ance  with  their  wishes. So the amendment before this House  was  put  forward

because they were afraid that the Government would put the second alternative to

the  people  where  merger is concerned. Their case for one  question  therefore

falls  flat.  They will be quite happy to have the second question  put  in  the

referendum,  but it should be framed in accordance with their wishes.  Now  that

the Government will not do.



<br><br>8.15 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, the statements made by the Workers' Party as represented by the

Member  for  Anson,  the  statements made by the Member for  Queenstown  as  the

Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis and again by the Member for Thomson -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



when  they mentioned the two unacceptable alternatives that would be put to  the

people - revealed the true character of this amendment. All this while,  Sir, the

discussion has centred on the fact that when this Referendum Bill is passed, the

first  referendum to be held in Singapore would be on merger. The first question

would  be  in  respect of the motion on the White Paper passed by this  Assembly

nem. con.  with  Members of the Workers' Party, the Barisan  Sosialis  and  the

United  People's Party not having the courage to vote against the motion and  to

vote  against merger, but by taking the coward's way out, by walking out of  the

Chamber.  The White Paper on merger, Cmd. Paper No. 33 of 1961, will  be  placed

before  the  electorate. Assuming that these proposals are unacceptable  to  the

Barisan  Sosialis, the Workers' Party and the United People's  Party,  the  next

question  which  we want to put would be that of complete merger,  unconditional

merger,  merger  where Singapore would be a member of the  Federation  on  equal

terms,  like any one of the other 11 States - no more and no less - with no autonomy

for  education  and  labour, and where one half of Singapore citizens  would  be

disfranchised  because they were not born in Singapore and they would  therefore

have  to  reapply  before they can hope to be registered as  citizens,  if  they

qualify.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, however much the Barisan Sosialis may say till they are blue in the face,

that  was what they wanted and although for this amendment, the Barisan Sosialis

have  the Workers' Party on the left and the United People's Party on the right,

both  their  representatives at the radio forum told the Barisan Sosialis  where

the fatal mistake was and that it should have been withdrawn. But no, the P.A.P.

will  put  that to the people, and that is what the Barisan Sosialis stood  for,

till they realised the catastrophic mistake made. That is why they fear question

No.  2.  We  shall not change question No. 2 to be of the type that the  Barisan

Sosialis would like to have worded in the referendum paper.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon):</b> You want to twist.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> We do not twist, but we put you on the spot because we want

you  to  stand by what you have said. And this is where it is most revealing - the

Member  for  Queenstown, before he sat down yesterday, said, "the two  questions

that would be posed to the people" (mind you, the people) should really read  as

"the two questions that would be posed would amount to death and hanging not  to

the  people or to anyone but to the Barisan Sosialis." The Member for  Nee  Soon

used  another terminology "to choose between the devil and the deep  sea".  Yes,

the  White  Paper on merger would be the "death and the devil" for  the  Barisan

Sosialis. The question on complete merger would be hanging and the deep sea  for

the  Barisan  Sosialis and not for the people and the citizens of Singapore.  So

the  Barisan  Sosialis have revealed their true nature - how the  White  Paper  on

merger  would  mean  death and the devil to the Barisan Sosialis,  and  how  the

question for a complete merger, when put in the referendum paper, would  be  the

hanging of the Barisan Sosialis and the deep blue sea for them to drown in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, I say that the amendment proposed holds no water; that, in

fact, they have argued against themselves, and that the purpose of the amendment

is  a  mischievous one in order that the merger issue will be confused. We  only

say  that  the true stand of the Barisan Sosialis has always been "not  merger".

All they want is a continuation of colonial rule under the British with internal

self-government.  And if the Member for Choa Chu Kang does not  know  what  that

means,  it  means  being colonial subjects, proud to be under  the  British  but

ashamed  to  be independent and free Malayans. But they loudly claim  toat  they

accept merger in principle, Malaysia in principle, everything in principle.  But

behind the facade, all that they are interested in is to destroy the people  and

the  country. It is useless for the Barisan Sosialis to pretend that they  stand

for  merger and reunification, when their heartland is in Indonesia. The  Member

for  Thomson  opened his big wide mouth and has been rapped. Supporters  of  the

Barisan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



Sosialis are now quivering. We hear very little about Indonesia these days, and

the inspiration that is not producing results for the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has said, the day of reckoning

is  close, and we shall put to the people the issues that are clear before them,

and it is a foregone conclusion that the people will know what is good for them,

instead  of listening to a tirade of lies, distortions and perfidy committed  in

the name of parliamentary democracy. And all that the Barisan Sosialis stand for

is just the opposite of democracy.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy):</b> Sir, I rise to oppose the amendment before the House. Before I speak on the

amendment, I wish to say a few words in reply to the inference which the  Member

for  Pasir  Panjang  drew  yesterday. Let me quote from the  unrevised  verbatim

report of yesterday's proceedings [Hansard Vol. 18, No. 1]:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They have clearly shown -'



<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> I beg your pardon. Which page is that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> At page 48, 4th line of the Member's speech [col. 67]:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They have clearly shown that if this House does not abide by the practice of

parliamentary   democracy,  then  it  would  mean  the  death  of  parliamentary

democracy.  From the debate up to now, we have only heard one of the  Government

Members - only one.'



<br><br>What  is the inference, Sir, that all the Government Backbenchers had kept quiet

and did not speak in this House?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment we were debating yesterday was more of a constitutional nature,

and a lot of legal problems were involved. We heard what eminent lawyers in this

House  had to say about the amendment. Even well-known lawyers who spoke on  the

amendment  appeared to know less than the Member for Cairnhill who is a  layman.

In that debate we naturally did not want to poke our noses in and utter nonsense

and repetitions, as the Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen did. As the Speaker himself

said yesterday, parliamentary democracy does not mean that each and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



every  Member of this House must speak and particularly repeat the same argument

over and over again to all the Members of this House and bore and waste the time

of the House. That is for the allegation from the Member for Pasir Panjang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to come to the present amendment. As the Member for Anson has said, in

moving the amendment, there are three points. One is: not more than one question

should be asked -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker thereupon left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair

of the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen):</b> I suspend this sitting until half-past nine.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended</i></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate in Committee resumed.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5-(contd.)



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on amendment (ii) to clause 5; that is, an amendment to add

a new sub-clause (3) as appears in the Order Paper Supplement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the words proposed to be added, be there added."



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Mr Chairman, just now I was saying that the amendment dealt

with three points. The first point is that not more than one question should  be

asked.  Second, not more than one issue should be put to the electorate.  Third,

the electorate should be required to say "Yes" or "No" to the question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first point, Sir, it has been said by Members of the Barisan Sosialis

and  the  Member  for  Anson that the only internationally  accepted  method  of

ascertaining  the views of the people is to ask only one question.  They  quoted

examples from the Jamaican referendum, the Australian referendum and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



referenda held in Switzerland, France and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was what the Member for

Anson said on the 8th May in the Select

Committee, [Official Report No. 3, col. 113]:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, in so far as I have been able to ascertain, there is no country that I

know  of which does not, in fact, require that the issues in a referendum should

be  formed  in  a  single  question  containing  a  single  issue  requiring  an

affirmative yes or no.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Select Committee, the Minister for Health and Law quoted instances

where  more  than one question had been asked. For the record, I would  like  to

quote  the  Licensing (Amendment) Act of 1948 of New Zealand,  under  which  the

referendum  was held on the question of the hours for the sale of  liquor.  That

was  sometime  in  1949. In that referendum, about four or five  questions  were

asked.  There  are  a  few more instances, but to the knowledge  of  the  Select

Committee,  these  instances may be and actually had been considered  to  be  on

subjects  of  lesser importance. But let us take the case of Newfoundland  where

they had a similar problem such as ours, that is, a constitutional problem. This

precedent is more appropriate for our purpose. There were three questions  which

were posed for that

Referendum:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Do we wish to continue as we were in a Colony?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Do we wish the Colonial Government to be restored?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Do you wish to join the Canadian Confederation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one more instance of a referendum held in the French Cameroons.

There  were two ballot boxes - one box for those who wish to join Algiers and  the

other  box  for  those  who  wish to join the French  Cameroons.  There  was  no

provision  for  saying  "No"  to  any of these proposals.  The  only  thing  the

electorate could have done was not to have gone to the polls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we had discussed in the Select Committee a possible question

in  a  referendum  about the Malay language becoming the official  language.  In

fact, there will be no one who will oppose the national language becoming



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>



the official language. But there may be different views as to when to make Malay

the  official language. There may be some people who will hold the view that  we

should make Malay the official language within five years. Some other people may

say  within  7  years,  yet some others may say within  10  years.  If  we  have

different  opinions as to when to make Malay the official language, how  are  we

going  to  ascertain the views of the people, if we are going to pose  only  one

question? That is the difficulty, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, that this question was put to the witnesses in the

Select Committee. When it was put to the P.M.I.P. representatives they said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It was you who posed the -'

It  was  you, Mr Speaker, Sir, who elaborated on the question put by the Member

for Anson or by the Minister. In reply to that question, they said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As I know, Sir, the question will have to be debated at great length in the

Legislative

Assembly.  And  the question will be so framed that the answer to  the  question

will have to be either "Yes" or "No".'

<br><br>Let us assume that the Legislative Assembly arrived at a decision that it should

be  five  years. Then this decision is put to the electorate who  are  asked  to

state  whether they support it. Will we get the actual views of the people,  and

if we get an answer 'no', does it mean that the people do not want to make Malay

the official language?

pertinent?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I suppose it is

his opinion. He might be wrong. It is up to the Member -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> He

is usually

wrong.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Assembly is getting a bit disorderly. I am sure either

the  Minister for Finance or the Minister for Law can indicate how he  has  gone

wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Whatever examples the Member for Anson might have, it does not

preclude  me  from quoting whatever examples I deem fit, Sir, I do not  want  to

repeat the arguments over and over again. Sir, I only wish to touch on the point

that the electorate should be required to answer the question with a simple  yes

or no.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our view is this. You will see the point that if there is

going  to be only one question, there must be art affirmative yes or no to  that

question. There are precedents which have been quoted by the Opposition  Members

but  where  there are two or more questions posed to the electorate, as  in  the

case  of  Newfoundland and the Cameroons, it is essential that there  should  be

only  one  affirmative  reply. We have to get the  electors  to  indicate  their

choice. If there are three questions, they can strike out two and there is  only

one  answer.  If  there are five or more questions, or six questions,  they  can

leave  one  question  and  strike out all the others. All  the  precedents  also

establish this point. Then how can the Opposition, that is the Barisan  Sosialis

and the Member for Anson, accuse us that we are undemocratic?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And the U.P.P. And the S.P.A.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> And the Lib-Socs.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> There is also another aspect of the argument. If two or more

questions  are posed, you are given a choice to say no to any question.  As  the

Member  for Anson has asked me to refer to the merger problem, we will take  the

merger referendum. We pose both the proposals - the White Paper proposals and  the

proposal  of complete merger. If you do not like the White Paper proposals,  you

can  say  no and strike it out and vote for the complete merger. If you  do  not

like  complete merger, say no to the complete merger and accept the White  Paper

proposals. I would say in the current merger referendum what is going to be done

is  not the ascertainment of principle on merger because nobody has said he does

not  want merger. Nobody has opposed merger. Everybody has said that he  accepts

the principle of merger. Then the referendum is going to be on the ascertainment

of  the mode and manner or, in other words, the details of merger. Therefore, as

we  have  to  ascertain the views of the people on the mode and manner  of, the

reunification  of both territories, we have no other alternative  than  to  pose

more  than one question to the electorate and it is for the electorate to choose

between  the  alternatives put before them. If they  do  not  like  one  of  the

proposals, as I have said, they can strike it out and vote for the other one.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, a few moments ago two Ministers from the Government side rose to  speak against the amendment moved by this side of the House. After listening

to the Minister for Education. I have the feeling that whatever he has said does

not  merit any reply because what he has said can be described by one proverb - he

was just picking up what was said by others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance seems to represent the Government when he made an important speech on the amendment we moved. However, his arguments are very

strange, and I cannot in any way agree with any one of them. Now, I want



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



to lock from several angles at the inaccurate and wrong arguments put forward by

the  Minister for Finance in relation to the amendment that has been  moved.  In

the  first place, our contention to have only one question during the referendum

had been very clearly explained by the Member for Anson with regard to its legal

aspect.  He  quoted examples of referenda held in various Countries.  Our  Party

Chairman  has  also pointed out many points and given several examples  to  show

that  the  National  Referendum Bill put forward by the Government  is  actually

intended for the matter relating to merger between Singapore and Malaya.  A  few

moments  ago  the  Member for Hong Lim pointed out very  clearly  and  correctly

certain  examples and legal points and arguments to show that  if  the  National

Referendum does not pose one question only, but instead poses several questions,

then  there  will be the possibility that the Government will take advantage  of

the multiple questions to manipulate the referendum, so that it will not achieve

the  objectives of finding out the actual views of the electorate as to  whether

or not they agree with the policy of the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point that I wish to stress, and that is our contention that we

should  have  only one question. This contention is being made now  because  the

Government  has all along been trying to distort the stand of the Opposition  on

the  matter of merger. From the speech of the Minister for Finance, we  come  to

know  that the Government has not much confidence in its own White Paper merger.

No  matter how much publicity the Government gives and how much propaganda  work

it  carries out regarding its form of merger, or however much it says about  the

merger, or however well it speaks of its merger proposals as being able to bring

an  independent status, the status of Federal national, Malaysian passports, and

autonomy  in Education and Labour for the people of Singapore, I would  like  to

point  out  that, if there are actually so many good points about its proposals,

how  is it that it does not have the guts and courage to frame a simple question

on this matter and put





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>



it to the people for their decision? The Minister for Finance talks about posing

the  question of complete merger as another alternative for the decision of  the

people.  This  goes  to  show that the P.A.P. know  full  well  that  their  own

constitutional  arrangements are unacceptable to anybody  and,  therefore,  they

want  to  find  a way out from their present predicament, and that  is  why  the

Minister  for Finance has brought up the matter regarding the posing of complete

merger  as a question for the decision of the people. Mr Speaker, Sir, on  this

point,  I  must  reiterate and stress again and again that we  are  against  the

second alternative to be put to the people for a decision, because in the  first

place, the posing of the so-called second alternative is not in keeping with the

principle. All along we have been pointing out that the matter of merger is  not

a  question  of  party struggle. It is not a matter of controversy  between  two

Parties or any number of Parties. We have also pointed out that this question of

merger  should  not  be one which should be fought between the  P.A.P. and  the

Barisan  or any other Party. The main point is: are the constitutional proposals

in  keeping with the interests of all the people of Singapore? That is the  crux

of the whole matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government wish to pose to the people the stand and contention of the

Barisan  Sosialis,  then the P.A.P. are treating the merger  issue  as  a  party

issue.  It is wrong in principle. If we were in the Government dealing with  the

merger  matter,  we would not be afraid to put our stand and contention  to  the

people  for  their endorsement or rejection. That is a very important principle.

The  Government does not have the courage to put to the people its own  proposal

and  find out from them whether they want it or not. It would be wrong  for  the

Government  to  put several questions to confuse the people. We  are  very  much

against this behaviour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has said that since the Barisan Sosialis want complete merger the question of complete merger could be posed to the people for

their decision. There is nothing wrong about it, he says. What I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



would  like to emphasise here regarding this point is that the matter  regarding

complete  merger,  as  put  forward by the Minister  for  Finance,  is  entirely

different from the complete merger we have in our own minds. He tries to explain

that the complete merger we have in mind will mean that some 324,000 citizens in

Singapore will lose their citizenship rights after complete merger. He  explains

that  our contention for compete merger will mean that we are prepared to accept

the  education  and  labour  policies  of  the  Federation  Government.  Such  a

distortion  of the stand of the Barisan Sosialis is an example of the  behaviour

of  the P.A.P. which is well-known to everybody. According to our definition,  I

would  like  to  read  a  few passages from an article of the  Barisan  Sosialis

regarding the meaning of complete merger.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member

should not go into too much detail because the Member for Queenstown in fact has

given notice of a motion alleging that the stand of the Opposition in so far  as

the  merger  problem is concerned has been distorted. Therefore, I have  allowed

passing reference to these matters, but not a detailed debate on them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, the quotation I am going to make here is taken from a  speech

which  has not been made use of by the Chairman of our Party. This passage  will

show  to the people clearly that the complete merger we are advocating does  not

mean  that  we  accept  the  labour and education  policies  of  the  Federation

Government.  This is not a new line. This article was published on the  28th  of

August,  1961, in a booklet containing a statement on merger. Apart from dealing

with  the question of citizenship and proportionate representation we point  out

in  this article, as a matter of fact, that the present Right-wing Government in

the  Federation has many policies which are unacceptable to us. This  Government

has  very close relationship and association with foreign capitalists and it has

signed an agreement with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



British  Government  whereby  our countries will  have  bases  for  the  British

military forces. This agreement in foreign affairs will try to alienate us  from

the other Afro-Asian countries.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I cannot see for the life of me how this is relevant to

what  we are debating. I have indicated that in passing there can be denials  of

the  interpretation of what the merger ideas of the Barisan Sosialis are, and  I

have  also  indicated that the Member will have an opportunity, when  the  right

time comes - when his own Party's motion is put before the House - to bring in  all

these details. Let us come back to the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker. Sir, if the Minister for Finance has not brought out his arguments

regarding the stand of the Barisan Sosialis and suggest that our stand  will  be

put as an alternative, then I will agree that the quotation I am making will  be

unnecessary, but since the Minister for Finance himself has said that  he  would

put  to the people our complete merger stand which he has tried to distort, then

I  would like to have your permission to take about two minutes to clear up this

point regarding the definition of our complete merger concept. I would like  you

to  give  me some time to read another two sentences and then you will know  the

whole position and realise how the P.A.P. has distorted our stand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our statement points out:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In the meantime, the Federation Government is carrying out a wrong education

policy.  In  spite of this, because of our stand on merger, we are  prepared  to

accept  and  face  difficulties. We will join hands with the Socialists  of  the

Federation to establish a strong alliance of workers, intellectuals and  farmers

and defeat all reactionary forces in the general election.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, from this quotation we can see that when we advocate complete merger it does not mean that we will accept every policy of the Federation

Government, it does riot mean that we will give up the struggle against  the  un

reasonable policies of the Federation Government. But what is the stand  of  the

P.A.P.?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out specially that the Government has not only tried to

distort our views on this point in various ways but it has also tried to whip up

communal feelings to bring fear into the people so that they would not think  of

having a genuine merger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are prepared to allow the Government to bring their own merger proposals

before  the  people for a decision. The P.A.P. are against their own words  when

they say they wish to have a reunification of Singapore and Malaya and to have a

socialist  nation. The P.A.P. have gone against their words and  the  principles

for which they stand for. They have even tried to stress the communal and racial

discrimination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since you do not read the Chinese newspapers, I would like to make a quotation

from a certain Chinese newspaper to acquaint you of a certain fact. This fact is

in  regard to merger. The P.A.P. are trying to frighten the people in such a way

that  they  would  be  afraid to have complete merger in  the  true  sense.  The

Government Press releases are usually published in the Malay Press, the  Chinese

Press  and  the  English  Press. But we have discovered  that  recently  certain

statements  on  merger issued by the Political Bureau of  the  P.A.P. are  only

published  in  the Chinese newspapers. They are not published in the  papers  of

other languages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will quote a passage which is not very long. It is taken from a statement

published  in the Nanyang Siang Pau and the Sin Chew Jit Poh of the 24th  June,

1962. The statement says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We want to ask the Barisan Sosialis to answer openly and publicly as to

whether  they  accept the policies regarding giving special  privileges  to  the

Malays in Singapore as what the Federation of Malaya is doing.'

<br><br>They  also  asked  us in this statement whether we are prepared  to  accept  the

position where Chinese students should answer in public examinations in  English

or Malay. They also asked us whether we are prepared to accept the ratio of 4 to

1 in the recruitment to the Civil Service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, the Government has all along tried to distort our stand on merger. At the same time it has also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>

tried to whip up communal feelings. So we say that  if  the

Government  is  allowed  to pose the complete merger question  in  the  national

referendum, it will be a very unfair way of doing things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the distortion and threat of the Government, we in the Opposition

have also been subjected to certain restrictions in our propaganda work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, let me tell you that whenever the Barisan Sosialis apply for permission to hold a mass rally we are always confronted with many unreasonable

provisions and regulations.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Where the Opposition

are asking for the insertion of a clause saying there should be one question and

reply in the affirmative or the negative

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- all these details are completely irrelevant. It can always be mentioned at the

right time and at the right moment. Let us get on with this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

I find it necessary to make you understand that if we are given adequate freedom

to  explain  our stand on merger to the people, then we will not  be  afraid  to

allow  the  Government to pose our stand to the people for  their  decision  and

judgment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, the Ministers opposite claim that they are very democratic. But I will ask your permission to tell you the restrictions we have had to face

concerning our application for the holding of mass rallies. When we -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, it seems to me that the hon. Member is anticipating the

motion of the Member for Queenstown, namely,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That this House condemns the Government for its dishonest and malicious

distortion  of  the  Opposition stand on the merger issue whereby  it  seeks  to

mislead and confuse the people in the forthcoming referendum.'



<br><br>Now, that has been anticipated time and time again. I have pulled the Member  up

for that. He is now going on a different tack which, to me, again appears to  be

irrelevant to the issue. I cannot see how it is relevant to the issue.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, as a matter of fact, I do not wish to talk too much about this

aspect of the matter. I am now going to talk on another aspect. The second  part

of our amendment says that the people when faced with the choice should have the

right to say 'yes' or 'no'. We know that if the National Referendum Bill is  now

being  condemned  by  the entire people of Singapore, it is  because  there  are

provisions relating to the blank and uncertain votes. I would like to point  out

to you. Mr Speaker, Sir, that if the Government allows the people to have their

basic  right to negate a certain issue, in other words, if the Government allows

the  people to say 'no', then there should not have been so many blank votes  in

any national referendum, and so this question of taking blank votes as votes  in

support  of  the Government will not be embodied in the provisions contained  in

this  Bill. Then it will also be unnecessary for the Government to have a clause

regarding the penalty to be imposed on those who deface ballot papers.  I  would

like  to point out that it is in this particular clause that the Government does

not  allow the people to say 'no'. That is why the Government finds it necessary

to  make  certain provisions such as clause 29 regarding blank  papers  and  the

severe  penalties  to be imposed on people who happen to deface  ballot  papers.

Such  provisions have made this Bill a laughing stock of the whole world because

it does not allow the people so say 'no'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government says that to pose two questions to the people

will  enable the people to make a choice, but this is not actually a choice.  If

you  want to buy a thing and if you are faced with two things which you  do  not

wish to buy, then you go to another shop and find something which will suit you.

It  is  only  when you have this right that you can say you have  a  freedom  of

choice - [Interruption in Mandarin]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The unfortunate part of it is that I cannot understand the

interruption. It does not seem to be offensive, but it is a bit disorderly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, the Political Secretary to the Prime Minister, Mr  Jek  Yuen

Thong, says that the P.A.P. wants the people to make a choice between the  White

Paper  company and the complete merger company. This example is not  appropriate

at  all. For example, we have the Housing and Development Board which has  built

many flats for selection by applicants. Now, the applicants can refuse the offer

of  flats and the right to refuse to make a choice is actually the right to have

a  choice. Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Government wants to deprive the basic  right

of  the  people  to say "no", then to say that such behaviour is  democratic  is

actually  improper. I would like to quote the speech made by the Prime  Minister

in  1955  in  the Kreta Ayer Constituency. He said that this type  of  democracy

should be given to the dog for consumption.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Member  for Anson in his speech before the dinner break  paid  me  an

exchange of compliments and posed to me certain questions, because he felt  that

there  was justification in my criticism of the one-question amendment  proposed

by  him  and  that  he would be interested to know whether we have  changed  our

stand.  We,  Sir, in this Party do not change stands now and then. We  have  one

stand and that stand is always firm. It is firm to this extent and we would  ask

the  Parties  represented in this Assembly to always bear  in  mind  that  in  a

national  issue of this great importance, they should sink political differences

and try to find out a solution for the best interest of the people of Singapore.

The  Member  for Upper Serangoon quite rightly said that this merger  referendum

should  not be a question for party struggle between the P.A.P. and the  Barisan

and the ex-P.A.P., and it should not be right and proper that the question to be

posed  should  only  be  the P.A.P. White Paper and the Barisan's  proposal  for

merger. I would not like to say what it was, but they have denounced and  denied

that they have ever made such a proposition, although we, as an independent  and

responsible Opposition, must say that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>



we  have read in the Press, a statement issued by the Secretary-General  of  the

Barisan Sosialis on what their stand was at the time when this merger issue  was

very,  very hot. The Member for Anson asked whether I do not consider  it  right

that  the people should have the right to reject any proposition put forward  by

the  Government, the right to reject Command Paper 33. I say there should be  an

inherent  right. There should be the right to say, "I do not like Paper  Command 33."



<br><br>10.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then let us treat this merger referendum that is tabled today calmly and

soberly  and  not  allow  our minds to be poisoned  by  all  the  intrigues  and

distortions  that  have been indulged in by the P.A.P. and  the  ex-P.A.P.,  the

Barisan Sosialis, both of whom have graduated from the same school of the art of

distortion. Let us treat this merger referendum in a manner that is befitting of

men elected by the people of Singapore to represent the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you ask me this one question. If this one question of the White Paper is

posed to the people, and if they reject it, would it be voluntary or compulsory?

I  have this to say. I said in my speech earlier this afternoon that it would be

voluntary. He knows, we know and everybody on this side knows and the people  of

Singapore  know, except the P.A.P. who refuse to admit that such is  the  state,

anything  that the P.A.P. Government does will not be accepted by the people  of

Singapore. If you pose that question as one question to the people of Singapore,

they  will  cast a "no" - an emphatic "no" - not because they do not  want  closer

association with the Federation of Malaya but because they want to see  the  end

of P.A.P. misrule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the merger referendum would be defeated to the extent that the

answer given by the electorate given on that one question, one issue, referendum



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>



would  not disclose whether or not the people of Singapore want merger. We  know

that  they  want merger. In fact, every Party represented in this  Assembly  and

parties outside which hope to be represented in this Assembly have all clamoured

for merger. This merger issue is not a new one. It is as old as the existence of

all  political Parties in Singapore - old political Parties, new political Parties

and  budding parties. But it has never been spelled out in all the platforms and

constitutions and the objects of all the political Parties. All they say is  "We

want  merger." Right, we want merger. Everybody wants merger. But what  type  of

merger?  in  fact, what is meant by merger at that time was complete  merger,  a

merger which will make Singapore a constituent State of the Federation of Malaya

on  the  basis  of  any one of the other constituent States at  present  in  the

Federation. That was all in our minds. It was all that we prayed for, hoped for,

worked  for, struggled for, and fought for. Now suddenly the prospects of closer

relationship  have come upon us. The P.A.P. know it. The P.A.P. was responsible,

in  fact,  for the cold shoulder of the Federation; government for the past  two

and  a  half years towards P.A.P. pleadings of merger. At that time, the Barisan

Sosialis was sitting on that side too.

They  were  there. They did plead and kept on pleading, "We want merger."  Every

time  they said, "We want merger," the Tunku gave a tight slap, "Shut up. I will

not have mercer." Now, the Tunku suddenly thought in his wisdom that perhaps  he

had  been  too harsh on Singapore; that perhaps it might be in the best interest

of  both  territories  that  closer association  should  be  achieved.  Then  he

suggested that he could have Singapore in a closer association so long as he had

external  affairs, defence and security. That was what he said. He was prepared.

In  fact, he extended the hand of friendship to the people and the Government of

Singapore.  Unfortunately, the P.A.P. thought that it was a good thing  to  play

party politics. And it came out with. "We want autonomy in education and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>



labour,"  and  never mind about other things. The Tunku had never said  that  he

wanted education and labour. Why should the P.A.P. -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Are all these details really necessary to the issue?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With respect, Sir, I am trying to explain the cause of this

animosity  that  is being displayed by the P.A.P., the Barisan Sosialis  and  at

times  by the Workers' Party. I will cut it short. I will not touch on that  any

more.  But  because  the debate took place, the P.A.P. had to  come  with  half-merger.  And  they  thought  half-merger, and we  also  thought - we  agreed  with

them - that  half-merger was better than no merger. That what has been offered  to

us - the hand of friendship - should be welcomed and that the White Paper Command 33

embodies the agreement reached. No doubt that does not give as much as we  would

like  to  have  or to see. But we must be realistic. That is the best  that  the

P.A.P.   Government  can  achieve  at  the  present  time  under   the   present

circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this question of merger is in the forefront. Those who are against the

White  Paper  are  for complete merger. They say that the  P.A.P. has  not  got

enough.  "Therefore, we want more." They say they want merger in  the  way  they

meant merger when the Parties had that written into their objectives and written

into  their  platforms. They want complete merger as a constituent part  of  the

Federation  of Malaya, on the same basis as any one State at present constituted

in the Federation of Malaya. That is all they want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question of citizenship and automatic citizenship right need not have

arisen and would not have arisen if there had been no -

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - no P.A.P.

style of distortion and the Barisan style of distortion, so much so that citizenship, citizenship and citizenship happens to be the order of the day. It need

not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>



be  so,  Sir. Let us treat this merger referendum in a manner that is  befitting

responsible representatives of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the P.A.P. wanted to pose questions. In fact, they let the cat out of the

bag.  They wanted to pose the questions in such a way that that there  could  be

only  one possible answer. Quite rightly, Members of the Opposition, and I  too,

were disgusted. We said that that was not an honest way and we would resist  any

attempt  by  the  P.A.P. to  conduct  a  dishonest  referendum  with  dishonest

questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Member for Anson, says, I have explained why one question is not a

wise  thing, and we are going to oppose that one question. The Member for  Anson

asked  me  what  alternative I had. You will remember, Sir, that in  the  Select

Committee,  when I sat down and listened to the ding-dong battle that  had  been

going on between the Barisan Sosialis and the P.A.P., knowing that we could  get

nowhere,  I  thought I had found a compromise that might put  an  end  to  this

bitter struggle on this one question one issue referendum. So I did suggest that

if I got their permission I would like to move an amendment to ensure that there

should  only be one issue posed in a referendum and that there might be as  many

questions as the Government liked to pose under that one issue, so long as  such

questions required a reply in the affirmative or in the negative "yes" or "no".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, that when I put forward that suggestion to the Select

Committee, there was a lot of discussion on that, and it was proved  to  me  not

only  by  the  Government  but also by Members in the  Opposition  too  that  my

suggestion  could  not  hold water, because it you'd make  the  referendum  more

complicated  and it would just get us nowhere. In spite of that,  I  begged  for

leave to move the amendment. The leave was not granted.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Was granted.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Was not granted. The official record will show that leave

was not granted. My amendment was not moved. In fact, the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>



Anson, as usual, was quite excited at that proposition. He was for it, and later

on he was not for it. Still later on he was against it. The official record will

show, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> May I refer you to column 146 [Select Committee Official Report

No.  3  dated  8th May, 1962], Sir, where he moved it? In fact, it  went  on  to

another day and he had my full support and clarification. You will find that  it

was put by you, Sir, at column 168 [Official Report No. 4 dated 11th May, 1962],

and it was negatived.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> May I refresh the memory of the Member for Anson? At column

161, the last paragraph, he said this:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Now, in answer to the Member for Cairn hill. My suggestion is that in matters

of  grave  national moment, there must be precision in the questions sought.  If

there are alternatives to be put, then each alternative can be put in a separate

referendum  with the text of the proposed constitutional changes attached.  They

are of considerable clarity.'



<br><br>So  it has been proved to me that my suggestion could not be carried out because

it  is  not  clear and, therefore, I did not get leave to move the amendment.  1

agree  with every Member who spoke and who said that such a propo6ecl  amendment

would  not  solve the issue. That is why I am not moving a similar amendment  in

this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, to come back to the main point. We are opposing this more than one

question  referendum because the Opposition quite rightly feel that  this  would

allow the Government to pose questions in such a way that they can have only one

answer - White Paper Command 33. Such suspicion is not groundless. It is based  on

utterances of Ministers as well as Political Secretaries of the Government.



<br><br>10.46 p.m.

<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I did say here in this debate that in order to prevent such

manipulation on the part of the Government,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>



such questions must be debated in this Assembly. Whatever questions they have to

pose must be debated in this Assembly and it would result in the questions being

framed  by  this  Assembly. They have given the assurance that they  will  allow

questions  to  be  debated in this Assembly for the decision  of  this  Assembly

before the questions are posed in a referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some speakers from the Barisan sosialis did indicate that their objection to

more  than  one  question was because of their fears that the P.A.P.  Government

would  be up to their tricks. The Member for Nee Soon has said clearly  that  if

the  Government Wants two questions, he has no objection to it, so long  as  the

second  question  posed  can be the Barisan question. And  yet  another  Barisan

Member,  the  Member for Upper Serangoon, says that it should not he  a  Barisan

question  or  a P.A.P. question. We are getting more and more confused.  Even  I

become more confused! What is it that the Barisan wants? The Barisan question or

no  Barisan question? Or that it should be questions based in the best interests

of  the people of Singapore as stated by the Member for Upper Serangoon? I think

so  long  as we can ensure that the questions to be posed in a merger referendum

are  clean,  honest  questions, I see no objection why more  than  one  question

cannot  be  posed. In fact, talking about merger, as I have said  earlier,  Sir,

when  all  Parties said, "Merger, merger, we want merger," what they  meant  was

complete  merger as a constituent State in the Federation of Malaya.  Therefore,

why are we opposing that? To my mind, I think these questions can be said to  be

honest, clean, straightforward questions: "Do you want White Paper 33? That is a

straightforward question.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes or no?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Do you want Cmd. Paper 33?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes or no?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Do you want

complete merger     -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes or no?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> as a constituent State of the Federation in the same manner

as  any  one  of the States at present in the Federation? Or, with  the  Cobbold

Report now out, but still not yet made public, all right, another question could

be posed. "Do you want Singapore to enter the Federation of Malaysia on the same

terms,   on  terms  not  less  favourable  than  those  of  any  of  the  Borneo

territories?"  There  could even be three questions and these  could  be  honest

questions that want an answer from the electorate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to a yes or no. If you were to pose two questions or three

questions  like that (the three questions that I have thought out), they  would.

in  our view, be fair and to the point. If you were to ask yes or no, yes or no,

yes  or  no, it can be three yeses and three noes and then we will get  nowhere.

The  choice  is there. The political Parties that are for complete  merger  will

speak  at referendum meetings telling the people that they should vote  for  com

plete  merger. Those of us who axe committed to the White Paper (the  33  of  us

here) will have to come out and try to sell the idea to the people of Singapore.

There may be some, and I am afraid there have been some, who may ask: why is  it

we  are not entering on the same terms as North Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei? They

could  speak strongly at referendum meetings on why Singapore should  enter  the

Federation of Malaysia on terms no less favourable than those of Borneo, Sarawak

or  Brunei. All political Parties having different ideas of merger can speak and

preach  to the people to their hearts' content and win the minds of the  people.

Therefore,  the choice is there for the people of Singapore. Do  you  want  half

merger?  Do  you want full merger? Do you want merger like Borneo,  Sarawak  and

Brunei? What they will be asked then is to give their choice. What do they want?

In  that  way  the  referendum will be able to elicit  from  the  electorate  of

Singapore the wishes of the majority of the electorate of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the assurance given by the Minister that the questions will be

debated in this Assembly before posing them in a merger referendum, I have said



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



that the proper place to write that into the law is in clause 13. The Government

says  that  this is a general referendum Bill, which is for general  application

and  not for merger. If it is a general Bill, I am of the view that in a general

Referendum  Bill, of course, the Government should have the right  to  pose  the

questions. But on a merger referendum, a matter that means life and death to the

people  of  Singapore, a matter on which all political Parties have  taken  firm

stands  one way or the other, it is quite right that the questions to  be  posed

should  be debated in this Assembly. For all we know it might take three  months

before  a  decision could be taken. But it is worth it. It should be debated  in

this  Assembly before it is presented to the electorate for their verdict. There

have  been  criticisms too by other Members of the Opposition  that  this  is  a

general  Referendum Bill to be passed. But as we all know and if we  are  honest

with  ourselves,  this  Bill is introduced just to meet the  merger  referendum.

Therefore. I would suggest to the Government that they should give an  assurance

here to this House - and if that assurance is given, it might take the heat off  a

number of other proposed amendments here -

that  as  soon  as the merger referendum has been completed, this general  Referendum Bill shall be repealed. That will take the heat off, otherwise there will

be  so many amendments put in just to safeguard the position that a general Bill

on  referendum  should  be  of  a character that should  be  acceptable  to  all

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to repeat that if the Government thinks of posing more than one

question,  perhaps, in our view, the three honest questions could  be:  "Do  you

want  White Paper 33?" "Complete merger on the same basis as that of  the  other

States that have joined the Federation?" "Or entering the Federation of Malaysia

on terms no less favourable than those of any one of the Borneo territories?"



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Mammen, before the Member sits down, may I rise on a point

of elucidation?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member for Cairnhill has not finished. He has not

then the Chairman will notice him and call him.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Forgive me. Mr

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Member gives way.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes. I said on a point of elucidation before the Member sits

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Mr Marshall.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am obliged, Mr Mammen. I would ask if the Member has directed

his  mind to the procedures adopted in Switzerland and Australia where, if there

is more than one question, each question is answered with a yes or no. There are

instructions  that all the questions can be answered with a  no,  but  only  one

question may be answered with a yes. Would that not meet the situation he has  in

mind Where there are three questions, so that the people can have the choice  of

rejecting all, but they can only accept one?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, the Member for Anson says you can ask three

questions: you can, put two noes and say yes to one. Later on, he says  you  can

say  three noes. I really do not know what he wants. To make my stand clear,  if

you  pose  3,  4  or  5  honest questions, free from  party  political  content,

questions  framed in the best interests of the people of Singapore, then  it  is

but right that we should seek the views of the people of Singapore as to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>



which  one they like. What will be needed, as the easier and less confusing

way, would be to put a cross against the question you like in the same  way

as  you put .a cross against the candidate to whom the voter wants to  give

his vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Mammen, Sir, only a while ago the Minister for

Finance -  the Deputy Speaker was not here when

the  Minister  for Finance made his speech - said that today's sitting  seemed

to  be  irksome. I do not know if he meant that the sitting will be  up  to

midnight,  so  that everybody will not sleep well when he  goes  home.  But

here  I  would  like to tell him that the blame should  be  placed  on  the

shoulders of the Minister for Finance and on the P.A.P. Government  because

they  utilise  this Assembly to play about with their phoney  parliamentary

democracy.  We,  in the Opposition, who are faced with such  .a  situation,

have  no  alternative but to clear up the issues which remain to be settled

because we, as representatives of the people, have to do so.



<br><br>11.00 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has said just now that this Bill is a

general  referendum Bill. Judging from the wording of the  Bill,  it  is  I

think  a  general Bill applicable to all referenda. But we feel  that  this National  Referendum Bill is specifically meant for merger.  We  have  lost

our faith and confidence in the P.A.P., and so have the people. Therefore,  we  have to explain to the people the consequences  of  passing

this  Bill.  The  P.A.P. are now making use of parliamentary  democracy  to

carry out their dictatorial rule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we fully understand - and the people also understand well - that the

P.A.P. have  exhausted  all  the facilities  of  attack.  Radio  Singapore,

Rediffusion,  the  Press, the Ministry of Culture,  the  Treasury,  and  the

Ministry  of  Home Affairs have all been the means for them  to  sell  their

phoney  merger.  They have carried out this trickery for a  long  time  but

they  have  now come to realise that their type of merger is not  acceptable

to  the people. That is why they have to resort to threats and trickery  to

cheat the people,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



by  distorting the stand of the Barisan Sosialis which is genuine  merger.  They

distort  our stand in order to further cheat the people. That is why  they  have

alleged  that  we  want the Penang type of merger, and so  hope  that  when  the

referendum is held they can fish in troubled waters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of our amendment to this clause is to pinpoint this fact - that the

P.A.P. wants to make much use of this

clause  as  it  is  the most important clause in the Bill. The meaning  of  this

clause  is rather equivocal, and they want to use this clause to enable them  to

play  their tricks. We can see that after the publication of this Bill  for  the

information  of  the  people, all Opposition Parties  here  in  this  House  and

outside,  as well as organisations, have felt strongly against this clause.  But

the  P.A.P. are still bent on their arbitrary way and they do not heed the views

and  opinions of the people and other political Parties. Yet they  try  to  show

that they are democratic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the debate since yesterday, you can see our reasons for wanting to amend

this clause. We feel that they want to make use of this clause to enable them to

propose  two  questions  at the coming referendum. I will  therefore  give  some

assumptions because the Minister for Finance also gave some assumptions - I should

say  "parables".  He  said that the people would be asked  the  question  as  to

whether  they accept Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961 which embodies the merger  proposals,

and that to attract the people this question would be framed in such a way as to

mean that Singapore would, by this merger, be able to retain autonomy in labour,

and  education. He also said that the other question would very likely be framed

in  such  a  way as to ask the people this, "Do you want the Penang and  Malacca

type  of  merger,  which means that about 300,000 Singapore citizens  will  lose

their citizenship rights?"



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order,

Sir, I rise on a point as to whether the

House has a quorum. There are only five

Members on the Government Benches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman (Mr Mammen): That is enough. I think the Member for Anson should

know his Standing Orders well enough that 13 Members shall form a quorum.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes, Sir. But as far as I can count, there are five Members on

the Government Benches - oh!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do hope the Member for Anson knows the Standing Order

on quorum. It says 13 Members present

in the Assembly. They need not apply

only to the Government side. So there is

a quorum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir,  from the example which I gave just now, you will know and the people  will

also know that the nature of These two questions is detrimental to the interests

of  the  people.  Under  such circumstances, how are the people  to  make  their

choice?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us return to the point. Some of the Members opposite who have spoken

appeared  to contradict their previous statements. I remember the Prime Minister

telling  the people a few days ago that the White Paper merger would finally  he

put to the people for a decision. But we know what is meant by "a final decision

of  the  people."  It  means that the people have a right to  accept  or  reject

anything.  But when two undesirable alternatives are put to them, how  can  they

make  their choice? From this we can see what they mean when they say  "let  the

people  choose." This is their way of cheating because the people cannot  choose

one  or  the other, and it therefore means that the people cannot make  a  final

decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little while ago, my colleague, the Member for Upper Serangoon, said that in

spite  of the publicity given by the Government on how good merger is the people

do  not support the White Paper merger. We know that the Government have no guts

to  present  this question to the people because the nature of the  question  is

such that they dare not do so. There is a saying - "genuine gold dreads no lire."

That  is  true in this case. They dare not pose only this White Paper merger  in

the referendum because it is had in itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. have also been distorting the stand of the Barisan Sosialis. They

have  provided a clause saying that all blank votes are deemed to be in  support

of the Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member

for  Anson appeared to be rising several times. I do not know whether he  wants

to rise on a point of order regarding the quorum. If that is his intention, then

all  he  need do is to ask a few Members to absent themselves from this Chamber,

upon  which I will then ring the division bell for a quorum. Mr Tan Cheng Tong,

please continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Mammen. I did not hear you.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I noticed that the Member for Anson had been quite anxious to

rise on a point of order to call for a quorum in this Assembly. I hope that  the

Member will contain himself in this Chamber. Mr Tan Cheng Tong, please -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order. Mr Mammen. Am I not entitled to call on a

point of order for a quorum?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Nobody is denying the right of the Member for Anson to stand up

on a point of order. At least in so far as I am concerned, I have not denied him

that  right, and nobody is saying that he cannot stand up on a point  of  order.

Mr Tan Cheng Tong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir, there is one clause in the Bill which provides that all blank votes and  un

certain  votes are to be taken as support for the Government. I think they  know

that  the  White Paper merger is not desired by the people and that is why  this

clause  has  been  put in to save themselves. And that is  also  why  they  have

distorted  our stand. That explains why they always say that we want the  Penang

or  Malacca  type of merger which means the loss of citizenship for hundreds  of

thousands  of people. They have often repeated these platitudes over  the  radio

and in the newspapers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> On a point of order, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Of course, if repetitions by a Member become too tedious, then

by  my  colleagues, and also to explain the attitude and behaviour of the P.A.P.

to the people. They have intimidated us and have bluffed the people. That is why

I say that they are trying to distort our stand on merger.



<br><br>11.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They know that by doing so, they may have a hope of salvaging their fortunes.

What  does  the  so-called  Penang  and  Malacca  type  of  merger  mean?  Whose

proposition was this?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Member for Jalan Kayu is going into too much

detail  on  the Penang and Malacca type of merger. If I am right, the  Assembly

has debated the merger issue for twelve days. We are now discussing an amendment

to  clause  5, that is, the addition' of a sub-clause. The speech  of  the  hon.

Member is completely irrelevant to the amendment which we are discussing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Chairman, the Minister for Finance

raised  two principal points. First, he said that two questions should be posed.

Second,  he  distorted  our  stand. That is why  I  want  to  disclose  his  two

intentions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 28th of August, we published in the Press our stand on merger -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have told the hon. Member that if he wants to disclose

to the public the stand of the Barisan Sosialis on the merger issue, there is  a

motion  standing in the names of the Member for Queenstown and  the  Member  for

Upper Serangoon. So when the motion is debated in this Assembly, the hon. Member

will  have  an  opportunity  to  disclose to the people  of  Singapore  how  the

Government  has distorted the stand of the Barisan Sosialis. We are now  on  the

amendment  moved  by  the Member for Anson, the Member for  Queenstown  and  the

Member for Hong

Lim.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Chairman, in that case, we will say something more at some other time on

this point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, we debated this clause and clause 13 yesterday and we arc still debating them today. Can the representatives here come to any conclusion on the

amendments to this clause so that it will be properly worded to ensure that only

one question will be put to the people in a referendum? The stand

of  Members on this amendment will expose their true nature. It will  also  show

whether  a Member wants to see our democracy becoming a laughing stock.  I  have

already  said that the main part of this Bill revolves around this  clause.  All

political  Parties,  inside  as  well  as  outside  this  Assembly,   and   many

organisations  and  individuals, have paid much attention to the  provisions  of

clause 5.



<br><br>11.20 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have published their views and opinions on this clause. Various views on

these provisions have been aired at radio forums and discussions. The object  is

to enable the Government to frame the provisions in such a way so that they will

he  acceptable to the people. But certainly there is some confusion  prevailing.

This  is  because  the  Party in power do not want to rule  in  accordance  with

democratic principles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to quote certain views aired by some eminent lawyers at certain forums.

I  hope the Government will pay attention to this for their benefit. I hope they

will  not  feel that today's sitting is wearisome or irksome. Not  only  are  we

giving our views on the provisions of this Bill, but there are also other people

and  organisations  outside  this House who have  given  their  views  on  these

provisions.  The intention is to prevent the Government from making  a  laughing

stock of our democracy here. Let me quote the views on this Bill of the Nanyang

University  Graduates Guild. I think it is necessary that the  Ministers'  attention  should  be drawn to this because there are certain Ministers  who  do  not

understand  Chinese, and they do not like to see the views given by the  people.

The Nantah Graduates Guild have given their views thus:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We are faced with the Government's White Paper on merger. We are faced with a

situation  where we seek for a merger and reunification of the two  territories.

We  have  to give our stand here. Our stand is for equality on the reunification

of the two territories. We want to ensure that the people of the two territories

can enjoy equal rights -'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. That appears now to be an argument against the White

Paper.  We are not worried about that now. What we are worried about is  whether

or  not there should be one question or two questions. I do not want to hear any

arguments against or for the White Paper. It has been suggested that a  question

could  be asked on the White Paper. Somebody else said a question could be asked

an  complete merger. I do not want to hear any argument as to whether the  White

Paper  is  good or bad. We are on a specific issue as to whether  or  not  there

should be one or two questions or more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Chairman,  even in the passage I have quoted, the last  point  therein  continues to say that the national referendum must be held in a democratic manner.

This  view is also our view. It is because we feel that this opinion is the same

as  the  one  we had that we are bringing it up for the reference of Members  of

this House for their convenience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point which the statement deals with is that we must put the White

Paper  merger as a question for the decision of the people. By making  reference

to  this statement, I mean to say that the National Referendum Bill is a  centre

of  interest to the various classes of people in Singapore. Here again, I  would

like  to  make  a quotation of a speech of a Member in the Opposition.  This  is

because  he  is a Malay and a Malay brother of ours. He is also a representative

of  a  political  Party. This Malay brother of ours is a representative  of  the

Party  Rakyat. He says that the National Referendum Bill as brought  forward  by

the P.A.P. is an unprecedented one. In other words, you can never find such a Bill

in the world. He continues to say that the Prime Minister used to talk



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>



about democracy. But now he seems to have forgotten about democracy. Instead  he

goes over the radio and makes distortions of the stand of other people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person has this to say concerning the question to be introduced in the

National Referendum:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The P.A.P. wants us to make a choice, say, for example, between this: Do you

want  the  P.A.P. type of merger or the Penang type of merger? These two  things

are bad and nobody would like either of them.'



<br><br>He  also says that this amounts to asking whether you want to beat your wife  or

you want to beat your daughter.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I might remind the hon. Member that he is making a

speech.  I do not want to hear a speech made by somebody who is not a Member  of

this Assembly. The Member for Jalan Kayu is reading out somebody else's opinion.

I  Want to know his opinion. The Assembly is interested to know his opinion, not

this gentleman's opinion.



<br><br>11.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I feel that the opinion of this man is  very  good  and  my

opinion  is  similar  to his. That is why I am mentioning his  opinion  in  this

House. In the meantime, I mention his opinion because he is a Malay friend  and

in the course of getting a merger -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): On a point of elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Can the Member for Jalan Kayu say who is the person?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

The  meeting of the Socialists. A representative of Party Rakyat. You will  know

him.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is quite a valid question, I thought I missed the

name.  We  cannot have any anonymous remarks by anonymous persons  mentioned  in

this  Assembly. The Parliamentary Secretary has asked who is this person who  is

being quoted and I think he is entitled to an answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, since you want the name I will tell you. He is the  representative of the Party Rakyat, Inche Wahab.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me return to the speech of the Minister for Finance. I

would  like to quote a passage of his speech. He says that if we can employ  our

tactics  in the proper manner, then we can defeat our enemies. That is  what  he

says.  I would like to remind the Members of the Government that as a result  of

the  controversy over the National Referendum Bill, the Government is now placed

in a very embarrassing position. Because it is now faced with the attack coining

from  the Opposition and from other angles and quarters. Even their friends  in

the  Alliance are unhappy about some clauses in this Bill. That will  mean  that

the P.A.P. is actually undemocratic. Even their friends are against them in some

places.  Let me now deal with the speech made by the Minister for Education.  In

his speech, the Minister concerned tried to explain why we want to bring up this

amendment.  Here  I would like to tell the Minister that the  amendment  we  are

bringing  up shows that we have no confidence in you. We have no confidence  and

faith in the phoney merger which you are playing with.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think, if my

recollection  is correct, I have already pulled the Member up as  being  out  of

order  for  referring to the merger proposals which have been accepted  by  this

House  as a phoney merger. He must not do that. It is a reflection on a vote  of

the House and is therefore completely out of order. He must be careful not to be

out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

The Minister tried to explain the reason why we wanted to bring up this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>



amendment.  I am telling him that because we have no confidence in you, meaning

the Members in the Government.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member has been interpreted as saying he "has no

confidence in you" - the Chair. I hope that is not so. I hope he retains  his  confidence in the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I tried to say that the amendment we wanted to bring  up  was

brought  up because we have no confidence in the Government and that is  why  we

want to amend this clause. This particular clause is now being incorporated  for

the  sake  of merger. The Government is going all out in its publicity over  the

merger matter and tries to bluff the people by saying that those who are against

merger  are  being fooled by the Communists. This is a step to bluff  them.  The

next  step  will be to suppress the people. We have many trade unions and  other

cultural organisations which want to hold meetings over the merger issue and the

Referendum  Bill, but they have not been given permission. So from this  we  can

see -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member now is anticipating the motion, a notice

of  which  has been given by the Member for Thomson and the Member for Havelock.

He is not entitled to do that and I think I might as well at this stage read the

relevant  Standing Order about anticipation. I have been lenient, but  at  this

time  of  the  night  perhaps leniency is out of place. The  Standing  Order  is

Standing Order 50 (2) :

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'When notice of a motion has been given, it shall be out of order to raise the

subject  matter of that motion in the form of an amendment to another motion  or

to  discuss the subject matter to which the motion relates on a motion  for  the

adjournment of the Assembly.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I ask the Member to try not to anticipate, for he probably would like to

say something on this other motion and I will permit him just to touch on it  in

passing, but not to go into details.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

The amendment we are bringing up to this particular clause has been brought





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>



up  because  of  their behaviour, because we have completely lost confidence  in

them.  I  was  just  trying  to show you why we are actually  bringing  up  this

amendment  to this particular clause. In short, they are very reactionary.  That

is  why  we  have no alternative but to bring in an amendment to this particular

clause  which says that there should be only one question in a referendum.  That

is why the people will be able to say yes or no to any particular matter. Clause

29  deals  with  blank  votes which will be taken as votes  in  support  of  the

Government.  So  if the Government should pose two questions which  are  equally

unacceptable  to the people, then it is very unfair to the people, because  they

cannot make a choice. Mr Speaker, Sir, because of this, we are bringing up this

amendment so that only one question will be asked at the referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with the speech made

by the Deputy Prime Minister. He says when a person is thirsty, he would like to

drink  water. That is common knowledge. When a person is thirsty, he must  drink

water.  There  is  no  point for him to tell us this. He  makes  the  comparison

between  tea  and drain water. Well, it does not matter what type of  drink  you

have  as long as you have a drink to quench your thirst. But this is a different

matter. Merger is very important as far as the people are concerned. You  cannot

compare  merger to the drinking of clean water or dirty water, because  the  two

are different. What I will say is that the White Paper merger is as bad as dirty

water.  So  to  draw  a proper analogy, I would ask our Government  whether  the

Government is trying to force the people to drink ditty water. I think this is a

more appropriate analog.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Dirty water from Jalan

Kayu.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I am going to give other examples which, I think,  are  necessary  because they have not been published in newspapers and many people do  not

know  about them. Perhaps some Members in the Assembly, if not all, know  about

this because the people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



concerned  have  sent their memorandum to various Members  in  this  House.  The

representors urged that as representatives of the people, we the Members of this

House  must  try  to  carry out the mandate given to us by the  people.  So, by

bringing  this up, more people will know about it. In this memorandum,  it  says

that  the  people's views on Command Paper 33 are to refuse or accept the  White

Paper.  There should be only one question in order that the correct attitude  of

the  people  may be ascertained. If there should be two questions on  the  White

Paper  merger,  then it will be undemocratic because if you ask  the  people  to

choose  between  the Penang type of merger and the White Paper type  of  merger,

then  the people have no actual choice and this is not in keeping with the  true

meaning of a national referendum -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. That argument has been advanced in this House from the

Opposition side several times. I also asked the Member to spare this  House  the

same  argument by somebody who is not in this House. We have had enough of  that

same  argument,  and I think possibly I must be a little bit more  strict  about

this  because  all arguments have been exhausted, and we are  going  round  and

round  in  circles.  If the Member can bring his speech to a  conclusw4l, then

perhaps we can get on faster than we have gone on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker. Sir, this argument has only been advanced by the Member for Anson,

and that is why I am trying to advance the same argument again in general.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I have already made a quotation; that ends my speech. But before I sit

down, I hope the Government will not say that, as the Minister for Finance says.

because  of the trouble created by the Barisan Sosialis, the people are  against

the  national referendum. As a matter of fact, the National Referendum Bill  has

caught  the attention and interest of people of various classes. Their attention

has  been  drawn  to it because they want to be sure that in a democratic  State

this Bill is not implemented in an undemocratic manner.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, we are almost reaching midnight and

all  this  time  we have been led far away by some Members of  the  Assembly

with  the  same  old  tune, a tune which sometimes gives  a  kind  of  entertainment to those who wish to go to sleep.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the debate on the amendment moved by the Opposition, we have heard

many  speakers  touching  on  the  subject  of  democracy,  democracy,  and

democracy. But if we go deeply into the matter of

democracy, which has been expounded by them as genuine democracy,  we  find

that  democracy  is practised by them merely for the purpose  of  the  next

general  elections, that is to say, "We want the seats." That is  democracy

to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In opposing the clause before us, they pretend to be true patriots. But

their  words  expose  their true character. We have  been  led  far  field,

particularly by an eminent lawyer in this Assembly, the

Member  for  Anson, on the subject of the referendum in other countries such  as

Australia - from  north to south, and from east to west. But  they  have  conveniently  forgotten that in those countries there is only one nationality. Here  in  Singapore  we are living in a country comprising  a  multi-racial

society  with  different religions. We must stand on solid ground  and,  as

fighters  of  democracy, we must respect the views of all sections  of  the

people  who live in this country and who owe undivided allegiance  to  this

country.  This  is  the responsibility of fighters of democracy - to  respect

the  views  of  all  sections of the community and whose  loyalty  to  this

country is undivided.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, Mr Speaker, in honouring the respect of these loyal

people,  we must be cool, calm, and perservering, and must look on a  wider

plane.  Mr Speaker, in discussing this question, which is to be  posed  in

the  forthcoming referendum as to how many questions are to  be  posed  and

whether  it  will be answered by a "yes" or "no", we must  be  cautious  so

that  we will not put something that is not acceptable to our community  as

a  whole.  We  know  that  the principle of merger  has  been  agreed  upon

unanimously, i.e. Singapore must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



merge  with  the Federation of Malaya. But the type of merger has  been  debated

upon months ago, and we have also debated the White Paper Cmd. 33 which has been

adopted  by  this Assembly. In my opinion, the basis of merger has been  debated

and  accepted  by  a great majority of the population comprising  a  multiracial

society  in  Singapore.  But  these views and opinions  have  been  misled  and

confused  by opportunistic leaders who play on chauvinistic feelings  so  as  to

achieve their own political ends. Nobody can deny this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have often heard it said in this Assembly by Members opposite, particularly

the  Barisan  Sosialis  which  is led by their  great  leader,  the  Member  for Queenstown, that we have deceived the people and so on and so forth. I  do  not

know  the  Chinese  language and therefore cannot read Chinese  newspapers, but

until  today I have not come across nor have I heard what is the type of  merger

that the Barisan Sosialis want. The Member who spoke just now about the attitude

of  the  Barisan Sosialis, unfortunately spoke in Chinese. But whatever he  said

must  be  read,  digested and understood by those who do not understand  Chinese

too.  From  this  we  can see that their opinion is limited and  confined  to  a

particular section of the community. In this way, they are playing on chauvinism

for  their  own  political  future. They only pose to  be  genuine  fighters  of

democracy. We Assemblymen here, on this side at least, come from all sections of

the community, and we disseminate our views to the people in open confrontation,

so  that  the  people  themselves may decide. So when this  problem  is  clearly

understood by all sections of the people. Mr Speaker, it means that we are figh

ting for the rights of democracy, and that the people themselves can realise and

assess the value of democracy according to their views and their wishes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I wish to reiterate. It is highly dangerous and highly inflam mable and will bring calamity to the country if leaders, especially those

sitting  in  this  Assembly,  stir up communal passion  to  light  the  fire  of

communalism  f  or  a particular section or part of the community,  or  for  any

particular Party.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Parliamentary Secretary is straying away when he went

on that tack. That is, in my opinion, completely irrelevant to the amendment.  I

think  the Parliamentary Secretary is guilty of the same fault - being completely

irrelevant when he talks about feelings in this particular context when  we  are

dealing with the amendment before the House.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I do not wish to argue with you. But I

have  said  it because that charge has been made several times when Mr  Speaker

retired from the Chamber for a while. So I think it is imperative that I  should

explain that in implementing this referendum, we must pose questions which  will

be  acceptable  by the people comprising the various races. This is  my  object.

There is a danger if only one question were put and accepted by one section  and

rejected by another. So in order to safeguard democracy and thereby respect  the

views of all the communities, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



questions  to be posed should be acceptable by all sections of the people  here.

By  this  there  is  the hope that the basis of national unity  which  has  been

implanted  in the people of Singapore who owe undivided loyalty to this  country

will not be disrupted.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Midnight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair of

the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to report that the Committee has

made progress on the Bill, and beg leave to sit again tomorrow.
