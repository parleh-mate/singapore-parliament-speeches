<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Sia Kah Hui) (for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Amendment Bill to the Medical

Registration Ordinance (Chapter 191 of the Revised Edition)  seeks  to

amend  the  Ordinance  so as to vary the composition  of  the  Medical

Council in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Ordinance prescribes that under section 4 the Medical

Council shall consist of 16 members and under subsection 1 (e),



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Three registered medical practitioners to be nominated by the Council

of  the  University  of Malaya and appointed by  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Ordinance came into effect in 1963 but as from January 1962, the

University  of  Malaya,  Singapore  Division, became  known  as   the

University  of  Singapore and the University of Malaya,  Kuala  Lumpur

Division, became known as the University of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur has started a Medical

Faculty  with  its first intake of medical students  in  1963,  it  is

considered desirable that provision be made for representation of both

Universities  on the Medical Council. The Federal Minister  of  Health

has  been consulted and is in agreement that reciprocal amendments  be

made  in  the  relevant  Ordinances of both territories  so  that  the

following  representation will be prescribed  for  both  Medical  Councils:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 registered medical practitioners to be nominated in all, of which:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 registered medical practitioners are

to be appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara on the nomination of the

Council of the University of Singapore and another 2 registered

medical practitioners to be appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>



Negara  on  the nomination of the Council of the  University  of

Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the proposed amendment under clause 2 of the Bill, the Medical

Council  will  have  an  increased membership of  17  instead  of  16,

hitherto.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of

the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third

time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is to fulfil Government's promise to provide opportunities

for  the  middle and lower income group to own homes. The Housing  and

Development  Board's five-year programme calls for the  completion  of

51,000 housing units by mid 1965. I am sure Members of this House will

be  glad  to hear that we will have the 51,000 units of public housing

by  that  date.  The progress of our housing programme,  according  to

schedule,  has  enabled the Government to give  accommodation  to  the

majority  of applicants who urgently need houses. We have reached  the

stage where we can offer accommodation to any citizen of Singapore who

is  eligible to a house if he is not too choosey. However,  there  are

quite  a  number of people with low income who want to, and should  be

encouraged to, own their homes too. Unfortunately the flats and houses

built  by  private developers are priced beyond their means.  We  have

therefore  now started a scheme whereby two- and three-room flats  are

sold on instalment at the subsidized prices of $4,900 and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



$6,200 respectively. At these prices our citizens can choose between

buying a car or a house.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan for the sale of low-cost flats was announced in February this

year, and the Housing and Development Board, as agent of the Government, prepared a pilot scheme for the sale of 2,068 two- and

three-room flats. The response so far has been most encouraging. Up to date

about 800 flats have been balloted for. Enough publicity has been

given to the scheme and I do not propose to go into details. In

putting up this scheme it is our intention to see that no abuse arises

out of it. Therefore, certain conditions and regulations have to be

made pertaining to the sale of these flats. There are enough

provisions in this Bill to prevent these flats which are sold on

instalments from falling into the hands of speculators and profiteers.

The flats are to be sold only to bona fide purchasers who wish to buy

a house for their own occupation. There are also provisions in this

Bill to ensure that the flats can be managed properly and economically

after they have been sold. Under this Bill, a person is not entitled

to purchase more than one flat, and if he does so, he contravenes the

Ordinance, and on conviction will be liable to imprisonment for a term

not exceeding 12 months, or to a fine not exceeding $2,000, or to both

fine and imprisonment. Any flat purchased in contravention of the

Ordinance will not be registrable. But, on the other hand, provision

is made in the Bill to exempt all bona fide transactions from the

legal requirements of the Registration of Deeds Ordinance and the Land

Titles Ordinance, as regards the registration of sale, mortgage, and

re-mortgage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a restriction on transfers which could only be effected with

the consent of the Housing and Development Board, and where the Board

refuses such consent, it is bound to buy it up at a price to be

determined by the Board. This price is, however, subject to appeal to

the Minister, should the owner be dissatisfied with the price offered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powers are given to the Board to require the owners of flats to form a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>



management corporation for the purposes of general maintenance of  the

common property, and where a direction by the Board to this end is not

complied  with, the Board may authorise any company to  undertake  the

control, management and administration of the property. The Board may,

however,  exercise  these  functions  where  there  is  no  management

corporation or where such corporation has been wound up on  the  order

of  the  Minister.  The  corporation  would  subsist  by  levying  con

tributions from the owners of the flats in the block.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powers are given in the Bill to enable the Housing and Development

Board to determine the lease under various circumstances, such as

non-payment  of instalments, securing purchase of a flat on false  pretext

or the owner has violated the rules for the sale of flats. In order to

regulate the sale of flats, the Board will be empowered to make  rules

for  purposes  such  as  methods of sale,  qualifications  of  persons

eligible, monthly instalments, period of payments, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is also taken in this Bill to make other amendments to

the  Housing and Development Ordinance which are considered  necessary

in  the  light of experience of the working of the Board since it  was

formed  in  February 1960. The repeal and re-enactment of  section  12

will enlarge the scope of the Board's functions and enable it to build

accommodation for sale and lease as well as for renting, and will also

enable  it  to  undertake urban development and to  provide  loans  to

enable persons to purchase houses. The Board will also be empowered to

promote  and  float incorporated companies to carry  out  any  of  the

functions laid down under the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By an amendment to section 24, the procedure for the internal

administration  of  the Board will be simplified by  vesting  it  with

powers  to  make  standing orders in regard to the methods  of  making

contracts,  the  delegation of powers to officers of  the  Board,  the

keeping of accounts, conduct and discipline of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



officers, loans and allowance to officers, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedure for the borrowing of monies from Government will also be

simplified  by  clause 9, which repeals sections  37  and  38  of  the

Ordinance,  and  re-enacts section 37. Under the new provision,  funds

required  by the Board for carrying out its functions will be  subject

to less cumbersome and formal procedures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first balloting of the sale of flats took place early in February

this  year,  and  it is necessary to bring this Bill into  force  with

retrospective  effect  from  the 11th  February,  1964,  in  order  to

validate the action of the Board in selling flats to the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to comment on this Bill from my personal understanding and experience. I would like the

Minister to explain the points I will ask.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to clause 4 (new section 12A), when authorized by the

Minister,  the Board can form a private corporation and can carry  out

urban and rural development. A green or agricultural belt was formerly

not allowed for housing development and prices were low. But according

to  clause 4 (new section l2A), if the Minister approves of  it,  such

lands  can  be developed and the landlord will have to pay  a  certain

amount  of development charges. The Bill has the purpose of preventing

the landlord from exploiting the benefits derived from development.  I

wonder  whether the Government has taken any measures to control  land

prices.  I  hope that the Housing Board, before any scheme is  carried

out,  will  look into the question of prices for the land  and  should

arrive  at  a just determination, otherwise land prices will increase,

and as a result, the burden of the people will be increased.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to clause 7 of the amendment Bill, the Board approved by the

Minister  can  make  standing orders to provide for  certain  matters.

There  is  a  provision  that  the  Board  can  give  facilities   and

conveniences to its staff. Maybe one reason is that they  are  looking

after the welfare and housing problem of the public, so that they  are

given such facilities and conveniences. I wonder whether the staff  in

other  Government  departments  are also  given  such  facilities  and

conveniences  as provided here. I would like the Minister  to  give  a

reply.



<br><br>2.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the House has just passed the

Planning (Amendment) Bill. Under that Bill whatever rise there  is  in

land prices due to development, part of that increase in value will go

back to Government in development charges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the fear of the hon. Member that landlords - I hope I

get  him  right  - will benefit unduly by the rise of prices  in  land

because of our development, I can assure him that we will see  to  it,

with every means at our disposal, that there will be no speculation in

land.  I did mention in my speech in moving the Second Reading of  the

Planning (Amendment) Bifi that we were quite aware that where planning

permission  has  been given, there are a number of people  who  having

received  this permission have hawked it around without any  intention

of  building.  Therefore, in the Planning (Amendment)  Bill,  we  have

fixed a date -

I  think  it  is  within two years - within which  if  no  building

operation is commenced, the permission lapses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to his other point - he was referring to clause 7:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'24.-(1) The Board may, with the approval of the Minister, make rules

prescribing  anything  that  is  to be prescribed  and  generally  for

carrying out the provisions of this Ordinance.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His contention is, why should special facilities be given to officers

of  the  Board  to  enable  them to carry out  their  duties;  whereas

officers in other departments do not get the same facilities? I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



would say this ruling here is - as a result of our previous experience

-  to cut away as much red tape as possible, to see that what could be

done  for  the public should be done with as little waste of time  and

with as little red tape as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of

the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.

<br><br>3.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I now

move officially,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*That, in view of the seriousness of the situation which will affect

the  lives  and  properties of the people of Singapore  following  the

pursuance of the present policy of military expansion and war  by  the

Alliance  Government, and the measures taken by the Central Government

to  coerce  youths  of  Singapore to undergo military  training,  this

Assembly  calls  on  the  Singapore Government  to  urge  the  Central

Government to stop conscripting such youths for military service.

<hr size="2" noshade>

*The motion also stood in the name of Mr Chia Thye Poh.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion does not mean that our youths are afraid of death or are

disloyal  citizens. Mr Speaker, wars differ in nature. We  have  wars

which are waged to protect peace and the interests of the people,  and

wars  which  are  waged  in  the interests  of  the  imperialists  and

colonialists. We have anti-colonialist wars and anti-imperialist  wars

to protect the people and their interests, and we have imperialist and

colonialist wars to deprive the people of their rights and  interests.

So it is for us to decide what type of war this is, whether this is  a

war  in the interest of the people of our own nation, or a war in  the

interest of the imperialists and colonialists. Once we know the nature

of  the war, then we shall be able to decide whether to encourage  our

people to fight or not to fight in the war.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as a result of their long experience in their

struggle against the imperialists and colonialists, the people of  our

nation know what they should or should not do. Therefore, they are not

so  gullible  as  to be led into an unjust war. The Alliance  and  the

P.A.P.  Governments all along want the people to do what they  dislike

and  what they should not do. Their refusal to do what the P.A.P. want

them to do is termed as an act of disloyalty and anti-national. But is

it  for  the ruling clique to say whether the people are disloyal  and

antinational? The ruling clique is selfish and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>



reactionary. Anyone who dares to fight for the interest of the  nation

and against the reactionary ruling clique is described as disloyal and

anti-national. Mr Speaker, Sir, what is very strange is that these

so-called  diloyal  and  anti-national  elements  are  invariably

anti-colonial fighters who receive great respect from the nation at  large.

The Alliance and the P.A.P. Governments hate them and resort to every

means to suppress them.  Why  should  this  be  so? This is  because

the  anti-colonial fighters  threaten the interest of the ruling clique

and  the  British and American imperialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me recount to you the history of our people in

their  struggle against imperialism and colonialism. In 1941 when  the

Japanese  imperialists occupied our country, the British soldiers  did

not  shoulder their responsibility in defending our country. They  ran

away  on hearing the approach of the Japanese. As a result, our people

were  left  entirely  to  sink or swim. They  were  massacred  by  the

Japanese. The blood shed was enough to form a stream and the  piled-up

corpses  could  form  a  hill. This was the so-called  protection  and

defence  that  the British were able to give us during  that  critical

period.  As a result, our people of various races had to come  forward

to  defend their nation and their own lives and properties,  and  they

waged  the  war  against the Japanese imperialists and Fascists.  With

determination  and  support from many parts of the world,  our  people

were   able   to  defeat  the  Japanese.  After  all  these  difficult

experiences,  we realise that whatever hardship and suffering  we  are

subjected  to  are the result of the suppression carried  out  by  the

British  imperialists. Therefore, in the name  of  liberation  and  to

break  away from the British imperialists, the people were not  afraid

to  go  to  gaol,  to  make sacrifices and carry on  their  relentless

struggle against the British imperialists. In these circumstances, the

British  imperialists experienced certain pressure  from  the  people.

They  knew  that  the struggle was going to be very difficult.  So  in

order  to  prolong their interest and influence in our  country,  they

made  use  of certain stooges. The policies of the Alliance  were  not

framed to end the British colonial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>



influence.  On  the  contrary,  they  were  framed  with  a  view   to

consolidating the British and American imperialist influence. That  is

why  the  people are against them. We are against Malaysia because  of

this.  We  are against the suppression that is now being  carried  out

against the people of North Borneo. Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a  short

history  and  it has been written in blood. It shows the loyalty  that

the people have to our nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask the people in the ruling clique where they were during the

struggle against the Japanese imperialists, what they contributed  and

what  they did to set an example to the people. Let me take the  Prime

Minister for example. In 1963, on 25th August ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are on the motion now. I wish that the hon. Mem

ber will not drag personalities into his motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not making any personal attack. I am just going

to  tell you some facts about the contributions made by people in this

respect. The Government has all along been condemning my Party as

anti-national  and  disloyal, and I have to tell you some facts  to  refute

this allegation.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There is no

objection  to the Member attacking the P.A.P. as such, but what  I  am

saying  is that individual Members must not be dragged into the debate

by name.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

At  the  present juncture, what have the PAP. Ministers  as  Ministers

done  to deserve their places? I remember that at a certain rally  the

Prime  Minister  spoke  about  his  difficult  experience  during  the

Japanese  occupation when he almost had his head chopped  off  by  the

Japanese  Fascists. He said that he escaped this fate because  he  was

very  fluent  and very convincing in what he said. But  unfortunately,

thousands of people who were subjected to hardship during the Japanese

occupation  were not so fortunate with the gift of the  gab  like  our

Prime  Minister; otherwise they would still be alive today, just  like

him, and there would be less widows and orphans. When



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



the Japanese went, the British came in, as a result of which the peole

launched  into the anti-colonial struggle. What did our  Ministers  do

during  this  period by way of contribution in this struggle?  It  was

through  the leadership of the Secretary-General of my Party  and  the

other  anti-colonial  and  anti-imperialist  leaders  that  the  Prime

Minister had been able to get some support to be what he is now.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have been listening patiently to the Member. I

have  been giving him as much rope as I think he should have. But  the

motion before the House is not the P.A.P. The motion before the  House

relates itself to "the seriousness of the situation which will  affect

the  lives  and  properties of the people of Singapore  following  the

pursuance  of  the present policy. . . .". So will the Member  confine

himself to "the present policy"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

I  thank you for your ruling, Mr Speaker. So through the struggle and

the  strength of the anti-colonial fighters, the P.A.P. came to power.

They went into collusion with pro-colonial elements like the Tunku  to

work  for  the  interest of the British colonialists and  they  formed

Malaysia.   They   are  the  No.  1  collaborators  of   the   British

colonialists. What right have they to tell us who are and who are  not

loyal,  Mr  Speaker?  The present tension that is  generated  in  our

nation is attributable to the formation of Malaysia by force. What was

the  idea  behind  Malaysia? After the Second  World  War,  the

anti-colonial and anti-imperialist movement has been gathering momentum  in

South-East  Asia.  The  cry for liberation and  self-determination  is

resounding throughout this region. The British colonialists knew  this

trend  and  in order to continue with and protect their rule  in  this

region,  they stated in the 1963 Constitution that Singapore would  be

given  complete  internal self-government; Sarawak  and  North  Borneo

would  be  given  self-government; and Brunei would be given  complete

independence. But the British colonialists at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



that  time  knew  that the progressive I Leftwing  movement  was  very

strong  and  influential and that power would come into the  hands  of

this  movement and those people who were against British  colonialism.

So the British colonialists had no alternative but to entrust power to

their agents in order to prolong their interest and influence in  this

region.  They found these agents in the Alliance and the  P.A.P.  That

was  how  the  idea  of Malaysia came into being. The ants-progressive

elements  gathered together and Malaysia was formed. British interests

and economic influence have not come to an end as a result of the form

ation  of Malaysia. On the contrary, they have been further protected.

Malaysia  was formed to isolate the progressive elements in  Indonesia

and  the  national movement in this region. This is precisely  in  the

interest of the imperialists. Mr Speaker, Malaysia was formed against

the wishes of the people. According to the Constitution, the people of

Singapore  cannot enjoy the same status as that of the  Federation  of

Malaya. The people of Singapore do not enjoy the same political rights

as  those  in  the Federation. The people of Singapore have  no  equal

representation in the Central Parliament. They do not enjoy freedom of

publication, freedom of assembly and freedom of speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysia Constitution has failed to unite the people of various

races.  In  fact, it has gone one step further. It has split  them  to

strengthen  the  colonialist influence. The Chinese people  have  been

regarded  as a foreign reactionary force. What is Malaysia like  as  a

nation? After its formation, the colonial influence still exists.  The

colonialists still continue to control the economy of our nation.  Bri

tish  bases are still rampant throughout our nation. Rockets and  army

installations  are  very  common in our  country.  Malaysia's  foreign

policy is pro-Western. It is a pro-war policy. Fundamentally, Malaysia

is  a  neo-colonialist  plan.  That is why  the  people  of  the  five

territories are against it. Previous to the formation of Malaysia, the

Secretary-General of my Party, Mr Lim Chin Siong, gave  this  sincere

advice, that if Malaysia was imposed by force upon the people of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



the five territories, then the consequences would be very grave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> <i>(In Mandarin)</i>: Can  the  Member for Paya Lebar make it clear whether we have accepted

the  advice  of  his  Secretary-General when he asked  his  Indonesian

colleagues to give us trouble here?



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Before the Prime Minister speaks, he should have my permission.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Let me clear this point so that we will not misunderstand

one  another in future. If the Member did not wish to give way to  the

Prime  Minister, he should have remained on his feet and I would  have

asked the Prime Minister to resume his seat. As the Member had resumed

his seat, I understood that to mean that he had given way to the Prime

Minister.  In future, if the Member does not wish to give way  to  the

Prime Minister, all he has to do is to remain on his feet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Concerning  the query raised by the Prime Minister, I  think  I  shall

deal with it after my speech. [interruption.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the advice has not been heeded by the Alliance and the

P.A.P.  That is why there is a war going on in North Borneo. There  is

also  Indonesian confrontation. As a result of this advice  not  being

heeded,  things  are happening that are against the  interest  of  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the war that is now going on in North Borneo is one in

which the people want to get self-determination and liberation - a  link

of  the entire national movements. The target of their struggle is the

British  colonialists. This war unites many people in  their  struggle

and opposition against Malaysia. It is being waged to get rid



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



of  the  colonialists from our country. This is  a  war  for  complete

independence.  But  the  British colonialists have  taken  suppressive

action  to  curb  the wishes of the people. Under these circumstances,

the  people of North Borneo have no alternative but to resort to  arms

in order to get rid of the British colonialists. Mr Speaker, in order

to fight for their national independence and liberation, the people of

North  Borneo  are  now bravely engaged in an anti-British  and

anti-colonial struggle. Any party or organisation and even individuals  who

are  anti-colonialists should support the people of North Borneo.  The

British  colonialists and the ruling Party in Malaysia should be  held

responsible  for the war that is going on in North Borneo  today.  The

Alliance Government is now forcing the people of Singapore to  undergo

military  training as a preparation before they go to fight  in  North

Borneo. This is against the interest of the people as much as  it  is

in  the  interest  of the British colonialists. The  present  struggle

against the British colonialists in North Borneo is a reasonable  one.

The British colonialists should be held responsible for the consequences.

The fate of the people of Singapore and Malaya is similar to that of the

people in North Borneo. They have suffered the same savage suppression. Since

we have mutual aspirations and wishes, we should support one another to get

rid of this suffering.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, having experienced two World Wars, particularly the

Japanese  invasion of Malaya, the people in Singapore and  Malaya  are

now  longing  to go back to the former peaceful days. But the  British

colonialists and the Alliance Government would not let the people live

in  peace.  When  the  people in Singapore and  Malaya  are  urging  a

peaceful  solution of the war in Borneo, the British colonialists  and

the  Alliance  Government  are  forcing  youths  to  undergo  military

training in order to prolong the war. We have no ill-feelings  against

the  people in North Borneo. The British colonialists have carried out

this war in North Borneo in order to suppress the people. They do  not

want  to give them self-determination. Why should we, the young people

here, be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



asked to fight for the British colonialists? Even if the struggle  for

self-determination in North Borneo could be suppressed, what good will

it do to -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b> remained standing.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member does not give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

The  only  people  who  can  benefit from this  war  are  the  British

colonialists. Therefore, the people in our country have no  obligation

to  fight  against the people in North Borneo. This is  especially  so

when  the  people  in  Singapore  have  not  been  enjoying  the  same

privileges and rights as the people in the other territories.  We  are

in  the  midst  of  hardship. We have been  deprived  of  our  rights.

Moreover,  we are being conscripted to fight our brothers.  Since  the

people  have no rights, what obligation have they to fight in  a  war?

War  will  only bring destruction, misery and death to our people.  It

will  destroy  our  peaceful lives. Husbands and  wives,  parents  and

children, brothers and sisters will be separated. There will  be  more

orphans  and  widows.  This is only for the  purpose  of  serving  the

British  and  American imperialists. After the formation of  Malaysia,

many people have lost their jobs. Many factories and shops have closed

down.  Our  trade has declined. Our port is under control. The  barter

trade  has  been  suspended.  Economic  activities  in  Singapore  are

becoming  more and more depressed. The income of the people  has  gone

down. The burden of the people is becoming heavier day by day. At  the

same  time,  the  Alliance Government and the  P.A.P.  Government  are

carrying out repressive measures. Many innocent youths have been  sent

to  gaol and beaten up. They have restricted youths from entering  the

universities.  They  have  declared a state  of  emergency,  and  have

introduced reactionary measures and regulations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



They  have created racial disturbances. Lives and properties have been

sacrificed. In short, they have brought misery to the people. This  is

the result of Malaysia. The war in North Borneo is also the outcome of

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the facts are very clear. They have shown that we

have   no  obligation  to  serve  the  foreign  capitalists  and   the

reactionary stooges. I urge the Alliance Government to value the lives

and  property  of the people. They should defer to the  views  of  the

people  and  stop  calling them up, especially the  youths,  to  fight

against the people in North Borneo. Our Party advocates peace and  the

protection of people's lives and property. The people in Singapore are

peace-loving. They do not want war. They hate it and they do not  want

to  wage  it. If there is any war in our country, it can only  benefit

the  colonialists, and the Government should be fully held responsible

for  it, because they have allowed the British to station armies here.

They  suppress democracy and they pursue the pro. Western war  policy,

particularly  the policy of the United States which is  anti-Communist

and  anti-China.  New Zealand, Australia and the  United  States  have

joined  the  British in supporting Malaysia and they have promised  to

provide  arms to Malaysia. However, their young people will  not  come

here to fight the war, because in Britain itself the young people  are

against conscription. Moreover, the British do not have enough  troops

to cope with the situation in Malaysia. So we see the Alliance and the

P.A.P. are trying to conscript the young people here into fighting for

the  British. The out-of-date armament left over h' the United States

and  the  weapons  left behind after the war in Korea  are  now  being

handed over to the Alliance Government. The Alliance Government is now

trying  to  arm our people with these out-of-date weapons. Had  Dulles

known  this, he would have laughed in his grave, because his  plan  of

Asian people fighting against Asian people has now been realised.  The

U.S.  Military  Mission  has come to Malaya to  have  talks  with  the

Alliance Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>



Tun Razak has also said that Malaysia is prepared to send aid to South Vietnam  to help the Government there. All this proves that  they  are irresponsible. All this has been carried out to serve the interests of

the  foreign  powers. That is why they want our people  to  fight  the

people  in North Borneo. Therefore, in the interest of our people  and

the  interest of the people in North Borneo, I earnestly urge  Members

of  all  Parties  in this House to forget their party differences  and

protect  the lives and properties of the people by bringing them  back

from the brink of war.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Member for Paya Lebar wrote to me, as Leader of the House, asking that

the Assembly be summoned under Emergency conditions in order to debate

this  motion.  I  replied to him that since his motion  mentioned  the

policies  of  the Alliance Government and the administrative  measures

taken  by  the Central Government, it was right and proper  that  this

motion  should  be debated in the Central Parliament in Kuala  Lumpur.

This  suggestion, as I have seen, has not been taken up by the Barisan

Sosialis.  We have had two meetings of Parliament since he last  wrote

to  me,  and  none of their representatives in the Dewan  Ra'ayat  has

sought  the opportunity to debate this motion of theirs in  the  Dewan

Ra'ayat, as they ought to if they are nationalist leaders. They  have,

however,  preferred to act as "big frog in a little  well",  and  have

asked  this House to debate this motion which has been put up  in  the

name of the Member for Paya Lebar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one consistency in the Barisan Sosialis despite changes

in  their  leadership.  Their Party is now without  a  Chairman;  they

talked of their Secretary-General, but no mention is made of the Party

Chairman.  The  only  consistency in the  Barisan  Sosialis  is  their

support for Indonesia against Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two and a half years ago when in this House we debated the Referendum



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>



Bill,  at  that time, their Member for Thomson, Mr S.  T.  Bani,  now

Member  for Crawford, significantly mentioned that Indonesia  was  the

heart-land  of  Malaysia. At that time, among  some  sections  of  the

public,  little importance was attached to that statement. But  it  is

now  transparently clear in the light of recent developments  why  the

Member  for  Crawford,  Mr S. T. Bani, had  insisted  that  Indonesia

should  be the heart-land of Malaysia. This underlies all the  actions

taken  and  statements made by the Barisan Sosialis - their statements

opposing  Malaysia and national service and their action in organising

a  demonstration at Hong Lim Park against national service.  All  this

amounts to really a big sell-out by the Barisan Sosialis of the people

of  Singapore.  What they are asking us is to substitute parliamentary

democracy,  which they are enjoying here today, for guided  democracy;

economic progress for economic stagnation and decline. They are asking

the people to substitute, or to change over from eating rice to eating

corn, and they are asking us to relinquish our independence so that we

can come under Indonesian hegemony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us review the stand which has been taken by the Barisan Sosialis

since  the first signs of disaffection broke out in this part  of  the

world.  They have openly declared their support for Azahari  when  the

rebellion broke out in Brunei. In fact, it was pointed out in a  White

Paper  released subsequently that there was a conspiracy in which  the

Barisan Sosialis agreed to provide assistance for Azahari's rebellion.

When the Indonesians sent guerillas to infiltrate the borders of Sabah

and  Sarawak  and  even  when long-houses were attacked,  the  Barisan

Sosialis came out in support of what was called the "liberation  army"

of  Sarawak. In fact, a number of Barisan Sosialis leaders,  including

the  ex-Chairman and Secretary, went across to Kuching and other parts

of  Sarawak to incite disaffection and raise the standard of rebellion

in  Sarawak.  But  as  we all know, these pseudo-revolutionaries  were

unceremoniously thrown out by the Sarawak Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we see a sorry sight, when Indonesians are attacking the borders

of  Malaya  itself, when Indonesians are exploding bombs in Singapore,

when  Indonesians are attacking our fishermen, robbing them  and  even

kidnapping  them,  there has been no word of protest  by  the  Barisan

Sosialis against these acts of aggression. On the contrary, they  have

expressed sympathy for the Indonesian cause. They have not at any time

spoken  in  favour of our own cause - the cause of our own  people,  but

they wax eloquent against Malaysia and support for Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the space of three months, Mr Speaker, we have had landings at

Pontian, Lahis and Muar. Altogether there must have been at least -  a

rough  estimate  from news that can be gathered from Press

reports  - about  300 odd or more Indonesian guerillas who have landed on Malayan

shores. There have even been more attacks on Malaysian fishermen. What

do  the  Barisan expect? Do they intend that we should keep our  hands

tied,  that we do not defend ourselves, and that we apologise  to  the

Indonesians for these acts of aggression? This is, in fact,  what  the

Barisan  Sosialis  are doing. The Barisan Sosialis  perhaps  would  do

better  to  use this opportunity to unite and rally all the  races  in

Malaysia and make this a first-class Opportunity for laying the founda

tion for our Malaysian nation, rather than making Malaysia an issue to

split  the  races.  That, unfortunately, has been the  consequence  of

Barisan's support for Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two methods by which Indonesia hopes to crush Malaysia. The

first  method is to utilise military aggression. The second method  is

to  use  subversion - subversion in which race can be  pitted  against

race  -  so  that ultimately the Indonesians hope that  Malaysia  will

fall,  not  because of external pressures, but from internal collapse.

And the Barisan is doing nothing better than to assist the Indonesians

in this subversion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a sorry sight, Mr Speaker, to see in front of us Members of the

Legislative  Assembly who, at this moment, when  they  ought  to  show

their  patriotism, working on the side of the enemy. Rather  than  the

Barisan  Sosialis leaders should have wasted their energies misleading

innocent  school-boys  and schoolgirls in an  attempted  demonstration

against national service in September last month, and causing a number

of  these innocent school-boys and schoolgirls to land up ingloriously

in  court  and  in  gaol, they should have devoted their  energies  to

promulgating the cause of the Malaysian nation. But theirs has been  a

destructive policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House will have noticed that the Member for Choa Chu

Kang  is missing from this House today having paid the price for being

indiscreet enough to be caught at the demonstration. But I gather that

the Member for Paya Lebar and the Member for ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> And the Member for Jurong were watching.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> --- and the Member for Jurong were more cagey. They

were hiding behind the skirts of school-girls and were discreet enough

to  remain in hiding until all the mass was cleared by the Police.  If

this  is  the capacity for leadership as shown by the present  Barisan

Sosialis  leaders, then I say that if this country were to  listen  to

them,  they would be leading us into, not only just disglory,  but  to

hell.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are all aware that our own military setup is

inadequate  even  for our own internal defence. And because  of  this,

everybody  knows - it is not a secret - that New Zealand  troops  were

asked  to  assist Malaysian forces to wipe out paratroopers  who  were

dropped  at  Labis  on  2nd September, and more  recently,  Australian

troops  were involved in confronting the guerillas who landed in  Muar

at the end of last month. It is not desirable for us to depend all the

time  on foreign troops to assist us in our defence. For then,  surely

we will be laid with the charge that we are a neo-colonialist force.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



having to depend upon foreign troops for our own  defence.

We accept at this juncture while our own forces are inadequate that it

is  necessary  that  we  should  rely upon  British  troops  and  even

Australian  and New Zealand forces. However, it is important  that  we

ourselves should build up our own military forces in order to  protect

our own independence. No independent country can survive the pressures

which  are  exerted  upon  it  in this world  of  international  power

politics, unless it is prepared to defend its freedom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Israel, young boys and girls of 18 and 19 years old are conscripted

to  serve for two years in the national service. On the one hand, they

are  taught  to carry a rifle and, on the other hand, they  carry  the

plough,  and they are taught how to drive a tractor. This is  possible

because  the Israelis are aware that the only way they can defend  the

integrity of their country is to demonstrate an expressive ability  to

fight and die for their country's independence. Even the neutralism of

Switzerland  must be defended by military means. Neutralism  does  not

come  by  itself  or  is  given on a platter to countries  which  just

declare  that they are neutral. In Switzerland, young men of 20  years

old are called to serve in the militia, and they remain in the militia

from the age of 20 years to 50 years during which they undergo periods

of  military  training. They take back their arms with them  to  their

homes and, at a moment's notice, the country can mobilize thousands of

militia  men.  And  this has made it possible for Switzerland  not  to

maintain a standing army.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia is an independent country. Singapore is independent by virtue

of  our integration with Malaysia, and therefore it is necessary  that

we  should be prepared to defend our independence. The alternative  is

to  remain  passive and subsequently fall and succumb to the pressures

which  will  be exerted on us not only from Indonesia but  from  other

parts.  Let  me just ask the Barisan Sosialis one simple question.  Do

they  or do they not agree to foreign troops helping us to defend  our

independence?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



If they do not agree, will the Barisan Sosialis leaders act as a

stop-gap?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, national service is no shame. In fact, all newly emergent

countries in the Afro-Asian world have made it a point to ensure their

independence by indoctrinating the youths of their countries into  the

significance  and  nature of independence, partly  by  propaganda  and

partly through national service. Rather than agreeing with the Barisan

Sosialis  on  their  motion  to urge the Central  Government  to  stop

conscripting such youths for military service, I must say it is a pity

indeed that so far only 100 Singapore's young men have been called  up

for  military training. Over 50,000 young men in Singapore have signed

up for national service, and indeed it is regrettable that up to date,

to  our  knowledge, only 100 have been called up. It is our hope  that

more people in Singapore will be given a chance of demonstrating their

loyalty  to  this  country and to show in no uncertain  fashion  their

determination to defend our independence and all that we stand for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to move an amendment to the motion submitted

by the Member for Paya Lebar:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the word "following" in line 2, to leave out the rest of the

motion, and insert the following words -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Indonesia's policy of aggression and subversion, this House calls

upon  the Central Government to take all measures to secure the safety

of  the  lives and property of our citizens, and for this  purpose  to

give our youth proper military training to help defend the sovereignty

of our nation.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment is in order. The Clerk will now distribute

to  Members  copies  of the amendment proposed  by  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of the amendment accordingly distributed to hon. Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The first Question is, "That the words proposed to be

left  out, be left out." The debate may include the words proposed  to

be left out and those proposed to be inserted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I draw the attention of the House to Standing Order 39. I do not

want  to read out the whole of that Standing Order. It is quite  long.

But for our present purposes the gist of it is this. The House may, if

it so desires, debate at the same time the original motion as proposed

by the mover of the motion, the words to be left out, and the words to

be  added as proposed by the Deputy Prime Minister. If the House feels

that  it is convenient to do this, then we may do so. But if the House

feels that it wishes to debate the amendment first and then go hack to

the  original motion, the House may also do that. I am entirely in the

hands  of the House as to what it proposes to do. Perhaps it might  be

more  convenient if the amendment and the original motion  be  debated

together,  and,  at  the proper time, I shall just put  the  questions

simpliciter. Is that the general view of the House?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The debate may then range over the amendment, the words

to  be left out, the words to be inserted, and the original motion. At

the  appropriate juncture I shall put the motion just simpliciter  and

ask Members to vote thereon.



<br><br>4.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I oppose the amendment before us. This amendment motion is mainly to counter our motion, its effect

would  be  to  force  all our people to be conscripted  to  fight  for

something  which  is  against our interests. We have  brought  up  our

motion in the belief that conscription is against the interests of all

the  people  of Singapore. To force our people to be soldiers  and  to

force  them  to go to war would only destroy the family lives  of  our

people.  It would also separate families. It would cause the  loss  of

many  lives  and  property. More serious than this is  the  fact  that

Malaya  has  been brought into a war to promote the interests  of  the

Anglo-American imperialists and colonialists. We have been involved in

an aggressive war in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



interests  of  the imperialists in SouthEast Asia. Through  their

so-called merger with Malaya the Lee Kuan Yew clique has handed over  our

political, citizenship, and financial rights to the Central Government

in  the  name  of Malaysia. All important decisions which  affect  the

1,700,000 people of Singapore - and to quote one example, conscription - are in the hands of the

Alliance  Government. Perhaps on this matter, Prime Minister Lee  Kuan

Yew ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Lee Kuan Yew happens to be the Prime Minister

of  Singapore. Will the Member refer to him by his designation and not

by his name?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Perhaps  the Prime Minister, Mr Lee, who said that we are limited  by

law, perhaps the Lee Kuan Yew clique will say that ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Member wants to use the word `clique', I

have  no objection to his using "the Prime Minister's clique" but  not

"Mr Lee Kuan Yew's clique".



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

On  this matter, the State Government has the obligation to accept our

motion  before  the  House,  a  motion  that  will  urge  the  Central

Government  not to carry out this reactionary measure in  forcing  our

youths to become soldiers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, why do I oppose the amendment before us? It is

because  this  amendment  is chiefly aimed at  the  following  points.

Firstly, the people have no obligation to protect the product of

neo-colonialists,  namely, Malaysia. Prime Minister  Lee's  clique  cannot

rebut this -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Just the "Prime Minister" and not "Prime Minister

Lee".



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  perhaps  due to the  difficulties  in  regard  to

terminology as between Chinese and English, in other words, because of

the  transposition  of  words in the course of  the  translation,  the

translation  has appeared to be as you have heard. Malaysia  has  been

brought  about  by the scheme of three parties, namely,  the  British,

Malaya and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



Singapore. The "three big men" have had meetings at Cameron  Highlands

over  venison,  satay and golf, at the end of which  they  came  to  a

decision.  This scheme has been an open secret. Everybody  knows  that

the Federation of Malaya is really serving the interests of the

Anglo-American  imperialists.  Since that is so,  what  obligations  do  the

people have that they should shed their blood and sacrifice themselves

in order to safeguard British property in Malaysia?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the purpose of military training is to send the conscripts

to North Borneo to wage war. This fact cannot be covered by any

smoke-screen. It is very clear. The war in North Borneo is the result of the

British  rulers' intention, through constitutional means, to  suppress

the  desire  of the North Borneo people to gain national  independence

and  self-determination. The North Bornean people  want  to  shed  off

foreign  rule  and  domination. They want national independence.  This

request is right and proper. The desires and ambitions of North Borneo

cannot   be  obstructed  by  any  imperialist  designs.  The   British

colonialists, who are devils, are trying to show themselves as  angels

and to cause Asians to fight amongst themselves. What cause do we have

to fight for the British imperialists and colonialists?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, under the phoney merger, all rights and political interests

have  been sold out. The so-called autonomy in labour and autonomy  in

education which have been claimed by the Prime Minister's clique  have

been  seen  through. The recent legislation restricting students  from

entering  the universities is a very good example. Their  rights  have

been severed. Those who harm others will in the end harm themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, conscription is part of the designs of the Alliance to

expand  their war-like preparations. It is also part of the scheme  of

war of the imperialists. The establishment of Malaysia, in fact, meets

the military aim of the Anglo-American imperialists to start a new war

of aggression in South-East Asia. Thus from the day Malaysia was born,

it was doomed. Its fate has been doomed since



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>



its  birth,  because it will have to shoulder the burden of  armaments

and war, and become cannon fodder for the foreign imperialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, we oppose the conscription of our youths and their military

training  so  to  become  cannon fodder to satisfy  the  imperialists'

greedy  desire.  Such  an  aim is contrary  to  the  Charter  and  the

principles  of  the  United  Nations,  and  the  principle  of

self-determination as declared by the conference of the nonaligned  nations

in  Cairo. It is also contrary to the spirit of self-determination  of

the people in the colonies. The people's opposition to conscription to

fight  a  war  for  the  interests  of  foreigners,  colonialists  and

imperialists  is  fully  in  keeping  with  the  principles  of  newly

independent Afro-Asian nations. The people want to get their right  of

self-determination  from  the British colonialists.  We  have  now  an

obligation  to help them to fight the people of North Borneo.  If  the

P.A.P. want to act in the manner they have claimed, then they  should

support  the  declaration  of  the non-aligned  nations.  The  Barisan

Sosialis  is a Party that has the interests and welfare of the  people

at  heart.  Since the P.A.P. clique have rebelled against the  people,

serious consequences and adverse conditions have been brought upon the

people  of  Singapore.  I will now repeat that  facts  have  blatantly

exposed  the  lies  of  the Prime Minister's clique.  Their  so-called

prosperity,  happiness,  peace  and all  such  slogans  and  beautiful

phrases  have come to nothing. They are like water bubbles. But  facts

are facts. The Prime Minister cannot deny them. It is clear for all to

see  that  there has been a big increase in unemployment with  serious

losses  to  all  concerned and an economic depression all  round.  The

P.A.P. ruling clique have been suppressing the people, suppressing the

news,  facts  and information concerning the true situation  in  order

that  the people may not know the facts. The traitorous clique of  the

Prime  Minister  have  gone all out to arrest patriotic  people.  They

control  the Press, create public opinion and fabricate false news  in

order to blind the eyes of the people - [Interruption.]



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member please continue with his speech?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Up  till  now, the clique of the Prime Minister are just like drowning

persons  catching  at  straws  to  prolong  their  lives.  Their  true

intentions  have  been  exposed. All of a sudden,  they  imagine  that

confrontation  has  afforded them the last chance  of  survival.  They

shout  that the people of Malaysia should be united in order to defend

themselves  against  foreign aggression. They  lie  that  the  Barisan

Sosialis  is  pro-Indonesia  and is traitorous.  They  are  just  like

gamblers  who  resort to cheating in order to win. But what  they  are

holding on to is a straw that cannot save their lives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the present situation is brought about entirely as a

result  of  Malaysia.  These people who are asking  others  to  defend

Malaysia should themselves take up arms - the son of the Minister  for

Finance  is  of  age now - and they should ask their  own  sons  to  be

conscripted. Also the sons of people in the traitorous clique  of  the

Prime Minister who are staying in their ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Member refrain from using the words

"traitorous clique"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

These  people  who  try to collaborate with imperialists  and  foreign

colonialists  should not ask the people to support and die  for  them.

The  Prime  Minister's clique say that we are an anti-Malaysia  group.

But there are other Afro-Asian countries, for example China, which are

also  opposed to Malaysia. Then why do the clique not say that we  are

also  pro-China  as well as pro-Afro-Asian countries?  Formerly,  they

said  that we have been pro-China. Why do they now turn round and  say

that we have been pro-Indonesia ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> A question has been asked. May I say, "Because it

is  Indonesian troops that have landed in Malaya. It is the Indonesian

terrorists  who  are  in  Malaya, Sabah and Sarawak.  Not  Chinese  or

African troops." That is why.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, our Party is in the forefront of the struggle  for

the  people. Our principles and our aims are fully in accord with  the

interests  and welfare of the people. The only people who can  control

us  are the general masses. If you want to ask us whom we are for,  we

can  say that we are for the people. We are pro-the-people. The P.A.P.

who want to shake their tails in front of the British colonialists try

their  best  to shift their blame on to others and to cover  up  their

anti-people  nature. They try in every way to smear  and  slander  all

those who are patriotic and innocent. As representatives of the people

who  are suppressed, we have an obligation to speak for the people who

desire peace. We insist on our correct stand. The Member for Choa  Chu

Kang has already shown a very brave and valiant example ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order. Can an action which has

resulted  in  a  criminal prosecution with a term of  imprisonment  be

properly called "heroic conduct" in this Assembly?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tan Cheng Tong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No. Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not putting a retort.

I  am  really asking for a ruling on this because it seems to me  that

the  Member for Jalan Kayu was referring to the heroic conduct of  the

Member for Choa Chu Kang who was arrested for breaking the law,  tried

in  a court of law and convicted, and is now serving a sentence of six

months.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think it is a matter of opinion. The Member for Jalan

Kayu is entitled to his opinion on that. Mr Tan Cheng Tong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Nehru was also arrested and imprisoned. There are other  national

heroes and democratic people who have been arrested and imprisoned  by

their colonial masters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in order not to allow the anti-national clique of

the  Prime  Minister to escape our censure and not to  allow  them  to

blindfold us, I think I had better give a very clear example to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>



show  the  truth.  A woman cannot bear a child without  having  sexual

relationship  with a male. Malaysia is caused by the political  sexual

relationship between the P.A.P. and the Tengku's Alliance  ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must warn the Member not to use offensive

language in this House. [Laughter]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Dirty mind!



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> He can make his point. [Laughter] Will the Member for

Jalan  Kayu please refrain from laughing? I must ask him to use proper

language in this House, otherwise I shall ask him to sit down. Mr Tan

Cheng Tong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, these facts relating to nature are common knowledge

which anyone can understand. So I need not talk further on this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the political promiscuity between the parties

Who  can  be  blamed  for  this? We can only  blame  the  P.A.P.,  the

traitors. They have achieved this because of their own desires. Here I

hope  that  the  Backbenchers  in the  Government  would  respect  the

interests of the people and choose the road of peace. This  is  not  a

political  dispute.  This suggestion relates to  an  issue  which  has

immediate  concern for the interests of the people. I hope  they  will

choose  to get out of the clique of the P.A.P. and support the  motion

before the House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, we have earlier heard Members of the Opposition talking about and defining war. They say there are

different types of war - anti-national war, anti-aggression war  and

liberation war. The Barisan Sosialis' understanding of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>



liberation  war  is  this - that it is an act by  which  anti-national

elements  try  to overthrow a constitutional government.  The  Barisan

Sosialis  want  the people of this country to commit an  anti-national

act by rising up and destroying the nation. But they do not say so  in

many  words. We have heard also that the Barisan Sosialis  adopts  the

anti-Malaysian  stand because we did not accept the  advice  given  by

their  Secretary-General. The Barisan Sosialis is now left  without  a

Chairman  although  it has its Secretary-General. I  remember  hearing

that  the  Barisan  Sosialis members are not interested  in  having  a

Chairman.  That is why their Party is still without one. In fact,  one

of  the  members  of  the Barisan Sosialis has said  that  he  is  not

interested whether his Party has a Chairman or not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar has said just now that Lim Chin Siong, their

Party  Secretary, advised with sincerity that we should not take  part

in  Malaysia.  Because we refused to accept his  advice,  the  Barisan

Sosialis are now against us and against Malaysia. I think the  members

of  the Barisan Sosialis can still remember that their Party Secretary

also said, with the same degree of sincerity, to the British at a  tea

party, that they wanted to have a self-governing country instead of  a

completely  independent country. They were prepared to hand  over  the

right  of self-determination to the British. They did not support  the

call for independence completely. This shows that they are not so

anti-colonial as they claim to be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about their loyalty, the Member for Paya Lebar has said that

the  Government  has described all those whom they  dislike  as

anti-national  and disloyal elements. Now, Mr Speaker, when the nation  is

faced with a crisis, it is for us to back it up. At this juncture  the

Barisan  Sosialis should call upon the people to take part in national

service  to  support  and  defend our  country.  But  they  have  done

otherwise. So they have disqualified themselves as representatives  of

the people. Furthermore, they have even tried to mislead some students

and  youths to take part in illegal processions and demonstrations  in

order to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>



bring further disorder to our country. I remember in the past Mr Chor

Kok  Thong, a former member of the Barisan Central Committee,  saying

something about loyalty and democracy. On the eve of leaving Singapore

for  China, he said that he never showed any loyalty to Singapore  and

this  nation.  These are words that have come from  a  member  of  the

Central  Committee of the Barisan Sosialis. He said that he was  never

loyal   to   our   country.   These  words  are   representative   and

characteristic of the leadership of the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, what we are not clear about is whether they have been

really  logical. Our national integrity is never doubted  among

Afro-Asian  countries. We have been recognised by many countries  in

Afro-Asia. But there are still some elements in Singapore, our own country,

who  still  doubt  our  national integrity and  sovereignty,  when  we

already  have it. Mr Speaker, this is something that is very puzzling

to  me.  At a time when Indonesian troops are killing and slaughtering

our people on the border of Borneo, and at a time when open aggression

has  been  shown by Indonesian landings in Labis, Malacca and Pontian,

the Barisan Sosialis have said nothing to condemn the Indonesians.  On

the  contrary, they have turned round to say that we are  forcing  the

people  to fight against such aggression. We do not deny that in  deal

ing  with  these invaders, as the Deputy Prime Minister has said  just

now,  we have to obtain help from New Zealand and Australia. But  this

help has been described as a threat to our nation, whereas Indonesia's

open  aggression is never considered as a threat to us by the  Barisan

Sosialis. It is very clear that there are Indonesian guerrillas on the

border  of  Sabah and Sarawak trying to disrupt our national  security

and  killing  our people. But the Barisan Sosialis have  said  nothing

against  it. They say that the Indonesians are part of the  Sahah  and

Sarawak  people. This is their logic. It is not so strange as one  may

seem  to think, because the hero in the Barisan Sosialis, Mr Lim Chin

Siong, has already suggested a federation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



between  Singapore  and  Indonesia. By this  logic  Indonesian  guerrilla

activities are described by them as acts of heroes fighting for

self-determination and national liberation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Barisan Sosialis have not been successful in acting

as  the agent of their Indonesian master. That is why their master now

has  some  doubts about them. Knowing this, the Barisan  Sosialis  are

trying  to get back the favour that their master used to give them  in

order to regain the position that they used to enjoy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in various countries in the world, whether in Afro-Asia

or  Europe, national service has been considered as an honour  to  the

citizens.  The people feel proud to be able to take part  in  national

service  in  defence of their own country. This is a great  honour  to

loyal  citizens. But to the Bansan Sosialis, to escape  from  national

service  is not shameful at all. Instead of encouraging our youths  to

take part in national service, they want them to boycott it. This is a

very  irresponsible act. The self-determination and sovereignty  of  a

country should be safeguarded by us. We should not depend for too long

a  time on foreign aid to defend our own rights. National service is a

step  towards  strengthening our military power to protect  ourselves.

But  the Barisan Sosiahis do not like this. Instead, they suggest that

we  should open our doors wide and invite their Indonesian friends  to

come in with great honour. This is a very clear example of their

anti-national sentiments.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think this is a convenient time to take the tea break. I suspend the sitting of the House and will resume the Chair at 5.30 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Poh Ber Liak, in Mandarin.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak (Tampines)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like to air my views on certain points raised by the Deputy Prime

Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture.

All they have said is mere nonsense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that war will bring disaster to the people; war will cause

loss  of support to aged parents; war will cause disintegration  among

families.  Therefore, we firmly oppose war and the  military  training

measures which are pursued by the Government, because this will affect

the  normal livelihood of the people. The spread of war may also cause

loss  of  lives  among the people. Therefore, we must  point  out  the

fallacy  uttered  by the Deputy Prime Minister and  the  Parliamentary

Secretary,  in saying that the State Assembly should not  debate  this

question. Why should that be so, since the question involves the lives

and  property of the people? We are totally opposed to what they  have

propounded just now. The State Legislature has full rights  and  is  a

proper  place  to discuss the question which is posed before  us.  The

Singapore  Government  should pay attention  to  this  question  which

affects the lives and future of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the war in North Borneo, the Deputy Prime Minister has

accused the Barisan Sosialis by saying that we should not support  the

war  waged  by the people in North Borneo. We know that the war  there

was  the  outcome of the people's uprising there. Does the P.A.P. not

realise that Party Rakyat has got the support of the people in  Brunei

and   that  this  was  initiated  by  the  British  colonialists?   As

representatives  of the people, we have a duty and  responsibility  to

offer them support on humanitarian grounds. But the Government has put

forward  all kinds of falsehoods, pretexts and excuses, and fabricated

all sorts of rumours in order to suppress the democratic people ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I understand some earphones are not switched off.

Will  hon.  Members please see that their earphones are switched  off,

because  it  does  interrupt the proceedings and we do  not  want  the

proceedings interrupted, do we?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The P.A.P. tactic has been to

fabricate all sorts of rumours in order to confuse and mislead the

people. Like the other reactionaries in Malaya, the P.A.P. are trying

to mislead the people by saying that the democratic people here are

pro-China and pro-Communist. But now they have changed their tune by

saying that we are pro-Communist and accuse us of being pro-Indonesia.

They say that we have connections with Indonesia. All these deceitful

statements will be exposed to the people. All these falsehoods will

not be of avail and they will have to fabricate other falsehoods. All

these schemings are like those of a woman who wants to change her

lipstick.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the present dispute between Indonesia and Malaysia arose

from  the  establishment of Malaysia. It also severed trade  relations

between  the  two countries. The economic situation in  Singapore  has

deteriorated.  All firms and factories are in a semi-paralysed  state.

Shops  are  faced  with difficulties because of a  trade  slump.  Many

businessmen are earning less and less. All these difficulties are  the

outcome  of  the  scheme pursued by the P.A.P. and  the  Alliance  in

setting  up Malaysia. If the P.A.P. and the Alliance had not supported

the  British Government on the question of Malaysia, then there  would

not  have been such a dispute between Malaysia and Indonesia and there

would  not  have been this confrontation and slump in trade,  so  that

businessmen, hawkers and people from all walks of life would have been

able  to  live  a happy life without Malaysia. All these  difficulties

were created by the P.A.P. and the Alliance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are opposed to the policy pursued by the Alliance Government in

regard  to  Malaysia. Therefore, we staged our peaceful  demonstration

against conscription in protest against the war policy of the Alliance

Government. We opposed the Alliance Government because they wanted  to

force  our  youths to go to the battlefield to become  cannon  fodder.

There is nothing surprising in their attitude. It can only expose  the

P.A.P.'s inability to work for the interests of the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister has talked about so many difficulties they have to face. He says they should not depend on foreign aid and military assistance, and that we should build up our own defence. Now

look  at the example of Ceylon. Ceylon is a small country. Yet it does

not depend on foreign troops to protect its independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the Deputy Prime Minister is here, I would like to direct my

criticism at him. "The military pact was created by the people" -  if

they  have any self-respect, they should oppose the Alliance  military

pact with Britain, because this military pact would only lead them  up

a  blind alley. It would lead to our people being forced to fight  for

foreign  powers.  It  would  only lead to foreign  powers  setting  up

numerous military bases on our soil. In the present circumstances, our

troops are under the control of foreign officers. We firmly oppose all

conscription  being carried out in this neo-colonialist Malaysia.  The

present purpose of conscription is not to) serve the interests of  the

people but to serve the interests of foreign powers - neo-colonialists. Conscription means support for the foreign powers to

suppress our own people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether he really

understands the situation in Switzerland. Has Switzerland allowed  any

foreign  powers to set up military bases in her territory?  If  Malaya

pursues  a policy similar to that of Switzerland, of course,  we  will

not  oppose conscription, or the policy of non-alignment. How  can  we

compare  Malaysia  to  Switzerland, which is entirely  different  from

Malaysia?  The Deputy Prime Minister also talks of the help  given  by

New  Zealand,  Australia and Britain. New Zealand and  Australia  have

been  trying  to suppress the peoples of other countries; particularly

Britain after governing Malaya for more than a century and suppressing

the people here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me touch on the points made by the Parliamentary

Secretary   to   the  Minister  for  Culture.  He  has  talked   about

safeguarding our sovereignty and independence. How much



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



does  he  know about sovereignty? If we have sovereignty, how  can  we

allow  foreign troops to be stationed on our soil? How could we  allow

foreign  capitalists to exploit our people? How could we allow foreign

personnel  to control our administration? If we have sovereignty,  why

should  we  not be allowed to take part in the Afro-Asian  non-aligned

conference in Cairo?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also talked of the honour of serving in the army. Where is the

glory  of  serving in the army which is meant to fight,  to  die,  for

foreign  powers? I want to ask, "What soldiers will they become?  Whom

will the soldiers serve? And under whose control are these troops?" If

the army were under the control of a fully independent nation, then it

would,  of course, be a glory to serve in it. However, in our  present

state  of affairs, we are not independent, we are not masters  of  our

own selves, and it is not a glory to serve in an army when it is under

the control of foreign powers.



<br><br>5.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, nobody likes military training or military  service

because  youths  are  compelled to interrupt their  studies  or  their

careers to spend sonic of the most precious periods of their lives  in

training  how  to shoot and kill. What a waste of human resources  and

national  income  even  if what we are prepared  for,  will  never  be

carried out! It has always therefore been a dream of philosophers from

ancient  days to find ways and means to abolish war forever.  But  the

nations of the world have not been so successful in their efforts, and

in spite of the existence of the League of Nations, and now the United

Nations,  there are still wars breaking out now and then in all  parts

of  the  world.  So as long as the threat of war hangs over  us,  most

countries, including neutral countries, have been forced to  introduce

compulsory military service. It is also for that reason that  we  find

the  Socialist  Front and the S.U.P.P. supporting the call-up  in  the

Malaysian Parliament. Mr Speaker, Sir, I therefore cannot agree  with

the motion of the Barisan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sosialis in advocating a complete boycott of military service

altogether.  Moreover,  the  situation  in  the  country  has   become

critical. We are facing the threat of external aggression and internal

disturbances.  Indonesian  troops  have  landed  in  Johore  and  near

Malacca.  Racial  disturbances  have  exploded  on  two  occasions  in

Singapore.  I do believe that unless peace with Indonesia is  restored

in  time, we cannot discount the possibility of Indonesian planes  and

guerillas making raids on Singapore Island itself. We cannot advocate,

therefore,  support  of  a  boycott  of  military  service  in   these

circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking backwards to the 5-13 affair - in those days the fight against

conscription was a correct move. In those days it was the British  who

wanted to conscript the youth of Singapore to fight fellow Malayans of

a  different philosophy in the jungles of Malaya. After ten years  the

situation  has  radically changed. South-East  Asia  will  not  be  as

peaceful as it once was.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of Malaysia has set in motion a chain of events which

even  the founders of Malaysia had least expected. I believe  some  of

the  staunchest  pro-Malaysian leaders are now having second  thoughts

and  praying in their heart of hearts that Malaysia will disintegrate.

They  now realise their former mistakes. But the unfortunate thing  is

that  history  once made cannot be undone. We are now faced  with  the

threat  of  external aggression. The internal situation also  requires

our  utmost  vigilance. The buildup of a local defence force  to  meet

external  pressures and maintain internal peace,  law  and  order,  is

necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many will agree that in the last two civil disturbances the people of

Singapore  would  have  been  better off  seeing  local  troops  being

deployed rather than getting troops from other places who are  not  so

familiar   with  local  conditions.  Military  service  is   therefore

inevitable.  But  I ask that Singapore youths, after training,  should

not  be  sent to other States, particularly to the Borneo territories.

The primary role of Singapore youths after military training should be

for  local  defence. After all, Singapore citizens are in an  inferior

status compared



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



to that of other Malaysian citizens, and it is not fair to  ask

them  to shoulder similar responsibilities as full-fledged first-class

citizens when it is a question of citizenship obligations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I support national service in principle, I would not wish to

support the war-mongering moves of the P.A.P. Government which attempt

to  persuade the British Government to take the initiative of  bombing

Indonesia,  thereby escalating the present conflict into a  full-scale

war. We should condemn not only Indonesian acts of aggression but,  at

the same time, we should expose any move to seek political capital and

political  salvation from an extension of the present  skirmish.  What

consolation  do  we  get if Singapore, Penang  and  Kuala  Lumpur  are

reduced to ashes at the same time as all Indonesian cities are blotted

out?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I see that a solution to the present dispute is not

impossible. Let us take a determined stand and tell Indonesia that  we

will  fight and that we cannot be cowed. But at the same time  let  us

not  fail  to  find  ways and means of re-establishing  peace  in  the

region,  on the basis of a fair and honourable settlement. Only  then,

Sir, can we earn the respect and support of the Afro-Asian nations and

the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot support the amendment of the Deputy

Prime  Minister.  The P.A.P. leadership have now understood  the  real

significance that power in most countries of the world, and more so in

Asia,  rests  in  the barrel of the gun. From North and  South  Korea,

Communist  and  Kuomintang China, North and South  Vietnam,  Thailand,

Burma,  Pakistan  and Indonesia - in the countries of  Asia  stretching

from  the  Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea, we see in  the  lost

analysis  that it is the control of the gun that really decides  where

power shall lie. Only in a few countries, like Japan, the Philippines,

the  Federation of Malaya, India and Ceylon, could the democratic vote

effect  at  least in theory a change of government. But  how  far  the

governments  and  ruling  groups in these countries  would  allow  the

ballot box to effect a genuine



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>



change of government is still left to be seen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. leadership knew from its experience in the last Federal

elections  that it has no hope whatsoever of assuming political  power

in Malaysia. For the P.A.P. knew that not only must it be given a fair

chance  to  compete in the democratic vote in Malaysia  which  it  has

denied  to its opponents in Singapore, but that even if it can win  in

the  democratic  vote, which is not an easy matter, it  is  still  the

control  of the gun that shall finally count. And, therefore, we  find

the  P.A.P. complaining that Singapore youths are not  given  a  fair

chance  to receive proper military training. The Deputy Prime Minister

has  said just now, with real understanding, and perhaps apprehension,

that  only  one hundred of the 50,000 youths registered  for  national

service have been called up to receive military training. For  in  the

minds  of the P.A.P., if the 50,000 youths of Singapore could receive,

as   the   Deputy  Prime  Minister  has  described,  "proper  military

training", we might find ourselves in a situation, in the event of the

Federal-State  relationship  further deteriorating,  a  South  Malayan

army, predominantly Chinese in content, marching into battle against a

North  Malayan  Army  across  the  causeway,  predominantly  Malay  in

composition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore can only be a turtle in a tub. Singapore can never be a

beachhead,  a  launching-pad  to  launch  an  offensive  against   the

Federation.  Yamashita  has proved it. Singapore  cannot  be  a  Cuba,

neither  can  it  be  a  South Korea where the Causeway  is  our  38th

Parallel.  We  have  warned  the P.A.P. of  the  consequences  before

entering  Malaysia. Sir, the die is cast, it is too late  to  retrieve

the  position.  The  present  conflict  between  the  Singapore  State

Government  and the Central Government should be resolved  by  further

consultation. If there is ever the idea of a 50,000 secret army to  be

trained  by  the  Central Government which will one day  come  to  the

rescue  of the P.A.P. Government, I am afraid the idea will not  help.

Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the usual poor intellectual content of the Barisan  has

further  deteriorated. This is proved today by  the  Member  for  Paya

Lebar  who has tabled the motion of anti-national service before  this

House.  Even the Member for Hong Lim does not agree to the motion.  At

one  time, he was shouting similar slogans like the Barisan. Today the

people  of  Malaysia are interested in carrying on  and  fighting  the

invaders who are now fighting in our land. Yet the Barisan has come to

this  House  to  object to national service. This shows  there  is  no

intellectual content in the Party and the Party is gone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the amendment proposed by the

Deputy  Prime Minister. I have heard the Member for Paya Lebar  saying

that the formation of Malaysia has brought misers and hardship to  the

people.  If there is any truth in it, it is encouraged and abetted  by

the  Barisan  who have collaborated with Indonesia. That  the  Barisan

Sosialis is infiltrated by Communists is an open secret and it is this

element which has encouraged Indonesia to confront Malaysia. As  early

as 1962 the Barisan have openly professed their support of an uprising

in  Brunei  led  by  Azahari who is now in  exile  in  Indonesia.  The

Secretary-General  of the Barisan Sosialis. Mr Lim  Chin  Siong,  collaborated with him. The Barisan knew full well that they were not in a

position to fight, to capture power by constitutional means,  so  they

chose  to  capture power by violence. In this connection, the  Barisan

have spread falsehoods and told Indonesia that the people of Singapore

are anti-Malaysia. They hope by this to receive aid from Indonesia  in

order  to  help them to capture power. Is that not the truth? However,

man proposes, but God disposes. This plot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



between  the  Barisan and Indonesia was exposed, and  it  led  to  the

arrest  of Lim Chin Siong and company. Sir, following the arrest,  the

people  came  to  realise that the Barisan are  closely  aligned  with

Indonesian  Communists. That is why the people voted them out  in  the

last  election.  It  is common sense, Sir,If they are  anti-Malaysia,

they  should  not blame the people of Singapore for voting  them  out.

According  to  their logic, if the people had been against  us  -  the

P.A.P. - they would have voted us out in the last general election. It is the

verdict of the people, Sir,If the Opposition had any sense of  shame,

they should by now have realised and kept their mouths shut.



<br><br>6.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, at present Malaysia is isolated  in  international

circles.  It has only the sympathy of Australia, Britain, New  Zealand

and Canada. It can only get support from such countries, but it cannot

get the support of Afro-Asian countries and our neighbours, the Philip

pines,  Thailand  and  other neighbouring countries.  The  reason  why

Malaysia has not been able to get support from Afro-Asian countries is

that  Malaysia  is  controlled by the British in  respect  of  matters

concerning economy, military and politics. For instance, if  there  is

any  matter of importance in public affairs, the P.A.P. would not like

to  consult the Opposition or to solve the problems on the strength of

the  people.  On the other hand, the Government resort  to  help  from

Ottawa, Washington and London. Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government

is  the same as the Central Government, because whenever there is  any

problem confronting it, it will go to London to seek a solution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. and the Alliance Government have not

taken the people's opinions and wishes serious

ly.  On  the contrary, they regard them as enemies, and those who  are

friendly  with Malaya and who are actually loyal have been  termed  by

them  as  traitors. The British military is regarded by them as  their

intimate friends. Do the P.A.P. not know that the British military has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



been  occupying colonies throughout the world and that the  people  of

the  Afro-Asian countries are against neocolonialism? The P.A.P. have

been  suppressing democracy, arresting people, disrupting  the  normal

family  life  of  the people, and causing distress and disaster.  They

regard  the people as their enemies. On the one hand, they oppose  the

Barisan  Sosialis' stand in calling off conscription and fighting  for

the interests of the foreign countries. On the other hand, they try to

step up this action. We should pay heed to Afro-Asian opinion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have three ways to deal with the present situation. Firstly, to

discard all foreign bases and control and to ask all foreign troops to

withdraw  from Malaysian countries. Secondly, to pursue a  non-aligned

policy.  Thirdly, to give the people a greater degree of  freedom  and

democracy. If the people cannot get this, then they have no obligation

to  fight  for the present Government. If the P.A.P. and the  Alliance

Governments cannot put into effect these three suggestions,  then  all

the consequences will be theirs to bear.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, after hearing the Barisan Members just now, I feel  very

disappointed in them. I also feel sad for them. After one whole year's

training in this Assembly, they are still the same as before,  raising

past  issues,  reciting cant phrases and mentioning  anti-colonialism,

neo-colonialism  and the rest of it, similar to what  they  have  been

doing  in  the  past four or five years. There has been no  change  in

their  tune.  They are just like a charlatan selling medicine  to  the

people  on the road side. There has been no change and they are unable

to bring out anything new to show. But times have changed. It is now a

new  era. The present Singapore is very much different from the  Singa

pore  one  year  ago.  Yet their talk, their attitude  and  tune  have

remained the same. This is because of their obstinacy and ignorance in

not  paying attention to the people's wishes. They have thus lost  the

support of the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Paya Lebar has been boasting about the

heroism of his former Secretary-General, attributing merit to him  and

lauding  him  for his achievements. We cannot say that any  individual

can  be  solely  responsible for any contribution  or  achievement  to

society.  But  collectively  we  bring about  better  housing,  better

schools,  better  medical  health and care and  various  projects  and

benefits to the people and improvement in society generally. But  this

so-called hero has he brought about any such things to the people? The

most  he  has done has been to create such unrealistic people  as  the

Members of the Barisan Sosialis who are ignorant of social changes. As

a  Minister, I am not unaware of any problem or hardship in Singapore.

My being a Minister is not by appointment of the British colonialists.

I have been elected by the people - [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I wish Members would allow the Minister to continue his

speech uninterrupted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

As  regards  the motion put up by them, at first I thought they  would

withdraw it because there had been changes in the circumstances and it

was  time for them to withdraw it and yet they have not withdrawn it.

I have given undue credence to their intelligence in taking cognisance

of  the  situation. There is a Chinese classical saying to the  effect

that  everybody has a duty in respect of the existence or death  of  a

country  especially  facing foreign aggression.  Every  duty-conscious

citizen  will rise to the occasion to try to defend and safeguard  his

country.  Now  that  we  are  faced  with  the  crisis  of  Indonesian

aggression and confrontation, many infiltrators and troops have landed

on  our  soil  and many traitors have been carrying out  sabotage  and

destructive work in our country. The Indonesians have unreasonably car

ried out economic confrontation against us, causing economic losses to

us, in  facing  all  these attacks and aggression by  Indonesia,  the

Barisan   Members  have  not  only  refrained  from   condemning   the

Indonesians hut have instead asked us



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



not  to conscript, not to raise an army to defend our country, and not

to  take  any  steps to safeguard our own safety and  integrity.  Now,

this, according to me, is a traitorous act, abetting the enemies,  and

is downright high treason.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Central Government may have some faults in certain mea

sures,  I  do not think that the recent conscription order  is  not  a

correct  policy.  I  think it is correct in this situation.  Malaysia,

since  its  independence, has never had the need  to  conscript  until

Indonesia started its confrontation and aggression. This also goes  to

prove  that  in  the past Malaysia had been carrying  out  a  peaceful

policy.  If the military brings about any inconvenience to our people,

then  I  would say that it is because foreign aggressors have  brought

this  upon us. Then we should first condemn the Indonesians for  their

unreasonable  confrontation and aggression against us,  causing  great

losses to our people. Now, this is the only right and correct step  to

take to safeguard the integrity of our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the bounden duty of every citizen to defend his country. It is

so throughout the world. I cannot see any reason why we should condemn

conscription  at  this  hour.  The  Indonesian  confrontation  against

Malaysia is not only news - a matter pertaining to this area -  but  it

has  also  become headline news throughout the world.  All  democratic

countries  have condemned Indonesian aggression against us except  the

Soviet  bloc.  No other country except the Soviet bloc has  said  that

Malaysia  is  wrong.  Indonesia condemned  Malaysia  in  the  Security

Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that the Barisan Sosialis has condemned the

Malaysian Government for resorting to conscription in defence  of  the

country.  This  proves  that  the Barisan  Sosialis  are  following  a

treasonable line, aligning with the Indonesian aggressors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the debate in the Security Council recently, 11 countries voted in

favour   of  the  Norwegian  draft  resolution  condemning  Indonesian

aggression  against Malaysia. Out of the 11 countries, nine Afro-Asian

countries supported it. Only Russia and Czechoslovakia opposed it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



Russia  had to cast a veto and this blocked the passage of  the  draft

resolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Bukit Merah has said that Malaysia has been

isolated in the Afro-Asian world. But what is the truth? What  is  the

truth  in  the Security Council? Who is isolated? It is  not  us.  The

facts are very clear. World opinion is on the side of Malaysia. If you

think that is the U.S.A. opinion, then it is a kind of Communist stand

to have such a view. Only Indonesia and the Soviet bloc think so. Only

they  condemn  Malasia. Does it not clearly show who is the  aggressor

and who is being attacked? Who are traitors and who are not?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the Member for Paya Lebar has said, there are many kinds of

war -  wars of aggression or wars in defence of the country and others.

Ours  is  a  war  of  defence  to maintain  the  peace,  security  and

sovereignty  of  our  country. It is a just  war.  The  war  waged  by

Indonesia  is  an  aggressive  war, a  neo-imperialist  war  which  is

condemned by all the people in the world. Whereas the Barisan say that

Indonesia's  action should be lauded. Now, this is  a  most  shameless

treasonable statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar has talked about the people of our country

now  and  then.  I  would  like to ask him about  the  so-called  "our

country".  What does he mean? What does he refer to? When I asked  him

this  question,  he dared not answer. To what country  does  the  term

refer?  Then  he  said it refers to Malaya. We have also  heard  about

their  songs, "We love Malaya". "Malaya is our homestead". Now,  since

Malaya  is  their  homestead, why then should they oppose  Singapore's

entry into Malaysia last year?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesians have landed at Pontian, Labis and Muar. All these are

part  of  Malayan  territory and also Malaysian  territory  -  or  the

territory of "our country" as the Member for Paya Lebar has said. Now,

since  the territory of our country has been infringed upon,  and  the

Barisan  Sosialis is a patriotic political Party, why  should  it  not

voice protest against this unreasonable aggression? They say that  the

people  have no obligation to defend Malaysia. But now it  is  Malayan

territory; in other words a part



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>



of  Malaysian  territory that is being infringed  upon.  As  patriotic

elements, do they not have the obligation to defend this country?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Barisan Sosialis themselves are undecided on the

question  of  conscription. If they should agree to this, then  people

might  criticise them for changing steps, if they do not  support  it,

then  people  might criticise them as being unpatriotic. Now,  it  has

caused  internal contradiction and conflict in their Party.  For  many

days  they have been talking across the table, pulling strings  inside

their  own  Party.  It  is entirely their internal  Party  affair.  In

addition  to  this, there are also two views existing in  the  Barisan

Sosialis.  There is the saying that if the nomenclature is not  right,

then  the action is not proper. If the action is not proper, then  the

cause  is  not just. Because of this, they are inciting the people  to

support   their  action.  They  have  organised  an  anti-conscription

demonstration  which  has caused great disgust to  the  people.  As  a

result  of the two recent disturbances in Singapore, people have  been

longing  to  live in peace and security. They hated the  demonstration

sponsored  by  the Barisan Sosialis. The demonstration failed  because

the  people did not co-operate. This is because the mood of the people

has  changed.  For  the sake of the security of the country,  everyone

longs  to  take  up  arms  to  defend the country  against  Indonesian

aggression. But the people in the Barisan Sosialis, on the other hand,

want  to  pour cold water on the heads of the people. Even the  Member

for  Hong  Lim can understand this situation. He dare not support  the

motion  by  the Barisan Sosialis. He also understands that times  have

changed  and  that  there should be a new approach.  But  the  Ban-san

Sosialis cannot see that times have changed, and that there should  be

a  new  formula to deal with the new situation. Conscription to defend

the country is a common system throughout the world. Even Switzerland,

which  is a nonaligned country pursuing a neutralist policy, has  this

system in practice. In fact, the conscription now in force in Malaysia

has shown us that we are no longer in slavery. Why should we have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



conscription  to  defend our own country? It  could  be  left  to  the

masters  to defend it. So it is just as what the Barisan Sosialis  has

said  in  the past -"This land is ours. Except for this land  we  have

nowhere  to  go." If this land unfortunately is occupied by Indonesia,

then our livelihood will be badly affected. That is the reason why  we

should protect and defend our country. The Barisan Sosialis argue that

our  condemnation  of Indonesia is a lie. Do they mean  that  all  the

Indonesian  infiltrators  who  landed in  Labis  and  Muar  were

non-existent?  We had an exhibition recently in Singapore. It was  a  very

successful  exhibition at which weapons like machine-guns supplied  by

the  Indonesian Government were displayed. Do they mean that all these

were faked?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tampines touched on foreign bases. He said that these

bases  should  be  withdrawn. He said that if  these  bases  had  been

withdrawn,  then nothing would have happened. Let me ask  him  whether

Ceylon, which has a powerful neighbour, is in danger of being invaded.

The  answer is no. If Indonesia can assure us that it will not  invade

us;  if the whole world can assure us of our safety and security,  we,

of  course,  will  request the withdrawal of foreign  bases.  But  the

question  is  whether we can get such an assurance from Indonesia,  or

from  the United Nations, to protect our security and safety. If  not,

then how are we going to protect and safeguard our country? Of course,

we  will  then have to arm ourselves and build up our forces. When  we

ask foreign countries to help us, to defend us, they turn round to say

that  it  is  not  proper to do so. Do they mean that  they  want  our

country  to be handed over to another power before they are contented?

The  Barisan speakers and their propaganda have been of no avail. They

are going into a blind alley from which position they cannot save them

selves.  Their action is an anachronism. I hope they will  mend  their

ways.



<br><br>6.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, just



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



now  the  Minister  for  Labour has said that the  Barisan  are  using

hackneyed phrases, and that we are repeating what we have said in  the

past.  That  is  right,  because there  has  been  no  change  in  the

situation. Our former colonial masters are today still controlling the

fate of Singapore and Malaya. Singapore and Malaya are still under the

control  of colonialism. If there is no change in the situation,  then

of  course we will not change our attitude and words. I admit that the

P.A.P. have  changed. They are very fond of changing  themselves  and

their  position. They could pose as anti-colonialists,  and  later  on

they  could also become a pro-colonialist Party. They could co-operate

with  our  Secretary-General and they could also sell  him  out.  They

could also become a woman to please the Tunku. They can also become  a

screw-driver  to  loosen screws or to tune up  the  machinery  of  the

Alliance.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The earphones are not right. They do not seem to

have  been switched off. Will Members responsible for their earphones,

please check? Mr Ong Lian Teng.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Furthermore,  I  believe  that  the Minister  for  Labour  is  also  a

versatile  person  judging from his speech. He  has  referred  to  the

discussions  held  in  the  United Nations  on  Indonesian  aggression

against  Malaysia, and has tried to show that Malaysia has the support

of  world opinion. If he wants to give a full analysis, he should also

mention  the facts of February 1963. He should also mention  the

non-aligned  nations'  Conference in Cairo. It is only  fair  for  him  to

mention these two events.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. are also fickle in this way. They have all Sorts of

propaganda  tactics. Previously they said that the  Barisan  was

pro-China.  Later  they  changed their tune and said  that  we  were

pro-Communist.  Now they say we are pro-Indonesia. This is  a  classic  ex

ample of their incapability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour has also touched on a Chinese saying that when a nation is faced with danger, everybody

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



has  a duty to defend it. However, he has forgotten that there is also

a Chinese saying that good iron will not become nails, and good people

will not become soldiers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members sitting opposite have also said that we should bring up

this  issue  in the Central Parliament. What do they imply  by  saying

this?  Firstly,  I  think they want to pass the buck  to  the  Central

Parliament in order to shirk their responsibility. Secondly, their  in

tention is that maybe the people in Singapore have no rights and  that

everything has to be decided by the Central Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me rebut some of the points raised by the Member for

Stamford.  He  said  that  the border of Sabah  has  been  invaded  by

Indonesian  troops. However, does he know that the Chief  Minister  of

Sabah,  Dato  Stephens, said that about 2,000 youths had escaped  into

the jungle? The Member for Stamford should approach the Chief Minister

of Sabah to find out the real situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The earphones are still not switched off. I wish

Members  will pay attention to their earphones and have them  switched

off, so that the debate will not be interrupted. Mr Ong Lian Teng.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  the  P.A.P. claim to represent  the  interests  of  the

people,  but  the  real  fact is that they only  represent  their  own

interests.  Everybody knows that it is no good to serve in  the  army.

Why  should the P.A.P. ask the people to serve in the army?  They  say

that it is to defend our country. But my colleagues have said that our

country is not fully independent. If we do not have full independence,

obviously  our  youths will be under the control of  British  officers

after  they have completed their training, and they will not be  under

the control of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conscription does not mean looking after the interest of the country.

If  we want our youths to undergo military training for the purpose of

going  to war, this will run counter to their aspirations and  wishes.

We must pursue a policy of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



peace.  If  we want peace, we must find ways and means to resolve  the

dispute between Indonesia and Malaysia. If our youths are conscripted,

what  will  be  the consequences? We can imagine them. There  will  be

disintegration of families. There will be separation of  husbands  and

wives.  What  good  will  it be to send our youths  to  fight  on  the

battlefields of North Borneo? For whom? Even if we gain victory,  what

will  we  benefit? Nothing. Soldiers are needed to safeguard a nation.

Let  me  mention  this.  Tun  Razak has recently  said  that  whenever

possible  Malaysia  will send some of its troops  to  help  the  South

Vietnam  regime. It is very clear what the purpose is  of  our  youths

serving in the army. The first Infantry Regiment of Singapore was sent

to  Sabah.  96  youths from Singapore were sent to  Port  Dickson  for

military  training. All these people have been sent outside Singapore.

We  have to understand the situation, otherwise we ill just be like

blind men.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tunku said on the 14th of August that the United States would

send  a  mission to Malaysia to find out our military needs.  He  said

that  he hoped the United States would give us the same amount of  aid

that  it  was giving India to fight against the Chinese. What will  be

the  result  of this aid? The United States are also aiding  Indonesia

because  they are training Indonesian officers. How can anyone explain

this  paradox? If there is a war in these countries, nobody will  gain

anything  by it. Only the Americans will derive any benefit  from  it.

All these factors should be studied by us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour has touched on the demonstration that took place on the 12th of September. If he is accusing us of repeating ourselves, then we can say the same of him because speeches have been

put  over the radio to the effect that it was the Barisan Sosialis who

wanted to create trouble and disturbances in Singapore. But has he considered  who were responsible for the disturbances before the  Barisan

demontration?  We wanted to discuss this matter in the  Assembly,  but

the P.A.P. did not have the guts to do so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> On a point of order.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member resume his seat?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, I understand that you have already

ruled  that their motion on the communal disturbances in Singapore  is

sub judice. Therefore, it is not to be debate I in this House. But the

hon.  Member said just no that we dare not debate this motion in  the

House  because we were afraid that we would be exposed. I do not think

this is a fact.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member for Bukit Panjang is referring to those

disturbances, then he is out of order, because that matter is now  sub

judice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

I  am  just  recalling the events that took place before the  12th  of

September.  There  was  still a curfew on the night  of  the  12th  of

September.  The  P.A  P. Government made use of  military  troops  and

policemen  to  arrest  some  30  persons.  These  persons   were   not

responsible  for  the racial disturbances. Why was this  action  taken

before  the curfew was lifted? Even before the 11th of September,  the

Government  took  similar  action on  four  occasions.  They  arrested

certain  people and locked them up in gaol without trial.  Why  cannot

the  people express their views on such matters? If the Government can

arrest  people without trial, then the people are entitled to  express

their  views  either for or against this action. The demonstration  on

the  12th of September was one of the means by which the people  tried

to express their views. That is the first point.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I wish the Member would get on with the motion. He can

make his points as he goes along, but he should not dwell on them  too

much and so get out of line with the motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, I have brought up these matters because the Minister for

Labour  has spoken on the demonstration held on the 12th of September.

I have to bring them up by way of reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Minister for Labour has also touched on one other

point,  namely, that Ceylon is not experiencing any foreign  pressure.

Of course, we know that there are no foreign troops in Ceylon. That is

why  there  is  no  external pressure. We can also say  that  Cuba  is

experiencing pressure from foreign sources because at one time foreign

troops were stationed there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Members on the Government side have also said that the Barisan Sosialis have refrained from condemning Indonesia. The question of condemnation of Indonesia has been brought up in the

international field, that is, in the United Nations. We can  challenge

them  now  by saying that if they can cause foreign troops to withdraw

from  our  country, then the democratic rights of our people  will  be

respected.  Give them the freedom which they deserve. As my  colleague

has  said,  if the people have no democratic rights, then their  hands

are  tied and they have no obligation to serve in the army. But if the

Government  is prepared to release all political detainees,  including

those  arrested  during the colonial regime, we will then  change  our

attitude.  We  will  then be prepared to serve in  the  army.  We  are

prepared  to serve in the army provided the Government is prepared  to

do what I have already stated.

that brought about confrontation today.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I did not hear. The seven - what did the Member

by  the consent of the people of Malaysia. Yet they have got the cheek

to come here today and say that they are afraid of the masses, whereas

in  reality  they are working against the wishes of the masses.  These

are the hypocrites who, on the one hand, shed crocodile ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is the Member referring to the seven Members

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member please withdraw that expression?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> Yes. The Barisan Members, on the one hand, shed croco

dile  tears  because of conscription and, on the other  hand,  support

confrontation and Indonesian aggression. Malaysia is at war today, not

cold  war, but physical war. The Indonesians have sent troops here  to

kill  our  innocent  ones. Our brothers and sisters  have  lost  their

lives.  But  what  do  the  Barisan Sosialis  do  today'?  Instead  of

condemning  Indonesia, they have come here instead to ask us  to  stop

conscription  in  the  hope  that the Barisan  Communist  bosses  from

Indonesia will take over Malaysia and that their leaders could  go  on

holiday  overseas  and enjoy their leave with their  different  wives.

Whereas  the  ordinary  people in the street  have  to  eat  rats  for

breakfast, rats for lunch, rats for dinner; and even rat soup  in  the

case of the sick. Why do the Barisan anti-nationals for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>



once  not  denounce confrontation and, condemn Indonesian  aggression?

The  giant  National Trades Union Congress has said that the  workers

are  prepared to fight for Malaysia so that their children  and  their

children's  children  will  be guaranteed three  square  meals  a  day

instead of being forced to eat rats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I had my way today, the people concerned would

not  be allowed to enjoy the privileges of this country. Instead  they

would  be  made  to experience eating rats by banishing  them  to  the

country from where they get their instructions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, when I was elected to this Assembly I thought we

had  13  Opposition  Members, hut now it seems  the  number  has  been

reduced. I sincerely hope that the day will not come when we  have  to

face no opposition at all.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, we call upon the State Government to urge the Central Government to stop forcing our youths to serve in the Army for

good reasons. The Members opposite talk about invasion, aggression and

patriotism.  They try to show that they are very patriotic,  and  very

loyal, more patriotic and more loyal than those who do not agree  with

their  views. They describe those who disagree with them  as  disloyal

and  unpatriotic. They even go to the extent of saying that we are for

aggression.  Before one can come to the-conclusion that the  other  is

patriotic or not, one has to go into the actual facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say that Malaysia is the brainchild of neo-colonialism. The P.A.P.

want  our  people to be loyal to the British colonial  masters.  Their

patriotism is not based on the interests of the people but on those of

their colonial masters. There are different forms of patriotism. Japan

and  Hitler  of  Germany had their own ideas about  patriotism.  Their

patriotism was one of aggression. That is one form of patriotism.  The

colonial  masters want to continue their rule over foreign  lands  and

they also require some form of loyalty of the' colonial people to  the

ruling clique. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>



so-called patriotism of the P.A.P. belongs to the second category that

I have described.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have already made our stand very clear. We cannot

make  it any clearer. There is a war going on in Borneo. They say that

Borneo  is  being invaded. So let me deal with this point now.  Borneo

belongs  to  the people of Borneo. It is the British who  have  forced

their  way  into North Borneo and occupied it. As the waves  of

anti-colonialism mount, the people rise to the occasion to drive away their

colonial  masters.  They do not want to be ruled by  the  British  any

longer.  So  for fear that the people will succeed in getting  rid  of

them,  the  British thought of an idea by including  North  Borneo  in

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the British, the Alliance Government has sent some troops to

suppress the uprising in North Borneo. Now, who is being invaded?  The

P.A.P., although it is without any troops, is also shouting that North

Borneo  is  being  invaded by foreigners. Who is  actually  guilty  of

aggression? Has anyone the right to deny the right of the people of  a

country  to fight against foreign rule? The people of Borneo  want  to

fight  for  their  own rights. They want to fight  for  democracy  and

independence. Borneo belongs to them and they want to regain it from a

foreign  ruler.  So  the  British should  actually  leave  the  matter

entirely  in the hands of the Borneo people. Because of the  formation

of Malaysia by force, there is trouble going on in North Borneo. There

is  also trouble arising from conscription. The ruling clique want the

people  of  Singapore  and  Malaya to support  the  British  in  their

suppressive actions against the people of Borneo. How can we give them

such support? No, certainly not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present juncture, the Alliance Government and the P.A.P. are

faced  with  certain  difficulties arising out  of  the  formation  of

Malaysia  by  force.  Because of this the  people  are  against  them.

Internationally   they  have  received  criticisms   from   Afro-Asian

countries; internally they are isolated. So to resolve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



all  these  difficulties, they have no alternative but to  expand  the

armed forces and to prepare for war. The Alliance Government, in doing

this  and  in trying to obtain the support of the people,  are  making

full  use  of  the expression "loyalty and patriotism".  They  try  to

equate  the interests of the minority to the interests of the majority

in  the  view of the broad masses of the people. They try to say  that

the  fight for their own interests is a fight for the interests of the

people. What good will anyone get from this fight?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the P.A.P. contend that conscription is intended for the

defence of our own nation. The Minister for Labour has said that every

citizen  has a duty to his nation when it is confronted with a crisis.

Others  have said that it is an honour to serve in the army. Yes,  all

this  is  very  true. But we want to ask this question: if  we  should

serve  in  the army today, as they say, to defend Malaysia, what  good

will  it  do  to the people? Malaysia has been formed and  within  the

short  space of a year a series of events have taken place,  and  some

events are still taking place, much to the disadvantage of the people.

They  say  that  Malaysia will bring prosperity and happiness  to  the

people.  But during the course of the formation of Malaysia,  we  have

mounting  unemployment,  a  great  slump  in  trade,  and  a  lot   of

businessmen  have  to  put down their shutters. This  what  they  call

"prosperity and happiness". If we were asked to defend something  that

is  useless  to the people, it would be absurd. No one  in  his  right

senses will ever do this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other important point. You may say that Malaysia is now

independent.  But  who  is in actual control of  the  forces?  Who  is

directing the war in North Borneo? It is none other than the colonial

masters - the British. They are all in actual control of our forces. Are

they doing all this for the interests of the people of Malaysia'?  No,

they  are  doing  it  for their own interests  because  they  want  to

continue with their exploitation in this region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time when Malaya was invaded by the Japanese, that was the time

when the Malaysian people required



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



foreign  aid. But what happened to the British troops then  that  were

described as troops fighting for our interests? Who actually  rose  to

fight against the Japanese? The P.A.P., the Australian troops, or  the

British  troops? I believe, Mr Speaker, they would not have the  guts

to  answer my question. Those who are capable of safeguarding Malaysia

are  our  own people, not foreign troops. The words and utterances  of

the  P.A.P. are not different from those of the imperialists. How  can

one  imagine that the independence and freedom of a nation require the

protection of a foreign power?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, not so long ago the nonaligned nations held a conference

in  Cairo. What were the resolutions of that conference? Those  taking

part  in  that  conference resolved on an immediate and  unconditional

withdrawal of foreign troops from colonial countries. On the agenda of

that conference, foreign bases was a topic for discussion. On this mat

ter their resolution called upon the imperialists to give up all their

military  bases in foreign lands. Now, are foreign troops and  foreign

bases  in a position to protect us? The Party in power says that  they

have  got international support and support from Afro-Asian countries.

But  what  are the actual facts? The facts have already been mentioned

and  they  are very clear. One resolution passed at the conference  of

non-aligned nations was to condemn the existence of foreign bases  and

foreign  troops in colonial countries. And what is most surprising  is

that the so-called independent Malaysia was not invited to participate

in  the  conference of non-aligned nations in Cairo. Why? It  is  very

clear - it is because Malaysia is pro-colonial and is not on the side

of  the  majority  of anti-colonial nations of the world.  Instead  of

fighting  against  imperialism and colonialism,  Malaysia  is  helping

them. That is why Malaysia was not invited to the conference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister has stressed the need to continue with the military pacts that we have with the British and the need for foreign troops in our country. We in principle are against the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



so-called military defence pact with Britain. If we say that this pact

is  necessary, then we will be scorned by other independent nations in

the  world.  Just  imagine  one nation having  to  resort  to  foreign

military  aid  in order to safeguard its own integrity. Is  it  really

necessary?  Cambodia  is  a neutral country and  is  non-aligned.  The

P.A.P. is proud of it, but has Cambodia signed any military pact  with

America  or Britain to safeguard her own sovereignty? Let us  look  at

South  Vietnam which is being bullied by the Americans, The Cambodians

do  not  require  any  foreign protection. If the  Ministers  and  the

Backbenchers of the Government do not recognise this fact, then let me

tell  them  that in Cambodia they have been having some trouble  along

their border recently because of American stooges in South Vietnam. Ac

cording  to  P.A.P. logic, it appears that Cambodia  has  to  sign  a

military  pact  with  Britain  in  order  to  counter  these  acts  of

aggression. No, there is no need. Cambodia does not do so  because  it

wants  peace.  It  is an independent country and it  is  not  isolated

internationally. In spite of the fact that it does not have troops  or

atomic  weapons, it can still exist in this world because it  has  the

will and the determination to exist. The people there love peace. They

love  freedom  and they want to preserve their independence.  Cambodia

has the support of its people and the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague has also said that Malaysia has brought about great dif

ficulties  and hardship. If this should go on, it will be  harmful  to

our  people.  If this is allowed to go on by force or  by  some  other

means, then the consequences should be pinned on the shoulders of  the

P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour, in trying to defend the Alliance Government,

has said that the Alliance Government in expanding the armed forces is

not preparing for war. He has said that the Alliance is trying to stop

foreign aggression. Let us look back to 1947 and the period before the

formation  of  Malaysia. Was there any necessity to  prepare  for  war

then?  Talking  about  the year 1957, which he  said  was  a  terrible

period, the real master was the British



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



and not the Alliance. He has also said that he had said before that we

wanted  to  safeguard Malaya. But I want to point out that  Malaya  is

still  within Malaysia. If the P.A.P. and the Alliance Government  are

prepared  to accept the views of the people by getting away  from  the

control  of  the British and the colonialists - that is by dissolving

Malaysia - then we will come forward to safeguard Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Malaysia was formed, we had already pointed out to the Party

in  power  that Malaysia would not get the support of the  people  and

that  it  was  neo-colonial. We said that  time  and  again  and  also

expressed our correct views, hut the paid no attention to us. So,  as

a  result  of the formation of Malaysia, there came about difficulties

and  they try to put the blame on us. They want to get us to fight for

the interests of the colonialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. always say that a citizen has a duty to his nation. We all

agree. But they do not mean what they say. The people are reluctant to

become  cannon  fodder of the imperialists and the  colonialists.  Two

months  ago we carried out a house-to-house visit all over the  island

and  we  came  to  the conclusion that the people do  not  desire  the

expansion of the army. Now if the P.A.P. want the people to  serve  in

the army, then they themselves should first set a good example. During

the  period after Malaysia there are enough lessons for the P.A.P. to

learn, in spite of their slogans saying that they serve the interests

of the people, and that the people support Malaysia, the people do not

give them their support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. have handed over some powers to the Central Government as a

result of Malaysia. In spite of this, they still persist in continuing

with  their actions. If they should persist further, I am afraid  that

the  results  will  be tragic. So in order to curry  favour  with  the

Central  Government, they have to say things which are  against  their

wishes. This is a good lesson for them to learn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.26 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have  still not quite understood the arguments put forward by the hon.

Members opposite. They have submitted this motion before us which says

that  the  seriousness  of the situation will  affect  the  lives  and

properties  of  the  people of Singapore. If  a  leader  is  sincerely

responsible  towards his country, he should inevitably  say  that  the

lives and property of the people of Singapore should be safeguarded so

that our enemies, whose intention is to destroy the lives and property

of our people, can be prevented from colonising us. Unfortunately, the

hon.  Members  have not spoken in that tone. They do  not  defend  our

right  to  protect  the lives and property of our people  and  of  our

State.  On  the  contrary, they say that our country is  defended  by'

foreign  forces. Are they conscious that the Government  is  exhorting

its  citizens to respond to its call to protect the lives and property

of our people?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member could keep a little distance

from  the  mike,  perhaps we can get on better. His  voice  is  coming

through very loud.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Thank you, Mr Speaker. I think I was a little carried away by emotion

when I talk about lives and property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Government has called upon the people to come forward

to  defend  and  protect  their lives and  property.  It  is  not  our

intention  to  call  upon  the  people  outside  the  State.  In   the

circumstances, the Opposition Members are not aware of the  situation.

Perhaps they have not read the local newspapers and they are not aware

of  the  landings  which took place in Pontian  and  Labis,  and  more

recently in Muar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those troops who landed on our soil could be correctly referred to as

foreign troops whose intention it is to destroy the lives and property

of  the  people. Because of the presence of these foreign  troops  who

want  to  destroy our lives and property, we are duty bound to protect

and safeguard our lives and property. We must therefore defend our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>



country  so  that  the  lives and property  of  the  people  might  be

protected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am obliged to repeat "lives and property" over and over

again  in the hope that I can bring home to hon. Members opposite  the

true meaning of these words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say that Malaysia has been forced upon us, whereas in fact they

realise  that  they  were rejected by the people  at  the  Referendum,

although they tried to instigate our people into voting against merger

and  Malaysia. Perhaps leaders like the hon. Members opposite have  no

standing  - they have no responsibilities towards the people.  Perhaps

they  conveniently forget that the Referendum which was held two years

ago  has  taught  them an object lesson that our  country  aspired  to

merger  and  Malaysia. Therefore, it goes without  saying  that  their

allegation that Malaysia was forced upon us is nothing but a falsehood

or  untruth which was uttered by irresponsible Members in the House in

order  to mislead the people. And they further say that we must  learn

in  order  to  lead our people to the path of peace and harmony.  What

they  have said earlier on contradicts what they ask of us  to  do  in

order  to  achieve peace and harmony. They tell us not to  defend  our

country. They desire, in collaboration with their foreign masters,  to

rule  us  with  a view to breaking the law and order of this  country.

They  also say that only they are prepared to listen to the advice  of

their Secretary-General, Mr Lim Chin Siong. They are not prepared  to

heed the advice of the people of this country. Their Secretary-General

has  advised  that  the  lives and property  of  the  people  must  be

protected  in  peace and harmony! The advice from the people  of  this

country  is  unheeded  by them and they are in  collusion  with  their

foreign overlords with intent to destroy their own electorate who have

property in this country. Needless to say, such leaders have no  place

1n  our midst, since they have enjoyed peace and freedom of speech but

are not prepared to shoulder ,their responsibilities to the State. Let

those Opposition leaders scrutinise the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



local  newspapers. If they are not prepared to go through the  English

or  Malay newspapers, then they can read the Sin Chew fit Poh  or  the

Nanyang Siang Pao from which they can see reports of landings at Labis

and  Muar.  Surely  they  realise that lives and  property  are  being

threatened  there,  and  that therefore it is  our  responsibility  to

defend our country from our enemies, and thus protect the lives of our

fellow citizens and prevent their property from being grabbed by  such

foreign masters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, that is all I wish to say. I hope the Opposition Members

will realise the gravity of the motion they have tabled and how to  be

responsible to this country.



<br><br>7.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir,I will try as far as possible to give a brief reply to all the criticisms levelled at us by the Government

side regarding our motion and I will also touch upon the amendment  of

the Deputy Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that today the people are faced with a very serious

situation,  and  a depression in trade and commerce.  The  people  are

suffering  and  there  is  unemployment.  There  are  also  other  ill

consequences. So you can see the seriousness of the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, in Sabah and Sarawak, you can see a guerilla war going on,

and it is becoming more serious every day. From the Press we have read

how  many British soldiers have been killed or security force  members

wounded. We have also read that British aeroplanes have been shot  at.

We can see that the situation is worsening and deteriorating.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in Malaya in Johore - Malacca and Muar - there have been youths

landing  along  the  coast. It is undeniable that among  those  landed

there  have  been some local Chinese and Malay youths. The  Government

have  declared  a  curfew in those areas and  this  has  affected  the

livelihood of the people there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, we have also seen the Alliance Government going

along the path of military expansion and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



embarking on a policy of war. At present Malaysia has been declared to

be  in  a  state of emergency and all freedom and right of association

and  assembly have been banned. The Government have been  using  money

earned by the blood and sweat of the people to buy armaments. They are

carrying  out enforced conscription throughout the territory in  order

to send our youths to any place to fight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this situation cannot be said to be not serious. You cannot say

that  this  situation does not have any far-reaching consequences  and

influence on the future of our people. Who is the culprit? Who  is  to

blame  for  this situation today? Political party propaganda  by  the

other  side has claimed that it has been from Indonesia, in two  ways:

external  military aggression and internal subversion. They  say  that

because  of  this  foreign aggression, therefore, we  have  these  ill

consequences and this serious situation. Now this is their logic. They

have  told  the  people  that  Malaysia will  bring  about  peace  and

prosperity. But what is the actual result? The actual result  is  that

Malaysia  has  brought about pain and suffering  and  misery,  because

Malaysia is a product of British neo-colonialism, because it is not in

the  interests  of  the  people but in the interests  of  the  British

colonialists. The Party in power says that it is ridiculous to say so,

but  even the British people themselves have claimed what I have  said

not  very  long ago. A British newspaper, the Observer,  published  an

article saying that Malaysia was a communal arrangement. Not very long

ago  a British Conservative Party Minister said that Malaysia was very

important  to  Britain.  Why?  Because Britain  has  great  financial

investments in this territory, and also this territory would serve  as

an  important military link and a point of communications in a

world-wide  network. So from this you can see the motives of the British  in

setting up Malaysia. It is merely for their own interests.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> On a point of

information.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh:</b> All right.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The hon.

Member has mentioned British investments in Malaysia. Now, can  I  ask

him  how  much  British investment there is in the Malayan  States  as

compared with British investments in Sabah and Sarawak which makes  it

so  important  that Sabah and Sarawak must join the new Federation  of

Malaysia?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir,  I think the Minister for Finance is trying to test me. According

to  my  information on the question as to how much investment  there

is,  I  understand it is �400 million sterling by the British. So  the

British,  because  of  the financial benefits  and  because  of  their

military advantages in having this area, tried to form Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the hon. Member has said �400 million or what

ever  it is. My question is, "How much in the Malayan States, and  how

much  in the Borneo States?" If Malaysia was formed because of British

economic interests, then British investments in Sabah and Sarawak must

be  so great that they want to bring it into Malaysia. My point is. 90

per  cent of British investment is in Malaya in rubber estates and tin

mines. So what is the point of bringing in Sabah and Sarawak? I  mean.

where is the benefit?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

From the Minister's question asked just now, it is clear that he wants

to  defend  British  interests.  He  has  claimed  that  most  of  the

investment is in Malaya. Now this goes to prove the point that Britain

wanted  to  set up Malaysia in order to protect its economic interests

in  Malaya.  As  I  have said, the investment amounts  to  about  �400

million.  It does not matter where most of it lies - in Malaya  or  in

Sabah  and  Sarawak.  If  they want to bring Sabah  and  Sarawak  into

Malaya,  it  is  because  the struggle of the people  in  these  areas

against  colonialism is gaining momentum. Seeing this  situation,  the

British wanted some agent to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>



look  after  their interests in this area. Under these  circumstances,

they  formed Malaysia. Because the British point of view is  such  and

the motive is such, it has aroused strong opposition by the people  in

these  five  territories, and the people of  Sabah  and  Sarawak  have

started a struggle against Malaysia. Even in Singapore the people  are

doing  so.  How do the Government resort to suppressing this movement?

They are closing down and banning the organisations and arresting  the

people.  Under such circumstances, the people of Sabah have  no  other

alternative but to take up arms against the British. No matter how the

Party in power may say that this is very terrible and violent. Even in

the  recent  non-aligned nations' conference in  Cairo,  there  was  a

resolution   which   stated  that  colonial  territories   should   be

independent as soon as possible. If the colonial powers would not  let

them  be  independent, then the colonial people could  resort  to  any

means, including force, to achieve independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in Sabah the people have been waging a struggle for independence

and  the  British  have tried to suppress them. It is  just  like  the

struggle  that  is  taking  place in, say,  Cuba  and  other  colonial

territories.  It  is a righteous struggle. No matter how  the  British

persuade  the  Federal Government to do things  which  meet  with  the

interests of the British, i.e., to form Malaysia and to salvage  their

sinking  political  fortunes in this area  and  to  look  after  their

interests,  the  struggle of the people of Borneo has become  stronger

and more vehement. I think it will continue until success is achieved.

It  is  only  a  matter of time before the people will be  victorious.

There  is no doubt that they will get support from various

quarters  - spiritual support as well as moral support. Perhaps Malaysia  will  be

getting  support  from  the  British and  elsewhere,  as  has  already

happened  in the past. For instance, the liberation of West Irian  had

the  support of people in various Asian countries. So the struggle for

freedom  in  Borneo  will  also receive the  support  from  Afro-Asian

countries and all those who love independence and freedom.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now I have mentioned this and now I would like to say how the

situation can be resolved. The Alliance Government has been trying  to

increase their military armaments and to go along the path of war. Not

very  long  ago  the Prime Minister, the Tunku, went  to  Britain  and

America for the purpose of asking for more military and financial aid.

America  also agreed to provide more military equipment, such as  helicopters, and even technical personnel to train military officers here.

In  order  to  beg  for  more  money and military  aid,  the  Alliance

Government also announced its support for South Vietnam, thus  running

the  danger of involvement in the American War. How much military  aid

will come from America we wilt see in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Britain is also trying to build up her military armaments here even

to the extent of supplying nuclear warheads to be stationed here. Thus

there  will  be  danger to the lives of the people in  this  territory

under  the  pretext of preserving Malaysia. They are  actually  making

ready  to expand war in this area when necessary. This is just like  a

kind of competition. America also puts ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, on a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Would the Member give way to the Prime Minister?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am a little puzzled on this. Because the

British  wanted  the  exploitation  of  the  �400  million  worth   of

investments, therefore Borneo and Sabah were thrown in for  that.  But

now the Member says the British and Americans also want to enlarge the

war in this area. But if they do that, they will be losing money. So I

am  a  bit puzzled. Are we to understand the Barisan view is that  the

British  are  interested in investments and profits,  or  in  war  and

destruction,  which  would  mean the  end  of  their  investments  and

profits?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

The  imperialists, of course, have their motives in expanding the  war

in this area. For instance, America, when she



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



cannot maintain her position in South Vietnam, will have to extend the

war  into North Vietnam. Some officers of the British forces have also

suggested  the  bombing of Indonesia. So in order  to  preserve  their

interests, they would go to the extent of expanding the war. So  there

is  a  sort of armament competition in this area. It is a question  of

building  up  military strength here. America wants  to  preserve  her

military  balance  here; so she is trying to dump  in  this  area  her

military  build-up. So Malaysia would become a battlefield  in

South-East Asia. Now, of what benefit is it to the people? None at all.  The

people  under  these circumstances will suffer more in an  imperialist

war in this area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Alliance Government, in addition to buying

armaments, is trying to conscript youths to be soldiers. No matter how

the Party in power tries to explain that the conscription of youths is

for the defence of the country, we say that conscription



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



of the youths is to defend British interests, and it is a deception on

the  people. The British have never given us any assurance to  protect

us.  They  have  poured into our territory and they are  not  our  own

people.  Who  are in control of the forces here? None other  than  the

British. So to say that conscription is to replace British forces does

not  hold  water.  The  real  purpose is  to  make  the  people  serve

imperialist  interests  and to force the youths  to  undergo  military

training.  What  will be the period of training then?  As  far  as  we

understand, the war here will be a long one, a war of attrition.  Even

the British military officers have said ---
