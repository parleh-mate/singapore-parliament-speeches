<div align="center"><b>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(MR E. J. DAVIES):TRIBUTE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am sure that hon. Members would

wish to join with me in congratulating the Hon. the

Attorney-General on his appointment as Chief Justice

of Tanganyika.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Davies has been in this country since 1938,

serving in the then Federated Malay States as Deputy

and  later as Acting Legal Adviser until 1941,  when

he was appointed Solicitor-General of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the War, on the 1st of April,1946, he was

appointed Attorney-General, and in that capacity  he

has served continuously as a Member of the Singapore

Legislature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will be leaving us shortly to take up his new post.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will be losing an Officer who has, in his own sphere, contributed a great deal to her progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tanganyika is fortunate, indeed, to have obtained

the  services of Mr Davies, and I wish him and Mrs.

Davies  all  happiness in their  new  life  in  that

country.

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>ECONOMIC ADVISER AND ECONOMIC COMMISSION (APPOINTMENT)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr M. P. D. Nair</b> asked the Chief Minister what

action  has  been  taken up to date  to  secure  the

services  of  an Economic Adviser to the  Government

and to appoint an Economic Commission.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall):</b> Sir, one

of  the  first  tasks  of the Government  on  taking

office  was to take steps to secure the services  of

Dr.  Benham  as Economic Adviser to the  Government,

and   Dr.   Benham   was   interested.   There   was

correspondence  in  some detail,  but  finally,  for

domestic   reasons  which  transpired   during   the

negotiations, he found it impossible to accept  that

post.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereafter, Professor Arthur Lewis of Manchester

University was approached, and he seemed interested,

but  the most recent communication received from him

indicates a definite refusal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now in communication with another suitable

economist  of  international  reputation.   We   are

hopeful, and I can add no more to it at this present

juncture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the appointment of an Economic

Commission, Sir, that will naturally have  to  await

the  appointment of an Economic Adviser, as we  wish

to   obtain  his  advice  on  the  constitution  and

personnel of the Commission.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>AUSTRALIAN TROOPS FOR SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr M. P. D. Nair</b> asked the Chief Minister what

consultations have taken place between  himself  and

the  Australian  Government representatives  on  the

subject  of  sending Australian troops to Singapore;

and whether he will make a statement on the subject,

as  far  as the interests of the people of Singapore

are concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> May it please you, Sir, as I

understand   the   question,  it  is   asking   what

consultations have taken place between  me  and  the

Australian Government representatives on the subject

of  sending  Australian  troops  to  Singapore;  and

whether  I  will make a statement in so far  as  the

interests of the people are concerned. I would  like

to  indicate to the hon. Member that there has  been

no  official request to station Australian troops in

Singapore, and  consequently  there  have  been  no

formal  consultations with the Australian Government

representatives  on  the  subject.  The  House   is,

however,  aware  that  it has now  been  decided  to

station  these  troops  in the  Federation.  It  has

always   been  our  view,  Sir,  that   to   station

Australian  troops  in Singapore at  this  political

juncture  might be misunderstood. In so far  as  our

own defence is concerned, I think I should add, Sir,

that  it  is  the  view of this Government  that  it

should support the maintenance of British forces  in

Singapore until such time as we are in a position to

provide the means for our defence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>TRADE AND INDUSTRY (EXPANSION)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Commerce

and  Industry whether he will state what  plans  the

Government has in view for the carrying out  of  its

declared aim of attracting private capital from both

local  and  overseas investors for  the  purpose  of

expanding  trade and industry, and  of  raising  the

standard of living of all the people of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr D. S. Marshall:</b> May it please you, Sir, it is

a  question that seeks a thesis and somewhat,  if  I

may say so, inappropriate for an oral answer, but  I

shall  do  my  best.  In the two  months  since  His

Excellency's   Address  outlining   our   commercial

policy,  Government has established a Trade Advisory

Council.  It  has, as the House is  aware,  been  in

communication  with  our  great  trading  neighbour,

Indonesia,  with a view to improving our  commercial

relationship.  Furthermore, plans for an  Industrial

Development   Corporation,   to   encourage    local

industries  along  the  lines  that  have  been   so

successful  in  Hong Kong, are now  under  intensive

study.  The  Report  of the International  Bank  for

Reconstruction and Development is being  studied  in

detail,  Sir,  and the question of the establishment

of  a Central Bank is being pursued. The appointment

of  an  Economic Adviser and an Economic Commission,

of which this House has heard, and which it is hoped

will  certainly  take place in the  course  of  this

year,   will  assist  in  blueprinting  an   overall

commercial,  industrial and fiscal  policy  for  the

next few years. In the meanwhile, Sir, assistance in

the  industrial and commercial fields is taking  the

form  of  attention  to individual  applications  on

their   merits,  encouragement  to  the  extent   of

granting hard currency, and allowing immigration  of

key  personnel, where necessary, for the development

of industry in this territory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also draw attention to the Labour

Ordinance which is before the House this morning and

which is the first step in Government's plan for the

amelioration of employer-employee relations and  the

establishment of industrial stability, so  necessary

for  the  encouragement of capital to take advantage

of  tie  opportunities that are  available  in  this

country.  I  think  I ought to add,  Sir,  that  the

provisions  for technical education  which  are  now

afoot would, it is expected, considerably assist  in

the  industrialisation, so necessary for our  future

welfare, the absorption of the unemployed of  today,

and the youth seeking employment of tomorrow.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could the Minister

give  more detailed information regarding the  means

the  Government will use to attract private  capital

from both local and overseas investors; for example,

by  means  of giving income tax reliefs, initial  or

annual  or both, on the cost of factory construction

and initial plant?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have indicated

that  the  question  of  the  establishment  of   an

Industrial  Development  Corporation  is  proceeding

apace.  To  what extent our taxation policy  may  be

directed towards giving relief for the encouragement

of  industry  will  await, Sir, the  advice  of  our

Economic  Adviser  and  the  establishment  of   the

Industrial  Development  Corporation.  But   it   is

intended    that    that   Industrial    Development

Corporation,   when   established,    should    give

assistance of a very practical character and perhaps

financial aid for the establishment of industry.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, does not the Minister agree

that  as  much haste as possible in this  matter  is

necessary,  so  that  we can go forward  swiftly  to

expand our industries which are so necessary to  us?

I feel that -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Confine yourself to the question,

please.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Does he not consider that awaiting

an  Economic  Adviser,  which  I  realise  is  being

searched  for  diligently, is holding up  this  very

necessary development?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair:</b> How soon does the Minister for

Commerce   and   Industry  expect   the   Industrial

Development  Corporation to be established?  Can  he

indicate any time limit?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I regret I cannot add further to my

statement.  Sir,  I would not wish  to  mislead  the

House, but I can assure you that the plans are under

intensive study.

<div align="center"><b>POST OFFICE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(JALAN KAYU)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr M. P. D. Nair</b> asked the Minister for

Communications and Works what progress has been made

up to date



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



in  regard to the construction of the proposed  Post

Office at Jalan Kayu.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> There is financial provision

in  this year's Estimates for the building of a Post

Office at Jalan Kayu. A site has been selected  near

the  junction of Yio Chu Kang Road and  Jalan  Kayu,

and  the  site  is  awaiting  the  approval  of  the

Planning  Co-ordination Committee.  Thereafter,  the

land will be acquired and building will proceed.

<div align="center"><b>POST OFFICE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(THOMSON VILLAGE)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr M. P. D. Nair</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  and Works whether, in  view  of  the

development of the Thomson Road area between the 4th

and  8th  milestones, the Government have plans  for

building  a  Post Office in the area; where  is  the

building  intended to be situated; and  when  is  it

likely to be open to the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The Government has plans for building

a  Post Office in the Thomson Road area. A site  has

been selected in the Thomson Village. It is proposed

to  ask  for financial provision for the Post Office

in  next  year's  Estimates.  If  the  provision  is

approved, it should be possible for the Post  Office

to be completed about the middle of next year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> In the meantime would the Minister consider establishing postal agencies in the area?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I must have notice of that question, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>TELEPHONE FACILITIES THOMSON ROAD AREA</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr M. P. D. Nair</b> asked the Minister for

Communications and Works whether he  is  aware  that

the  people living in Thomson Road (between the  4th

and  8th  milestones) and Yio Chu Kang Road (between

the  6th  and  11th milestones) do not  have  public

telephone  facilities;  and  whether  he  will  take

immediate   steps   to  see  that  adequate   public

telephone service is available in those areas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The Singapore Telephone Board has a

development  programme for this  year  and  next  in

which  priority  is given to the  areas  which  most

urgently need telephone facilities, and I understand

from  the  Board  that the areas specified  in  this

question   are   included   in   their   development

programme.

<div align="center"><b>ROAD TRANSPORT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(NATIONALISATION)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr M. P. D. Nair</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  and  Works  if  he  will  state  the

Government's    policy   on    Nationalisation    of

Singapore's   Road   Transport,   with    particular

reference  to  the Singapore Traction Company  whose

Charter expires in June 1955.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Since the hon. Member's question about

the  nationalisation of road transport was put,  the

subject has been debated in the Assembly, and it has

been  decided that a Commission should be  appointed

to examine the public passenger transport system and

to  make recommendations. In that debate I informed

the  Assembly  that  it  was the  intention  of  the

Government  to nationalise passenger transport.  The

decisions  on how and when this would be done  would

be  taken in the light of the recommendations of the

Transport Commission.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>INTERNAL AIRWAYS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(NATIONALISATION)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr M. P. D. Nair</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  and Works whether, in  view  of  the

declared   policy  of  the  Government,  viz.,   the

unification  of  Singapore  and  the  Federation  of

Malaya,  and  of  the belief of  the  Government  in

Socialism,  the  Government  intends  to  bring  the

internal Airways system under public ownership;  and

whether   this  matter  will  be  brought   up   for

consideration by the Federation of Malaya Government

and  the  Joint Co-ordination Committee at an  early

date.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The agreement entered into between the

Governments of Singapore and the Federation and  the

Malayan Airways provides that on or before the  30th

of   April,  1956,  the  Governments  shall   either

conclude a mutual agreement with the Company for the

renewal of the agreement or its replacement by a new

one upon agreed terms and conditions, or give notice

to  the  Company that they do not propose to  extend

the  agreement after its expiration on the  30th  of

April,  1957.  The  agreement  also  provides   that

neither  Government will take any decision affecting

the  duration  of  the agreement without  the  prior

concurrence  of  the  other Government.  And  I  can

assure  the  hon.  Member that  it  is  proposed  to

discuss  with the Federation Government at an  early

date  the  future of the internal Airways system  of

the Malay Peninsula.

<div align="center"><b>ISLAND-WIDE TRAIN SERVICE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr M. P. D. Nair</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  and Works whether, in  view  of  the

increased convenience of the travelling public  that

will  result  from  the  efficient  running  of   an

Internal Island-wide Train Service, Government  will

consider    instituting   an   enquiry   into    the

desirability and practicability of such a service in

Singapore, the initial step being a shuttle  service

between Johore Bahru and Clifford Pier.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The possibility of using local railway

transport  to  supplement  road  transport  has,  of

course, been widely discussed for many years and has

been  under  consideration in  connection  with  the

planned  development  of the  residential  areas  of

Singapore.   The   problem  was   studied   by   the

International    Bank    Mission,    and     further

consideration will be given to it in  the  light  of

the recommendations of the Bank Mission.

<div align="center"><b>(WOMEN TEACHERS) (Equal Pay and Allowances)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr M. P. D. Nair</b> asked the Minister for

Education whether, in view of the declared policy of

the  Government  to afford equal treatment  for  all

schools and all teachers, Government school teachers

will  be  permitted to contest the forthcoming  City

and  Island  Council Elections;  and  whether  women

teachers in all schools will be paid the same salary

and allowances as their counterpart male teachers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question

involves   service  matters  which  are  under   the

portfolio of my friend the Hon. the Chief Secretary.

I  shall ask the Hon. the Chief Secretary to  answer

that question.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. A. Williams -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. A. Williams:</b> Sir, the answer to the first

part of the question is that Government teachers, in

common  with  other  civil  servants  of  equivalent

status,  are forbidden to take any part in political

activities. They will not, therefore, be allowed  to

offer themselves for election to any statutory  body

representative of the community or of any section of

the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the second part of the question is

that  it is not intended to make any change  in  the

existing   rates   of  salary  and  allowances   for

Government teachers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Will the Chief Secretary state why he

does  not  consider it necessary that women teachers

in   all  schools  be  paid  the  same  salary   and

allowances as their counterpart male teachers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Williams -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Williams:</b> I think, Sir, that the question of

equal pay for men and women raises major social  and

economic  issues which cannot be adequately answered

in a supplementary question.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, will the Minister state whether

he  will give consideration to the granting  of  the

same  specialist allowances to married lady teachers

as to single lady teachers?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Hon. The Chief Secretary

would rather have notice of that question.

<div align="center"><b>FAMILY PLANNING ASSOCIATION</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin H. A. Hamid asked the

Minister for Health if he will state what the policy

of  the  Government is regarding the Family Planning

Association.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. J. Braga:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government

has  no  set  policy regarding the  Family  Planning

Association. I assume from the question asked by the

Member for the Southern Islands (Inche Mohamed Sidik

Bin  H. A. Hamid) that he is anxious to know whether

this   Government   will   make   further   monetary

contributions  towards this Association.  Well,  the

question is highly controversial, as hon. Members of

the  House  know,  from the recent articles  in  the

Press. It also involves the conscience and religious

convictions of the individual. So the Government has

thought  it  proper  that an opportunity  should  be

afforded the House for a debate and a free  vote  at

the  appropriate time. Members on both sides of  the

House,  whether they be on the Front  Bench  or  the

Back Benches, will therefore have an opportunity  to

vote individually according to their conscience.

Yoh was not made from Government funds, but from the

Silver Jubilee Fund. The families were informed that

they could apply to the Public Assistance Section of

the  Social  Welfare Department for  further  relief

under  the usual Public Assistance schemes  if  they

required it. Only two families applied; one of these

was eligible and is receiving assistance.

<div align="center"><b>ISLAND-WIDE SYMPATHY STRIKES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Chief Minister)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, since this House last

met,  events  have  occurred of  a  very  disturbing

character.  Political Parties  represented  in  this

House have, through the Press, heaped abuse upon the

Government  for  its handling of these  events.  Yet

today  we  have the extraordinary position that  not

one  single  member of these political  Parties  has

seen  fit  to challenge in this House the action  of

the  Government. Though no Member of the  Opposition

seeks  a debate, I consider it my duty to report  to

this House the facts as I know them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, Sir, a clique of P.A.P. politicians who

masquerade as trade unionists. On Friday, 10th June,

I  received  from one of them what they  called  "an

ultimatum to the Government", indicating that unless

the   Government  settled  the  outstanding  dispute

between the Harbour Board and its Staff Association,

more  than 20 trade unions, wholly unconnected  with

the  dispute,  would be called  out  on  a  sympathy

strike.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For several days prior to that Friday, Sir, the

Press  had been giving considerable publicity  to  a

statement of a member of that clique, threatening an

island-wide sympathy strike.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Government has made repeated and earnest

efforts  to  bring  about a settlement  between  the

Harbour  Board and its Staff Association, but  there

never was question, and there can never be question,

of  Government seeking to compel an employer  or  an

employee  to  surrender to the terms  of  the  other

party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same day, Sir, that I received this so-called "ultimatum", reports began coming in of a very disturbing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



character,  of intimidation of trade  unions  in  an

attempt  to compel them to join the sympathy strike.

These reports suggested that some of the same forces

as  those  which  brought about the tragedy  of  the

recent riots were at work, and indicated that  there

was  a  strong  possibility that organised  violence

might  flare up under cover of the confusion of  the

sympathy  strike. Our advisers, Sir, urged immediate

action   to  protect  peaceful  citizens.   Security

arrangements were finalised, and I saw  this  P.A.P.

clique  on  that  Friday night. When  they  left  my

office at 8 p.m., I believed that there would be  no

sympathy  strike and that I would on  the  following

morning receive a communication from them. I did not

hear  from any member of this clique on the Saturday

morning, and the emergency meeting of the Council of

Ministers  on  that  Saturday  afternoon  considered

reports of heightened activities and intimidation in

furtherance  of this sympathy strike which  was  set

for  the  following Monday. I made repeated  efforts

that  Saturday  afternoon to  get  members  of  this

P.A.P. clique to see me. They did not appear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government was naturally very anxious to avoid

unrest  and  violence which would cause considerable

harm to our people and our commerce. We were anxious

to  avoid using the Emergency Regulations. I dislike

the   Emergency  Regulations,  intensely.  It   was,

however, an urgent question of protecting the people

against  an  imminent threat of violence.  In  these

circumstances,  on  Saturday evening,  authorisation

was   given  for  the  arrest  under  the  Emergency

Regulations of a small number of persons believed to

be the sparking points of this threatened violence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately after this meeting, Sir, at 8 o'clock

I  sought  once  more to persuade  members  of  this

clique  to  see  me, and despite my urgent  request,

they  kept  me  waiting for one  hour,  and  finally

appeared  at  nine.  At  9.20  p.m. they  issued  a

statement agreeing to call a meeting of trade unions

to  consider  calling off the sympathy strike.  That

statement,  Sir,  materially modified  our  original

plan  of arrests. A few arrests, however, were  made

and the headquarters of the P.A.P. pseudo trade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>



unionists  were searched. As a result of  this,  the

P.A.P. clique  promptly sought  to  prostitute  the

trade union movement and worked frantically for  the

next  few days to call out workers of the Colony  on

strike,  not  for  the  purposes  of  bettering  the

conditions  of the workers, not for any question  of

the  welfare  of  the workers, but  openly  coercing

Government into releasing the men it had arrested - an

action  thought  necessary for the  welfare  of  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was at no time any suggestion, Sir, from

this clique or its associates that this House should

assemble  in  order to consider the  action  of  the

Government  which  they so loudly decried,  and  for

which they were prepared to put this country to such

inconvenience and such risks. It was an open  effort

to  substitute mob government for government by  the

people's    elected   representatives.    Widespread

intimidation and rumour-mongering were resorted  to.

The  security forces were constantly on  the  alert,

Sir,  and  the  knowledge of the strength  of  these

security forces and of Government's readiness to use

them,  as  well  as the few arrests which  had  been

made, are believed to have been the reasons for  the

absence of violence during those days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, large numbers of

workers,  reaching  a maximum of  15,000, excluding

those  who  were on legitimate strike, were  induced

during  those days to go out on strike,  dislocating

passenger transport and considerably inconveniencing

the  public,  and alarming capital. Government  made

arrangements  for the transport of school  children,

and  later for members of the public. The threat  by

this   P.A.P. clique  to  the  democratic   process

collapsed,  Sir, after five days, when  the  workers

under   their  domination,  led  by  the   Singapore

Traction  Company  workers, openly revolted  against

being  used  as pawns in a political game,  and  the

threat to reinstate a general strike on the 26th  of

June failed to materialise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all, there were eight persons arrested - two are

facing  open  trial in our Courts;  four  have  been

released  as  the danger of violence in  which  they

might be used had passed, and I would like to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>



assure hon. Members that their release was in no way

accelerated  nor conduced to by the strike,  or  the

threat  of  a further strike. Government  takes  the

view, Sir, that the Emergency Regulations should not

be  used,  except for urgent and grave  reasons.  In

these  circumstances, only two of the eight continue

to  be  detained. I would add, Sir, that it  is  our

desire  to  present to this House at an  early  date

suggestions  for  an  improved procedure  under  the

Emergency Regulations which would satisfy the public

desire  for  open  justice and the  vital  need  for

executive power to nullify the activities  of  those

who seek to rule by violence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The normal citizen of Singapore accepted the

inconvenience of these strikes with good sense, with

cheerfulness, and with loyalty, that made the defeat

of   this   subversive  attack  on  the   Government

possible. I consider it necessary to explain to this

House  why the Government did not act in the drastic

manner that the circumstances seemed to require.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had the knowledge, Sir, that illegal strikes

were  being  fomented for purely political  purposes

entirely   unconnected  with   any   trade   dispute

whatsoever. We had the knowledge of the persons  who

were  fomenting these strikes. We had the  knowledge

of  a large number of persons behind the scenes  who

were acting as lieutenants of the P.A.P. clique that

was fomenting the strikes. We had the knowledge of a

small group of persons who might be used as sparking

points for violence during these illegal strikes. It

would  have  been easy to make a clean  sweep  of  a

large number of these people to such an extent as to

prevent the general strike and subsequent threatened

violence from materialising.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would point out to this House, however, that a

very  large  section  of our working  population  is

illiterate; that it has for generations developed an

antipathy to Government as such; that the widespread

arrests  which were indicated would have involved  a

large number of persons in the P.A.P. movement.  The

forces  that seek chaos in this country  would  have

found it easy then to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>



convince  the  common  worker, Sir,  that  executive

power  was  being  abused  with  the  intention   of

destroying  political opponents, and  of  destroying

the  worker's movement by depriving him of  his  so-called  leaders. The ingrained traditional antipathy

to  Government  as such by a large  section  of  our

working population would have been only too ready to

accept  such an explanation, particularly  as  force

and the Emergency Regulations are closely associated

in  the  public mind with colonial rule. The  people

have  not  had the time, Sir, to recognise the  very

real  distinction between past governments and  this

Government.  In those circumstances, we  might  have

done irreparable harm to the cause of democracy  for

which we exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government deeply regrets that the loyal

citizens   of  this  Colony  should  have   suffered

inconvenience and even run some risk in  order  that

the illiterate worker should have the opportunity to

learn for himself the extent to which his trust  was

being   abused,  and  how  his  welfare  was   being

sacrificed  for the political ambitions of  his  so-called leaders. The Government hopes that this loyal

section   of   the  population  will   realise   the

tremendous importance of the task of attracting  the

loyalty  of  the illiterate worker to the democratic

process,  of  making him realise that  this  is  his

Government, and of achieving the harmonious  welding

of  all sections and all interests in this territory

into  a  unified  loyalty. It  is  the  Government's

belief,  Sir, that the democratic process, which  is

now  rapidly  gaining ground,  can  best  serve  the

welfare  of all the people and can adapt  itself  to

the pace of change that the public may demand at any

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The misled workers who went out on strike at the

behest of this P.A.P. clique have, in fact, begun to

realise to what extent their welfare was sacrificed,

and  the  trade union movement prostituted, for  the

personal,  selfish political ends of some  so-called

leaders.  To  that extent it has been a victory  for

the  democratic process, where there could have been

a  very  grave  setback,  irretrievably  losing  the

potential loyalty of a large mass of our population.

This is but the commencement of the process, and  as

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>



Government gives further evidence of its deep desire

for the welfare of the worker and the masses of this

territory,  it  is hoped to attract and  consolidate

this  loyalty  of  this illiterate  section  of  the

population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to express the gratitude of the Government

for  the patience and the loyalty of a large  number

of  the citizens of this Colony in a time of stress,

and  for  the sense of responsibility and  stability

shown by many trade union leaders who did not permit

their unions to be prostituted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure this House that we have the

strength to meet all emergencies that may arise, and

we  will  use  that  strength when  we  consider  it

necessary for the welfare of all the people of  this

territory. In the meanwhile, Sir, I hope Members  of

this  House  and the loyal citizens of this  country

will continue to be patient with our forbearance  in

this vital formative period of democracy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I

formally  move the Second Reading of  this  Bill,  I

would  like to explain to hon. Members the  urgency,

or the reason for the urgency, of carrying this Bill

through all stages at this sitting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Provident Fund Ordinance was enacted

in  1953, and was to have come into force on May Day

this  year.  However, soon after I  took  office  in

April,   representations  were  made  to   me   that

amendments  were necessary to the Central  Provident

Fund Ordinance. It was therefore decided to postpone

the   operation   of   the  Fund   so   that   these

representations   could  be   considered   and   any

necessary  amendments prepared. This, Sir,  has  now

been done,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



and  the Bill before the House is the result. It  is

important that there should be no further  delay  in

putting into operation the Central Provident Fund so

that  it  can start during the second half  of  this

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments that are sought today, Sir, are

necessary  to  ensure the smoother  working  of  the

Fund - hence the Certificate of Urgency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 2 of the Bill provides for the

operation of the Fund as from July 1st, and for  the

refund  of  any deductions which may have been  made

before that date. But it also provides that if  both

parties agree, such deductions may be paid into  the

Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the changes embodied in these amendments

are minor changes, suggested by the Board to ensure,

as  I said earlier, Sir, the smoother working of the

Fund.  The purpose of these is set out in detail  in

the  Objects and Reasons, and I do not think  it  is

necessary  for  me  to  dwell on  them.  There  are,

however,   several   changes   of   substance    and

importance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6, Sir, and the new Schedule to which it

refers,  provide that employees who  earn  not  more

than $200 per month do not have to contribute to the

Fund,  though their employers must still make  their

contributions of 5 per cent of their wages.  It  was

put  to  me,  Sir,  that the lower-paid  workers  in

present  circumstances cannot afford to lay aside  5

per  cent of their wages each month, even though  it

is  to provide an investment for the future. It  can

hardly  be denied that this is true, and that  these

lower-paid  workers should therefore be exempt  from

contributing to the Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A special provision is put into the Schedule so

that  an  employee whose wages are between $200  and

$210.50 in any month shall not pay a full 5 per cent

contribution, but only so much as would  reduce  the

net amount he would receive as pay for the month  to

$200.  Without  this provision,  an  employee  whose

wages were in this zone would have less to take home

than the employee whose wages were only $200.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 (a), Sir, amends subsection (2) of

section  21  of  the  principal  Ordinance  so  that

private  provident  funds or  schemes  will  not  be

eligible  for approval unless they were  established

before 11th December, 1953, the date of enactment of

the  Ordinance.  The Ordinance in its  present  form

requires the Board to approve of any private fund or

scheme established by an employer at any time, if it

provides pecuniary benefits for the employees of not

less  value  than  the benefits provided  under  the

Ordinance.  Employees who are members  of  any  fund

which  is  approved will not be liable to contribute

to  the  Central  Provident  Fund,  nor  will  their

employers  be  liable to contribute  in  respect  of

them.  If  this  is permitted, Sir,  it  means  that

employees  can  be  removed from the  scope  of  the

Central Provident Fund at any time by the setting up

of  new schemes, and the number of employees covered

by  the  Fund will diminish. The cost of supervising

these  schemes  would have to be met  by  the  Board

which  would be receiving no income from investments

in  respect  of  them. What is even more  important,

Sir, is that it would, in practice, be impossible to

ensure  that  contributions to numerous  funds  were

paid  correctly, or that employees received the full

benefits  due to them. This amendment would  prevent

this  anomalous  state of affairs, though  it  would

not, of course, prevent an employer from setting  up

another scheme in addition to participating  in  the

Central Provident Fund if he so wished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 (b), Sir, seeks to add additional

subsections  to section 21 of the Ordinance,  and  a

new  subsection  (8) gives power  to  the  Board  to

exempt  non-domiciled employees  getting  more  than

$500  per  month as wages who already enjoy adequate

retirement   benefit  rights.  There   are   certain

employees in Singapore who have pension rights under

various  schemes  provided by  their  employers,  or

under government schemes in other countries, and who

are  not  domiciled in Malaya, to  whom  it  may  be

reasonable to give exemption



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



from  contributing  to the Central  Provident  Fund.

Such  schemes cannot generally be amended  to  bring

them   within  the  provisions  of  the   Ordinance.

Nevertheless,  the retirement benefits  provided  by

these  schemes  may be quite adequate in  comparison

with  the  amount  which would be payable  from  the

Central  Provident Fund on reaching the age  of  55,

particularly  in the case of employees  whose  wages

are  over $500 per month, for whom the Central  Fund

contribution is at the rate of less than 5 per  cent

of  their  wages. It is proposed to give  the  Board

under  this  new  subsection powers to  exempt  such

individual employees if they apply for exemption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21, Sir, in addition to exempting employees

earning  not  more than $200 per month,  as  I  have

already mentioned, substitutes contributions at  the

flat  rate of 5 per cent for the present set scales.

This will greatly facilitate the calculation of  the

amount  to  be deducted, especially in  cases  where

wages  are paid daily or weekly and the amount  paid

on different pay-days is variable. As the law stands

at  present, the calculation of the contribution  in

these cases is very complicated, and in the case  of

big  employers,  would involve considerable  expense

and waste of time. The new Schedule will avoid this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the suggestions made to

me was that monies paid out of the Fund on the death

of  an employee should not be subject to estate duty

unless they exceed some limit to be decided upon.  I

am  in  sympathy with this suggestion, but it  needs

careful consideration in relation to other financial

matters.  It  is not urgent, because estates  up  to

$1,000 in value are already exempt from estate duty,

and  it will be some time before any member's  share

of  the  Fund will be more than $1,000.  I  give  my

assurance  that  before the matter can  arise,  this

suggestion will be further considered carefully  and

sympathetically.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Sir, I rise to second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I would like to ask the Hon. the Minister  for

Labour and Welfare whether Gazette Notification  No.

890  fixing  the  date for the commencement  of  the

Central Provident Fund has been withdrawn?



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, while

congratulating  my  hon.  Friend  the  Minister  for

Labour and Welfare on the important amendment  which

he  made  in  regard to the Schedule in  respect  of

employees  who  are receiving a wage rate  exceeding

$10  but not $200, I would like to point out to this

House that those employees in this category will  be

taking home a much smaller sum. If calculated on the

basis of $200, it comes to about $2,400 for a period

of 20 years. I think this sum is very low.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When proposals were made to amend this particular

Schedule,  I thought that the Government would  come

in  and  give aid to these workers; in other  words,

the Government would consider contributing a certain

percentage  as  their  contribution,  thus  enabling

these workers to take home a very substantial sum on

retirement.  As I see it, these employees  stand  to

lose.  I  am  wondering whether Government  has  any

plans  to  supplement  the  retirement  benefits  of

employees in this category. I feel that they deserve

Government's earnest consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> On a point of

clarification, Sir, and reserving my right to speak,

may  I  ask  that  the  Member for  Bukit  Panjang's

question  be  answered by the Hon. the Minister  for

Labour and Welfare?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, if reference is made to

clause  2  of  this Bill, it will be  seen  that  by

inference  the date of commencement of  the  Central

Provident Fund Ordinance has been postponed  to  1st

July, 1955.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on Monday, 4th April, Gazette Notification No. 890 was

published,  stating that the Central Provident  Fund

would come into operation on the 1st of May. To  our

knowledge,  nothing  has  appeared  in  the  Gazette

authorised  by  the Governor either to  withdraw  or

extend the date of the coming into operation of this

Ordinance.  But  on the 28th of April  the  Minister

announced  that the date of commencement was  to  be

postponed.    I   think,   Sir,   it    is    highly

unconstitutional for any Minister  to  postpone  the

operation  of  any law that has been passed  by  the

Legislative Council and which has not only  received

the  sanction of the Governor, but also a  date  for

the operation of which has been definitely fixed. It

seems  to  me  that  on  this particular  point  the

Minister for Labour and Welfare had two courses open

to  him:  either he should have had the  consent  of

this  Assembly  to  postpone the operation  of  that

Ordinance -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of

order. Is the hon. Member speaking to the motion? It

seems to me, with respect, Mr Speaker, Sir, that he

is  speaking  to what might have been  a  motion  of

censure  for an action which suspended the operation

of  law, out it has no reference whatsoever  to  the

motion now before they House.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think, Mr Chief Minister, that the

Member  for  Paya  Lebar  (Mr  Lim  Koon  Teck)  is

probably talking on the principle involved in clause

2,   where  the  date  given  for  the  coming  into

operation  of  the Ordinance is the  1st  July,  as

against  a previous date. Mr Lim Koon Teck,  please

carry on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> - either that; or he should

have  allowed the Central Provident Fund to commence

on the date on which it was fixed, and he can easily

have  brought in all these amendments which he wants

to  do today. In fact, many, if not most, firms have

already complied with the law requiring this Fund to

commence   as  from  the  1st  May,  and  this   has

necessitated  clause  2  of this  Bill  to  legalise

actions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>



of  employers  for  deducting contributions  to  the

Provident  Fund  as from the 1st May.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as the Minister has said, there is not a great deal of new

matters in this Bill, the most important of which is

the  right  of those workers drawing less than  $200

per  month  not to contribute to the Fund.  In  such

cases,  only the employers are to contribute.  Well,

this  is only a matter of compromise, and I  do  not

think  it is of great importance either way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I do not think that this Bill should

have  taken the Minister two months to draw up,  and

taking  such  a long time over it, it  has  made  it

necessary  for  him to apply for  a  Certificate  of

Urgency  from  the  Governor. I  submit,  Sir,  that

Certificates from the Governor should only be -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. I do not think any hon.

Member can question a Certificate of Urgency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> I am not questioning it, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No hon. Member can question a

Certificate of Urgency from the Governor. If he does

so,  he  is  indirectly offending  against  Standing

Order  No. 31 (8), where the conduct of the Governor

shall not be referred to in any circumstances.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> No, Sir, I know that section

well.  I  am not questioning the act of the Governor

at all. I am only remarking that if the Minister had

taken  one  of  the two courses I have outlined,  it

would  not  have  been necessary to  appeal  to  the

Governor in such cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is this: he has had nearly two

months,  and yet we have only notice of  this  Bill,

Sir,  less than 30 hours ago. We had made a  protest

against  such short notice, but we were referred  to

section 22 of the Standing Orders, subsection (3) of

which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Except where it is otherwise provided in any

Standing  Order,  not less than  seven  clear  days'

notice of any motion shall be given unless it is  in

the  name  of  a Minister, in which case  one  clear

day's notice shall be sufficient."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a special privilege given to a very

responsible Minister of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>



Government, and a special privilege should  only  be

used -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. You are still

criticising  indirectly the Certificate of  Urgency.

We are now debating the Second Reading, and you must

confine   yourself   to  the  general   merits   and

principles of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> We are only voicing our dissatisfaction -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. You can voice your

dissatisfaction by not taking part in the debate or

by getting the right later on to speak on the Adjournment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Well, I reserve my right to speak on the Adjournment.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lim Yew Hock, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already

replied to the point raised by the Member for  Bukit

Panjang (Mr Goh Tong Liang).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the point raised by the Member for

Seletar (Mr Nair), he states that by assisting  the

workers who receive less than $200 in that they need

not  now  have to contribute to the Provident  Fund,

they  would,  when they retire, receive  less  money

than  they  would  have  got  had  they  contributed

themselves.  There is nothing, Sir, in the  proposed

amendment to prevent any member of the Fund, who  is

in  receipt of less than $200, to contribute himself

if he so desires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the point raised by the Member for

Paya  Lebar, he says that the Ordinance  should  not

have  been  postponed and that it should  have  been

allowed  to operate as from the 1st of May.  I  have

pointed  out  in my speech, Sir, that soon  after  I

took  office I had received a lot of complaints from

the  workers who demanded that the date of operation

of the Ordinance should be postponed. They expressed

a  genuine fear that the Ordinance was not in  their

interests  and  they brought up  certain  points  to

substantiate their views. It is as a result of their

representations, Sir, that it was felt necessary, in

the interests of the large majority of workers,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



that the Ordinance should not come into operation on

the 1st of May. I do not think, Sir, that the Member

for  Paya  Lebar  would  now object  to  the  Second

Reading  of  the Bill, thereby delaying  the  coming

into operation of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>Committee</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir,  before this Bill was placed in this House with

a Certificate of Urgency, I discovered -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Are you moving an amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No, Mr Chairman.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will you wait until I propose the Question?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 21 stand part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, before this

Bill  was  tabled with a Certificate of  Urgency,  I

attempted, through the Chief Minister, to  get  this

House  a  chance  to make its contribution  to  this

Bill.  I have waited till this last clause to  raise

this point: that because only one clear day's notice

was   given,  and  no  more,  no  one  has  anything

constructive to contribute to the discussion of this

Bill.  There  was  a  terrific  outcry  against  the

Provident Fund Bill -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You are confining yourself to the Schedule?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am. One of the complaints was

what  this  Schedule has now attempted  to  correct.

Contrary  to  the  expectations of  the  Progressive

Party, the Ordinance did not bring them the required

results  in the last elections. It was their  brain-child,  and  it was rejected because little  things,

like  people  who  earn less  than  $200  having  to

contribute, although they could not afford to do so,

were not taken into consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Minister for Labour has had consultations

with  mysterious representatives who have  convinced

him that $200 is the line of demarcation. It may  be

right,  it may be wrong. I had always believed  that

the  purpose of this Assembly is to allow the people

as  a  whole to make their representations,  and  to

make  their views known, on any particular piece  of

legislation.   It  is  because  of  this   important

principle  that  I say to the Government  that  this

amendment is entirely theirs. Nobody has contributed

anything to it. Nobody knew anything about it  until

it  was tabled. Notice was given, as one Member  has

said, about 36 hours ago. I have not calculated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>



the number of hours, but I think everybody is

agreed that very few in this Assembly, other than

the Minister for Labour, really know -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Point of order, Sir. Is it

permissible, on the motion now before the House, to

make this attack upon Government, and, if so, will

Government be granted an opportunity to answer it?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> As I see it, the Member for Tanjong

Pagar   is  commenting  on  the  Schedule,  and   in

particular on the $200 level.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That is so, Mr Chairman.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Now, if he goes beyond that - I am

watching him very carefully - I will try and stop him.

Government,  of course, will have an opportunity  to

reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am grateful for the indication

that  my movements are being watched very carefully.

I  am told that quite a number of my colleagues  are

also being watched carefully, and they are also very

grateful for that information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish, however, to make this point clear: that

this is the Bill of the Minister for Labour. We have

no  chance to contribute to it. We do not  know  why

$200  has  been  chosen. Who  told  him  this  magic

figure? Or how did he work it out? It is for him  to

take  the  whole responsibility for this  amendment,

and for the Labour Front Government -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Coalition!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I beg your pardon! One keeps

forgetting these little things! [Interruption.]  But

it  is for them to bear the responsibility. If there

is anything amiss, it is entirely theirs.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I would not

seek any subterfuge in answering the attack that has

been made. It is not a question of the $200 now.  It

is  a  question of the House not having  been  given

enough  time.  With your permission, Sir,  I  should

like to answer that attack.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May it please you, Sir, the Government is fully

conscious  of the need that this House  should  have

sufficient   time   to   consider   all    important

legislation.  There is no question whatsoever  about

that,  and  Government  has taken  steps,  and  will

continue  to  take  steps, to see that  Members  are

advised  long in advance of any material legislation

that will be introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of the $200 limit was aired some six

weeks  ago  and published in the newspapers.  It  is

true that it has not been circulated to Members, but

when  the Member for Tanjong Pagar tells us that  he

seeks   no   responsibility  and  has   nothing   to

contribute  and cannot understand that $200,  we  on

the  side  of the Government accept very gladly  the

responsibility for this contribution to  the  public

welfare.  We  know that the P A.P. has  nothing  to

contribute. That we have always understood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is the conduct of the P.A.P. that has

recently  set back the welfare of the workers  to  a

considerable  extent, and I do say  this:  that  the

delay  in the printing and in bringing forward  this

piece  of legislation to the notice of hon.  Members

has arisen out of such conduct; and it is our desire

to  see that the second half of the year should  see

the  commencement of this legislation, so  important

for  the  worker.  And we do not  wish  to  see  his

welfare  further postponed. That the  P.A.P. cannot

see   anything   to  contribute  after   36   hours'

deliberation is no matter for surprise, nor a matter

for regret.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Not only the P.A.P.!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported, without Amendment.



<div align="center"><b>Third Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move, "That

the Bill be now read the Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read the Third time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>LABOUR BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Governor's Address on 22nd April, 1955, it

was  announced  that  the  Government  intended   to

introduce  a  Labour  Bill to  replace  the  present

outmoded Labour Ordinance, and today the new Bill is

before hon. Members for its Second Reading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Ordinance arose out of, and was designed

to  meet,  the need to protect the large numbers  of

Indian and Chinese immigrants who were recruited  at

that  time of rapid expansion of the tin and  rubber

industries.  Its emphasis, naturally enough,  tended

to  be  on  the control of conditions of immigrants,

and   on   the  provision  of  satisfactory   living

accommodation for the immigrants. Inevitably,  large

portions   of   the   old  Ordinance   have   become

meaningless for present-day Singapore. Nevertheless,

those  provisions of the old Ordinance,  which  have

proved  their value over the years of the operation,

have  been  retained,  and their  meaning  has  been

considerably  clarified to enable them  to  be  more

readily understood by the workmen. For example,  the

power  of the Commissioner for Labour to hear claims

for wages, etc., is retained. This has proved a free

and  speedy  method  for a workman  to  settle  such

claims,  and  he  is  thus spared  the  expense  and

formality  of  laying  his  complaint  in  a   Civil

District Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many new features which bring the Bill

into  line  with  the  latest  International  Labour

Office's  Conventions  on  labour  conditions.   The

definition of "workman" has been widened to  include

drivers,  and  by making United Kingdom  departments

functioning  in  the Colony liable to  inclusion  as

employers, the workmen employed by them are  brought

within  the scope of the Bill. An entirely new  part

has  been added, Sir, regulating the recruitment  of

workmen,   which  gives  effect  to  the   principal

provisions of the I.L.O. Convention on this subject.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another new section makes main contractors jointly

and  severally responsible with sub-contractors  for

the  wages  of  the workmen, even  though  they  are

engaged directly by the sub-contractor. In the past,

Sir, a great many of the claims for arrears of wages

heard  by  the Commissioner for Labour had  involved

defaulting  sub-contractors,  and  the  workmen  had

suffered considerable hardship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, Sir, more protection is given to

children  and  young  persons.  The  employment   of

children  under  12 is prohibited, and  I  am  given

powers  to prescribe minimum rates of pay.  To  make

certain that there will be no abuses associated with

their  employment,  all children and  young  persons

will  be registered, and the Commissioner for Labour

has  powers to require that they should be medically

examined in order to ascertain their fitness for the

employment proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maternity allowances were compulsory under the old

Ordinance,  but  were based on they female  workers'

wages.  Under  the  new Bill, these  allowances  are

fixed, in order to give effect to the principle that

these benefits should be sufficient for the full and

healthy maintenance of the mother and her child.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other sections of the old Ordinance, Sir, have

been  amended to give greater protection to workmen.

For  example,  the workmen can now  claim  up  to  4

months'  arrears of wages instead of  3,  under  the

section   guaranteeing  the  priority  of  workmen's

wages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hours of work have been reduced from 9 to 8, with

overtime  at one and a half times the ordinary  rate

for any hour in excess of 8. If the workman works on

rest  days,  he  is  to receive  double  pay,  or  a

substitute day of rest. And in passing, Sir, I would

like to mention that I have given notice to move  an

amendment for a 44-hour week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill is in 17 parts, and the purpose of

these  parts  is given in the Objects  and  Reasons.

This Bill, Sir, is designed to protect artisans  and

manual  workers, but I am very conscious that  there

are  other classes of workers in Singapore, such  as

shop assistants and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>



clerical workers, who need more protection than they

enjoy at present. These classes of workers may  rest

assured that they have not been forgotten. It is  my

intention to introduce further legislation to ensure

that they, too, have fair conditions of employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Bill was brought up to replace the old Ordinance

which,  as  the Minister for Labour and Welfare  has

said, is now outmoded. We welcome such a change, but

I think it should have been brought in much earlier.

So  far  as it goes, we find that during this  short

period  since this Bill was printed - on  21st  June - a

matter  of about ten days, reactions have  not  been

unfavourable. However, I think for a  Bill  of  this

type, which affects a great portion of the people in

Singapore, people should have been allowed  time  to

air  their  views.  We have seen  in  the  papers  a

protest from some of the trade union groups,  and  I

believe  that  if  there were  more  time,  probably

industrialists, employers and employee unions  would

have  come forward, either with criticisms  or  with

better suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill, as we see it, can be accepted

generally in principle, it has brought nothing  very

new.  As  I see from the Comparative Table, we  have

introduced  into  this Bill what  has  already  been

introduced  in  other parts of the  world.  We  have

inside  it the I.L.O. and other sections from  Burma

and  India,  and  the  Children  and  Young  Persons

Ordinance. Nothing objectionable could be  found  in

that,   and   I   think  there   is   nothing   very

revolutionary.  I believe, too, that good  employers

would  have by this time carried out most  of  these

laws without any urging from the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I maintain that to allow the very short

time  of a week for the Second Reading of a Bill  of

this size is not correct. Most of the old Members of

this  Assembly probably have read the Bill a  number

of  times,  but I think for other Members  who  have

come  into  this  Assembly only very recently,  they

should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>



be  given  time to read the Bill through  carefully,

consider it, and gather opinions from all interested

bodies,  in order to make their contributions.  Like

the  other  Bill  which  has  just  been  passed,  I

believe,  Sir,  this Bill would have probably  about

the same effect. There will be plenty of Ayes on the

Government side, but we may not be able to take part

in it as fully as we would like to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this matter, however, it is important that

this  new  Bill should come into effect as  soon  as

possible.  And  I would suggest that  the  Committee

stage  of  this  Bill  be not taken  today,  but  be

postponed for a month. Perhaps by that time we  will

have gathered sufficient material for discussion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noticed, too, from the Bill that there is a

clause  concerning medical examination  of  workers,

and  it  requires  that workers be  brought  to  the

Commissioner for Labour for examination. Probably in

this  instance it might help workers,  if  they  are

large in numbers, for the doctors to examine them at

the  factories,  rather than for  large  numbers  of

people  to  go  and crowd themselves in  the  Labour

Office to be examined. I think that clause should be

amended  for  that  purpose when  it  comes  to  the

Committee stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I conclude, I would like to remind the

Government side that party government should  always

operate on a line that will enable the Opposition to

have  some  chance  of discussing  a  Bill.  It  is,

indeed,  very undemocratic for the Government  side,

who  knows everything, to keep everything back until

the  very  last  minute,  and  then  pounce  on  the

Opposition.  We  are not lawyers.  A  Bill  of  this

nature, even given to a lawyer, probably would  have

taken  him quite a lot of time to read over; and  as

laymen,  trying to understand what lawyers  want  to

put  into words, it would take us far more time.  If

this  Bill  were placed in the hands of an  ordinary

labourer, he would not even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>



understand  a little bit of it, unless it  has  been

explained to him.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Are you discussing the merits of the Bill?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I am talking of -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a point of information,

Sir. If  the  hon.  Member would permit,  it  might

assist  him. May it please you, Sir, the  Government

is  conscious of the complexity of this Bill and its

importance  for the welfare of a tremendous  section

of  the  population. The intention is that it should

go  to  a  Select Committee to report  back  in  six

weeks,  so that everybody should have an opportunity

of  studying  the Bill. I hope that  helps  my  hon.

Friend, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Thank you, Mr Chief

Minister.  I think if the Government takes  such  an

attitude as suggested by the Chief Minister, we will

definitely be satisfied.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, it is very sickening that Members

of  this Assembly often plead for time. I have heard

it often, but I do believe that on a measure of this

kind,  of which Members are fully aware, they should

not  take  two  weeks  or one month  to  express  an

opinion  in principle. As legislators we can  easily

understand  the various clauses in this Bill  if  we

have some idea of what labour conditions are, and if

individuals cannot understand I presume their  Party

would be in a position to brief them. I have no such

complaints, Sir, but I am very glad that  the  Chief

Minister has expressed the Government's intention to

refer  it  to a Select Committee. If the  Government

had  not made that announcement, I would have  moved

formally  that  the  Bill be referred  to  a  Select

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a large number of people in my

constituency who are employed by the Services, and I

take  this  opportunity on their behalf  to  express

their  appreciation for including them in this Bill.

I would also inform this House



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>



that   their   confidence  in  this  Government   is

increasing,  as  measures of this kind  which  would

benefit those employees are being introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hours of work, which was a subject of very

keen  discussion  in labour circles,  has  now  been

resolved. For a long time the manual workers of this

country  have  been struggling hard  in  negotiating

with  their employers for less hours of work, and  I

think  the  amendment envisaged by the  Minister  is

really  a good move in the right direction.  I  have

heard  it  said that 48 hours can be worked  by  any

manual labourer, and it is also argued that this  is

being  done all over the world. But we in this  part

of  the world are situated differently. Our climatic

conditions do not allow our manual labourer to  work

for 8 hours a day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Trades Union Congress, Sir, has

declared,  in one of their statements to  the  Press

the other day, that various clauses in the Bill need

special consideration, and I do hope that the Select

Committee  which is going to examine this Bill  will

invite  representatives, not only of  the  Singapore

Trades  Union Congress but of all those trade  union

organisations which are interested in the welfare of

their employees, to give their evidence. As a result

of this, when the Bill comes up at the next Assembly

sitting, it will be one which will have no criticism

from any quarter.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, the measure under discussion is a wise and far-reaching   one,  and  the  Government   is   to   be

congratulated  for the initiative it  has  taken  to

implement it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has just passed through a phase of acute

industrial  unrest, and it is to be  hoped  that  at

last something is going to be done for the worker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I look at this Bill, one problem seems

to be needing urgent attention. In a large number of

industrial concerns, no steps have been taken to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



bring  the worker into the general scheme of  things

and  convince  him that he is also  a  part  of  the

industry. On the other hand, the feeling is stressed

to  the  worker  that "You are asked to  do  certain

things. If you like to do them, you do so. Otherwise

you get out and look for a job elsewhere."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my considered opinion that a new scheme

be  set  up to bring the worker and management  into

Advisory    Boards,   bodies   which    will    send

representatives  of the workers  and  management  to

discuss  the  day-to-day problems  in  a  spirit  of

friendship and co-operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this measure is done, there will be a

lessening of the tension and frustration that  exist

today,  and this will lead to industrial  peace  and

prosperity.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome the

statement  of the Hon. the Chief Minister that  this

Bill  will be referred to a Select Committee.  There

are  therefore only two small points which  I  would

like  to  bring to the attention of this House,  and

subsequently   to   the  Select  Committee   to   be

appointed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first refers to clause 3, sub-clause (2),

which reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Governor may also appoint such other officers

with  such  powers as may be necessary for  carrying

into  effect  the provisions of this Ordinance,  and

may  incur such expense as may be necessary for  the

purpose."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take it, first of all, Sir, that it does not

mean  that the Government will not have to  come  to

this  House for the sanction of such sums as may  be

required from time to time. Further, I would like my

hon.  Friend the Minister for Labour and Welfare  to

indicate what expenditure will be required per  year

on   new  staff.  I  am  not  suggesting  that  this

important  new  Labour Code can be operated  without

staff,  but we on this side of the House would  like

to have some idea of the cost involved.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter to which I wish to refer is

maternity  benefits,  with particular  reference  to

clauses  94, subclause (2), and 96. These  read  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 94.-(2) (Rate of maternity allowance).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A female workman who has worked under the

employer  from whom she claims maternity benefit  on

not less than one hundred and eighty days within the

period  of one year immediately preceding the notice

required under subsection (2) of section 98 of  this

Ordinance shall be paid maternity allowance  at  the

rate  of  four dollars per diem during  the  benefit

period."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 96.-(Payment of maternity allowance).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The amount of the maternity allowance shall be

payable in two instalments, the first for the period

up  to  and including the day of confinement, to  be

paid  within  seven days of the date of confinement,

and the second, for the period after confinement, to

be  paid  within  seven days  of  the  end  of  that

period."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset I want to make it very clear that we

welcome maternity benefits. We welcome the 8  weeks'

benefit  period, and we approve the $4 per day  rate

of  payment for those who have worked for  180  days

for  one  employer  out of the  preceding  year.  We

would,  however, like to suggest an  improvement  in

the  method  of payment and the time of payment  for

the  consideration of this House and of  the  Select

Committee to be appointed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at present drafted, a female workman will be

entitled to $224 as benefit - $112 payable within one

week of confinement, and the balance of $112 a month

later.  This means that she will receive no  payment

of  any  kind for one month before confinement,  and

possibly for one week afterwards - surely at  a  time

when  it  is  most needed. I suggest, Sir,  that  it

would be more humane and helpful to continue to  pay

the  normal rate of weekly wages up to a maximum  of

$4 per day throughout the benefit period, and make a

lump sum payment of the balance one week before  the

expected  day  of  confinement when  money  is  most

needed. That is to say, if the normal rate of  wages

is  $3  per day, which is quite common in Singapore,

this  should  be  paid  weekly  in  the  normal  way

throughout the benefit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>



period,  that is $168 in all; the balance  from  the

$224, namely $56, to be paid as a lump-sum ex-gratia

payment  one  week  before  the  expected   day   of

confinement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of female workmen earning at the rate

of  $4  per  day, or above, they should receive  the

payments weekly at the rates laid down under  clause 94 (2).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have made my point clear. I do not seek

to  reduce  the  period of benefit or  the  rate  of

benefit. I seek to improve the method of payment.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lim Yew Hock, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to

the  points  raised by the Member for  Tanglin  (Mr

John Ede), I would like to assure him that they will

be  fully considered by the Select Committee that is

to  be  appointed. I would, however, like to explain

why  it had been found necessary to fix the date  of

payment  as  one week after the date of confinement.

It  is because it is difficult for any employer,  or

even the female worker herself, to know when she  is

going to be confined. But this matter -



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir. It

is  perhaps more difficult to know one month  before

when the benefit period starts! [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> In regard to all the other

points raised, Sir, as the Bill will be referred  to

a  Select Committee, they will, of course, be  taken

into   consideration  when  the   Select   Committee

deliberates on the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Bill be committed to a Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members know, no notice is required of

this motion. In view of the experience of the public

of Select Committees in years gone by - they had a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some sort of defect in that Standing

does not apply to a Select Committee on a Bill.  You

could, of course, move that the Members be appointed

<div align="center"><b>INTERPRETATION AND GENERAL CLAUSES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. J. Davies (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr E. J. Davies):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main changes which this Bill seeks to

make to the principal Ordinance flow from the

introduction of a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



Ministerial   system   of   government,   but    the

opportunity has also been taken to include  in  this

Bill  two  other amendments which are considered  by

Government to be desirable. Those are clauses 2  and

3 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill purports to amend section 29

of the principal Ordinance which provides that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where a written law confers power on any person

to  do or enforce the doing of any act or thing, all

such powers shall be understood to be also conferred

as  are reasonably necessary to enable the person to

do or enforce the doing of the act or thing."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience over the past few years has shown that

it  is  desirable that such powers  should  be  more

particularly expressed in the law, and clause  2  of

the  Bill, as Members will see, expressly gives  the

power to prohibit and control and includes the power

to  provide therefor by licensing; and the power to

grant  a  licence, permission or exemption  includes

the  power to impose conditions. This new provision,

Sir,  finds  a  place in most modern  Interpretation

Ordinances  of  other territories, and  it  is  long

overdue in this Colony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 is designed to provide that section 32 of

the  principal  Ordinance shall he amended  so  that

substantive  appointments may  be  made  to  offices

without  delay  when the former holder  proceeds  on

leave  prior to retirement or transfer. This  clause

3,  Sir, follows the usual pattern of clauses in the

Interpretation Ordinances of other territories, and,

indeed, finds a place in our own Order in Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining clauses deal directly with the

Ministerial system of government, and I  venture  to

think  that they are fully and adequately  explained

in  the  Objects and Reasons attached to the printed

copy  of the Bill. I venture to think that there  is

nothing  controversial in those  provisions,  or  at

least nothing that should cause any undue concern to

Members  on  either this side of the  House  or  the

other side. I therefore beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>ISSUE OF $30,000,000 SINGAPORE CITY COUNCIL 4% DEBENTURE STOCK 1955</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Sir, I

have  the  authority of His Excellency  the  Officer

Administering the Government to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with section 343

of  the  Municipal Ordinance (Chapter 133) sanctions

the  raising  of a loan of $30 million by  the  City

Council  for  the  purposes  stated  and  under  the

conditions specified in Sessional Paper No.  Cmd.  6

of 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at a special meeting of the City Council held

on  24th June, it was unanimously resolved to borrow

a  sum not exceeding $30 million by the creation  of

Debenture  Stock issued at 96, bearing  interest  at

4%, and redeemable at the option of the City Council

between 1970 and 1980.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this year the City Council has budgeted for

expenditure  on loan account totalling approximately

$40  million.  This  budget, in the  main,  concerns

extension   schemes  already  in   being   for   the

Electricity, Water and Gas Departments. Towards this

expenditure, at the beginning of this year, the City

Council had in hand a sum of $1�



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>



million, being the unexpended balance of the 4% loan

raised  in  November of last year. This sum  is  now

exhausted and loan account expenditure has,  in  the

meantime,  been financed to the extent of almost  $7

million from surplus revenue balances. It is  clear,

therefore, that the coffers of the City Council must

be replenished as soon as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was originally intended to float this loan at a

discount  of 2�%. Recently, however, interest  rates

have  hardened  slightly, and  the  Council  is  now

advised  that, in order to bring the terms  of  this

new  loan  into line with current market conditions,

the rate of discount should be increased to 4%. This

variation  in  the terms of the loan will  have  the

effect of increasing the redemption yield from 4.15%

to  4.25%, and should have the effect of making  the

loan attractive to investors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already stated, it is proposed to use

the proceeds of this new loan mainly for the further

expansion of the City Council's electricity, gas and

water  undertakings. During the years from  1948  to

1954  the  City  Council has borrowed  approximately

$140  million  mainly for the development  of  these

undertakings. It is now possible to see the  results

of this expenditure. The funds have clearly been put

to  productive  use. The increase in output  of  the

three utility departments has been most marked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of electricity, for example, in 1948

sales  averaged 300,000 units a day. At the  present

time, they average 800,000 units a day. In the  case

of  water, sales have risen from 27� million gallons

a  day  in 1948 to 46 million gallons a day  at  the

present  time. In the case of gas, sales have  risen

from  600,000 cubic feet a day in 1948 to 1� million

cubic feet a day at the present time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore develops, the demand for these

services  will increase at an even faster rate  than

it  has  in the past, and I think hon. Members  will

agree  that money cannot be invested better than  in

such undertakings. Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with section 343

of  the  Municipal Ordinance (Chapter 133) sanctions

Council  for  the  purposes  stated  and  under  the

<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> Sir, as the hour is now past twelve, do you wish me to continue?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Let us try this one, shall we?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Before speaking to the motion standing

in my name, I seek permission to touch on one or two

connected subjects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, a new Customs Ordinance

was enacted in February of this year. This Ordinance

consolidates  and  amends the law  relating  to  the

collection  of  revenue  on  intoxicating   liquors,

tobacco and petroleum. It is hoped to bring this law

into operation in the near future, when the existing

Liquors  Revenue Ordinance, Tobacco  Duty  Ordinance

and   the   Petroleum  Revenue  Ordinance  will   be

repealed.  In preparation for the coming into  force

of  the new Ordinance, it is necessary to promulgate

the rules and regulations and subsidiary legislation

required  to  implement the law. Hon.  Members  will

have noticed that today there have been tabled three

Sessional Papers, which include the regulations  and

rules  which  have  been made  by  the  Governor  in

Council under the new Customs Ordinance. These rules

and  regulations have been published in the  Gazette

for the information of the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sessional Paper No. 20 contains the Liquors

Licensing  Regulations, 1955,  which  supersede  the

Liquors  Licensing  Rules, 1937. Several  amendments

have  been  incorporated in these  new  Regulations,

mostly connected with bringing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>



existing procedure into line with modern conditions.

The   opportunity  has  been  taken  to  incorporate

certain   recommendations  made   by   the   Liquors

Licensing Law Committee. No change in fees has  been

proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sessional Paper No. 21 contains the Customs

Regulations,  1955,  which have  been  made  by  the

Governor  in Council under section 114  of  the  new

Ordinance,  and  which  consolidate  and  amend  the

Liquors Revenue Rules, 1937, the Tobacco Duty Rules,

1948,  the  Petroleum  Duty  Rules,  1948,  and  the

Petroleum   Revenue  (Heavy  Oil  Engined  Vehicles)

Rules, 1948. Here again, the amendments proposed are

mostly procedural, and they are aimed at making  the

Customs Department more efficient and adding to  the

convenience of the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sessional Paper No. 22 contains the Customs

(Duties)  Order,  1955. This Order reintroduces  the

rates of duty on tobacco, petroleum and liquor which

were  in force under the old Order. No change is  at

present contemplated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also necessary to introduce legislation

connected with the special rates of tax on  vehicles

using  heavy oil and diesel oil. This brings  me  to

the  motion standing in my name. As hon. Members are

aware, this duty is imposed under section 16 (2)  of

the  new  Ordinance. Before moving the motion,  Sir,

which  I  have  the authority of His Excellency  the

Governor to do, I would like to draw attention to  a

clerical  inadvertence which  has  occurred  in  the

terms of the motion. Hon. Members will note that the

words "traction engines" and "motor cars" appear  in

the  motion  when, in fact, under the new  Ordinance

the   term  used  is  "motor  vehicles".  I   should

therefore, with your permission, like to  amend  the

motion  as follows: In the third line of the motion,

I  should like to substitute for the words "traction

engines  and motor cars" the words "motor vehicles".

In  the first line of section (a) of the Schedule in

the  motion, I wish to substitute the word "vehicle"

for  the  word "car"; and under section (c)  of  the

Schedule, I should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



like  to  delete  the  words "traction  engine"  and

substitute  therefor  the  phrase  "motor  vehicles

constructed for the conveyance of passengers".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here a copy of the amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy handed to Mr Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The motion will then read - shall I read it?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I just look through this first,

would   you  mind?  Have  hon.  Members  got   those amendments?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Hart, they are in order; they do

not  involve  any material change in any  principle,

and I therefore allow the amendments.

Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think you had better, now that it

has been amended.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The motion then reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the scales of the

special  tax leviable under section 16  (2)  of  the

Customs Ordinance, 1955, on motor vehicles which are

equipped with engines using heavy oil or diesel  oil

as  fuel  or  fitted with producer  gas  attachments

shall  be  with effect from the date of  the  coming

into  force of that Ordinance the scales set out  in

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These rates, Sir, are the same as are enforced at

the present moment. The only alteration suggested in

this  motion is that provision will be made  in  the

resolution  for  a  rebate of tax on  road  rollers.

This,  at  the present time, is made by the Governor

in   Council  under  the  Fees  Ordinance.   It   is

considered  more  appropriate  that  it  should   be

included in this resolution. Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have had occasion to ask both my

learned  Friends  on either side  of  me  what  the

expression "hackney carriage" means. It  is  rather

a  hackneyed  phrase, and I do  recommend  that  in

future legislation the words "hackney carriage"  be

substituted  for  something much more  fitting  for

the modem types of vehicles we use today.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I am afraid I have not couched my motion

amendment. In section (c) of the Schedule,  I  said,

in reading out the amendment:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For every motor vehicle constructed for the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the scales of the

special  tax  leviable under section 16  (2)  o  the

Customs Ordinance, 1955, on motor vehicles which are

equipped with engines using heavy oil or diesel  oil

as  fuel  or  fitted with producer  gas  attachments

shall  be  with effect from the date of  the  coming

into  force of that Ordinance the scales set out  in

the Schedule hereto: -



<pre>

                       SCHEDULE



(a)  For  every motor vehicle constructed  for  the

     conveyance  of  passengers (other than  a  hackney

     carriage) - twice the amount of the computed  annual

     licence fee prescribed for a motor vehicle of  the

     same class or description under section 45 of  the

     Road Traffic Ordinance, 1941.



                                                  per

                                                 annum

                                                   $

(b)  For every hackney carriage -

       for each passenger up to 20 for which

        the vehicle is licensed                     36

       for each additional passenger

        in excess of 20                             24

<div align="center"><b>SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 5 of 1955)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> Sir, I have the authority of His

Excellency  the Officer Administering the Government

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of

$17,320,223  should be supplied  to  the  Government

under  the Heads of Expenditure and for the services

specified in Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 5 of 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the applications under items 105 to 109 have

already  been approved under the delegated authority

obtained  from the Assembly at the last sitting  and

are now submitted for covering approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to item 105, a new compressor is

required for the refrigerating plant at the  Fishery

Station,   Bedok.  Cold  storage  accommodation   is

provided there at a rental of $10 a day for the fish

trade to enable it to accommodate glut supplies. The

existing  compressor was installed in 1937, suffered

from  lack of maintenance during the Japanese  time,

and is now becoming rapidly unserviceable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 106 refers to the supply of four Radio-Telephony sets for the Master Attendant's launches

to  enable  communications to be maintained  between

launches and between the shore and launches in times

of  emergency; for example, during a fire  when  all

visual signalling is impracticable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 107 refers to the post of the Serjeant at

Arms.  Hon. Members will recall that this  post  was

entered  in the Estimates for 1955, but the question

of  salary  was left in abeyance until  Mr  Speaker

returned  from  the  United Kingdom  and  until  the

identity  of the officer selected to hold  the  post

was  known. Mr Speaker returned late in March,  and

it  became  a  matter of some urgency to  appoint  a

Serjeant  at Arms, and it was decided to  offer  the

post to Che Mahmood at a salary of $650 per month. I

am very glad to say he saw



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>



his  way to accept, and this sum is now required  to

supplement  Head "Legislature" to enable his  salary

to be paid with effect from the 21st of April.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 108 refers to a duplicator required by the

Government Medical Store. The present duplicator was

salvaged  from  a  Japanese dump and  has  now  been

condemned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards item 109, this extra equipment is

rendered  necessary by the fact  that  it  has  been

decided   that  certain  categories  of   Government

servants  should  contribute  towards  the   Central

Provident Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items 110 to 130 are submitted for the approval of

the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 110 seeks approval to create a Grade B post

for  Mr McNeice. It has been announced already that

Mr  McNeice will be seconded for duty in connection

with the committee that is considering the City  and

Island Council Bill and other connected matters.  He

may  also be required for other services. His duties

will be full-time, and he will not be able to devote

any  time  to  the  City Council.  It  is  therefore

necessary to create a Supernumerary Grade B post for

Mr   McNeice,  and  thus  free  the  post  of   the

President,   City   Council,  for  the   substantive

promotion of another officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 111 is an application for supplementary

provision  for  the Singapore Airport. Approximately

$3.8  million  has been provided in the  Development

Estimates  for  1955. It is now estimated  that  the

work,  which  will be completed in 1955,  will  cost

approximately $10,000,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice that under item 130 provision of

C.D.  &  W. money to the extent of $1.4 million  is

sought, and that under item 134 a revote of $208,340

is  requested.  These,  with the  supplement  sought

under  item  111  and  the  money  provided  in  the

Estimates  this  year,  will  make  up  the  sum  of

$10,000,000. This will be required for  the  runway,

taxi-tracks   and  parking  aprons  which,   it   is

estimated,  will cost this year $3.8 million;  roads

$1,000,000, electrical installations $1,000,000, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>



so  on. I should say, at this stage, that the latest

estimate  of  cost  for  the  Singapore  Airport  is

$46,000,000, of which $10,000,000 will  be  provided

by  C.D.  & W. Fund and $3.9 million by the Ministry

of Civil Aviation of the United Kingdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items 112, 115, 117 and 125 can, with convenience,

be  taken  together,  since all  arise  out  of  the

revision  of  superscale salaries which  took  place

last  year.  With regard to Item 112,  the  post  of

Deputy  Secretary to the Ministry  of  Commerce  was

previously  graded IB, M.C.S. When the  revision  of

salaries took place, all other Class IB M.C.S. posts

were upgraded to Grade E, with the exception of this

particular post. The result of the salaries revision

in  this  case  was  not an upward  revision  but  a

downgrading. Since then, it has become  quite  clear

that  the post is under-graded at Grade F, and  that

the  duties  and  responsibilities  attached  to  it

warrant Grade E and that is now proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 115 refers to the post of Chief Inspector of

Schools, which again was graded on revision at Grade

F.  Having  regard to the expansion  of  educational

facilities  and the great increase in responsibility

which  falls on the shoulders of the Chief Inspector

of Schools, it has been decided that the post should

properly be graded at Grade E.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 117 refers to the post of Director of

Botanical Gardens, which should be upgraded to Grade

F. Hitherto, before the revision of salaries, it was

placed on the same grade as Director of Museums  and

Deputy Director of Broadcasting. On revision,  these

posts  were graded Grade F, but the post of Director

of Botanical Gardens was left, for no understandable

reason,  at  Grade  G.  It is  now  clear  that  the

responsibilities  and  status  of  the  Director  of

Botanical  Gardens merit upgrading, and  it  is  now

proposed that the post should be Grade F.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, item 125 - Deputy Government Printer - on

revision of superscale salaries, the salary of  this

post was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>



fixed  at  $1,300, which was in the  middle  of  the

professional officers' timescale. There was no  real

reason  for creating this special superscale salary.

It  is  now  thought  desirable,  especially  having

regard   to  the  duties  performed  by  the  Deputy

Government  Printer,  that it  would  be  better  to

substitute the upper segment of the timescale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing now to the other items, we come to item

113 - Customs  Secret Service. Rewards are  paid  from

time  to  time  for information which leads  to  the

apprehension  of  smugglers and to  the  seizure  of

dutiable   goods,  and  some  of  the  rewards   are

substantial. $100,000 was provided in the Estimates,

and  that is now exhausted, and there are  one  or

two  substantial rewards remaining to  be  paid.  In

1954,  expenditure  under this  Head  came  to  over

$300,000,  and it is possible that expenditure  this

year will be of the same order. Therefore, we seek a

supplement of $200,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 116 - Refunds of Estate Duty - it sometimes

happens  that estate duty is overpaid and  a  refund

has to be made. At the present time, there is a case

outstanding,  where duty has been  overpaid  to  the

extent  of  $27,000, and we seek to  supplement  the

Vote, which stands at $10,000, by $26,907.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items 118 and 119 refer to two posts lit the

Ministry of Lands - one for a (G.C.S. Clerk  and  one

for  a Stenographer. My hon. Friend the Minister for

Local Government, Lands and Housing, finds that  his

Ministry  is understaffed, and he seeks the creation

of these two new posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 120. About two months ago, when the question

of  entertainment  allowance  for  Mr  Speaker  was

considered, it was felt that, like the Ministers, he

might call upon the block Entertainment Vote when he

had   to  entertain.  This  is  now  clearly   quite

unsuitable,  and  it is desirable that  Mr  Speaker

should  have an entertainment allowance of his  own.

It  is not subject to any scrutiny or control by the

Treasury.  It is therefore proposed that  we  should

give him an entertainment allowance of $400 a month,

which is the same as that for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>

the Chief Justice and the Chief Secretary. Provision

is  now asked to pay this allowance from the 1st  of

August this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 121 seeks further provision for the upkeep of

Mr  Speaker's house and grounds. Hon. Members  will

recall that at the first sitting of the Assembly,  I

sought  provision for precisely this  service.  That

provision was based on an estimate of my own  as  to

the  sum required to upkeep Mr Speaker's house  and

grounds.  Now,  I fear I have rather under-estimated

the  matter.  Neither  did I  allow  for  sufficient

servants nor did I propose to pay them enough. I  am

now satisfied that I have under-estimated the matter

and now seek further provision to enable Mr Speaker

to employ the minimum staff required to maintain his

house  and  grounds till the end of the  year.  This

provision  also provides for the employment  of  one

"Tukang Kebun".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 122 is a very substantial item. It was

decided in August last year to invite the members of

the  Colombo  Plan  Consultative Committee  to  hold

their  next  meeting in Singapore. It was considered

appropriate that this should be done in  a  year  of

great constitutional development in Singapore.  This

invitation  was extended in Ottawa and was  accepted

with very great pleasure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting will fall into two parts. Firstly, in

the last week of September and the first two and a

half  weeks  in October, there will be a meeting  of

officials from all the member countries to  consider

the  progress of the Colombo Plan over the  previous

year,  to  consider  the reports  from  the  various

member  countries, and to draft the statistical  and

annual  reports  of  the  Colombo  Plan  itself  for

presentation  to  the meeting of Ministers.  In  the

third week of October, Ministers from all the member

countries will attend and will discuss questions  of

policy  arising  from  the  implementation  of   the

Colombo Plan, economic developments of East Asia and

other kindred matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear that this is going to be a very

considerable undertaking. A



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



very high standard has been set at previous meetings

in  London, Karachi, New Delhi and Ottawa and it  is

considered   that  Singapore  should  endeavour   to

achieve  the  same standard. The arrangements  which

have  been made so far in the Treasury are now being

made under the supervision of a Committee of Members

of  this House, consisting of the Assistant Minister

for Commerce and Industry, the Member for Paya Lebar

(Mr  Lim  Koon Teck), Mr Sutherland and myself.  I

think  all arrangements are up to date, and  I  feel

confident that we will be able to stage a conference

in the same way and as successfully as has been done

in other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will, however, be a costly undertaking. The

Victoria  Memorial Hall will have to be redecorated,

and  the  first floor arranged and prepared  as  the

main  conference chamber. On the ground  floor  will

have  to  he built office accommodation for  various

delegations. This has been done at previous meetings

in  the past. A secretariat for the conference  will

have  to be set up, and will have to consist of able

officers.  A very high standard of ability  will  be

required to run this conference. Accommodation  will

have   to   be  provided  for  all  delegations   in

accordance with precedent. Transport will have to be

provided, and there will have to be a certain amount

of  entertainment, particularly at  the  Ministerial

level. We have estimated that the total cost will be

somewhere  between $270,000 and $300,000.  I  cannot

say  at the present time just exactly how much  will

be  spent.  Every  effort will  be  made  to  reduce

expenditure as much as possible, but I think it will

be  of  the  order of $270,000 to $300,000.  Members

will  also recall that this expenditure has  already

been  accepted  in  principle by the  entry  in  the

Estimates for 1955 of a token vote for the  cost  of

the Colombo Plan Conference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 123 refers to anti-malarial and other health

precautions which have to be taken at the  Singapore

Airport  to comply with international civil aviation

standards. Previously, we sought a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



vote of $100,000 for drainage works and $25,000  for

the  laying  of a piped water supply. Now,  we  find

that  further drainage work is required and  certain

equipment  will have to be bought for  anti-malarial

work. Hence, we seek a supplement of $20,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 124 refers to the construction of

accommodation  for  a Police Ghurkha  contingent  at

Mount  Vernon on Bartley Road. This work falls  into

two  phases.  The total cost is about the  order  of

$3,000,000. Phase I has been virtually completed.  A

small  revote of $200,000 is asked for later  on  in

the  Schedule.  The P.W.D. now find  that  they  can

press on with Phase II this year. It was intended to

enter  provision for Phase II in the Estimates,  but

it   was  inadvertently  overlooked.  We  now   seek

$1,250,000, which is required to complete Phase II.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 126 seeks authority to create a post of

Superintendent of Prisons. Under he Criminal Justice

(Temporary Provisions) Ordinance, and I think  under

section  13  of the Criminal Procedure  Code,  1955,

provision is made for two new types of detention.  I

think  they  are  called "corrective  training"  and

"preventive detention", the object being that  while

a prisoner is detained, provided that he co-operates

with  the  prison authorities, he will be  sent  out

into  the world, on completion of his sentence,  fit

to  take  his  place in society. As I say,  the  co-operation  of  the  prisoner  is  required.  It  is,

however, essential that a man of great experience in

this  type  of  work be obtained to  carry  out  the

scheme  and,  at  the  same  time,  to  train  other

officers to expand and continue the scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 127 seeks provision for the staff required by

the  Chief  Minister  in his  office  of  the  Chief

Minister.  It was, I think, envisaged  at  the  time

when  the Constitution was drawn up that, as far  as

the Chief Minister was concerned, the emphasis would

be  on a portfolio and that the officer holding  the

portfolio  would be Chief Minister in addition.  The

Constitution has developed very considerably in  the

last two months, and we find that the Chief Minister

has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



responsibilities which are quite distinct  from  and

certainly not less important than those arising from

the Ministry of Commerce. It has been found that  if

he  is to do his work as Chief Minister, he requires

a  very  capable  staff,  and  the  staff  which  he

requires is shown in the first portion of item  127.

The  second portion of item 127 makes provision  for

the  Economic Adviser and for the staff required for

his sub-office. These posts, of course, will not  be

filled until an Economic Adviser is appointed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 128 makes provision for stationery and other

matters  of a similar nature required by  the  Chief

Minister's office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 129 seeks provision for new office furniture

and equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 130 seeks the authority of the



Assembly  to  draw $1.4 million of  the  $10,000,000

grant from the C.D.& W. Fund for expenditure on  the

Singapore Airport this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the remaining items, that is items 131 to 229,

make  up  a  very  formidable list of  Revotes,  the

majority of which refer to public works and  capital

works. These are presented in this Paper in the form

in  which it has been customary to use in the  past;

but  having seen it in print, I now appreciate  that

it would be desirable, and it would have been clearer

to  hon. Members, if I had given details in columnar

forms; for example, if I had laid out this Paper  in

the  following  way  in columns:   Amount  voted  in 1954:Amount spent in 1954: Balance unspent at the end

of  1954:  Amount  revoted in  the  1955  Estimates:

Additional revote now required - that would give  hon.

Members all the information about the revotes  which

they  required. This new layout will be followed  in

future. In the meantime, however, I have all  the necessary information here, and I will be  only  too

glad to supply it to hon. Members in connection with

any   item   they  may  wish  to  raise.  Of   these

applications for revotes, items 134, 136, 137,  138, 140,  142, 145, 156, 161 to 169, 171, 176, 183, 184, 192,  193, 203, 204, 207, 209, 211, 223 to  227  are

unforeseen  revotes, in addition to revotes  already

shown in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



the  annual  Estimates. How these are arrived  at  I

will  make  it clear by quoting an example.  Let  us

imagine  that  provision  has  been  made   in   the

Estimates for a school costing $300,000. By the time

September comes round, when the Estimates are  being

finalised,  the  Director of Public Works  considers

that  a certain amount of work will have to be  left

over  to  be  done  in the following  year  and  the

estimated   cost  of  that  work  is  $100,000.   He

therefore  seeks  authority to  enter  a  revote  of

$100,000  in next year's Estimates. After September,

something  unforeseen happens - perhaps a dock  strike

in  the  United  Kingdom or delays  in  delivery  of

material - and  when the accounts are finally  closed,

it  is found that instead of $100,000 worth of  work

undone,  $150,000  worth of work  was  left  undone.

Therefore,   it  becomes  necessary   to   seek   an

unforeseen revote of $50,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining items in the Schedule refer to

revotes  which were completely unforeseen  when  the

Estimates  were drawn up in September  last.  Either

the  money for the project is voted too late  to  be

spent  in 1955 or else something unexpected happened

after September, 1954, which prevented it from being

spent.  In  the case of these unforeseen revotes - and

when  I say unforeseen revotes, I refer to the  last

category which I mentioned - where work has had to  go

on,  advances  have  been made by  the  Treasury  in

accordance with previous practice. This practice is,

in  my  opinion, open to objection in so far  as  it

commits   funds   without  the   sanction   of   the

Legislature,  and  it was partly  to  overcome  this

objection that I sought power at the last sitting of

the   Assembly   to  approve  revotes   in   certain

circumstances in advance of the covering approval of

the    Assembly.    However,   I   appreciate    the

constitutional  apprehensions  of  the  Member   for

Tanjong  Pagar in this connection, and  it  has  now

been   arranged  that  applications  for   necessary

unforeseen revotes will be made at the last  sitting

of  the  Assembly in each year. These  revotes  will

merely be rough guesses of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>



amount left over unexpended at the end of the  year,

but  will enable work to continue uninterrupted into

the  next year. In the middle of the year, as we are

doing  now, after the accounts are closed,  we  will

come forward for an unforeseen revote of the balance

remaining  unspent. This will obviate  the  need  to

authorise  advances as has been done  in  the  past,

and,  at  the same time, obviate the need to approve

revotes   in   advance  of  the  approval   of   the

Legislature,  as was proposed in the  last  sitting.

The  power  given  to  the Government  at  the  last

sitting  of the Assembly will consequently  only  be

used in cases of emergency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these applications for revotes have been

examined  with  care  in the  Treasury  and  by  the

Finance  Committee of the Council  of  Ministers  to

make  sure that the need for the work continues  and

that  no  more  is  asked for than  is  required  to

complete   the   job.  The  services  and   projects

themselves were approved by the Legislature  in  the

first  instance, because they were regarded as being

essential services and works of top priority.  There

are  some 90 items altogether. It will take too much

time if I have to explain each one in detail. In any

case, not all hon. Members are interested in all the

applications.   In  the  circumstances,   it   would

probably be better if I left it, to hon. Members to

speak  on  those items in which they are  interested

and to seek further information. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have listened

with  considerable care to the remarks of  the  Hon.

the  Financial Secretary in his presentation of this

motion,  and I am somewhat less bewildered now  that

we have had his explanations of some of the details,

than I had been in the last two days by the mass  of

figures on the Paper before us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before you give hon. Members, as I hope you

will,  the opportunity of raising as many points  as

they  desire - on as many occasions as they  desire - I

wish to make a few general observations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>



regarding  financial procedure and to  ask  my  hon.

Friend  for  clarification regarding such procedure.

It is our right, indeed our duty, as Members of this

House to keep a jealous watch on the expenditure  of

public  money, and I am not entirely convinced  that

this  House is being asked to vote this sum of  over

$17,000,000 in entirely the proper manner,  so  that

we can be reasonably certain that this huge sum will

be or has been properly spent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put these views forward with considerable

diffidence,  but I must confess myself  to  being  a

novice in the intricacies of government finance,  as

indeed  perhaps are many hon. Members  present,  and

our  problem  has not been made easier by  the  fact

that  this motion and the financial details involved

reached hon. Members only two days ago. At the  risk

of  repetition, I must add my protest to those of my

colleagues at the way in which the business of  this

Assembly is being conducted -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order, Mr Ede. Your

observations on  financial  procedure   could   be

referred  to  the Standing Orders Committee  or  you

could  bring  those  points  forward  by  way  of  a

substantive motion. What is before the  House  is  a

motion  asking  that the Assembly  resolves  that  a

certain sum should be supplied to the Government for

certain  expenditure. The procedure may be  open  to

criticism,  but I do not think this  is  the  proper

time to criticise the procedure as such.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I be advised

as  to  whether  I  may ask questions  on  different

items, taken as a whole or separately, as we proceed

through the items?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Hon. Members will remember that I did

lay  down  a  procedure last time we  dealt  with  a

resolution  of  this  nature.  I  think   the   most

satisfactory way is for Members to raise  points  on

any  one item, and then I will invite discussion  on

that  particular  item only. When all  Members  have

spoken  on  that  particular  item,  I  will  invite

suggestions or criticisms on another item. In  other

words, we will take item by item as they are raised.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, on page 2, item 113, Subhead 4 - Customs Secret Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, Sir, as the Hon. the Financial

Secretary stated, there was an expenditure of  about

$300,000 on Secret Service, and I see that there  is

every  prospect of repeating this amount.  Sometimes

it  may  be  even more. Sir, I wonder  whether  this

procedure  of giving rewards to the Customs  Service

to  find out the culprits is a very desirable  thing

to  do. I feel that it amounts to a bribery from the

Government  side,  and that the  existing  personnel

should  be asked to strengthen the service in  order

to  enable  the culprits to be caught,  rather  than

being  paid a reward for bringing these culprits  to

book.  I  feel, Sir, that investigations  should  be

made   into  tile  existing  procedure  of   finding

culprits  and  to  see  whether  economy  could   be

effected in spending this money. I do not think  the

public  of Singapore can afford to pay $300,000,  or

sometimes  perhaps more, or a similar  sum  entirely

for  a  secret service of this nature. There are  so

many  other social services in abeyance.  The  other

point,  Sir,  I  wish to raise -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. Have you finished with that item?



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Item 113. Mr Hart, would you like to

reply  now, or would you like to reply right at  the end?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I think probably it would be better,

Sir,  if I reply item by item. Sir, first of all,  I

would like to say to the Member for Seletar that the

efficiency  of the Customs Service is  our  constant

preoccupation, and I should also like to  say  that,

in  my  opinion,  it  is a most  efficient  service.

Secondly, I would like to say that these rewards are

not paid to members of the Customs Service. They are

paid  to members of the public who are prepared,  in

some cases, to risk their lives to give us notice of

attempts  to smuggle dangerous commodities into  the

territory.  In many cases, the value  of  the  goods

seized as a result of this information exceeds  many

times  over  the amount of the rewards paid.  In  my

opinion, this money is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



well  spent. Rewards over a certain amount  are  not

paid without reference to me. I am satisfied that no

rewards have been paid wrongly or unwisely.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may be

permitted  to  take several items coming  under  the

heading of Personal Emoluments with Token Votes -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will you name them?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It is 110 - "Personal Emoluments,

Subhead 1, item (new) - Supernumerary Officer, Grade B

($2,075)    ...    $10.00    (Token) - Commerce    and

Industry - Personal  Emoluments,   Subhead   1,   item

(2) - Deputy  Secretary to Ministry  of  Commerce  and

Industry, Grade E" -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Item 112, is it not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> 112 - Head 12.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 15, item 1l5 - "Chief Inspector of Schools,

Grade  E  ... $10.00 (Token): Botanical Gardens - Head

18, item 117 - Director of Botanical Gardens, Grade F

... $10.00 (Token)".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 23, items 118 and 119 - there is no quarrel

with that at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 33 Printing Office - "Personal Emoluments,

Subhead  1, item (2) - Deputy Government Printer  ...

$10.00   (Token)",  and  Head  34  Prisons - "Personal

Emoluments".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I understand the Hon. the Financial

Secretary, they fall under two categories.  One,  in

the case of the item under Head 34, was necessitated

by  a  revision in the Criminal Procedure Code.  The

types  of  punishment  meted out  made  necessary  a

different kind of officer to fill a new appointment.

The others, as far as I can make out, fall under the

other  category  of regrading as  a  result  of  the

constitutional changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going from Grade F to Grade E, for instance, in

the case of the post of Deputy Secretary to Ministry

of Commerce and Industry -



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> On a point of information, Sir. The

items to which my hon. Friend the Member for Tanjong

Pagar refers, excluding item 110 which refers to the

post necessitated by Mr McNeice's transfer to other

duties, do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>



arise  out of any constitutional change. They  arise

as  a  result of the revision of superscale salaries

which took place in the middle of last year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Do I understand the Hon. the

Financial  Secretary  to say that  these  superscale

revisions had nothing to do with the creation of the

various   Permanent   Secretaryships   and   Deputy

Permanent   Secretaryships  as  a  result   of   the

impending constitutional changes?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Yes, Sir. As I say, this was revision of

salary - this  question  of  revision  of   superscale

salaries was embarked on long before there  was  any

question of constitutional change.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> July, last year?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The question of revision of superscale

salaries  started very considerably before that.  It

came  to  fruition about the middle  of  last  year.

These  posts were, in fact, regraded on their merits

as  part  of  the  service and had  no  relation  to

constitutional   developments,   the   creation   of

Ministries,  or  anything like  that.  The  post  of

Deputy  Secretary to the Ministry  of  Commerce  and

Industry was the previous post of Deputy Director of

Commerce  and Industry. It still is and the  officer

holding it performs the same functions and the  same

duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Still on information?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Still on information, Sir. Do I

take   that  explanation  to  mean  that  all  these

revisions  would  have  been  made  in  any   event,

regardless  of  the  creation  of  these   Permanent

Secretaryships?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, these are anomalies which have

arisen  out of the full scale revision of superscale

salaries,   and  we  merely  wish  to  rectify   the

anomalies.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I may refer to the

same items as the Member for Tanjong Pagar. I hope I

am not encroaching on a matter of procedure again. I

think it is a question of voting money. I would  ask

my hon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



Friend to elucidate why Token Votes of $10 are given

in  each  of these cases. I was under the impression

that  Token  Votes are only inserted in an  estimate

because  the  grant  cannot  be  estimated  due   to

insufficient  details being available,  but  in  all

these cases, the details of grades and salary scales

are,  in  fact, stated in the Paper, and  I  see  no

reason  why  the  proper amount required  cannot  be

asked  for now. I ask that, also because, if  I  may

refer  to item 127, it will be seen under that  Head

that a total vote has been asked for even in respect

of  the  Chief Minister's Economic Adviser, who  has

not  yet been appointed. I fail to see therefore the

distinction between the different Heads, and I would

like elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, perhaps I may deal first with item 127, that is the Chief Minister's Office - that is a

new  office.  We  are creating,  in  effect,  a  new

department. A new Head of the Estimates will  appear

in next year's Estimates. There is no money voted so

far  for this particular service. We are creating  a

new vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the other items which were

mentioned,  we  are  merely  adding  a  post  to  an

existing  establishment,  and  we  have  found  from

experience that no matter how accurately we estimate

personal  emoluments  in any government,  there  are

invariably   savings  at  the  end  of   the   year.

Consequently,  when  we  create  a   post   in   any

department, we usually ask for a token vote  because

we  know  that there will be savings available  from

the money already voted to pay the salaries. That is

the explanation. Have I made myself clear?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> On a point of information, Sir.

Under   item  127,  are  we  to  assume  that  these

appointments to the Hon. the Chief Minister's office

staff  have  already been made  and  that  they  are

receiving salaries?  If so, how is it that this  was

done  ahead  of  the sanction of this House,  unless

there  is some vote on account. I am not questioning

the right of my hon. Friend to have an office staff,

but I would like just to know what the procedure is.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I think that some of the incumbents of

these  posts  are not yet known. They have  not  yet

been  appointed.  Those  officers  who  are  already

officiating in the Chief Minister's office are  held

against their existing posts and are on loan for the

time being to the Chief Minister's office.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Under item 127 there appears a

post  of Press Liaison Officer  ($690-30A-930/  Bar/

960-35A-1,240).   Sir, I understand  that  there  is

such  a thing called the Public Relations Department

with  a very efficient, supposedly efficient, Public

Relations   Officer.  May  we   please   know   more

specifically  the  duties  of  this  Press   Liaison

Officer?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I am delighted, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  to receive such a bouquet from the Member  for

Tanjong Pagar for the Public Relations Officer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Orchids!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> The Press Liaison Officer,

Sir, that I require for my office - I find that I wish

to be kept in constant touch with the opinion of the

Chinese  Press and people and, through  the  Chinese

Press,  the  Chinese-reading public to  be  kept  in

constant  touch with our views. The Public Relations

Officer has discharged that duty very efficiently so

far,  but I should like to intensify that aspect  of

the  work,  and  it is my idea to  have  an  officer

permanently attached to me for full-time service  in

that  direction, an officer who has experience  with

the Chinese Press of the Colony.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  am very glad that the Member for Tanglin has just

told  us  that  we are here to watch jealously  that

public  funds are properly spent. From items 131  to

229, these figures or these estimates come under the

headings  of  Revotes,  and I  take  it  that  these

figures were voted by the former Legislative Council

where the Progressives were in majority.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> They only had six seats.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I refer now to item 154 under

Head D5 Governor - "Alterations to Government House",

where  a  figure of $200,390 is supposed to  be  for

alterations to Government House. We are  here  today

to endorse the figure that was voted by the previous

Council,  and I am really alarmed that  such  a  big

figure for alterations of the building is now to  be

considered. I presume that this figure could build a

big  palace; I wonder if it is not too much  or  too

low.  The Hon. the Financial Secretary has just said

that he is pleased to answer any queries that arise,

and  to  give us details, and I am quite  sure  that

Members of this House will be very glad if the  Hon.

the Financial Secretary will tell us the details  of

how this figure is arrived at.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> This work has been completed. The sum

was  voted  in connection with the creation  of  the

chamber  for  the  Council  of  Ministers,  for  the

creation of the offices for the Clerk to the Council

of  Ministers and for his staff, and for alterations

necessitated in another part of Government House  by

the  fact  that the Governor and his  staff  had  to

vacate their premises to make way for the Council of

Ministers.  The  total sum voted was $220,300.  Only

$19,000  was  spent last year because the  work  was

only  put  in hand towards the end of the year,  and

all  the  money was spent before the new  Government

came into being.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> The Council of Ministers are now

<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, may I know why that item has been

shown under development estimate?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Which item?



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> That same item - Head D5, item 154.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, the answer to my hon. Friend the

Member  for  Seletar's question is that it  was  the

practice  last  year to put the majority  of  public

works non-recurrent expenditure in connection with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



capital  projects  and  building  projects  in   the

development estimates, and this supplement was voted

under   the   particular  Head  in  the  development

estimates for Government House.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I take items 132 and 133 as examples of any items under the Head

"Revotes"  which require some explanation  from  our

hon. Friend? I have searched, I hope diligently,  in

the  Estimates  for  those items  132  and  133  and

expected them as having been voted for in 1954,  but

I  cannot  find them. How can we be asked to  revote

what  appears  not to have been voted in  the  first

place?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The answer to that question, of course,

is that the money was not voted in the Estimates. It

was  voted  as a supplementary provision during  the

course of the year. As I said previously, the  money

which  Government has to spend is made up  of  money

which appears in the Estimates and is covered by the

Supply  Bill, and of money which is voted after  the

passing of the Estimates in the form of applications

for  supplementary provision. These two  cases  were

applications for supplementary provision.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I then take

it,  when  such a Paper as the request for money  is

brought  to the House again, that all these apparent

obscurities will be made clear by providing  greater

detail as the Hon. the Financial Secretary mentioned

earlier?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> As I have said earlier, Sir, I

appreciate that this is not an adequate presentation

of  the revotes under present circumstances, and  in

the  future  I  will set it out in columns,  showing

what  has been voted in the Estimates, what has been

spent,  what remains unvoted, what has been  revoted

and  what  is required in the form of an  unforeseen

revote.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, on a point of elucidation.

Do  we understand that from henceforth, in September

every year, there will be a revote asking for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



expenditure which is not expected to be incurred  in

that particular year, but that a further revote will

only  be  asked  for  on  unexpected  increases   or

unexpected delays in expenditure? I understand -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, Mr Lee. I think you are

confusing  the motion. Let us stick to  the  motion,

shall  we?  That is a point which I  think  Mr  Ede

might  probably raise on his substantive motion.  It

is a matter of procedure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> But, Mr Speaker, Sir, with

great  respect,  I was seeking clarification  of  an

explanation  that  the Hon. the Financial  Secretary

gave  of  how he proposed to give this House  better

control   and  better  understanding  of  what   was

happening  in  the case of revotes,  which  in  this

particular case total about two-thirds of the amount

involved in this -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not strictly within the terms

of the motion, Mr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> If I may, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, certainly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I will give an explanation now and

settle the matter once and for all, if I may?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think we are just wasting time on

the  whole matter. There are criticisms, and I quite

agree  they  are  very  grave  criticisms,  on   the

procedure which is extant in our Standing Orders.  I

think the Standing Orders need a lot of revision  as

far  as financial procedure is concerned, but we are

now  concerned with a motion which asks the Assembly

to  resolve that a certain sum of money be  supplied

to  the  Government under the heads  of  expenditure

appearing in this Command Paper. What is to be  done

in  the future, I think, is not within the terms  of

the motion. What we should deal with now is what  is

before the House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I draw

the Hon. the Financial Secretary's attention to item

No.     222 -     "Accommodation    for    Ministers'

Offices - $278,140".  It seems to  me  to  be  a  very

princely  sum,  and  I hope the Ministers  are  well

accommodated.  [Interruption.]  I  would  like  some

explanation for this amount spent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> This money, Sir, was provided for the

creation  of  the  accommodation  required  by   the

Ministers  and their staffs, not just the  Ministers

alone;  and, in certain cases, it did necessitate  a

certain reconstruction, particularly in the Ministry

building  at Palmer Road to accommodate the Minister

for Health and the Minister for Education.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one final

question. The motion before us reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly resolves that the sum of

$17,320,223 should be supplied to the Government ..."



<br><br>Yet  on page 9 of the Paper concerned, you will read

that  the  total amount to be voted is  $17,324,748.

The  discrepancy is due to a sum of $4,525 which  it

is  desired to delete. Surely any sums voted in  the 1955 Estimates  should not be  deleted  during  the

course  of the year, but should lapse at the end  of

the  year and become the subject of scrutiny by  the

Public Accounts Committee in due course. Should  not

the gross sum be voted and not the net sum?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, in making this application, I only

seek the actual amount of money which is required. I

do  not want to ask for more money than is required,

and  the net sum required here is that shown at  the

bottom of page 9 - $17,320,223.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> On a point of information, Sir. I

still do not understand why these items amounting to

$4,525  have been deleted. They have been estimated.

So why do they not remain in the Estimates?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> These are not deletions, Sir. They are

estimated   savings  which  have   been   shown   in

expenditure. I cannot give you the details because I

came unprepared for that particular problem.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, am I to understand that this is

the only item of saving so far during the course  of

this financial year?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I cannot recall what appeared in

previous messages. I have not got copies here, but I

think  you will find similar deletions if you  refer

back  to  the  messages which  have  been  presented

before, not only in the life of this Assembly but in

the  life of the Legislative Council before  it  was

prorogued. As I say, I regret that I cannot give you

the   actual  details  of  this,  because   I   came

unprepared,  but perhaps if you will see  me  in  my

office,  I  shall  be  delighted  to  give  you  the

information.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I come

back  to  item  113  under Head 13,  Customs  Secret

Service?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, you can speak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> I think, if a reward has been

given,  we  have received something  in  kind.  What

happens to those things? [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> If goods such as opium and other

contraband  are  seized, they are sold  through  the

Crown  Agents  and  the  proceeds  are  credited  to

revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of

<div align="center"><b>REGISTRATION OF DEEDS (AMENDMENT) RULES, 1955</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. J. Davies -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. J. Davies:</b> Sir, in the unavoidable absence

of  the  Minister  for Local Government,  Lands  and

Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat), I beg to

move the motion standing in his name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with subsection

(2)  of  section  30  of the Registration  of  Deeds

Ordinance   (Chapter   121),   resolves   that   the

Registration of Deeds (Amendment) Rules, 1955,  made

by  the  Minister  for Local Government,  Lands  and

Housing  on the 28th day of May. 1955, and published as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



Notification No. S 157 in the Gazette Supplement No.

42  of  3rd  June, 1955, as contained  in  Sessional

Paper No. S.L. 15 of 1955, be approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, it is a declared policy

of  this Government to afford every encouragement to

persons  in  the low income group to own  their  own

houses, and the Minister has been exploring ways and

means  to  achieve  this  purpose.  One  ready   and

available  method  by which this  purpose  might  be

achieved  is to facilitate the sale and purchase  of

flat  units  which  could be made available  to  the

public  at  prices  substantially lower  than  those

asked  for  houses  and bungalows.  As  Members  are

aware, flat units may be sold and disposed of in the

same  manner as other interests in land, but  it  is

difficult   for   the   purchasers   to   obtain   a

satisfactory  title by reason of the  provisions  of

the  Registration of Deeds Ordinance. Section  5  of

that Ordinance provides that no deeds affecting land

shall be admissible in court as evidence of title to

any  land unless and until they have been registered

as   directed  by  the  Ordinance;  and  under   the

provisions of section 15 of that Ordinance, no  deed

may be registered unless the land affected by it has

been surveyed and demarcated to the satisfaction  of

the Surveyor-General.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to flats, however, which entail a sub-division of a piece of land in horizontal strata one

above   the   other,  survey  and   demarcation   of

boundaries  is  difficult, if not impossible.  There

is,   however,  provision  for  exemption   in   the

Ordinance, and there is contained in Rule 13 of  the

Registration  of  Deeds  Rules.  1934,  whereby  the

Registrar of Deeds is permitted to dispense with the

compliance  of certain provisions of the  Ordinance.

Paragraph  2  of  that Rule allows the  registration

without   the  necessity  for  survey   and   proper

demarcation of boundaries of leases for a period  of

21  years, or less in certain cases. This provision,

Sir,   enables   flats  to  be  registered   without

difficulty, but the leasehold title thereby acquired

is limited to 21 years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment, which is the subject of this

motion, enables the leasehold title of an indefinite

duration  to  be  secured for flat units,  and  will

facilitate  and, it is hoped, greatly encourage  the

building of flats for sale and for their purchase by

members of the public within the low income group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion is one which I venture to think will

have  the  full  support  of  very  Member  in  this

Assembly. I therefore beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, I second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with subsection

(2)  of  section  30  of the Registration  of  Deeds

Ordinance   (Chapter   121),   resolves   that   the

Registration of Deeds (Amendment) Rules, 1955,  made

by  the Minister for Local Government, Lands and  Housing  on the 28th day of May, 1955, and published

as  Notification No. S 157 in the Gazette Supplement

Speaker,  Sir,  this is the sixth  sitting  of  this

Assembly, although just two months have passed since

we  first  met. During that period many of  us  have

learned  to  respect the excellent  Standing  Orders

which    control   our   proceedings.   There    is,

nevertheless,  room,  I would respectfully  suggest,

for  improvement,  for  amendment  of  the  Standing

Orders,  and perhaps for reviewing some of  them.  I

should like, and I give it as a personal opinion, to

see  the  hours  of  sitting changed  from  sittings

during  the  day to sittings at night,  which  would

enable  members  of  the public  who  normally  work

during  the day to follow our proceedings  by  being

present in the Strangers' Gallery; and, perhaps,  it

would also assist the Ministers to give more time to

their  very pressing duties. In these circumstances,

though I feel a little apologetic to the Member  for

Serangoon  (Mr Lim Choon Mong), who himself  has  a

motion down for amendment of two Standing Orders,  I

would suggest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>



that it is not a matter for piecemeal reference, but

rather  for a comprehensive review, so that  in  the

new  session at least, we will have Standing  Orders

which,  in  the  light of our experience,  are  more

nearly adequate to our requirements. Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Standing Orders Committee do consider and

report  on amendments to the Standing Orders of  the

Legislative  Assembly which the Committee  may  deem

necessary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I second the motion.

deem necessary.

received. As it now seems certain that it  will  not

be   necessary  for  this  House  to  adjourn   till

you,  Sir, to move the suspension of Standing Orders

<div align="center"><b>(Pay and schemes of service)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b> asked the Chief Secretary whether he will consider a review of the salaries and schemes of service in operation for personnel of the Royal Malayan Navy, with a view to eliminating the present disparity in salaries and schemes of service as between the personnel of the Royal Malayan Navy and the Singapore Police Force.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. A. Williams -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. A. Williams:</b> No. The rates of pay for the Royal Malayan Navy were revised in 1952 and were fixed to correspond very closely to the rates for equivalent ranks in the Malay Regiment and in local units of the Imperial Forces. The powers, duties, responsibilities, and general conditions of service of personnel of the Royal Malayan Navy differ so widely from those of the members of the Singapore Police Force that it is not considered possible accurately to compare the salaries and conditions of service of the two Forces.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. A. Williams -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. A. Williams:</b> Although ratings are permitted to return to their homes when not on duty, they are all, whether married or not, accommodated in ships or in barracks while on duty. The question of Housing Allowance does not therefore appear to arise.

<div align="center"><b>(Personnel welfare)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b> asked the Chief Secretary whether he is aware that dissatisfaction exists among Malayan Royal Navy personnel; and whether he will (i) approve the establishment of a civilian advisory board to assist the relevant authorities with a view to reviewing the Royal Malayan Navy regulations dealing with personnel, welfare and conditions of service; and (ii) consider the employment of a capable professional interpreter not only to interpret in cases of personnel charged with offences, but also to convey to the relevant authorities any complaints or representations the personnel might wish to make, in the interest of better relations between personnel and their superior officers.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. A. Williams -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. A. Williams:</b> The Honourable Member has not indicated the nature of the dissatisfaction he has in mind. On the specific points raised, the answer is that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) officers and men of the Royal Malayan Navy, unlike members of Volunteer and Cadet Forces,

are subject to the Naval Discipline Act, and general regulations governing their discipline, organization and administration must conform with that Act.  It would be contrary to established

practice to consider setting up a civilian advisory board for any regular force;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the Royal Malayan Navy has a Malay Welfare Officer whose services are always available to

assist ratings. A Malay Regulating Petty Officer or other senior rating normally acts as

interpreter in all cases involving charges or requests. The question of need for an interpreter

will, however, be kept under review.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. A. Williams -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. A. Williams:</b> It is intended to seek provision in the 1956 Estimates to arrange for canteen premises. It is hoped that if this is approved, the local N.A.A.F.I. authorities will be prepared to consider providing N.A.A.F.I. facilities for the Royal Malayan Navy similar to those provided for the other Armed Services In the meantime, Royal Malayan Navy personnel are permitted to use the N.A.A.F.I. canteen in the H.M.S. Terror.

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b> asked the Chief Secretary whether he will consider the provision of transport for personnel of the Royal Malayan Navy to and from their places of duty.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. A. Williams -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. A. Williams:</b> Unless the existing Royal Malayan Navy transport fleet is considerably expanded, at heavy cost, it will not be possible to provide transport for Royal Malayan Navy ratings for all recreational purposes off duty. They do at present receive bus tickets for such purposes at half price, the remainder of the cost being paid by Government.

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b> asked the Chief Secretary whether consideration can be given to the granting of loans to the personnel of the Royal Malayan Navy for the purpose of building their own private houses.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. A. Williams -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. A. Williams:</b> Loans are not granted to personnel of the Imperial Forces to enable them to build their own private houses, and are only granted to Government servants who have not less than 5 years service on the permanent establishment; the normal period of repayment of the loan is 15 years. Royal Malayan Navy ratings enter the Force either on a special service engagement to serve for 7 years in the Royal Malayan Navy and 5 years in the Royal Malayan Naval Reserve, or else on a continuous service engagement for 12 years, followed by reserve service. A rating performing special service may, if he wishes and is considered suitable, transfer to continuous service, but in no case does any rating enter for more than 12 years service in the first instance, although at the end of that period he may re-engage for a further period of 10 years, after which he is eligible to retire on pension. It is not, therefore, considered possible to furnish loans sufficiently large to facilitate the building of houses and at the same time to recover these within the limited period of a rating's engagement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of providing accommodation, within the Royal Malayan Navy area, suitable for the families of ratings is under active consideration.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. A. Williams -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. A. Williams:</b> Government is not at present prepared to spend public money on the operation of a television service, in view of the heavy financial commitments required on social services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government is prepared to consider any proposition put forward regarding the establishment of a television service by private enterprise.

<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> Concrete benches are provided for the use of customers inside all five toddy shops now being operated in the Colony, but these are inadequate for the large number of customers attending during peak periods.
