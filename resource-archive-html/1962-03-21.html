<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on

Amendment  [19th  March, 1962]  to  Question  [16th

March, 1962],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House views with grave concern the

mounting  of  industrial unrest and  calls  on  the

Government to take all reasonable steps  to  ensure

industrial  peace with justice in the interests  of

the   economic   well-being  of   the   people   of

Singapore.".-(Tun Lim Yew Hock).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Amendment was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To leave out from "unrest" to the end and

insert:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"by pro-Communist political agitators for

political ends and calls on the Government to  take

all  reasonable  steps to ensure  industrial  peace

with   justice  in  the  interests  of   industrial

expansion  so  vital to the economic well-being  of

the  people  of  Singapore and to  prevent  genuine

industrial  grievances  from  being  exploited  for

Communist  ends".'-(The Parliamentary Secretary  to

the Minister for Labour, Mr Wee Toon Boon).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the words proposed

to be left out, be left out."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday before the

moment  of interruption at midnight, I was  dealing

with  some  of  the charges which  the  Member  for

Thomson  had  made against the Government.  One  of

these  charges  concerns what he  contended  to  be

unwarranted  police  action  against  employees  of

certain  commercial firms. I would refer the  House

to  a report of what he said in this connection  in

the Straits Times of this morning. Mr Speaker, Mr

Bani  is  reported  as saying that  these  acts  of

violence  have  been  defended  by  the  Government

Ministers as reasonable. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We do not consider police action against pickets

reasonable.  Unwarranted  use  of  the  police   on

helpless workers cannot be termed reasonable by any

stretch  of the imagination. Soon after losing  the

support  of the workers, the Government  adopted  a

ferocious anti-workers' attitude.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, he instanced police  action  in

connection with disputes like those of Sassoon, the

Glass  Factory, the General Electric  Company,  the

City  Council, Robinson's, Shaw's and Guthrie's.  I

mentioned some of the facts concerning the  Sassoon

dispute.  I  informed  the  House  that   in   that

particular  case, there was very bad blood  between

the  employer and an employee who was the Secretary

of  the  Branch  of  the Business Houses  Employees

Union in that firm. The employer threatened to sack

this   employee.  The  feelings  of  the  men  were

aroused.  They  came to the Ministry.  Mr  Dominic

Puthucheary represented them. I knew feelings  were

very  high.  I  remained in the  office  late  that

evening. He gave me and the Parliamentary Secretary

to  the Minister for Labour (Mr Wee Toon Boon)  an

assurance  that  the men would go  home  peacefully

that  night and that nothing would happen.  I  told

him  that if there were any doubts in the matter  I

would  have  the Labour Inspectors posted  on  duty

that  night. He said, "Do not worry. They will  all

go  home." And I told the House that when I was  at

Crawford  that same evening, I received a telephone

call  from  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to   the

Minister for Culture appealing to me to go down  to

the Central Police Station to see what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>



had  happened  as  there was a  clash  between  the

police  and the strikers of that firm. I  told  the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture

that  I refused to do so because I had been assured

that  the men would go home peacefully that  night.

Then   Mr   Woodhull  took  the  phone  from   the

Parliamentary  Secretary  to,  the   Minister   for

Culture and phoned me. He made a personal appeal to

me.  He  said, "Would you come down? If you do,  it

would  buck the morale of the men up, and you could

lead   a  demonstration  against  the  police."   I

positively  refused  to  do  so.  Next  morning,  I

received  a police report of what happened.  I  was

informed  by the police that the strikers  remained

in  the  office that night and the employer had  to

seek  the  assistance of the police  to  have  them

ejected. The police used reasonable force to  eject

them. Some went out of their own accord. A few  had

to  be carried away. I checked on the police report

and   found  that  some  of  the  men  had  a   few

contusions. Where was the police violence  in  this

particular dispute?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson also

mentioned the case of the Glass Factory. I told the

House  that when that dispute occurred,  I  brought

with me to the site Mr Fong Swee Suan, Mr Dominic

Puthucheary, Mr Kandasamy, Mr Woodhull,  and  Mr

Bani. I also asked Mr Lim Ching Siong to accompany

us.  He  said  he had another important appointment

that  morning and could not go with us to the scene

of the strike. When we arrived there, we found that

the  main  entrance to the factory  was  obstructed

with  benches. Mr Woodhull would do nothing  about

it.  I appealed to Mr Fong Swee Suan. He spoke  to

the  workers  and got them to remove  the  benches.

That  was a protracted dispute. It lasted for  very

many  days. In the course of that dispute, some  of

the workers got very restive. They wanted to return

to  work.  The majority of them were Malays.  There

were  also  Chinese and Indians amongst them.  They

came  to  see  me at my office and  asked  for  the

protection  of the Ministry to enable  them  to  go

back   to  work.  In  order  that  we  would   play

completely  fair  with  the union,  I  asked  these

workers  if  they would register their names  on  a

register



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>



that  was  opened in the Ministry. They  said  they

would  agree to do so. They came into the Ministry.

They  recorded their names, their addresses,  their

identity   card  numbers,  their  employment   card

numbers, and signed a declaration that they  wished

to  go back to work of their own accord. There were

about  40  to 50 of them. I sent for the leader  of

the  Branch  Committee of that Union together  with

some  of  the  officers  of  the  T.U.C.  In  their

presence,  the men lined up in my office  and  they

all  stated both to the Branch Committee and to the

representatives  of  the T.U.C. that  they  wanted

police protection to go back to work; and on  that,

I  arranged that labour officers should go  to  the

scene  of  the  strike and that  police  protection

should  be  given  to these workers.  There  was  a

general  melee  when  they returned  to  work.  The

police  protected them. Some of them were assaulted

at  the  time  when  they tried  to  get  into  the

factory. Feelings were very tense at that time,  so

that  the men who returned to work had to  live  in

for  many days. They did not dare to come  out.  In

the  course  of that dispute, there were complaints

made  that the management was taking out industrial

property so that it could set up operations outside

of Henderson Road. Every complaint made was checked

in  the  presence of the union officials.  Most  of

those   complaints  were  found  to  be  completely

untrue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, is it resorting to violence for

the Government to get the police to give protection

to  workers  who want to go back to work?  In  that

particular strike, both Mr Woodhull and  Mr  Fong

Swee  Suan realised that the main instigator behind

it  was  the  Branch Secretary of that Union.  They

both  took steps to get that man moved out of  that

position  in  that Union. Where were  the  acts  of

violence in the case of the Glass Factory strike?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson referred

to the G.E.C. strike. That strike arose because the

management proposed that if the workers wished  for

increases in pay, as they could not afford to  give

increases to all, some of the workers would have to

be retrenched. They would not have it at all. We in

the Ministry tried to resolve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>



that  dispute.  We  had  many  meetings  with   the

management and the employees. We were assured  that

the  employees  would not take strike  action.  But

eventually  they  did take strike action.  In  that

dispute   also,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,   there   were

complaints  that the management were removing  some

of  their property, some of their electric  motors,

to outside shops to get work done during the period

of  the strike in order to break that strike.  That

was  untrue. The workers even searched  members  of

the  management and we had to discourage them  from

doing  so.  In  that case some of the workers  also

wanted  to  return to work. There  was  an  act  of

violence  committed,  but it  was  not  an  act  of

violence  against the workers by  the  police.  One

worker  was charged for an act of violence  against

another  worker under section 4 (d)  of  the  Trade

Disputes Ordinance. On 17th November, 1960, he  was

prosecuted  in the police court and fined  $20  for

assault. Where were the police acts of violence  in

that dispute?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Thomson referred to the

Robinson   strike.   He  said  that   Mr   Dominic

Puthucheary was there at 8 o'clock in the  morning.

He  went  there at 10 o'clock. Everybody  was  well

behaved.  He  said the police acted violently.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the Minister for Culture  has  drawn

the   attention  of  the  House  to  pictures  that

appeared  in  the Straits Tunes in connection  with

the   attitude  of  the  workers  in  that  strike.

Everybody  appeared to be very  happy.  Nobody  was

assaulted. As far as I personally was concerned,  I

was  at that time in the Ministry of Health  and  I

remember that the Commissioner for Labour called on

me  at  about  8.30 on the morning of the  Robinson

strike  and reported to me that the employees  were

out  on  strike. He said he had posted  his  labour

officers on duty, and the latest reports were  that

they  were behaving themselves. I was very  pleased

to  know  that. I had that morning  to  go  to  the

Ministry  of  Finance to cover the  duties  of  the

Minister  for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee)  when  he

was  away.  Between 11.30 and 12  that  morning,  I

received  a telephone message from Mr A. T.  Rajah.

He informed me that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>



men   were  blocking  the  main  entrance  of   the

building, and he asked whether it would be in order

for  him  to take police action to clear  the  main

entrance.  I  replied that it was  his  duty  as  a

police officer to keep the main entrance open.  But

if  the  strikers were sitting around on the  five-foot way, they should be left alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in connection with this strike, this is

what  the Member for Thomson said in the  House yesterday.

I  refer again to  the  report  of  the speech

in the Straits Times this morning:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Bani then described how the Police had moved in against

the  Robinson  strikers,  although  no reports  had

been  made  against  obstruction   by officials or any

other persons.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr A. T. Rajah is a Government

officer. He was the senior police officer  on  duty

there. He had made a reference to me. He wanted  to

know  whether it was in order for him to clear  the

main  entrance as it was being obstructed.  Surely,

if the Member for Thomson had checked on his facts,

he could not have made such a statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there was nothing to show that

the police had anything to do with the Ministry  of

Labour  when the other strikes occurred -  the  City

Council  strike, the Shaw strike, and  the  Guthrie

strike. I have no doubt that other Members on  this

side of the House will be covering those strikes in

the course of their speeches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another charge that the Member for Thomson made

was  that  Government  was partisan.  Even  in  the

matter of secret ballots where certain unions which

were friendly to Government were concerned, even if

they lost out on the ballot they were allowed to go

out on strike. The Member mentioned a strike of the

Manual  and Mercantile Workers' Union at  a  rubber

mill.  Mr Speaker, Sir, things like this do happen

when  workers in any particular organisation belong

to  different unions and when the numbers are about

even. If a ballot is taken where two unions contend

for  recognition, it can happen that  the  minority

feel so strongly about it that they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



continue to strike even if they lose in the ballot,

But our duty as a Government is to get them to call

off the strike, which we did.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on this question of secret ballots, Sir. Who

are  the people who make the charges against us?  I

refer  the  House to an ultimatum that appeared  in

the  Straits Times of Tuesday, 28th February, 1961:



<br><br><div align="center">`UNION WARNING TO THREE FIRMS</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Business Houses Employees' Union

this  evening  [that was Monday,  the  day  before]

served  a  seven-day ultimatum on three  big  firms

demanding  recognition of its branches.  The  firms

are:  Firestone  Tyre  & Rubber  Co.,  the  Federal

Dispensary and the agency house of Muller &  Phipps

(Far East)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the union, all three firms have

refused to recognise branches set up between them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ultimatum was issued after an hour-long

protest meeting of members of the three branches in

the union's premises at Towner Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting passed a resolution which protested

against  the withholding of the right of the  union

to  represent  employees, condemned the  denial  of

employers  to  recognise the right  of  workers  to

organise   themselves,  deplored   the   anti-union

preparations   of   the   employers    and    their

intimidatory   tactics  and  demanded   recognition

within a week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement, issued by the union after the

meeting,  claimed that the employers have  directly

and  indirectly intimidated workers wins a view  to

dissuading  them  from supporting the  union  while

negotiations on recognition were in progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It added: "The union has been patient for the

last six months. Recognition is fundamental as this

union  represents most of the workers  employed  in

these firms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been patient long enough. The firms

concerned  represent American and British  business

interests. They live in a dream land and  adamantly

refuse to see reality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, any employer who refuses to recognise a

union  in  Singapore must be out of his  mind.  The

whole  purpose  and  operation  of  the  Industrial

Relations   Ordinance  is  to  regulate   relations

between   employers  and  employees  and  encourage

industrial peace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are of the opinion that the managements of

these  firms are ganging up together to fight  this

union.  We are prepared to fight them if they  want

to."'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this warning is described as an

ultimatum.  When I saw that in the papers.  I  sent

for the Executive Committee of the Business Houses



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



Union.  I  advised  them that  even  if  they  felt

strongly  about this, they should not  take  strike

action.  So  I proposed to them that we should,  in

all  fairness, hold a secret ballot with regard  to

their  claims for recognition in these three firms.

There  was a lot of argument. They who issued  this

ultimatum  were  afraid to  face  up  to  a  secret

ballot.  But  eventually,  I  decided  that  secret

ballots would be held. Secret ballots were held and

I  agreed with the unions that before I took  these

secret ballots, I would speak personally to all the

employees of these three firms and tell them of the

Government's  attitude  towards  the  unions,  that

Government  thought  it  very  necessary  that  all

workers should be organised in trade unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I duly attended a meeting in the Ministry on the

14th  of  March,  1961,  in the  evening  when  the

employees of Muller & Phipps were asked to come  to

the  Ministry to find out if they were prepared  to

participate  in this secret ballot. We checked  the

list  of the employees of Muller & Phipps and found

that  those eligible to vote numbered 64. Of  those

who  voted  in  this  secret  ballot  after  I  had

addressed them, 17 voted in favour of the Singapore

Business Houses Employees' Union and 41 against.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 15th of March, 1961, in the Ministry also,

a  secret ballot was held amongst the employees  of

the   Federal   Dispensary  Ltd.  We  checked   the

employees'  list  of that firm and  there  were  88

eligible  to  vote. In the secret ballot  that  was

held, 34 declared that they wished to be members of

the  Business Houses Employees' Union and  49  were

not in favour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, on the 23rd of March, 1961, we held a

third  secret ballot for the employees of Firestone

&  Co. We checked the employees' list of that  firm

and found that there were 106 eligible to vote.  In

the secret ballot, 94 said that they were in favour

of  being members of the Singapore Business  Houses

Employees' Union and five were against.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ballots were opened in the Ministry on 27th

of  March,  1961,  and the results  were  declared.

Following  on that, the Business Houses  Employees'

Union,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



although it had lost in the ballots at the  Federal

Dispensary Ltd, and Muller & Phipps, demanded  that

they should be recognised with regard to those  who

voted  in  their favour. I refused this request.  I

said  to  them,  "You  have  in  the  past  accused

employers  of forming yellow unions. Here  you  are

yourself proposing that unions who lose in  ballots

should still be recognised. Is that not a new  form

of yellow union organisation?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have also referred to what

the   Member  for  Thomson  has  said   about   the

difficulty he experienced in getting scales of  pay

for  the commercial workers who were members of the

Business Houses Employees' Union. I mentioned that,

as  a  result of representations received from  the

T.U.C.,  50  amendments were  introduced  into  the

Industrial  Relations Ordinance. I  also  mentioned

that before people like Mr Bani, Mr Woodhull  and

Mr  Kum Siew Yee got interested in the affairs  of

the  Business Houses Employees' Union,  that  union

had come to see me and had asked me to do something

to  enable them to get redundancy terms, retirement

benefits,   proper  scales  of  salary  and   bonus

payments.  They  showed me a draft agreement  which

they  had  proposed to the Federation of  Employers

for consideration and which had been turned down. I

chaired various meetings between them, but we could

make  no headway. As a result of that, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  entered  this particular  clause  in  the

Industrial Relations Ordinance. I refer Members  to

section 38 of the Ordinance which provides that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In making an award in relation to a trade

dispute the Court -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall not be restricted to the specific relief

claimed  by the parties or to the demands  made  by

the  parties in the course of the trade dispute but

may  include in the award any matter or thing which

it thinks expedient for the purpose of settling the

trade   dispute  or  of  preventing  further  trade

disputes   and  may  in  fixing  wages,   salaries,

allowances or other remuneration give effect to its

decision   by  prescribing  time  rates,  piecework

rates,  salary  scales, bonus  payments,  severance

pay,  or  retirement allowances or  by  such  other

prescription as it considers appropriate;'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we introduced a number of

amendments to the original Bill. I dealt  with  one

of  those amendments -  the first provision that there

should   be   automatic  reference  of   deadlocked

disputes to the Court. We recognise that the unions

should,  in  certain circumstances in a  democratic

society,  be  allowed to withdraw  their  services.

That  is  why  we made an amendment to  the  clause

dealing  with automatic references of  disputes  to

the Arbitration Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all the clauses of this Bill

were   agreed   to   between  the  Government   and

representatives  of  the  T.U.C. except  for   two

paragraphs  of  one  clause. These  are  the  penal

clauses  for  contempts of  the  authority  of  the

court. The T.U.C. asked us not to incorporate  this

particular  provision in the  Bill  which  provided

that  where a person failed to comply with an order

of  the  court,  the Court could place  the  person

guilty  of contempt under a restriction from  trade

union  activities for a period of two years and  if

the   provision  was  breached,  then  the   person

concerned could be brought before a District  Court

and punished for the offence. They said that it was

derogatory of the whole of the trade union movement

for   such  a  provision  to  be  entered  in   the

Ordinance.  But, nevertheless, we were  firm  about

those two paragraphs of this Bill. As for the other

paragraphs,  they  were  completely  and   entirely

agreed  to - clause by clause - with the  members  of

the T.U.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson was aware of the

provisions of this Bill. be  discussed them all with

us.  I  was very surprised to hear him say that  he

respected  the  wishes of the  employers  in  these

matters. The employers he said had stated that  the

conditions  of  work in the commercial  firms  were

unlike the banks and the insurance companies.  They

could  not give the white-collar workers scales  of

pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I mentioned in this House how Mr Woodhull got

himself  interested in the affairs of the  Business

Houses  Employees Union. He came to see me on  many

occasions, telling me that he knew that  agents  of

employers were planted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>



in  that union posing as advisers to the union, and

he  thought that they should be moved out. He  told

me  that  he  was  making plans to get  a  suitable

person into that union. I mentioned yesterday  that

I  was  invited to a Christmas "do" by this  union.

When  I went there, there was a dance on and I  was

surprised  to  see Mr Kum Siew Yee there.  I  have

known him - I mentioned it in the House yesterday - for

many  years.  I  have known that he was  under  the

influence  of  Mr Devan Nair who had indoctrinated

him  to be a Communist. So I was very surprised  to

find  out  that the man Mr Woodhull had  put  into

this  union was none other than Mr Kum  Siew  Yee.

Lest I be mistaken about these matters - in fairness

to Mr Kum Siew Yee - the moment I heard about that,

I naturally checked up with Mr Devan Nair, "Do you

know that Mr Kum Siew Yee is now interested in the

affairs of this union?" He said, "Yes. Mr Kum Siew

Yee  came  to see me." Mr Kum Siew Yee  said  that

when  the  approach was made that he  should  enter

this  union, he asked Mr Devan Nair for his  views

as to whether he was doing the right thing by going

into  this  union. Mr Devan Nair told me  that  he

told Mr Kum Siew Yee, "It would be better for  you

to  stay  in the teaching profession and work  with

the  Teachers Union." Mr Kum Siew Yee said to  Mr

Devan   Nair,   "I  respect  what  you   say,   but

nevertheless  I  feel that because  of  ideological

differences, it is very essential that I should  go

and work in that union." He resigned his post as  a

teacher and joined this union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw that things were hotting up the moment

these changes were made. An issue on the scales  of

wages  immediately arose. That was in the New Year.

The  employers,  out  of the  generosity  of  their

hearts,  were giving increments to their employees.

Now at that time, the practice was for employers to

grant  rises in pay and increments to some  of  the

employees  and  deny them to others.  There  was  a

tense  position  in  three  firms - Nestles  Products

Ltd., the East Asiatic Company and United Engineers

Limited. Mr Dominic Puthucheary came to see me. He

said that the employers were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>



treating  the unions very unfairly. The  union  was

actually  negotiating  with  the  employers  for  a

salary  scale. This was refused. Nevertheless,  the

employers  still  paid  merit  increments  to  some

employees and denied them to others. So I sent  for

Mr   Woodhull.  But  before  that,   Mr   Dominic

Puthucheary said that he must teach the employers a

lesson by having a demonstration. So I said,  "Yes.

I  am  all with you." He said that they would  book

the  Victoria Memorial Hall, meet there and have  a

demonstration  and  say that these  employers  were

unfair  and  unjust. He promised me that  he  would

take  no strike action. I heard later that the  men

went on strike at Nestles Products Limited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I sent for Mr Woodhull. I discussed the

position  with him and he confirmed that  they  had

been  negotiating for wage scales  in  these  three

firms. So I said to Mr Woodhull, "I will back  you

to  the  full.  Will you demand that the  employers

enter a clause into these agreements that they will

provide  a  salary scale for the workers  in  these

three  firms,  and  that they  will  not  pay  them

anything  in  addition to what is provided  for  in

those  salary scales? If they are tough.  I  assure

you that if they refuse to do that, that issue will

be  put  to the Industrial Arbitration Court."  Mr

Speaker, Sir, he promised me many times he would do

so.  I  rang him many times about this. He promised

me  that  he would speak to the union and get  that

clause  entered into the draft agreement. I had  to

wait  for  two or three months. Later on,  I  heard

that  on the quiet he went and concluded agreements

with  the employers for increases of $10 last  year

and $15 the following year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely this is a case in which the Government was

doing its best to help the white-collar worker  and

offered  to invoke a provision in the Ordinance  to

help the worker. The Member for Thomson knows about

it.  We  were prepared to help them. But  what  did

they  do? They made agreements on the sly with  the

employers.  Mr Speaker, Sir, they have  registered

these agreements. I accuse them of selling out  the

white-collar workers. The workers have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>



demanding  all along for wage scales and retirement

benefits. They have been asking for bonus payments.

They have been asking for severance pay. Where  are

all these demands in these agreements?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, surely it is very unfair for

the  Member for Thomson, with a knowledge of  these

facts, to accuse the Government of being anti  this

particular union



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stated in this Assembly that the P.A.P.

Government  disliked  the white-collar  workers  so

much  that  it  was prepared to use  force  against

English-educated  clerks and  salesgirls.  Is  that

true?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson, in drawing the attention

of  the House to a statement which appeared in  the

Straits  Tunes  that the Minister  for  Labour  had

dissolved  the T.U.C., said that they knew  nothing

about  it;  there  was not even a  meeting  of  the

Council; these were Fascist methods of closing down

unions,  and so on. Mr Speaker, Sir,  let  me  now

draw the attention of the House to the Trade Unions

Bill  which had its First Reading in this House  on

the  6th of April, 1960, and its Second Reading  on

the  13th of May, 1960. The Member for Thomson  has

charged  that we introduced the original Industrial

Relations  Bill without any consultation whatsoever

with the T.U.C. That is correct. But in the case of

the  Trade  Unions  Bill,  there  was  the  fullest

consultation  between the Ministry and  the  T.U.C.

before this Bill was introduced. Now we as a  Party

have proclaimed our belief in the need for unifying

the   trade   union  movement.  We   have   brought

legislation  into  this  House  to  do  away   with

splinter  unions  and yellow  unions.  We  got  the

approval  of  the  House and we have  taken  action

against  splinter unions and yellow unions and  put

them out of business. Mr Speaker, Sir, at the time

that this Bill was under discussion, the members of

the T.U.C. knew of our intention to and assisted us

in setting up different categories of trade unions;

in  fact,  the 19 categories that are scheduled  in

the First Schedule to this Bill were prepared



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>



by  the  members  of  the  T.U.C. themselves.  Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   this  Bill   provided   for   the

categorisation  of trade unions  on  the  basis  of

similarity  of employment. All trade  unions  which

were  registered would have to be in one  of  these

categories. It also provided that no union could be

registered   unless  it  was   affiliated   to   an

association  of  trade unions  exempted  under  the

provisions of this Ordinance. Clause 59 of the Bill

dealt  with the exemption from registration of  the

association  of  trade unions i.e, the  T.U.C. and

provided that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Minister may, on the application of any

association  of trade unions and after  examination

and  approval of the rules of such association  and

after making such inquiries as he deems fit, exempt

such association of trade unions from any or all of

the provisions of this Ordinance.'



<br><br>The  intention there was to recognise  the  T.U.C.

as an association of unions and exempt it from this

Bill  under  the  provisions of  section  59.  This

section further provided that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`An association of trade unions which is exempted

by  the  Minister  under  subsection  (1)  of  this

section  shall  not  change its rules  without  the

written permission of the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any trade union or federation of trade unions may

by  resolution of its executive affiliate  with  an

association  of  trade unions exempted  under  this

section.'



<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, there are two other sections  of

the  Ordinance dealing with the registration  of  a

trade   union,   and   the  cancellation   of   the

registration   of  a  trade  union  which   deserve

attention. I refer the House to section 11  of  the

Ordinance which provides that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Registrar, if he is satisfied -

<div align="center"><h4>* * * *</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the trade union being an association or

combination  of  employees  is  affiliated  to   an

association  of  trade  unions  exempted   by   the

Minister under section 59 of this Ordinance;

<div align="center"><h4>* * * *</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall,... register the trade union in the

prescribed  manner and if he is  not  so  satisfied

shall .refuse the application.'



<br><br>So  that before any trade union, existing or to  be

constituted,  can be registered, it must  first  of

all  be  affiliated  to  the association  of  trade

unions exempted under the provisions of section 59.

And  to  section 14 of the Ordinance which provides

that:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The registration of a trade union may be cancelled

by the Registrar -

<div align="center"><h4>* * * *</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if he has evidence and is satisfied -

<div align="center"><h4>* * * *</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the trade union, being & an association or

combination   of  employees,  has  ceased   to   be

affiliated  to  an  association  of  trade   unions

exempted by the Minister under section 59  of  this

Ordinance;'.



<br><br>So  that before any trade union could come  on  the

register,  it would first have to seek  affiliation

and  get affiliation from the T.U.C., otherwise  it

is not registered. If after being registered it was

disaffiliated  by  the T.U.C.,  it  would  also  be

deregistered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the transitional provisions of

this  Ordinance provide that within one year  every

existing trade union would have to seek affiliation

to  the association of trade unions exempted  under

section 59 before it could continue to function.  I

will  read  this section, Mr Speaker. Sir,It  is

section 77 (2):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Within a period of one year from the date of the

coming  into  operation of this Ordinance  or  such

longer period as the Minister may in any particular

case   allow,   the  Registrar   may   cancel   the

registration of an existing union ...',



<br><br>and it provides for cancellation (1) in the case of

employers'  organisations of an existing  union  if

the  Registrar is satisfied in the case of a  trade

union of employers that it is not an association or

combination of employers in a trade, occupation  or

industry  or  in trades, occupations or  industries

which  are  in his opinion similar and (2)  in  the

case of a trade union of employees that it is  not

an  association or combination of employees  within

one  of  the  categories  specified  in  the  First

Schedule  to the Ordinance or is not affiliated  to

an  association  of trade unions  exempted  by  the

Minister under section 59 of the Ordinance. So  you

will   see,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  that   from   the

provisions   of  this  Ordinance  the  T.U.C. had

absolute  and entire control over the  whole  trade

union  movement. If any trade union failed  to  get

affiliation to the T.U.C., it would cease to exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these provisions were discussed

with the T.U.C. and they urged that they be enacted

into law.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now deal with the

registration of the three federations of unions. As

the  clauses  of  this Bill were under  discussion,

steps  were  taken  by certain unions  to  organise

themselves  into  federations for  the  purpose  of

bringing themselves within one of the 19 categories

in  the  Schedule to the Ordinance.  The  Singapore

Land Transport Workers Union was registered on  2nd

January, 1960. The unions which were affiliated  to

this  first federation were the Singapore  Traction

Company Employees Union, the Singapore Taxi Drivers

Union, and the Singapore Bus Workers Union. At  the

same time, a second group of unions took action  to

constitute   themselves  into  another  federation,

known   as  the  National  Federation  of  Building

Construction  and Woodworking Unions.  This  second

federation  was registered on 12th February,  1960.

The  affiliates of this second federation were  the

Singapore Woodworkers Union, the Singapore  Sawmill

Workers  Union,  the Singapore Brickmaking  Workers

Union,   the   National   Union   of   Building   &

Construction  Workers, and the Singapore  Union  of

Workers  of  Boat-building Industry.  At  the  same

time, yet a third group of unions were constituting

themselves into a federation. All this was done  to

bring  themselves within the 19 categories which  I

have  referred  to, and of which they  had  advance

notice.  This new third federation was  called  the

Singapore   Federation  of  Factory  and  Workshops

Employees  Union.  The unions  affiliated  to  this

federation are the following: the Singapore General

Employees  Union,  the Singapore  Rubber  Employees

Union,  the  Singapore Spinning Workers Union, the

Amalgamated  Malayan Pineapple Workers  Union,  the

Singapore   Shoe  Employees  Union,  the  Singapore

Tailors Union, the Singapore Rattan Workers  Union,

the    Singapore   Union   of   Brewery,    Bakery,

Confectionery.  Canning and Drinks  Workers  Union,

the  Singapore Motor Workshop Employees Union,  the

Singapore  Metal Manufacturing Workers  Union,  the

Singapore  Metal Box Workers Union,  the  Singapore

Machine & Engineering Employees Union; all to be in

the new third federation known as the Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



Federation of Factory & Workshops Employees  Union.

At  the  same  time also, one union which  had  its

membership restricted to lightermen, known  as  the

Singapore  Transport  Vessel  Workers  Association,

changed  its name to the Singapore Water  Transport

Employees  Union, and amended its rules  to  extend

its  membership to godown workers, carriers of rice

and  goods,  and employees of sailing  ships.  This

union  registered its change of name  and  its  new

rules on 11th May, 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are 19 categories

provided  for in the First Schedule, and  there  is

one  category, Category No. 5, which is  designated

"Land Transport Workers Unions." The first group of

unions  which  called  itself  the  Singapore  Land

Transport Workers Union formed a federation  within

that category. In the same way, there is a category

for  Construction  and  Building  Material  Workers

Unions,  Category No. 16 in the Schedule. Obviously

the federation known as the National Federation  of

Building Construction and Woodworking Workers Union

federated  to come within that category. There  was

also  a  category,  Category No.  15,  for  Factory

Workers Unions, and obviously the federation  known

as  the Singapore Federation of Factory & Workshops

Employees  Union was formed to bring itself  within

that  category. The change in name of the transport

workers union where it extended its membership from

lightermen to godown workers, carriers of rice  and

goods, and employees of sailing ships, was made  to

bring   itself  within  the  category   for   Water

Transport Workers Unions, Category No. 7.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the provisions of this Bill

were  debated in this House on 13th May, 1960, that

is,  when  the  Bill  had its Second  Reading.  The

Member  for  Thomson  spoke  in  that  debate  with

reference to this categorisation of unions. This is

what  he had to say: I refer Members of this  House

to  Hansard,  Vol. 12, No. 11, of 13th  May,  1960,

column 755, second paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government does not intend to usurp



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



the  right  of  the  unions to participate  in  the

unification  of the movement, and setting  out  the

categories in the Schedule is merely establishing a

basis for the unions to work on.'



<br><br>Mark  the  words  he  used, Mr  Speaker,  Sir - "the

Government  does not intend to usurp the  right  of

the unions to participate in the unification of the

movement". And he went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Without the provisions of the Bill and without

the  eradication of splinter and yellow unions,  if

we are to hope for the unification of the movement,

I  would say, speaking from my own experience, that

it  would take at least ten years for the  hope  to

materialise.  Therefore, in brief, what  this  Bill

seeks  to  do is to propel the development  of  the

trade union movement forward, and to encourage  the

unification of the movement. And I am certain  that

with  the  passing  of  this  Bill  and  with   the

implementation of its provisions, we  will  have  a

stronger, a healthier and a unified movement  in  a

very  short  time,  perhaps in about  a  couple  of

years' time.'



<br><br>Now,  they  were trying to beat the gun. They  were

forming these federations sometime before this Bill

had  its Second Reading, and bringing their  groups

of unions within the categories provided under this

Ordinance.  In this debate the Member  for  Thomson

also  referred  to  section 59 of  the  Bill  which

required every union to be affiliated to the T.U.C.

before  it could be registered, whether it  was  an

existing  union or a union to be set up in  future.

This is what he had to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Thirdly, on the question of compulsory

affiliation,  I would say this. Whether  compulsion

is  democratic  or not is futile to  ask.  What  is

important  is whether it is desirable.  Slogans  on

democratic  principles are beautiful but  they  are

meaningless   if  the  results  they  produce   are

undesirable.'



<br><br>That  is  from  the  Member for  Thomson,  who  has

accused  the  Government of being  Fascist  in  its

dealings with the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another interesting thing that happened was the

registration  of the new T.U.C. At  the  same  time

that  these  unions were grouping  themselves  into

these  federations in the knowledge that this  Bill

would  be  introduced in the Legislative  Assembly,

the organisations of trade unions were taking steps

to   regularise  their  position.  Before  the  new

organisation  was  formed,  there  was  a  lot   of

discussion between the leaders of this organisation

as to what sort of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



form this new organisation should take. The men  in

the  leadership decided that there should be a  new

form  of T.U.C., with an Executive Council, with  a

delegates  conference  and also  with  a  permanent

Secretariat.   The   permanent   Secretariate   was

established to do away with appointments which were

provided   for   under  the  rules  governing   the

governing  council  of the old  T.U.C. - appointments

like   the   General-Secretary,   three   Assistant

Secretaries  and  Treasurer. The  old  constitution

provided   for   those  officers.   So   this   new

organisation was to have a permanent Secretariat in

substitution. It was intended that the Secretary of

the  new  T.U.C. should be elected at  a  delegates

conference,  and  he  should  have  the  right   of

appointing  ten permanent Secretaries with  various

portfolios.  There  was  a  lot  of  jockeying  for

positions.  They had discussions with  me.  I  knew

that  they  were  not  a  united  group.  The   men

concerned  were then trying to seek  concord  while

maintaining differences. They were trying to  unite

while  struggling at the same time. There were  two

opposing forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I identify the members of this Secretariat as follows: In one grouping was Mr

Kandasamy,  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to   the

Minister  for Culture, Inche Buang bin Omar  Junid,

the  Parliamentary Secretary to  the  Minister  for

Health  and  Law - he was at that  time  Secretary-General   of   the   Singapore  General   Employees

Union - Mr  Ow Kheng Thor, who is in, the Government

service,  and Mr Devan Nair. That was  one  group.

The  other six consisted of Mr Woodhull, Mr  Fong

Swee  Suan,  Mr  Lim Ching Siong,  Mr  Bani  (the

Member  for  Thomson), Mr Dominic Puthucheary  and

Mr  Jamit Singh. There was a lot of jockeying  for

positions  at that time. The group which  was  with

Mr  Devan Nair were trying to get one more  member

on their side and they were discussing as to who of

these ten should be left out. At one point of time,

it  was  suggested  that  Mr  Dominic  Puthucheary

should  be  left out, and another man  substituted.

They  could not reach an agreement. Mr  Lim  Ching

Siong said that if Mr Devan Nair's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>



group  insisted that Mr Dominic Puthucheary should

be  left out, then he would have nothing more to do

with  all this. So eventually under pressure, this

group  was  formed  and they  agreed  to  form  the

permanent  Secretariat. Then they had to regularise

the   whole  position.  Meetings  had  to  be  held

immediately after that to give it a facade that all

this   was  done  constitutionally.  So  a  General

Council  of  the  general delegates conference  was

called.  All members were present there.  They  had

this  mock  election.  The  Executive  Council  was

formed.   The  permanent  Secretariat  system   was

introduced. "Elections" were held. These ten became

the permanent Secretariat. The delegates conference

had  no  control  whatsoever  over  them  and  this

mockery of a T.U.C. organisation was formed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is to comply with section

59  of  the  Ordinance where there was a  provision

that associations of unions should be exempted from

the  provisions of the Trade Union Ordinance.  They

duly  went  with this constitution to the Registrar

and  the  Registrar told them that  he  would  have

nothing to do with it. He said that if they  wanted

to  register this constitution they would  have  to

register the office bearers. He told them  that  as

far  as  he was concerned, the rules governing  the

Council   of  the  old  T.U.C. under  the   T.U.C.

Ordinance still remained in force, and that if they

had  to  register  such an association,  then  they

would  have to disclose who the President was, who

the   three  Vice-Presidents  were,  the   General-Secretary, the three Assistant-Secretaries and  the

Treasurer. All that they could disclose under  this

arrangement  was  the President,  Mr  Mahmood  bin

Awang,  the P.A.P. candidate for Anson;  the  three

Vice-Presidents,  Mr Tan Teck  Wah,  who  was  the

President of the Singapore General Employees Union,

the Second Vice-President, Mr J. A. Kurup, who was

from  the Naval Base Labour Union, the third  Vice-President,  Mr  Ang Chin Chye,  and  the  General

Secretary,   Mr   Kandasamy,   the   Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Minister for Culture. They  could

not satisfy the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>



Registrar   that  at  the  general  meeting   three

Assistant  Secretaries and  a  Treasurer  had  been

elected,   and   he   refused  to   register   this

organisation.  Mr  Speaker, Sir,  the  Member  for

Thomson  referred  to  these  arrangements  in  the

debate  on  the Second Reading of the Trade  Unions

Bill. This is what he had to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Constitution of the T.U.C. has been amended

and  the  organisation is being geared to meet  the

new  situation. The future, as I envisage it,  will

create a democratic centralisation of the movement.

But  there are all sorts of wild talk in town. Wild

talk  about the so-called 10 Tall Men. But this  is

far  too  stupid to demand attention and to require

clarification.  But what I wish  to  point  out  is

this.  In  the  final  analysis,  it  is  not   the

Secretary-General or the Secretariat of the  T.U.C.

which will decide, but the workers themselves.  The

political pace in Singapore is set and dictated  by

the   working   class.  Governments   may   change,

personalities  may fade, but the grim  reminder  of

reality  is  the temper of the working class  which

will  be  the  deciding factor,  and  history  will

continue to be made.'



<br><br>We  all  heard  him  say that in  this  House.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  that  is  not  the  language  of  a

democrat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned earlier on that this Bill passed its

Second Reading on 13th May, and on the 23rd of May,

ten  days later, the Government was advised of  the

great  security risks that it would  take  if  this

Bill  was  assented to. It would  have  placed  the

whole of the trade union movement under the control

of  known undemocratic forces. On the 23rd of  May,

on the instructions of the Cabinet, I issued orders

deregistering the Singapore Land Transport  Workers

Union,  the  Singapore Federation  of  Factory  and

Workshops  Employees Union, the National Federation

of  Building  Construction and Woodworking  Workers

Union,  and also required that the Singapore  Water

Transport Employees Union should assume its  former

name  and  revert back to its former  rules.  There

were  protest meetings immediately after  that  was

done. I advised the leaders of these unions not  to

do that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had further meetings with them to see what we

could  do  to remove from this Bill sections  which

were considered to be objectionable and a danger



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>



from the security point of view. I proposed to  the

T.U.C. - the  Ten Tall Men - that clause  77  of  the

Bill  should  be amended. That is the clause  which

provides  that all existing unions must within  one

year  seek affiliation to the new T.U.C. before  it

can  continue to exist. I suggested that we  remove

that  clause,  and that we introduce a  new  clause

providing  for the dissolution of all  general  and

miscellaneous unions before any action is taken  to

categorise  the unions under the First Schedule  of

this  Ordinance. There was considerable  opposition

from  the  Singapore General Employees Union.  They

said  that it was not possible for them to do  that

within one year, because they had so many contracts

with  the employers, and if it was known that  they

were  to deregister, the employers concerned  would

act tough with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were also asked to consider an amendment to

clause  59  of  the Bill, the clause which  exempts

associations of unions from the provisions of  this

Ordinance,   to   provide  that  where   this   new

organisation   known   as   the   T.U.C. refuses

affiliation  to  any particular union,  that  union

would  have  a right to appeal to the  Minister.  I

held  many  meetings  with  them,  asking  them  to

consider  these  amendments.  They  rejected  them.

After these meetings, they promised that they would

reply, but they did nothing about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, for picketing rules. Mr Speaker Sir, I

think  the  Member for Thomson said that  when  the

Government was not anti-worker, the Government used

to  be  very  considerate, the Government  used  to

require that policemen should be at least 50  yards

away  from any place where there was a strike.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I know of no such arrangements.  All

that  we  have  done  is to insist  that  during  a

strike,  an employer should not engage new  labour.

We  have  held firmly to that. I have also insisted

that the men on strike have a right to picket.  The

right  of picketing does not mean that the  men  on

strike  should only be allowed to stand around  the

gates  of the firms or factories on strike,  whilst

the  employer  brings  in new  workers  in  lorries

through the gates. There was a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>



lot of trouble about picketing and we tried to come

to  some arrangement with the T.U.C. about  it  and

with   the  organisations  of  employers.  I   held

countless  meetings with Mr Woodhull. I  told  him

that it would be necessary for us to put this on  a

proper business-like footing. If necessary, we were

prepared  to amend the Trade Disputes Ordinance  to

give  the  Government the power to  make  picketing

rules.  He discussed this matter with me and  said,

"We  will take it back to the T.U.C." Then he said,

"Wait  awhile. It is necessary on such a matter  to

consult  all  the unions affiliated to the  T.U.C."

The  10  Tall  Men could not take a decision  among

themselves. The decision would have to be taken  by

all  the  unions  affiliated to the  new  T.U.C.  I

waited  for him. Nothing happened. I sent  for  him

and  he  said,  "We have agreed. At least  we  have

taken   a  decision.  Do  not  let  Government   do

anything, but we will come out with a statement and

we  will  see  that the new rules are enforced."  I

sent  him  a  draft proposal for his consideration,

but as usual, Mr Speaker, Sir, nothing was done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson also referred to the Army

Civil  Service Union. Mr Woodhull came to  see  me

about  this  union. He was dissatisfied  with  this

organisation. It had a loose federation. There  was

a  delegates'  conference and representatives  were

returned to this delegates' conference from various

areas  in  Singapore. The members in any particular

area  were  both the daily-rated and  the  monthly-rated  staff. The monthly-rated and the daily-rated

staff voted as one group to send representatives to

the   delegates'   conference.  He   wanted   these

arrangements  changed.  He  knew  that  as  far  as

numbers were concerned, the white-collar staff were

completely outnumbered by the daily-rated staff. He

wanted  new  arrangements to be made  whereby  they

would change the system of area representation  and

have  a  system of an election at a general meeting

of  all workers. They should not vote any more from

their  separate  areas,  but  they  should  hold  a

general meeting and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



return representatives from the general meeting  of

all  the  workers. Mr Speaker, Sir, I looked  into

the  constitution of this union, discussed it  with

the  leaders of the Army Civil Service  Union,  and

they  were  hostile to amending it. They said  this

organisation  had  been working satisfactorily  for

many years. They gave due regard to representations

from  the daily-rated group and they were satisfied

with  existing  arrangements.  In  this  case.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  accuse  Mr  Woodhull  of

deliberately meddling in this matter for subversive

reasons. He had no other reason for wanting to make

these changes than for the purpose of enabling  him

to  get  control of the daily-rated group  in  this

union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have refuted all the charges

that  were made by the Member for Thomson. Although

he  was  in  this House earlier on, he saw  fit  to

leave the Chamber when I was speaking. I would have

been  prepared at any time to give way  if  he  had

stayed  on  and  indicated that he  would  like  to

challenge any of the statements that I have made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We as the Government have made mistakes. There

is no doubt about it. But there is one mistake that

we   have   never   made.  We   have   never   been

unsympathetic to labour. We have done everything to

assist labour against unscrupulous employers. It is

galling  in the extreme to know that these  charges

are  made  by  our former associates who  have  now

thought  fit  not only to separate themselves  from

us,  but  to  make  false and baseless  allegations

against us as well.



<br><br>3.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

when  this  motion  was first brought  up  in  this

Assembly  by the Member for Cairnhill, he  knew  in

his  heart of hearts that it would make the  P.A.P.

and   the  Barisan  Sosialis  quarrel  about  trade

unionism.  This  has  now actually  happened.  Sir,

while  the Member for Cairnhill can blame the trade

unions  and the workers without losing anything  at

all - he has no or little influence at all over trade

unions - the P.A.P. Government cannot blame the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>



trade  unions  and  the  workers.  The  P.A.P. is

controlling  some unions, and if all  trade  unions

are  blamed then their own unions are also  blamed.

Sir,  the  P.A.P. speakers  have  said  this:  "Yes,

industrialists are scared by strikes. But they  are

misled  by the Communists in the unions."  So  what

they  are telling the people of Singapore  is  that

not all unions are bad; only some unions are bad -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Union leaders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> That some unions are not bad.

That the bad unions belong to the Barisan Sosialis -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Communist leaders belong to

the Barisan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> That the good unions belong to

the  P.A.P. This is a strange story. This  is  also

the  behaviour of the P.A.P. leaders. All the  good

things  belong  to  them. But all  the  bad  things

belong  to  others. This is what we mean by  P.A.P.

arrogance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what the P.A.P. Government wants the people

of  Singapore  to believe is that people  can  join

unions, but they must join the "good" unions.  They

must  join  P.A.P. unions, accept  P.A.P. men  as

advisers  and  leaders. Then even  if  they  go  on

strike, they are not doing the wrong thing. But  if

they  should  join  unions  not  belonging  to  the

P.A.P.,  whatever thing they do, even if  they  are

doing the right thing, they would still be blamed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am told that because of this thinking,

because of the belief that people in the non-P.A.P.

unions are no good, the police are asked to set  up

a  special unit to deal with strikes. This is  only

one aspect of the problem. P.A.P. and P.A.P. men  as

union people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect of the problem is, namely, the

P.A.P. as an employer. I am told that the  Harbour

Board workers are still having a hard time with the

employer, the P.A.P. or its agent, the Minister for

Education. Two and a half years have passed, but  I

do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



not  think that the Harbour Board workers  are  now

having a better life. The people can still remember

what  the  P.A.P, did to people in  the  Government

service when the pay was cut -



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> You supported

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> No negotiations and no respect

at  all  for  the trade unions. Now they  say  that

because  of  the so-called merger, the P.A.P. must

give back what they have taken away from the unions

and  the  civil servants. Sir, I do not think  that

even if the P.A.P. has now given back the pay cuts,

this is bad money. But as I say, the civil servants

have no reason to be thankful to the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. as an employer in the City

Council is not something I should pass judgment on.

The  City  Council workers should be the  judge.  I

must  say  that the strike that they  went  through

recently is a very strong judgment that the  P.A.P.

is  a  kind  employer that must be  dealt  with  in

strikes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot has been talked about industrialisation.

How  much  faith  has  the  P.A.P.  Government   in

industrialisation?  The  P.A.P. say   they   want

industrialisation  and yet  they  use  the  surplus

funds for investment outside Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everyone will remember that before the last

elections the people were told by the Minister  for

Finance  that all monies invested overseas must  be

got  back  for  investment  inside  Singapore.  The

recent  financial  statement  of  1960  shows  very

clearly that the amount of investment is double the

amount invested by the last Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the people of Singapore can see very clearly

that  in this debate the P.A.P. are not as good  as

they  claim, the P.A.P. unions are not as  good  as

they claim, and that the P.A.P. employer is not  as

good as they claim. Let me give you an example.  In

the  Wah  Hin Rubber Factory, there were two  rival

unions:  the Singapore General Employees Union  and

the Singapore Manual and Mercantile Workers Union



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>



to which Mr Devan Nair is an adviser. There was  a

strike  and  a secret ballot was taken. The  result

was  in  favour of the Singapore General  Employees

Union. And yet the P.A.P. Union to which Mr  Devan

Nair is an adviser called a strike in spite of  the

result of the ballot. Eventually 30 workers of that

P.A.P. union  were dismissed and  they  were  very

unhappy  about the handling by the P.A.P.-sponsored

union.  Sir,  this  is the behaviour  of  a  "good"

union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the duty of the Minister for Home Affairs

to  defend  the police. Let me point out here  that

the Minister is responsible for all the things that

the  police  do. Whether the police are  doing  the

right  thing or the wrong thing, he is responsible.

And so when the police are asked to do something to

the  unions, unionists or the strikers,  he  cannot

run away from the responsibility. No one is blaming

the  police.  But if they do the wrong  thing,  the

supreme command is to be blamed. The P.A.P. should

be  blamed for ordering the police to do the things

they want them to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this debate, we can say fairly that the

P.A.P. and the S.P.A. - the Prime Minister  and  the

Member for Cairnhill - have very much in common.  The

S.P.A. hate  the workers and blame the  Communists

for  the strikes of the workers. And the P.A.P.  are

now   doing  exactly  the  same  thing.  The   only

difference   is  that  while  the  Lim   Yew   Hock

Government   did   what  they  said,   the   P.A.P.

Government  are not prepared to do what  they  say.

Now,  the reason for the P.A.P. Government to  just

talk  but  to take no action is that they are  more

cunning. It is not because they are democrats. They

want  to  do  all the talking and let  the  foolish

people do all the dirty work, like the closing down

of  trade  unions,  arresting unionists,  banishing

them, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is quite clear that the amendment to this

motion by the P.A.P. Government is nothing new.  It

is  merely playing an old and tedious record  which

the colonial Government and the previous Government

were playing when they were about to topple. It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



simply a case of who is playing the gramophone. The

only  difference is that the P.A.P. Government  are

using  a  hi-fi  stereogram to make it  sound  more

realistic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> And

playing your record too. Mr Speaker, Sir, from the

two  principal  speeches made  by  the  Member  for

Cairnhill  and  the  Member  for  Thomson,  it   is

apparent  that  both  the S.P.A. and  the  Barisan

Sosialis   have  been  thrown  into  a   state   of

uncertainty and confusion as to the line  they  are

to take on our amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill was unable to deny the

fact  that  mounting industrial  unrest  only  took

place after the Communists openly fought the P.A.P.

over  the question of merger from about the end  of

July  last  year.  He  went  on  to  say  that  the

Government was seeking by this amendment  to  place

all  industrial  unrest as  being  caused  by  pro-Communist agitators for political ends. That is not

our contention. There is no country in the world - Communist  or  non-Communist - which does  not  have

friction   between   workers  and   management   in

industry.  The  only difference  is  that  in  non-Communist  countries the workers can  seek  redress

for  their grievances over conditions of  work  and

pay  through  collective action  in  bargaining  or

going  slow  or going on strike. But  in  Communist

countries,  any  worker  who  goes  on  strike  and

hampers  the  production of the  State  becomes  an

enemy  of  the  people  in the  definition  of  the

Communist  State, and punishments for an  enemy  of

the people are well known. But in spite of this, in

two  instances in recent history - in Poland  and  in

Hungary - barely five or six years ago,  the  workers

rose  up against the management and the State  when

living  and  working conditions became intolerable.

And  it  required extensive reforms  in  Poland  to

maintain the regime without naked force and terror;

it required the Russian Army in Hungary to brutally

quell  demonstrations  of  discontent  against  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There can be no doubt that industrial peace

requires  a  continuous and continuing  process  of

adjustments  between  workers and  management,  and

this is so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>



whether  the  management is private  enterprise  or

State industry. The old simple dogma that when  the

management is converted from private enterprise  to

State   enterprise,  contradictions   between   the

workers   and   the  State  and  the  workers   and

management  automatically disappear and  industrial

peace and happiness automatically follow, has  been

belied  by  the history of nationalised  industries

both  in  the Communist and non-Communist countries

in Europe and in Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point we make against the pro-Communist

agitators in the unions is that they have  not  the

slightest  intention  of  helping  to  resolve  the

differences  between  workers  and  management,  to

correct  and  remedy injustice, and to create  just

and stable industrial conditions to help industrial

development. On the contrary, what they wish is  to

aggravate  and exploit dissatisfaction to  heighten

bitterness and hatred to aid the cause of their own

Communist revolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there were industrial disputes before and in

1959.  There were industrial disputes in  1960,  in

the  days  when the Communists in the  unions  were

still superficially accepting the Government policy

of   industrial   peace  with  justice,   but   the

protracted and bitter disputes which by-passed  the

conciliation  and  arbitration  machinery  of   the

Labour  Ministry  and  the  Industrial  Arbitration

Court  was a feature which appeared only after  the

open break in July last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, Sir, I refer to the figures. In 1959,

about  2,000 workers were involved. 19,000 man-days

were  lost in 500 disputes of which 40 resulted  in

strikes. I rounded the figures in order to  present

them  more  easily and graphically. In  1960,  6,000

workers  were involved, 150,000 man-days were  lost

in  800  disputes  of  which only  45  resulted  in

strikes.  In  1961, 40,000 workers  were  involved,

400,000  man-days  were lost in 1,200  disputes  of

which  116  resulted in strikes. The figures  speak

for  themselves. In 1959, 500 disputes, 40 strikes.

In  1960, 800 disputes. 45 strikes. In 1961,  1,200

disputes, 116 strikes. Now even if we take out  the

strike  of  the  City Council from the  figures  of

1961, there are still 30,000 workers involved with

200,000



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>



man-days lost in 1,200 disputes of which 115  ended

in  strikes.  I suggest further to the  Member  for

Thomson  that the City Council strike, though  non-Communist  in  its origin, was encouraged  by  them

when they invited 14 of the City Council unions  to

their S.A.T.U. inaugural meeting and when they sent

out  delegations of pro-Communist leaders from  the

Communist-controlled unions to see the City Council

union  leaders  in order to heighten,  prolong  and

aggravate  the  situation.  Unfortunately  for  the

Communist, the City Council Union decided  that  it

was in their best interest not to have anything  to

do  with  the  Communists and  a  great  deal  more

bitterness was spared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill said that by moving the

amendment  the Government was trying to  shirk  its

responsibilities.  His  reason  is  not  that   the

amendment  is  untrue  but  that  having  made  the

amendment  he  says  that the Government  does  not

propose   to   take  strong  action   against   the

Communists  to  crush  their  organisation  as  his

Government did. He went on to say that it  was  the

sacred  duty of the Government to deal with  people

who  created mischief in order to prevent them from

damaging  the  security and economic  stability  of

Singapore.   Sir,  the  Government   accepts   full

responsibility  for  the  handling  of  the  labour

situation in Singapore. But we have refused and  we

will  continue to refuse to commit the  errors  and

blunders  made  by the last Government  in  dealing

with the political state of agitation in the unions

caused  by Communist cadres. They have to be  dealt

with and the situation contained and damage to  the

security   and  economic  stability  of   Singapore

prevented,  but  the time and the manner  in  which

they  are  to  be dealt with and the  circumstances

under  which  they  have  to  be  dealt  with  will

determine   whether  their  future   influence   is

diminished  or unaffected, and whether  trouble  is

lessened or increased. The simple method of  direct

action of 1965 by the then Government -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sixty-five?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> 1956, sorry. I am looking

forward to it. [Laughter] But I must assure Members

on the other side,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>



in case they think there is any significance in the

number  "65",  that there is really  none.  I  just

misread  the  figure on the script. I  myself  feel

that there is nothing more to this very interesting

story  that we are unveiling before the  people  of

Singapore.  It  is a very important  stage  in  the

history  of  Malaya, and it may take place  with  a

rapidity  which  may astound even  Members  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis, resigned though they may  be  to

the inevitability of many things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the point I want to make is that in 1956,

while   the  direct  action  produced  a  temporary

quiescent  state in the unions - and they are  borne

out  by the figures of strikes for 1957; there were

27 strikes and 115 disputes - it also created for the

Communists  and  their cadres  a  great  number  of

martyrs  in  the  trade union world,  and  did  not

materially reduce their influence. In our view, the

crude  method  and manner in which they  are  dealt

with the last time - and we just had confirmation  of

that  from the Member for Havelock who referred  to

the less crude manner of the present Government  as

cunning, I would suggest these are witch words, and

if  one wants to be fair, one says, "This is a much

more intelligent, sensible and, in the long run, an

effective   way  of  dealing  with  the   Communist

problem." - enable  the Communists  to  persuade  the

workers  into  believing that they  went  down  not

because they were Communists but because they  were

champions  of  the workers, active trade  unionists

working  for  the cause of the improvement  of  the

workers'  lives. That error must never be  repeated

again. When they go down at the proper time,  there

will  be  very  little doubt in the  minds  of  the

workers  as to why they, the Communists, have  gone

down  and  not  the non-Communists in  the  unions.

Meanwhile  the position must be held and  contained

by  countering and exposing their manoeuvres in the

unions and by showing, albeit somewhat painfully in

the  case of the Ford factory workers and the  Shaw

workers,   that   when  workers  allow   themselves

foolishly  to  be persuaded to embark  on  ventures

with Communist unions, they will find that they are

sacrificed for a cause which is not their own.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest to the Member for Cairnhill that this

is  a much more effective way to deal with them. We

must first expose their political machinations and,

second,  compete  with  them  on  the  ground.  His

alternative of just smacking down the Communists in

the  unions  without his being able to expose  them

and   to  convince  the  workers  that  they   were

Communists, and worse, without competing  with  the

Communists   for  support  of  the   workers,   was

ineffective   in   dealing   with   the   long-term

situation. Sir, it is true that this competition at

ground  level  between the Communist and  the  non-Communist  groups in the trade unions has  in  some

cases led to more industrial aggressiveness leading

to  more industrial unrest. But it is an inevitable

phase  of  exposing  Communist machinations  whilst

convincing  the  workers that their best  interests

lie in not allowing the Communists to exploit their

unions.  When finally they are dealt with, it  will

be  clear  that it was: because they had  not  been

working in the interests of the workers but of  the

M.C.P.   And  the  best  judge  of  how  cold   and

unfavourable  the  ground  position  is   are   the

Communists  themselves  in  the  unions.  Never  in

history  have they faced; a more cold  and  a  more

unresponsive situation, for the simple reason  that

the   stock   tactics   of  whipping   up   hatred,

discontent,   and  unrest  against   a   repressive

reactionary Government using brutal methods through

the police to suppress workers are just not present

in this situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line taken by the Member for Thomson is

equally   uncertain   and   confused.   His   first

contention  is that there is no mounting industrial

unrest. He says that the facts and figures which  I

have, produced are lies, but if they are true, then

he  says that if there is any industrial unrest  he

will set out to show that most of it was caused  by

P.A.P. unions.  And if this was not  a  sufficient

cause  for  the  increase in unrest,  then  it  was

because    the   workers   had   suddenly    become

discontented.   Sir,  this  is  a  different   line

altogether  from  that  taken  by  the  Member  for

Queenstown on behalf of the Party leadership on the

first  day  of the debate before the amendment.  He

admitted that there was mounting industrial  unrest

to  fit in with the amendment made by their friend,

the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>



Anson,  who  wanted  to note  signs  of  industrial

discontent. But the Member for Thomson explains  by

saying  that the P.A.P. has suddenly changed itself

and  its  policy after July last year, and now  the

workers    have   become   anti-P.A.P. and    are

discontented   with  the  Government;   hence   the

increase    in    manifestations   of    industrial

discontent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have explained on the facts and

figures, even if we exclude the City Council strike

from  the 1961 total, may I repeat, for the benefit

of  the  Member for Thomson, that there were 30,000

workmen involved with 200,000 man-hours lost  as  a

result  of  1,200 disputes. 115 ending in  strikes,

compared  with  the 1960 figure of  6,000  workers,

150,000  man-hours lost, 800 disputes, 45  strikes.

He  was  the Joint Secretary of S.A.T.U. with  Mr

Rajendra.  I  do not know whether Mr  Rajendra  is

still a Joint Secretary, because he is a bit silent

these  days.  He  invited the City  Council  Labour

Unions  Federation, 14 of them, two  months  before

the strike, to a meeting.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> All the trade unions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, including these 14, to

egg them on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Including the S.T.C., the banks, A.U.P.E.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> To egg and encourage them on

to  take  industrial action against the Government.

After they did so, Mr Rajendra personally and  Mr

Dominic   Puthucheary  and  a  group   of   Chinese

Communist  trade  unions in the  Singapore  General

Employees  Union and in the Woodworkers Union  went

to  the City Council Unions Federation to encourage

prolongation and intensification of the strike.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> May I explain, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I think the Prime Minister is

definitely  getting  his facts wrong.  Mr  Dominic

Puthucheary,  to  the best of my  knowledge,  never

went to the premises of this Union. It is true that

a   delegation  from  a  few  unions  went  to  see

officials of the Public Daily-Rated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



Employees   Unions  Federation.  This  followed   a

circular  sent  by  the  Secretary-General  of  the

Public  Daily-Rated Employees Unions Federation  to

all  trade unions in Singapore, including  the  so-called non-Communist trade unions asking for  moral

help. I am sure the Prime Minister will agree  with

me that it is a proper and reasonable thing for any

trade  union,  be  it a so-called  Communist  trade

union  or a non-Communist trade union, to  try  and

find  out  in what way it could help another  trade

union  which has its members on strike. I  am  sure

the  Prime Minister, in his own experience as legal

adviser  to  over 40 unions, would  have  advocated

this to the union that it was entitled.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am glad the Member for

Thomson said that they went there in order to  give

moral and financial support. The circular asked for

moral  and financial support. And I know  that  not

one cent was given by this group of Communist trade

unions  to  the  City  Council  Public  Daily-Rated

Employees  Unions  Federation. All  they  suggested

were sympathy strikes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Nonsense! You prove that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I have already stated what

transpired  between Mr Rajendra, who was  then  on

the  premises  of the Public Daily-Rated  Employees

Unions  Federation,  and Mr  Dominic  Puthucheary,

then  on  the  premises  of the  Singapore  General

Employees Union. If need be, if this became a point

at issue. I can indicate the occasions on which the

Member  for  Thomson himself, prior to the  strike,

went there: and so on. [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He will be given ample time.

What I want to say quite simply is this: they asked

for  moral and' financial support. They did not get

one cent. What they got were suggestions of further

intensification  of  the  struggle.  I  know   this

because  I  met the union leaders. And very  wisely

they said, "No, we are going to have nothing to  do

with  this." That was the reason why a  great  deal

more  bitterness was avoided. It is  as  simple  as

that. [Interruption] That,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  shows  how  sometimes  blatantly  crude   the

Communists are when they are out on a rampage. They

are so crude that in the end, instead of exploiting

the  unions  against the Government, they  get  the

unions  around  to  thank the  Government.  We  are

grateful  to  them  for their stupidity.  Often  we

profit from it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, now that all their efforts did not

altogether    succeed,    they    disclaimed    all

responsibility  of ever having done anything  about

the  strike  of  the  City  Council  Labour  Unions

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was also interested to know that in his 2�-hour speech, not as long as the Member for

Queenstown's marathon one, the Member  for  Thomson

never attempted to deny, as in fact he cannot, that

the  Communist  unions in the  S.A.T.U. group  had

consistently bypassed conciliation and  arbitration

machinery in the Labour Ministry for some time  and

had  nothing  to do with the Labour Ministry  since

the  break  in  July last year. Of the  25  strikes

called  by  the Singapore Business Houses Employees

Union -



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Prime Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I did point out that yesterday the

Minister  for Health and Law did make an inaccurate

statement in saying that 24 strikes were called  by

the  Singapore Business Houses Employees Union. The

records  show  that ever since the Business  Houses

Employees Union was formed in 1954 up to date there

have been only 19 strikes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is a simple matter which

can  be checked. In fact, I have the details of the

strikes   here,   and  my  information   from   the

Commissioner for Labour, in his latest minute to me -



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Give exact figures.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, that is a matter of

opinion,  but  I am satisfied that the Commissioner

for  Labour  has  applied himself to  the  task  of

getting the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>



data  correct.  He has enumerated that  of  the  25

strikes  called  by the Singapore  Business  Houses

Employees  Union in 1961, only one was referred  to

the  Labour  Department before  strike  action  was

taken.  But whether it was 19 or 25, only  one  was

referred   to   the  Labour  Department   for   any

conciliation before strike action was  taken.  What

is the intention?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Before strike action was taken.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. What is the intention?

Sir, he has said that quite a number of strikes  in

1961  were brought about by P.A.P. unions, the Bank

Employees Union, the Insurance Companies Union, and

the  Mercantile Workers Union. Sir, let me get  the

facts  correct.  There were  a  number  of  strikes

called  by non-Communist unions, and the fact  that

P.A.P. members (maybe leaders) advise  this  union

does  not make them P.A.P. unions. But let me  give

him  the  figures.  Seventy-two  per  cent  of  the

strikes  called  in  1961 were  by  the  Communist-controlled groups in S.A.T.U., and 28 per  cent  by

non-Communist unions. In none of the strikes called

by  the non-Communist unions was there any violence

such   as  the  burning  of  fellow  workers   with

cigarette  butts  or the beating up  of  management

officials.  In almost every one of these  disputes,

the  conciliation machinery of the Labour  Ministry

was first used before a strike was called.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Thomson has not denied that

only  two - he cannot deny this - of the strikes called

`by  the S.A.T.U. group of pro-Communist unions had

their cases sent to the Arbitration Court, and that

was  two  out of 69 strikes. In the case  of  these

two,  they  were  directed by the Minister  to  the

Arbitration  Court,  and by  his  silence  on  this

point,  he  in fact admitted, in the face  of  the

facts, that they had by-passed the conciliation and

arbitration machinery set up by the Government, and

that  in  fact  the Communist unions  had  not  the

slightest   intention  of  using  conciliation   or

arbitration  except when they were  already  in  a

lost position. What



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>



they wanted was direct action, a collision with the

management,  strike with the police  and  with  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Thomson has explained why

Communist unions have not asked for salary  scales.

He  said that he shared the views of the employers'

representative. Mr Rattray, -



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I never said that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Well, he seemed to agree. He

appeared  to  agree with the views of Mr  Rattray,

the  employers' representative, that salary  scales

were  not suitable and rather than share the  views

of the workers -



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Is it in order for the Prime Minister - I

just  want  to get clarification from  you,  Sir - to

misquote me or to make a statement giving  a  wrong

picture of what I said yesterday?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Impressions always vary. The Prime

Minister might have had a different impression from

that of another Member of this Assembly. But if the

hon.  Member  for  Thomson says that  he  has  been

misunderstood  in a major portion  of  his  speech,

there  is  a  provision under our Standing  Orders,

which  is  Standing Order 43, paragraph (4),  which

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A member who has spoken to a question may again

be  heard  to offer an explanation of some material

part  of  his  speech which has been misunderstood;

but he shall not introduce any new matter.'



<br><br>So that is the remedy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Obviously the Member for

Thomson  finds  it embarrassing to agree  with  Mr

Rattray  today when it is pointed out to  him.  But

there  was  a general affinity of views,  shall  we

say, that there should not be salary scales because

it was unsuitable for these industries, rather than

share the views of the workers' representatives who

have pressed for salary scales. I suggest that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>



they, the S.A.T.U. boys - not the Member for Thomson,

but bigger boys behind him and bigger boys behind

the bigger boys -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What about the girls!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> So the girls too! They know

that  scales  would  be  an  effective  method   of

bringing   about  a  longer  term   of   industrial

stability. Mr Lim Ching Siong told Mr Devan Nair,

"Do  not  fight for salary scales. They  are  bad."

That cannot be denied. It has not been denied. From

the  point of view of the Communists, salary scales

make  the  workers contented. What  they  want  are

sporadic  and  periodic increases as  a  result  of

periodic strikes - industrial strikes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no place in Asia where there is more

advanced legislation designed to produce industrial

peace  with  justice  to the  workers.  Instead  of

giving this legislative machinery an opportunity to

prove  its  worth as the non-Communist  unions  are

doing,  the  Communist  unions  have  avoided  this

conciliation and arbitration machinery, and instead

have  spread  malicious  rumours  and  smears  that

justice  cannot  be  obtained  through  the  Labour

Ministry or the Arbitration Court, but can only  be

obtained by what they call "direct action".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one denies that there is industrial friction,

sometimes  leading  to unrest,  everywhere  in  the

world  where there are large numbers of  industrial

workers  whose  interests do not  sometimes  accord

with   those   of  the  management,   whether   the

management  is  by  private  enterprise  or   State

enterprise.  As  I have said, this  discord  exists

whether  the  State  enterprise is  a  nationalised

industry  in  a  non-Communist  country  or  in   a

Communist  country. The question  is,  do  we  find

channels  of  settlement  which  are  fair  to  the

workers  and  sound to the economy as  a  whole  by

producing   conditions  of  stability  leading   to

industrial   expansion,  instead  of  just   simple

exploitation  and aggravation of the situation  for

the   purpose   of  overthrowing  the   system   of

government?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has spoken in medical

terms about the conciliation machinery and all  our

other  efforts as merely treating the symptoms  and

not  the disease. Sir, I would like to quote to him

a  pronouncement  made by a Communist  against  the

Russian  imperialist regime when the Communist  was

arrested  and  banished from  Russia.  Herzen,  the

Russian,   said,   "They   [meaning   the   Russian

Imperialists]  are not the doctors.  They  are  the

disease." I think this statement is most  apt  when

we   look  at  the  pro-Communist  Barisan  in  the

S.A.T.U. group of unions, in the Country  People's

Association and in the Rural Dwellers' Association.

They are not the doctors. They are the disease. And

I suggest that the disease will soon be effectively

and efficaciously treated by the natural course  of

political  developments. Sir, it cannot be  treated

in  Singapore  isolated from  the  Federation.  The

remedy  lies  not  only  in pan-Malayan  unity  and

strength for political reasons, but more important,

for  economic  reasons  to  provide  the  base  for

industrial  expansion  on  which  alone   can   the

solution  to our economic problems of unemployment,

housing and a better life for the people be  found.

The Member for Thomson has every reason to know how

the  Government has handled Communist  problems  in

the   unions.  They  are  now  confronted  with   a

situation  which, in the simple and direct  methods

of  the  former Government, they did  not  have  to

face.  Before, the position was simple  and  clear-cut.   As   he   has  been  describing - alas   quite

inaccurately -   a   reactionary   and    heartless

Government using brutal police methods to crush the

just struggle of the workers for a better life. And

so  what happened was that all those who were dealt

with,  including those who went to prison  for  two

and  a  half years, found it worthwhile  to  go  to

prison as martyrs for the working class. This time,

the position is radically different. There is going

to  be a lot of sorrow for the Communists and their

stooges.  But  there are going to  be  no  martyrs.

There will be no suppression of the working class.

There will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>



no  injustice  and  there  will  be  no  resentment

against   the   reactionary  regime   because   the

Government   is  by  its  very  nature   far   from

reactionary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when their activities in furtherance of the

M.C.P. are curbed in the interests of the workers,

on  the contrary the interests of the workers  will

be advanced. This is the sad prospect for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Thomson has recounted how I

saw  Mr Dominic Puthucheary about a go-slow and  a

threatened strike of some workers in Hume Industry.

In  1960 I was informed by the Minister for Finance

that  Hume  was under a contract to supply  several

million  dollars worth of pipes to  a  neighbouring

Government, and would have to pay heavy  penalties,

under a penalty clause, if they did not supply  the

pipes  in  time. Hume claimed that they were  being

blackmailed  by the union who knew of this  penalty

clause  by staging a go-slow. I called Mr  Dominic

Puthucheary and asked him whether it was wise to do

this when it was the policy of the Government, then

accepted   by   the  trade  unions,   to   maintain

industrial  stability  and to encourage  industrial

expansion.  I  told  him that  Hume  had  told  the

Minister  for  Finance that whatever happened  now

regarding this dispute, they were abandoning  their

plans  for  an  expansion of their  factory.  As  a

result of my seeing Mr Dominic Puthucheary, the go-slow  was  called off, and a quick  settlement  was

achieved.  Those were the days before he threw  his

lot in with the Communists in the General Employees

Union.  Now,  of  course,  what  he  wants  is  not

industrial   stability   to  encourage   industrial

expansion.   What  he  wants  are  more  industrial

strikes leading to more bitterness, leading to less

industrial expansion, leading to more unemployment,

leading to more bitterness and finally leading to a

revolution. Sir, I do not think that is  likely  to

be  the  course  of events in Malaya and  Malaysia.

Those  who  try synthetically to create  industrial

strife,  instability, unemployment and  unhappiness

may  find  that only they themselves are personally

involved in a great deal of unhappiness.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown, when he spoke on the

first  day, may not have known what he talked about

when  he  claimed that the industrial workers  were

solidly   behind  the  Communists  in  the  Barisan

unions.  The  Member  for Thomson  knows  the  full

position quite well. I think I can just list him  a

few of the industrial workers where the writ of the

S.A.T.U. group does not run. The Printing workers,

the  oil  workers, the Harbour Board  workers,  the

Public  Daily-Rated  workers; Army,  Navy  and  Air

Force  -  40,000  industrial workers.  Surely  the

Member  for Thomson will remember also  that  in  a

recent  re-election in the S.T.C. Employees  Union,

both  he and Devan Nair were absent. Mr Devan Nair

was  unanimously re-elected as adviser and  he  was

quietly dropped from the union. These are facts. He

is no longer associated with the union. Is he going

to  suggest that the S.T.C. Employees Union is  not

an industrial workers union because it does not toe

the  Communist  line of S.A.T.U.? Is  he  going  to

suggest  that  the S.T.C. Employees Union  has  not

been  working  for the benefit of the  workers  and

that  it  is a stooge union? Is he going to suggest

that  since he dropped out of the union just a  few

weeks  ago, the union has changed in its  character

and  has  become unfit to be called  an  industrial

workers  union? He has also referred to the  white-collar workers in the Business Houses group joining

the  ranks of S.A.T.U. Sir, can he deny that  there

have  been ten branches that have left the Business

Houses  Employees  Union to join the  non-Communist

group in the Manual and Mercantile Workers Union?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I do not know how many have joined.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Can he deny -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> How many have joined from the

other  side?  None.  That is a  fact.  No  branches

defected  the other way. Is he aware of  the  grave

unhappiness of the workers when they were corralled

into buses recently to attend a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>



rally  and  they found on the buses  slogans  which

said,  "We  will fight every inch  of  the  way  to

Changi Gaol"? Sir, I did not quite believe it.  Mr

Dominic Puthucheary is a flamboyant person, a minor

version and a much lesser version of the big J.  J.

Puthucheary.  He is a great man who strikes  poses.

He will fight every inch to Changi Gaol if only for

the  sake  of  fighting,  to  prove  something   to

himself, that he is more than just the sickly  weak

chap  the people wickedly think he is. Then I quite

believe  the Member for Thomson will try and  fight

his  way into Changi Gaol and so will Mr Kum  Siew

Yee; and so will Mr Woodhull, I think less happily

now, because since those days he has acquired a lot

of  the  graces  of life, like running  a  car  and

enjoying the seaside air by the Esplanade or by the

Straits  of  Johore, and so on.  But  I  can  quite

believe  that  in  the end,  for  want  of  a  less

honourable  way out, he will fight  every  inch  to

Changi or Pudu as the case may be. It will have  to

be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Pudu.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is a tougher and harder

place.  The  rocks  there, I am  told,  are  a  bit

harder. But, Sir, I was pretty sure that no  white-collar worker wanted to fight every inch of the way

to  Changi Gaol. That is not their idea in  joining

the  Business  Houses Employees  Union.  What  they

wanted  was  fighting for more wage  increases  and

salary  scales  which the union does  not  want  to

fight  for them. Sir, the stock situation does  not

exist. The white-collar workers do not want  to  be

sacrificed on the Communist altar. The problem that

faces   the  Communists  now  is  that  the   stock

situation of a wicked reactionary Government  using

brutal  methods which create hatred in  the  people

against  the Government does not exist.  They  have

tested the ground in a series of mass rallies.  The

Member  for Queenstown can remember. He called  one

in his own constituency. A few hundred chaps turned

up,  a  big  downpour came, and all  scattered.  He

himself scattered -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Did you see our

big picture?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> All scattered into the car

shed  nearby  and the first series  was  abandoned.

They called another series -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Special Branch information?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, no. Toa Payoh was

American  T.V.,  Ministry of Culture.  They  wanted

democratic people. American T.V. came to town. They

wanted  to  know  life in Singapore.  They  took  a

picture  of the Member for Queenstown spouting  the

C.P. line.  They asked me about it. I gave  a  few

casual  comments. They wanted to know  the  dynamic

life of revolutionary Singapore. They went down  to

Toa Payoh -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Not the Barisan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Dispossessed. It is a bit on

the  down grade now. Dispossessed squatters out  to

kill  and  behead  landlords;  in  this  case,  the

Housing Board, the absentee landlord. It was a cold

meeting. He was there. He knows. [Interruption] The

T.V. was there; we could see the film. No  trouble

at  all.  We know exactly what happened. Where  was

the fire and the venom?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they tried their first series of strikes

with  the  Business Houses Employees'  Union.  They

tried it with Shaw's; they tried it with Ford:  and

they tested the ground. I think they know that  for

this phase they have come out second best. Now  all

they  can  do is to list up the injustices  of  the

Government. What are they? The Government's refusal

to  allow the reunification of the trade unions and

the  de-registration  of the  four  federations  of

trade  unions.  Sir,  we  have  not  the  slightest

intention  of allowing reunification of  the  trade

union   movement  to  take  place  under  Communist

domination,  and  we have made  no  secret  of  our

stand. On May Day 1960, I said at the T.U.C. rally

at  Jalan  Besar  that it was our duty  in  a  non-Communist  State to ensure that the  leadership  of

the  trade union movement remained in non-Communist

hands.  I  made no bones about it. I made it  quite

clear.  The T.U.C., the trade union movement,  must

remain  non-Communist or it just would not  receive

Government support. I mean,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>



they  have  got to fight the Government. We  cannot

have  a Communist-dominated trade union. It  is  as

simple  as  that.  Even if we  wanted  to  allow  a

Communist-dominated  and  manipulated  trade  union

movement,  they  could  be  quite  sure  that   the

Internal Security Council would not stand  idly  by

and  watch the situation deteriorate. If the Member

for  Thomson believes that it was I who  wanted  to

deregister the four federations and that the I.S.C.

was  far  more lenient and better and more tolerant

to  the Communists, then surely the sensible  thing

to  do  is  to ask for the abolition of the  P.A.P.

Government and the Prime Minister, and not  to  ask

for the abolition of the I.S.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has referred, to my mind

deliberately  inaccurately,  to  my  views  of  the

political  situation as expressed to him.  This  is

what he said. The S.P.A., as far as I am concerned,

was finished. That is quite right. The British,  to

my  mind, would remain in the background and  would

not  do a thing except if the Left-wing got out  of

hand.  Sir,  I  never use vague words  like  "Left-wing".  Left-wing? I am Left-wing;  Mr  Lim  Ching

Siong is Left-wing. But he is a Communist and I  am

a  non-Communist. Mr Devan Nair is Left-wing;  Mr

Bani  is  Left-wing. They live next  door  to  each

other.  They  were such great friends once  upon  a

time.  He  is  a  Communist. He is a non-Communist.

That  is how. It is simple. What I said was if  the

Communists  got out of hand - I made no bones  about

that. He said if the trade unionists made too  much

noise, the British, according to me, would not  sit

back. What I meant was, and he knew quite well, the

trade  unionists were Communists. That was what  we

were  talking about. He said so. I saw myself in  a

rather favourable situation. Not to worry from  the

Right and as far as the working class movement  was

concerned. Every time you get this long tirade, you

just   translate   Communist  for  working   class,

Communist for trade unionists, and you get the real

truth.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Socialism. These are

euphemisms.  As  far as the working class  movement

was  concerned, they could not go very far for fear

of British reprisals -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> When I used them, I refer to

somebody who is not a member of the Communist Party

of  the  Communist Party, nor people who  once  had

connections like the Member for Havelock  with  the

Anti-British League, and are somewhat scared  about

it  now. [Interruption] Very real. That conference,

Sir?  Ah,  dear! They were asked. Their credentials

were  challenged - two  Communists,  to  my  personal

knowledge. There is a man who was a Communist  with

them.  No  credentials were checked.  They  merrily

went on with the meeting -



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> They were thrown out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We walked out. Because they

did  not have the courage to discuss our paper.  So

they  had  to pass a resolution, until  finally  in

shame  even  the  Member for  Anson  went  away  to

Brunei.  Fortunately he had a case  there  and  his

Party  voted against him and so on. I say,  without

the slightest bit of embarrassment, that we were in

a  favourable position and we were not prepared  to

be  made pawns of either by the British or  by  the

Communists or anybody else. The biggest  error  the

Communists  made was in believing Lord Selkirk  and

disbelieving  our  analysis. As  a  result  of  the

blandishments  of  the  U.K. Commissioner  and  his

officials  that  all was well and that  they  could

assume  power, they came out into the open, mounted

an  attack and embarked on the greatest blunder  in

history - next  to  greatest but  one.  The  greatest

being  starting the armed revolt in June 1948.  The

second  greatest, history will record, was fighting

the  nationalists and the non-Communist  socialists

and  fighting  merger, a nationalist and  a  sacred

cause.  Sometime they will have reason to  rue  for

many  a  long  year. In a way, of  course,  we  are

grateful to them for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>



having  bared their teeth so early and  showing  us

their  wicked  intentions  even  before  the  final

culmination   of  the  anti-colonial  struggle   of

independence through merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has

pointed  out  the  damaging effects  of  industrial

unrest  on  economic  expansion.  The  Member   for

Thomson   claims  that  there  is  no  relationship

between  the two. He has advanced his arguments  on

the  basis  of  what I said in  the  House  on  3rd

September, 1956. Sir, the Member for Thomson,  like

so  many  of  his ghost writers, continually  falls

into the error of thinking that all they have to do

is    to    repeat    history.   Under    different

circumstances,  they  are  trying  to  repeat  past

history,  just repeat what we did, hoping  that  it

will  have  the same desired result. Sir,  this  is

1962  and  not 1956 and there are basic differences

in   the  situation  then  and  now.  In  1956  the

Government  of  the  day had no coherent  plan  for

promoting industrial growth. They did not set apart

any   financial  or  technical  resources  in   the

interests of industrialisation. On the other  hand,

the  present Government has made great  efforts  in

this   field.  In  1956,  it  did  not  matter   to

industrial  growth whether there was or  there  was

not   industrial  unrest,  because  the   pace   of

industrialisation  would not be  affected;  because

whatever  happened,  very little  could  have  been

achieved then under the policy of the Government at

that   time.   The  situation  now  is   completely

different.  Large sums of money have been  paid  to

the   Economic  Development  Board,   nearly   $100

million,  to  promote new industries. $100  million

has  been  put at their disposal to be called  upon

when required. A powerful team of experts have been

recruited  to  push  forward our  industrialisation

programme,   and  under  these  circumstances   the

presence  of  industrial unrest  can  be  of  vital

importance to a successful enterprise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, scattered throughout the long speech of the

Member  for  Thomson was the persistent  allegation

that  I  am power mad and am doing a lot of  wicked

things  to  maintain myself and the  Government  in

power.  This  is  another  of  those  what  I  call

categorised and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>



stock allegations made by the close circuit mind of

the  Communists behind the Barisan. The Member  for

Thomson knows full well that the problems they were

faced  with  last  year  was  that  we  were  least

interested  in  power for the sake  of  power,  for

personal  ambition, or aggrandisement  or  personal

reward.  In  fact,  he can recall  vividly  how  he

agreed  with me when he came to see me in  hospital

in  June 1960. He was then a great supporter of the

P.A.P. He came with Mr Woodhull once and Mr Devan

Nair once. He agreed with me that if the Communists

continued  to create industrial unrest and  trouble

instead of following our policy of industrial peace

with   justice   in   order  to  allow   industrial

expansion, then we should join issue with them  and

bring  things to a head. Sir, he knew of our desire

to  resign  when  we could see no solution  to  our

economic  problems  of the common  market  and  our

political problems of merger after the Hong Lim by-election  last year. At that time, they  were  most

vociferous  in asking us to stay in office  and  to

ignore  temporary manifestations of discontent.  He

cannot  deny  that. He spoke at the Party  meeting.

There  were tape recorders to record what everybody

said  at the Party meeting for the records  of  the

Party. He knew the causes of this discontent,  like

lack  of  housing, too strict immigration controls,

unemployment. But at that time the Communists  were

not  yet  convinced  by the U.K. commissioner  that

they could run amok with impunity. So they did  not

want  us  to resign. Now the position has radically

altered.  By  their adventurous moves,  as  I  have

explained  on  a past occasion, they  have  brought

about  merger  quicker than even we  expected.  But

unfortunately for them, we are not as ham-handed as

the  last Government, nor are we desperate, nor are

we just hanging on to power. Sir, the political and

economic  issues have been clearly put  before  the

people.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Prime Minister be

some time?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Can I just finish this

paragraph? Sir, merger is around the corner. Merger

is  the only way to solve our problems in the  long

term, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



produce  a  long-term  solution  not  only  to  the

problem  of Communism and Communists in  the  trade

unions,  but more important, the long-term problems

of   economic  growth,  stability  and   industrial

expansion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the Member for Thomson

was  challenging the accuracy of my statement  that

25  strikes  were called by the Singapore  Business

Houses  Employees  Union  and  that  only  one  was

referred  to the Labour Ministry before the  strike

was  called. The data were supplied to  me  by  the

Commissioner for Labour and I have here  the  names

of the 25 branches of the Union:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International Computers and Tabulators Ltd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Optorg Co., Ltd.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>



In  several  of  them,  more than  one  strike  was

called.  Of  the  25 strikes, only the  first,  the

Gramophone  Company Limited, was  referred  to  the

Labour Department before the strike was called. The

strike  was called on 30th January, 1961,  and  the

dispute  was  referred to the Labour Department  on

27th January, 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to illustrate the same point of their

unwillingness  to find a reasonable  settlement  to

disputes  or  to use normally accepted channels  of

conciliation and arbitration, let me quote  another

very  recent  instance where  the  Paya  Lebar  Bus

Company  branch  of the Bus Workers Union,  without

referring  the  matter to the Labour  Ministry  nor

even  discussing matters with the management,  took

direct  action. According to newspaper  reports  of

14th  March, the Paya Lebar Bus Company  branch  of

the Bus Workers Union gave free rides to all from 6

p.m. to 9.30 p.m. last Saturday for the purpose  of

getting  two  workers who were  not  union  members

dismissed from the company. This direct action  was

taken when in fact, having seen what they called  a

conciliator  or a moderator, they agreed  to  refer

the  matter, to take advice or to consult Mr  Tann

Wee  Tiong together with representatives of the Bus

Workers  Union to try and find a way  out.  Without

waiting  to  find a way out, action  was  taken  go

slow;  free  rides.  This  is  in  the  nature   of

Communist strategy which has been elaborated by the

Minister  for Culture. All I need do really  is  to

draw  the attention of Members of the House to  the

1anguage -  not only the tactics but the language -  of

the  pro-Communists. The cries - this is all from the

speech  of  the Member for Thomson - "Use police  on

striking   workers",  Police  action  during   City

Council  strike",  "Transform  City  into  military

camp',  "Robinson  strike -  clerks  and  salesgirls

carted  away  like  cattle into  Black  Marias" - are

absolute  falsehoods, Sir. They  pushed  themselves

in.  They  wanted to go in, laughing away,  because

the  police  were gentle. "Carted away like  cattle

into Black Marias!" And so I can go on reciting the

language of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>



the  pro-Communists. "Temptation of their  colonial

and   pre-colonial  predecessors  regarding   these

disputes with hostility." Hostility, Sir'? We  have

heard  the  Minister  for  Health  recounting   his

experiences when he was the Minister for Labour and

the  advantage they took of the confidence that  he

reposed in their good faith in wanting to work  the

conciliation and arbitration machinery. The  Member

for  Thomson talks of wild men, repressive  action,

warn   us,   warn  them,  throttle  expression   of

grievances.  Nobody  is doing that,  Sir.  This  is

exactly their trouble. We are giving them the  free

run  of  the  place within the ambit of the  law - do

their  worse and they will come to grief even  more

quickly than they would otherwise meet their  fate.

"Power-crazy   Prime  Minister",   "Working   class

movement constant threat to his personal ambition".

Since when have I suddenly changed from a nice anti-colonial  revolutionary who was asked to  lead  the

anti-colonial movement in June last year  in  Anson

into a power-crazy and a working class threat to my

personal ambition?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they talk of going about their business with

the noise and vulgarity of turncoats. I have always

stood  for  what  I  believe in - a democratic,  non-Communist,  socialist Malaya. It is he, the  Member

for  Thomson, who is a turncoat - if anybody  turned.

He  believed in it - an independent, democratic, non-Communist Malaya - and now he has thrown in  his  lot

with  the  Communists and has become their  willing

aide. Then of course the final hope - the P.A.P. has

travelled the same rotten route, has common  ground

with all opponents of the S.P.A. Sir, their trouble

is   that  they  have  now  embarked  on  a  route,

uncharted,  full of pitfalls, and we do not  intend

to  give  them  any guidance by doing  any  of  the

foolish things that were done by the S.P.A. in  the

past  which  made  them martyrs. I  have  explained

their  ways of dealing with wild men in the  unions

and  in  Communist  front  organisations  like  the

Barisan Sosialis. While these may appear to  people

like   the  Member  for  Cairnhill,  who   had   no

experience  in these matters, who had  in  fact  no

alternative because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>



he  had  no  alternative solution, to be weak,  the

Member  for Havelock knows. He was reading  from  a

script.  His  masters know. He  said  that  we  are

cunning.  I  suggest that that  is  so  because  we

learn. We have learnt from the mistakes of the last

Government. We have learnt from their doings. I say

we  shall show that our handling of this situation,

with  gentleness  according to the  law,  and  with

firmness whenever they break the law, will  produce

a much more healthy situation in the end when there

will  be  no tombstones for martyrs. There  may  be

tombstones,  Sir, but they will be unmarked  graves

for  foolish adventurers who sought their own self-destruction.



<br><br>5.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding the problem

before  us, I am of the opinion that the  amendment

is  not  a  new thing in principle. It is  a  usual

thing which is not extraordinary in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you have heard the non-Communist people speak, and also the people who

have been accused as being pro-Communists, but  who

have not yet clarified their position. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  as  you  well  know, I am an  anti-Communist.

Therefore, I think it is unfair for us to sit  idle

and witness as referees the non-Communists slugging

it out wish the pro-Communists. It is proper that I

should  take part in the hope that my blow will  be

delivered at the right people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My previous stand was that I was not afraid and I

did not hit as I did not have full faith. But now I

am  beginning to have faith in the attitude of  the

P.A.P.  It  does not mean that I want to  join  the

P.A.P. - far  from it. It is because the  P.A.P. has

demonstrated  its  stand  by  expelling  its   pro-Communist  colleagues  from  the  Party  for   many

reasons.  But is this enough in the field of  trade

unionism or in other spheres? Before I dwell on the

Barisan  Sosialis,  let  me  ask  the  P.A.P. this

question - as  the  Minister for  Home  Affairs  well

knows, I have asked this question on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



several occasions in this Assembly - why have these

people not been arrested? Why? If they want to send

these  people  to  Pudu Gaol, the rocks  there  are

rough.  I  think it is not the place, because  Pudu

Gaol  is  very far from Singapore. It is easier  to

send  them to Changi Gaol or Pulau Senang. If  they

are  really Communists, why are they allowed to  go

free?  It  is not my problem. If I am the  Minister

for  Home Affairs, I will arrest them all. So  this

is  the position in connection with the problems we

are facing today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill was indignant about the

release  of these people from gaol and then appoint

them  as Political Secretaries at $1,100 pay  each.

An  allowance  of  $500 is  paid  to  each  of  the

people's  representatives. Why pay the  Communists?

Why  do  we still make use of them when we can  put

them  in  a  safe place where they  can  no  longer

receive any allowance? This is what it should be if

you  really  want to face the Communist menace.  So

who  is  going to arrest these people? We  ask  the

Government  to discharge its duty, as I  feel  that

the  police  are unjustly accused. The  police  are

merely    fulfilling   their   responsibility    in

maintaining  peace and order. Now  that  they  have

been  accused,  we  on  the  Front  Bench  of   the

Opposition  are not satisfied unless  we  have  our

champions  in  the  Government.  Mr  Speaker,  for

instance, at one time my colleague in U.M.N.O. was

arrested  because he got himself mixed up  probably

with the Lim Ching Siong group in Middle Road.  And

we  from U.M.N.O. demanded a Minister, who  is  now

the  Member  for  Geylang  Serai,  to  release   my

colleague. Similarly my ex-U.M.N.O. colleague,  who

is  now the Parliamentary Secretary to the Hon, the

Prime  Minister,  knows  this  full  well.  If  Mr

Speaker were to listen to his oration, I feel  that

he could not control himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I am not asking them, other than my colleagues

who  are of the non-Communist belief, why they have

not fulfilled their obligations in the interests of

the  security  of  the State. I  am  quite  sure  a

definite  reply  will be given  so  that  we  could

together shoulder our responsibilities towards  the

people of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>



Let  us not wait until the realisation  of

merger  or Malaysia, or wait for Tun Razak  or  Dr

Ismail to do their job of arresting or banning  the

Barisan Sosialis from the political field and  from

the trade union field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have heard accusations in this

Assembly that the Barisan Sosialis is this and that

in  the trade unions. Once again I ask the Hon, the

Minister  for  Home  Affairs: why  is  the  Barisan

Sosialis  allowed to function as a political  Party

in Singapore? This is not a plaything, Mr Speaker.

I  am  surprised.  I am compelled  to  speak  in  a

language  which  he can understand and  appreciate.

The  Barisan Sosialis has one foot in the political

field, and the other is allowed to go free.  So  if

the Trade Unions Bill, which is awaiting the assent

of  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara, is to be enforced,

then  I  am  quite sure that people  who  are  non-citizens

of Singapore cannot take an active part in

the  trade unions. That is the intention. We do not

wish  to see non-citizens taking an active part  in

trade unions. If we allow non-Singapore citizens to

participate in trade union activities, we  will  be

frustrated.  The  Police Force and  the  Government

have all means at their disposal and they know more

about Communism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, after I have heard what the former Minister

for  Labour, who is now the Minister  for Health and Law,

has just said in this House, I  ask this question - and if

he cannot reply, perhaps  his colleague may be in a position

to help - who  is  in the wrong? Is it the fault of the Ten Tall Men?

Or is   the  Government  deliberately  condoning

the actions  of  these Ten Tall Men? Mr  Speaker,  the

wind  has  now  changed into  a  cyclone.  When  it

subsides, the ship of the Seamen's Union can sail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, before the Barisan Sosialis was formed,

I   had  occasion  to  plead   with   the Government:

why were the nominees to the  Seamen's

Registry  Board  not chosen from  the  other  side?

According  to the explanation given in this  House,

the T.U.C. had not then been registered. But if the

T.U.C. had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>



not  been  registered, does it mean  that  all  the

nominees were selected in a proper manner? Why were

we  completely ignored? We give due respect to  the

Government, and we expect them to treat the  people

of Singapore in a just and fair manner. One nominee

was  nominated from our group, but since his death,

nothing  has  been  done. I ask  the  Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Culture: what game is

he  playing?  Is he playing chess, or  what?  I  am

completely surprised at this, Mr Speaker.  Let  us

be  frank in this House because everything that  is

said here is recorded in the Hansard and is kept in

safe custody in our Library.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the question of Pulau Bukom, where

the  Shell Company is, I have a point but I do  not

wish  to  elaborate  on it at length.  There  is  a

union, of which I am the representative, which  was

defeated in a secret ballot. I want to ask: are the

seamen  considered as people who live on land?  Now

this  question  has  arisen,  and  I  am  sure  the

Minister for Education, who is the Chairman of  the

Port  Commission, will give due consideration,  and

the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  will  also  give  due

consideration. There are vacant jobs of helmsmen or

serang.  The  policy  of the Harbour  Board  is  to

recruit  persons  through the  shipping  office  at

Fullerton  Building. But when I enquired  from  the

office,  I  learned that no register  was  kept  of

helmsmen  because a helmsman can do the  job  of  a

Master of a ship of less than 25 tons and can  sail

within  25 miles of Singapore's territorial waters.

Therefore,  the Government policy is not  good.  So

what  has  happened? I do not know who will  become

mad,  whether  it is the people or the  Government.

This  causes  a  great  deal  of  inconvenience  to

applicants who have the necessary qualifications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker, concerns the Harbour

Board.  I know Mr Jamit Singh is a member  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis,  and I am in  the  U.M.N.O.  The

U.M.N.O. Alliance have been accused of working hand

in  glove with the P.A.P. We must be given a chance

to explain. We know that the Harbour Board makes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>



agreements  with  a union which  I  represent.  The

agreement might have lapsed, because when we  wrote

a letter, there was no reply. There was not even an

acknowledgment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are on an amendment which

alleges  that  there is some Communist  element  in

this  industrial unrest. I do not know whether  the

hon.  Member is alleging that the Communist element

has crept into the Harbour Board.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali:</b> I am coming to that.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I see. Inche Mohd. Ali.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I wish

to reiterate this point in this Assembly because  I

feel  that  the  pro-Communist  influence  in   the

Barisan  Sosialis  is strong in the  Harbour  Board

Staff Association, and the Government ignore us.  I

tell  them: do not be afraid of us. We will support

the Government to the hilt if we are asked to fight

the  Communists.  But we ask the Government  to  be

firm  in its policy towards Communism. Mr Speaker,

we  hate  Communism. Ban Communism before it  gains

ground  in Singapore. On the other hand, I ask  the

Government not to have the impression that  we,  in

the U.M N.O., are sitting idle. If Government still

does  not believe that we wish to support them,  if

they  are  prepared  to  come  to  the  Opposition,

likewise  we will be prepared to go to their  side,

so that we could discharge our duties just like the

Alliance  Government in Malaya  has  taken  up  the

fight against Communism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, to revert to the Communist problem. Whether there are pro-Communists or non-Communists in Singapore. I am really thirsting for positive replies, particularly from the Honourable Ministers who at one time were my comrades but who until now have not shown that they are courageous enough to take action, because I know that the P.A.P. has a bureau to look after the interests of the Malays.

Why is it that that bureau has not come out with  a

resolution  to  demand that the  Central  Executive

Committee  of  the P.A.P. take action against  pro-Communist elements?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I heard what the Prime Minister said just now when he emphasised in this House about martyrs. As for U.M.N.O. and as for myself, we are not surprised to hear this. If these 13 Members are really Communists who are trying to overwhelm Singapore, I think they should not make that futile attempt. If they do, they will face dire consequences. I say dire consequences because I am

confident,  not  that I wish to commend  the  Malay

members  in the P.A.P., but because we in  U.M.N.O.

and  elsewhere  no doubt love our religion  and  as

followers  of  the Islamic faith, we cannot  accept

Communism  in  Singapore.  I  wish  the  people  of

Singapore  who are members of political Parties  to

declare whether they are really Communists. If they

are, I promise U.M.N.O. will fight them unto death.

The  M.C.P. has  been banned. The M.C.P. was  the

cause of many of our citizens being slain. There is

no  doubt  that  we  will defend  our  nation,  our

religion   and   our  fatherland   from   Communist

conquest.



<br><br>6.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

after debating the amendment moved by my colleague,

the  Parliamentary Secretary to  the  Minister  for

Labour, I think the people of Singapore, especially

the  Members of this Assembly who love justice  and

the  prosperity of the State, will  not  oppose  or

reject  the amendment. The amendment moved  by  the

Government  aims  at  protecting  our  State   from

destructive  elements who are  intent  on  bringing

chaos to the country. This amendment is a challenge

to  Members of this House, a challenge at least  to

clear  themselves from accusations that  there  are

Members  in  this Assembly who associate themselves

with  members of Communist front organisations.  If

they  are truly free from Communist influence, they

must  say  so  because I think this motion  clearly

says  that we condemn the Communists. If  they  are

not  Communists,  if  they are not  pro-Communists,

what  is  there  to be afraid of? I  heard  several

Members saying, including the leader of the Barisan

Sosialis (the Member for Queenstown), that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>



Government  is brutal in accusing those Members  of

the  Barisan  Sosialis who have no  opportunity  to

defend themselves in this Assembly. Mr Speaker,  I

do  not  know which members of the Communist  Party

have  no  opportunity to answer our charges.  I  am

quite sure that their stooges and their tools  have

defended  the  open front Communist Party  in  this

Assembly.  This  is clear. If they  have  no  close

connections  with  members of the Communist  Party,

there will be no such accusations, such as that the

Government is repressive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I say that in this world, people who have no self-respect are those who are prepared to make use of other people's names for their own benefit. We have often heard that members who were previously Members of this Assembly who stood as P.A.P. candidates and who have now defected from the Party, now accuse the P.A.P. of being instruments of colonialism and Right-wing

reactionaries. They accuse the Government of  being

irresponsible  and  say that the Government  should

resign. I believe they must first themselves resign

from this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suggest that the hon.

Member  do  not raise his voice in such  a  manner,

because it rather upsets the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): If this

upsets  Mr  Speaker, at least I hope  the  Barisan

Sosialis will not turn a deaf ear to my speech. The

best  thing  for people, with self-respect,  to  do

before  levelling  accusations  against  others  is

first to clear themselves of such charges. Like the

action  taken  by the former Minister for  National

Development,  they  accuse  the  P.A.P. of   being

reactionary  and  as  an irresponsible  Government,

while  they themselves were at one time elected  on

the P.A.P. ticket.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, many of the Barisan Sosialis Members have accused

the Government of wishing to  involve the Opposition Members in

moving their amendment so that the Opposition will give their

support so that Government can take oppressive action against

trade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>



unions.  In this amendment, it is not the intention

of  the  Government  to suppress  the  trade  union

movement  but  what they wish  to  do  is  to  take

reasonable  steps to remove the Communist  elements

to bring about industrial peace in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, they are in a fix now. They do not know how to find a way out. The leader of the Barisan Sosialis challenges the Government to arrest the whole lot of the Barisan Sosialis members and bring them to gaol. Desperate people always adopt this attitude. This challenge is too naive. If a child is being beaten by his mother, the child would plead that he be killed rather than

be   beaten  up.  We  know  that  Communism  is  an

ideology.  So  with industrial stability  Communism

will have no place in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Cairnhill is trying to egg us on to take action. This is also a cunning move on the part of the S.P.A. The Government would be really irresponsible if it followed in his footsteps and put them all behind bars. We have our own stand. We will not be egged on by anybody. Communism will not be overcome if there is no alternative offered to the people. The people must

awaken.  It is our wish to eradicate the  Communist

elements.  We  have no surgeons: at  least  in  the

Barisan Sosialis there are two doctors. But  if  we

wish  to  remove  cancer  we  must  carry  out   an

operation. The purpose is to remove or to  get  rid

of the disease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, this amendment is not calculated to

curb   the  activities  of  trade  unions  but   to

eradicate Communism from trade unions. Mr Speaker,

there  is  a tree by the name of Mandalu. The  tree

will  die  by itself. There is no need to speak  at

great length on this amendment. Many speakers  have

spoken on it. But I am surprised to hear the Member

for  Kampong  Kembangan.  He  directed  his  speech

towards his former members of U.M.N.O. I know  that

the Member for Kampong Kembangan is a Left-wing. He

was  the  one who strongly opposed the P.P.S.O.  We

could  find  his name every day in the  newspapers.

But we found out later that there are people at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



the  back  of  him.  Our stand  is  clear  on  this

problem. We need not be egged on. Our policy is  to

maintain  industrial stability in the  interest  of

the  people. Mr Speaker, I see that the Member for

Kampong  Kembangan  is  trying  to  drag  in  Malay

Members  of  the  Government. I  suspect  that  his

intention   is   to  split  the  Members   of   the

Government, non-Malays from Malays. In facing  this

problem,  we are prepared to sink or swim with  the 26 Members on the Government benches.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the motion as moved by my colleague, the Member for

Cairnhill,  was to the effect that the House  views

with  grave  concern  the  mounting  of  industrial

unrest.  Mr  Speaker,  you will  notice  that  the

motion  is  not concerning the mounting  industrial

unrest,  but it is with the mounting of  industrial

unrest.  By  this was meant not so much  industrial

unrest arising out of industrial grievances  as  an

extraneous   source   making  use   of   industrial

grievances  to  mount industrial unrest.  That  was

what  my  colleague had in mind when he moved  this

motion.  Because  we, on this side  of  the  House,

understand that in the state of society we are  in,

where  there is an employer and an employee,  there

are  bound  to be grievances, and grievances  could

lead to industrial unrest. What we on this side  of

the  House  were concerned with when we  moved  the

motion was that some extraneous body or bodies  not

directly  involved  in  industrial  disputes   were

making  use of these industrial disputes  to  cause

industrial unrest. Since the moving of this motion,

the  Government have introduced an amendment to the

original  motion. The amendment as I  see  it,  Mr

Speaker, seems to be contained in three parts.  The

first  part  is a qualification to the mounting  of

industrial unrest:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this House views with grave concern the

mounting  of  industrial  unrest  by  pro-Communist

political agitators for political ends...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may say so, it is a closer definition, from

the Government point of view, of where the mounting

of the industrial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>



unrest comes from. Now, the second  point

of  alteration in the motion is with regard to  the

calling on the Government -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...to take all reasonable steps to ensure

industrial  peace  with  justice  [the   amendment

being]  in  the interests of industrial  expansion

so  vital to the economic well-being of the people

of Singapore...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet again here is possibly a closer definition

of  the  main theme my colleague had in  mind.  The

main point of difference, as far as I can see, with

the  amendment is the third and last limb  of  this

amendment which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...and to prevent genuine industrial grievances

from being exploited for Communist ends'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, as far as I can make out, seems to be the

substantial  alteration which  the  Government  has

sought  to the motion as moved by my colleague  the

Member for Cairnhill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, on various occasions in this

House,  I have addressed the Prime Minister on  the

question of his responsibility to the State on  the

question   of  Communist  interference   with   the

apparatus   of   State.   Naturally   it   is   the

Government's business to contain Communism  and  to

see  that in containing it the life of the  country

is  not  unduly disturbed; that is the problem  for

the  Government which it must meet and solve in the

best way it thinks the problem merits solution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my immediate concern at the moment is with

the amendment to the motion, and this amendment  is

to prevent genuine industrial grievances from being

exploited  for  Communist ends. I  read  into  that

amendment a positive statement by the Government in

the  use of the word "prevent" to suggest that they

will  take positive preventive measures to  prevent

the    Communists   from   exploiting    industrial

grievances. I have listened to various speeches  on

the  Government side as to what positive preventive

measures  they  intend  to  take  to  prevent   the

Communists  from exploiting industrial  grievances.

As  far  as I could make out - and I hope  I  am  not

doing Government an injustice - the only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>



positive  contribution that came on this particular

limb  of  the amendment was from the Prime Minister

himself when he seemed to suggest to the House that

what be proposed to do was to give the Communists a

long  rope within the ambit of the law and he hoped

that the Communists would hang themselves with that

long  rope.  That, to my mind, is  not  a  positive

preventive  measure  as  this  amendment  seems  to

envisage.   I  know  that  all  sorts  of   people,

Communists  and  others not well  disposed  to  the

democratic form of government in this country, will

do  everything  in their power - they will  use  foul

means,  they will infiltrate into legitimate  State

organisations,   into   legitimate   trade    union

organisations - with a view to disrupting democratic

government. Sir, I had hoped to hear from the Prime

Minister,  or from other Members of the Government,

that  in moving this amendment a definite statement

would  be  made  by Government that  some  positive

action  would be taken against known Communists  or

known   pro-Communists  who  would  use  legitimate

industrial  grievances  not  for  the  purpose   of

settling  the disputes of the workers for the  ends

of  the  workers, but for the purpose of exploiting

their  grievances for political ends of their  own.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I feel perfectly convinced  that

Government feel that they are doing the right thing

for the country and that the measures they wish  to

take  are the best which they can think of in  this

given  situation. But I find it very  difficult  to

support   an  amendment  which  suggests   positive

measures  and  yet,  on the speeches  made  by  the

Government, no statement has been made as  to  what

positive  measures will be taken except a  negative

approach to the problem, and that is to give a long

rope to the Communists to hang themselves with.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Original Question was,

<br><br>Tun Lim, in reply then?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Yes, Sir. It is

very short.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been accused by the

Government  and  the  Barisan  Sosialis  of   doing

something which they themselves went to the trouble

of proving. I did not ask them to prove it here.  I

just  tabled a simple motion calling on this  House

to   note  with  grave  concern  the  mounting   of

industrial unrest. I said in my speech on my motion

regarding  the mounting of industrial  unrest  that

this  is not a political move and that there is  no

intention  on  my part to blame the  two  political

Parties  - the Barisan Sosialis and the P.A.P. -  for

fighting  it  out in the industrial  field.  And  I

asked  this House, having viewed with grave concern

the  mounting of industrial unrest, to call on  the

Government  to do everything reasonable  to  ensure

industrial  peace with justice, and  in  connection

with  that part of my speech I did not at any stage

suggest  repressive measures. All I said  was  that

the   Government  rushed  through  the   Industrial

Relations  Bill  in  1960 and that  on  its  Second

Reading  rushed  through 50 amendments,  using  its

weight  of 43 Members then to put through  what  it

now  has  to admit is a Bill weighted in favour  of

the   Communist  group  of  the  trade  unions   in

Singapore. And yet you find three days spent  on  a

simple  motion  by  the Barisan  Sosialis  and  the

P.A.P. who are both hammering it out -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> And the S.P.A.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - and I sitting in between

hearing, "How bad the Lim Yew Hock Government  was.

How bad this was," from behind and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>



from the front. I want to tell this House that I am

used to that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one thing that must be an eye-opener to the

people  of  Singapore is this:  so  long  as  those

things  that  the  P.A.P. now  accuse  the  Barisan

Sosialis   of  doing  were  done  by  the   P.A.P.,

everything was all right. So long as they were done

by  somebody  else, everything was  wrong - Communist

front,  pro-Communist agitators. I  said  yesterday

that the group which the Government is now accusing

of  agitating the workers for political ends is the

same  group  that I had to contend with  during  my

time. They said that I was foolish enough to arrest

them and make them martyrs. But I would like to say

this  to  them,  that  it is  they  who  made  them

martyrs.  It  is they who stood in this  House  and

said  that they were the champions of the  workers,

that they fought and were prepared to go to prison.

These  words  were said by them.  They  made  these

people  martyrs, not I. I put them in the  oblivion

of  prison.  Instead of which, when  they  came  to

power, they refused even to take office until these

comrades  were  released and after that  they  made

them  Political Secretaries, paying them  $1,100  a

month  each from public funds. As if that  was  not

enough,  they  made them the Ten Tall  Men  in  the

T.U.C. Now they are described by the P.A.P. as pro-Communist  political agitators  in  the  industrial

field.  If  there is one thing that my  motion  has

achieved,  it is this. The P.A.P. are now  prepared

to  admit that the group that gave trouble in  1956

is  a  pro-Communist political group. But then what

does  the Prime Minister say? He says, "Oh, we  are

not  fools like Lim Yew Hock. We know that they are

Communists. They can have their fun."  And  yet  at

one  of the sittings two months ago, I compared his

Government  to a watchdog. I think  it  is  only  a

mongrel  that keeps on barking and never bites.  It

keeps  on saying, "Communists, Communists," but  it

does not do any biting. What is the use of it?  Why

then  call them Communists? Why then amend a motion

to say that all this is the work of pro-Communists?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member must not

attack the amendment. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



has  been accepted by the House. He must now  speak

in general terms.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Yes, Sir, in general terms. I

pointed   out   that  if  they  were   serious   in

implementing their policy of industrial peace  with

justice  and  that if they were serious  when  they

introduced the Industrial Relations Ordinance, they

could  have  made it work. Now they say,  "Oh,  the

Barisan  do  not Want the Arbitration Court."  Sir,

the  law does not state compulsory arbitration, but

it does give power to the Minister, if he considers

that a dispute is detrimental to the economy of the

country, to direct it to the Arbitration Court. The

Minister need not have to wait for either party  to

suggest  that it should go to arbitration. The  law

says that if both parties want it, it is all right.

But if both parties do not want it and the Minister

feels  that  it  is  in the best  interest  of  the

country that it should go to arbitration, he  shall

so  direct in the Gazette. The fact that he has not

directed  any of the Barisan Sosialis  or  S.A.T.U.

strikes - 69  strikes except for two as disclosed  by

the  Prime Minister - shows that the Government  is

playing party politics itself. Just because  it  is

not  the  P.A.P. unions calling a  strike,  "Never

mind, let them stew in their own juice. We can  now

laugh  at them on the Ford strike. They fought  for

110  days and got just one cent." That is  not  the

way for the Government to look after the workers of

Singapore. Keep away from party politics.  The  law

is  there. If it was felt, as it is felt now by the

Government, that all the 69 strikes that took place

in  1961  were bad for the economy of the  country,

why did the Government not do something about it? I

have not suggested that they should take repressive

measures. I did suggest, and I do suggest, that the

matter could have gone to arbitration under the law

introduced  by the Government. The Government  does

not  want  to do it, just because it is  a  Barisan

Sosialis strike and not a P.A.P. union strike.  Let

us  see  how  sincere  the  Government  is  in  the

administration of this law. I said that there is  a

Part  of  the Industrial Relations Ordinance  which

refers to a board of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



inquiry. A board of inquiry is to enquire into  any

trouble. I would like to read section 70(1) of this

Ordinance:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Minister may, by notification in the

Gazette, appoint a Board of Inquiry and direct  the

Board  to  inquire into and report to  him  upon  a

matter  defined in the notification being a  matter

included   within  the  definition  of   industrial

matters in section 2 of this Ordinance.'.



<br><br>I  said that the power vested in the Minister under

this Part of the Ordinance to bring the rule of law

into  industrial relations, where the rule  of  the

jungle had previously prevailed, had not been  made

use of by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the O.C.B.C. strike, it is a

simple matter. The Minister could have appointed  a

Board  of  Inquiry and that would  have  saved  the

workers  going all out on strike for 12  days.  And

that  Board of Inquiry would expose - there  was  no

need for the Minister to expose - if it was true, the

anti-trade  union  activities  of  the  Company  as

alleged by the union. Why did the Minister not make

use  of  the  power  given to  him  under  the  law

introduced  by the Government itself?  He  did  say

that another way to promote industrial peace was to

have a unification of the trade unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Health and Law just now gave an account of how the Trade Unions Bill was being considered by the Government, and how he, as the then Minister for Labour and Law, sought the assistance or consulted the Ten Tall Men who were at that time with the P.A.P., and how, as a result of those discussions, the Bill came to be presented in this Assembly, and how it was rushed through. It

was the Opposition - it was still 8 at that time - that

warned  the Government that it would be very,  very

dangerous  to  insist that such  a  law  should  be

passed,  as it would give the T.U.C. a stranglehold

on the trade unions. The Government could not care,

because  it  felt that at that particular  time  it

would  be  a  P.A.P. T.U.C. And when the Government

found that it could not be a P.A.P. T.U.C., we were

treated to the wonderful spectacle of the Secretary-General  of  the T.U.C. throwing up his  hands  and

saying, "Dissolve the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>



T.U.C."; and his friend the Minister and the others

replied, "Yes, dissolve the T.U.C." And even  today

we  find that the T.U.C. is a registered body.  And

the  Minister for Health and Law admitted  how  the

people  in  the  T.U.C. went  about  capturing  the

T.U.C. Of course, I must praise him for being  very

fair  in  his  speech just now  in  exposing  their

erstwhile  comrades  who are  now  in  the  Barisan

Sosialis. He went to the extent of saying that they

amended the constitution of the T.U.C. to bring  in

the Ten Tall Men, and the constitution could not be

registered.  The Registrar of Trade Unions  refused

to  register the new constitution. And yet the  new

T.U.C. was recognised by the Government and allowed

to  operate  up  to  the time when  the  Secretary-General  said,  "Dissolve" without even  calling  a

meeting of the constituent bodies of the T.U.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I asked the Minister in my speech to say

whether  the  Government  would  appoint  one  more

Arbitration  court just to meet the situation.  The

President  of the Industrial Arbitration  Court  in

his Report says that there are eight cases pending.

In view of the increasing industrial unrest and the

desirability  of  keeping a  check  on  unnecessary

industrial  unrest,  I  would  suggest   that   the

Government should consider appointing more than one

Arbitration Court. This assurance was given by  the

Minister  for  Labour and Law  when  he  moved  the

Second Reading of the Industrial Relations Bill  in

February  1960.  I  would  ask  the  Government  to

implement  the assurance given by the  Minister  in

February 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of the President of the Arbitration

Court   also   disclosed  that   there   had   been

discussions with the Minister on certain amendments

which would help to strengthen the law and make  it

more  effective. I would ask the Government not  to

hesitate  or delay any longer introducing  amending

legislation on the advice of the President  of  the

Court.  The  Government gave an assurance  to  this

House  that  if  amendments to the law  were  found

necessary,  they  would  do  so.  The  Report   was

submitted to the Government in early January.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>



Today  is  nearly the end of March, and  there  has

been   no   indication  whatsoever  that  it   will

introduce amending legislation on the basis of  the

discussions  which the President of the  Industrial

Arbitration Court had with the Minister for  Labour

and Law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second part of my motion does not intend

to  call  on  the  Government  to  take  repressive

measures.  I cannot understand why it is  that  the

Barisan Sosialis speakers should see in that simple

motion  a  suggestion  that I  was  egging  on  the

Government  to  take repressive measures.  And  the

Government  too, in their speeches,  also  had  the

same  kind of thought. It is very clear to me, Sir,

that as a result of this debate the P.A.P. and  the

Barisan  think alike in so far as the trade  unions

in  Singapore  are concerned. They are  good  meat.

Make  full  use  of  them  to  achieve  their   own

political ends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have spent nearly four days on a simple

motion,  but I must say that it is a very important

motion  and  I am glad that it is now reaching  the

closing stages. What the Opposition is more anxious

to  see  is  that the Government wake up  to  their

responsibility and do everything in their power  to

see  that  the workers of Singapore are  not  being

exploited by anybody - by the Communists, by the  so-called non-Communists, by anybody

- and that the industrial field in Singapore is made

more  calm,  more peaceful and more  conducive  for

foreign investment.

<div align="center"><b>SIX-DAY WEEK IN SCHOOLS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly is of the opinion that in the

interests   of  young  school  children  Government

should not further delay the relaxation of the six-day   week  pending  the  implementation   of   the

recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry.*



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The  same motion also stood in the  name  of  Mr David Marshall.

<hr size="2" noshade>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after such a prolonged and tiring debate on

the  industrial unrest, I am sure most Members  are

looking  forward  to  a period of  some  relaxation

Therefore, I trust they will be sympathetic to  the

subject before the House which seeks the relaxation

as  early  as  possible  of the  six-day  week  for

schools in the interest of young school children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the despatch of the original motion,

the   Government  has  appointed  in  a  Government

Gazette   Extraordinary  the  long-awaited  Inquiry

Commission.  It is unfortunate that the  Government

took  such  a long time to make the appointment  as

perhaps  the motion would not have come on  to  the

Order Paper. Sir, when the question of a Commission

of  Inquiry was raised, it was on 14th of November.

Then   on  17th  of  November,  the  Minister   for

Education announced his intention to revise the six-day week







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>



into  something "lighter". If he had  on  to  that,

Sir,  I am sure there would have been a great  deal

of  goodwill. Then on 21st December, he decided  to

put  the  six-day  week  revision  plan  into  cold

storage  pending  receipt  of  the  report  of  the

Commission   of   Inquiry.   That   was   a   great

disappointment to the many school children who were

affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my first point is that we as Assemblymen

should  apply the golden rule. We ourselves do  not

want  a  six-day  week practised in this  Assembly.

Because of the nature of our work, we find that  we

have  to  have time after our sittings here  to  do

work  outside, interview people, visit constituents

and  attend  meetings. All these  other  activities

have  to  be  taken into account. In  the  case  of

school children, their work is not done only during

the  days  when they are in schools.  If  they  are

conscientious students, they have their homework to

do  and  more outside reading to do. All in all,  a

five-day  school  week  really  means,  in   actual

practice,  a  six-day  week,  and  for   the   very

conscientious ones sometimes even a seven-day week.

So  when the compulsory five-day school week became

a  six-day  school  week, in actual  practice,  the

conscientious  students  were  penalised  and  they

spent  about seven days a week. Parents  have  been

saying  that  their children have been studying  on

Sundays.  When  the children were asked  why,  they

said, "There is plenty of homework to do. There  is

too much homework."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again I would stress that since we

Assemblymen  ourselves do not like a six-day  week,

we   should  be  more  considerate  to  the  school

children and relax the practice of a six-day week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is that in the case of the adult

education  classes, the Minister for Education  has

already relaxed the ruling. Last year, they  worked

on  a six-day week. There were regular classes  six

times a week. But it was found that there were many

absentees from the Saturday evening classes and the

organisers  had to ask that the number  of  regular

evening  classes be reduced to five  and  that  the

Saturday evening classes be for extra



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>



subjects.  Sir, that was granted. The adults  could

not  stand  a six-day week for study purposes.  Now

what  more the young children? In the case  of  the

adults, if they played truant, nothing happened  to

them.  In the case of the school children, if  they

were  to  play truant, they would get into trouble.

Having  been taught to be obedient, naturally  they

dare not play truant and so they have just to stick

on, going from six days to another six days working

on  Sundays  too and making themselves  more  tired

than they should be. If the adults can have a five-day  school  week,  there is no  reason  why  there

should  be  no  relaxation for the  younger  school

children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the argument was made before that many

parents would benefit by a six-day school week  for

their  children. Their children would then be  kept

away  from  the  streets. Sir,  educationally,  the

schools  are not meant for the parents but for  the

children. So educationally, we should think of  the

welfare of the children rather than the welfare  or

the convenience of the parents. If in certain areas

the parents want their children to be kept occupied

on  Saturdays because they are not back from  work,

then  other arrangements should be made in  such  a

way  that  the  welfare  of the  children  is  kept

uppermost  in  mind.  I  am  sure  that  reasonable

parents  would be able to see it from  that  angle,

that schools must exist for the educational welfare

of   their   children  and  not   for   their   own

convenience.  It would be wrong human relations  to

put parents first and children last.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point was made that because the

future citizens of Singapore must learn educational

languages,  they must therefore have an  extra  day

for lessons.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I know it is a very difficult

matter  to  draw  a line somewhere.  But  the  hon.

Member has mentioned that there is a Commission  of

Inquiry, and he is now urging whether or not  there

should  be  a  five-day week as against  a  six-day

week. I would suggest that details of that nature



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>



could  best  be  argued before  the  Commission  of

Inquiry  itself, and we should concentrate  on  the

principle behind the motion, that is, as an interim

measure, there should be some relaxation of the six-day week.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I was trying to bring out

the  point  that a relaxation of the  six-day  week

would  not affect any purpose which the State might

have  for having the six-day week, because the six-day  week has produced no better results than those

attained  in  the Federation. In case they  have  a

fear  that by relaxing the six-day week they  might

be  going against whatever might be recommended  in

future,  my  point is that there  will  be  no  ill

effects,   as  shown  by  what  happened   in   the

Federation.  In fact, the Cambridge  Higher  School

Certificate results showed that the students in the

Federation   did  better  than  our   students   in

Singapore. This is very strange, because usually in

previous  years  our students did better  than  the

Federation   students   in   the   Higher    School

Certificate  Examination! So,  apparently,  judging

form  the  results of the Higher School Certificate

Examination - I  say  the Higher  School  Certificate

Examination; we do not know whether the  Federation

students   did  better  in  the  Senior   Cambridge

Examination - the Federation students are  definitely

better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, heads of schools have been telling me all

these months that the children are showing signs of

strain.  They  feel  that the  work  has  become  a

drudgery. That is bad because we want the  children

in  school to acquire a thirst for knowledge.  That

is  fundamental.  Once they acquire  a  thirst  for

knowledge,  we can leave it to them  to  spend  six

days   or  seven  days  a  week  to  acquire   more

knowledge. But when the thirst is not there because

of something compulsory -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It is up to the teachers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> - then, Sir, it is human

nature that when we are compelled to do a thing, we

do not like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



doing  it. But when it is optional, we enjoy  doing

it.  On  the  question of acquiring  a  thirst  for

knowledge,  if  we give somebody a  little  bit  of

water  to  drink but it does not quite  quench  his

thirst, he wants more. But if we give him too  much

water,  he  does not want any more. If we  keep  on

compelling  him  to drink water,  then  that  water

becomes  something which he will need only when  he

reacquires a thirst for it. That is the comparison.

As  an  educationist, I found that it  worked  that

way.  Where  there  is  less  compulsion  and  more

incentive, so that there is a thirst on the part of

the  students to acquire knowledge for  themselves,

we  find  that they make quicker progress.  Let  us

remember  that we old people are human  beings  and

that  beyond  a  certain  point  we  cannot  absorb

whatever  we  hear.  We can only  absorb  up  to  a

certain point, and beyond that point we find  empty

seats in the Assembly. I am sure that if the chance

is  given to the school children, the teacher  will

say,  "All  right, we will not make it  compulsory.

You  go  by your judgment. If beyond the  point  of

absorption, you cannot understand what  I  have  to

say,  you can go." Well, we can see the same  thing

happening -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I ought to correct

what  perhaps might be a misunderstanding. The hon.

Member has said he sees empty seats. I just want to

say that the seats he sees empty do not include the

Speaker's seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I must say here that we

have admired your powers of endurance. I think  you

are exempted from this particular comparison.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the school term will be ending at the end of

this  month.  The Interim Report may not  be  ready

when  the  schools reopen for the second  term  and

naturally  the Minister may say, "Well, why  should

we  relax  earlier? Let the thing be done when  the

Interim Report comes to hand." But when people  are

feeling depressed, surely the Minister can show his

goodwill by relaxing the six-day week right away or

by  making an announcement that it will be  relaxed

pending the Report of the Commission



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>



of  Inquiry,  thereby giving the  children  a  more

enjoyable vacation. Sir, we all know that  goodwill

counts   a   great  deal.  We  have  talked   about

industrial unrest, if we have more goodwill between

employees and employers, there will not be so  much

tension and strife. I am sure, Sir, that it is  not

too  late  yet  for the Minister to take  out  this

particular thing that he has put into cold storage,

warm  it  up and make the announcement, because  he

may  expect the Commission of Inquiry to put up the

Report during the holidays. Well, I hope so. But we

know  that the members of the Commission  are  busy

men and if they are sincere and conscientious about

their  work,  they may want to hear  the  views  of

parents, school people, and so on; and all this may

take  some  time.  When a problem is  difficult  to

solve,  we  often say, "Right, we go  back  to  the

status  quo ante." The status quo ante would  be  a

compulsory five-day week with the sixth day at  the

discretion of the heads of schools depending on the

problems  which  each head encounters  in  his  own

locality  and  among  his  own  students.  In  some

schools,  they had the 5�-day week; in the  case

of the Chinese-medium schools, they had the 5�-day  week with work that was comparatively  lighter

than  what  they  have now. The announcement  would

make  them  feel  ready for any  Report  which  the

Commission of Inquiry might decide to put up. There

would  be  this early relaxation that prepares  the

ground  for  something new and I am  sure  that  it

would  be a good move on the part of the Government

to  do this, because they would not be showing that

they are stubborn and that they are not prepared to

be  persuaded  by the Opposition. We feel  that  if

good sense comes from the Opposition the Government

should  welcome that. I think that is on the  basis

that  there  is  no  monopoly of wisdom.  Sometimes

wisdom  comes  from  one side  and  sometimes  from

another.  In  this  particular case,  however,  the

circumstances  are so clear that  people  expect  a

revision  and, of course, the final revision  would

be made no doubt when the Report comes to hand from

the  Commission  of Inquiry. But  in  the  meantime

before the vacation begins, if an announcement is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



made  that the six-day school week would be relaxed

as  from  the beginning of the second term  pending

receipt of the Report of the Commission of Inquiry.

I should think it would change the atmosphere among

the  children  and among those connected  with  the

education of the children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some parents say they have very little time

with  their school children at home because  it  is

study,  study, study all the time. We believe  that

the children who study too much are missing a great

deal  during their childhood. They should have time

to play and go on excursions. The present full six-day week really needs to be relaxed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister may have some of his own ideas about relaxing the six-day week so that the extra- curricula activities could be done on Saturday, but on inquiries made, I find that the relaxation would really mean work for many people and that the voluntary activities would no longer be voluntary and may be objectionable. So really the best way would be to leave it on the basis of the status quo

ante to the heads of schools to modify arrangements

according to the needs of the school children in  a

particular  area  so  that the  school  head  could

really  do things the right way for the convenience

and the benefit of the children and those connected

with a particular school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>7.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  taking  the advice of the Member for  Tanglin

about  the  limitation of human endurance,  I  will

only say a few words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, right from the beginning, objected to

the  six-day  week. The Member for Tanglin  and  I,

having  had  experience as teachers and principals,

know  that it is a strain on the children. But that

was  at a time when the Government looked upon  the

Opposition as dead ducks and gunny sacks. So we got

no  further. But today, we hope that the Government

will give some consideration to our proposal. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>



hope that they will turn a more human ear to it.  I

am  quite  aware  that there  is  a  Commission  of

Inquiry.   But  we  do  not  know  how  long   this

Commission will take over its Report and no  matter

how  right the Government is in other things, there

is  always the possibility that the policy  of  the

six-day week may be wrong. We have seen articles in

the  Press  from protesting parents. The  Singapore

Teachers'  Union  who  are  experts  in  children's

education  have  protested to the Government  about

the  ill-effects to children and teachers of a six-day week. It is not fair to say, "Well, it has gone

on  for over two years; so the Commission will  not

take  more than a few months. Why can we not go  on

for  a  few  months more?" If we are  to  give  any

credit  to the parents who wrote to the papers  and

who  should  know about their children and  to  the

Singapore Teachers' Union, a group of teachers  who

should  know  about  school children,  and  if  the

Minister  is to lend a human ear to two Members  of

the  Opposition  who  have had  over  30  years  of

experience of teaching school children, I think  he

should  give some consideration to this appeal.  At

least,  let the people who have suffered  for  2�

years  relax now, let them go back to the  five-day

week  pending  the  Report  of  the  Commission  of

Inquiry  so that they would not have to suffer  any

more.  Sir,  civic  and social  activities  may  be

deemed to be very light and frivolous, but they are

not.  They  are  essential to the  pattern  of  any

civilised  life.  May  I tell the  Government  that

organisations have found it very difficult  to  get

teachers together on any occasion at all? They used

to resort to Saturdays - Sundays being unsuitable for

religious reasons - to get these people together  for

charity  work,  civic work and  social  activities.

They  find  it is impossible now to bring  together

the  two  batches of teachers who have  now  become

strangers.  There is no possibility of the  morning

school   teachers  meeting  the  afternoon   school

teachers  on any occasion at all because they  work

on all the six days.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the longer the drift away from the civic and

social    life   of   the   country,    the    more

detrimental - let me say especially to  teachers  who

are supposed to manage the lives of children - it  is

to  the  morale  of  the  teachers,  and  the  more

unhealthy  the  atmosphere of  the  State.  So  the

sooner  this is put to a stop, the better.  If  the

Commission  does  find that  the  six-day  week  is

better,  then I do not think any harm at all  would

have been caused by this relaxation to the five-day

week  in  the interim. It was pointed  out  by  the

Member  for Tanglin that even the adults could  not

stand  the strain. So the Government has  to  relax

it.  Is  it  because the children could  stand  the

strain  that  the Government could not  relax?  No,

Sir. It was because the children had no choice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  motion before us is not to debate the question

of  the  six-day week or the five-day week  in  the

English schools. It is to debate whether we  should

wait  for a few more months for the Report  of  the

Commission of Inquiry into Education which has been

appointed  by the Government, or whether we  should

revert  back from the present six-day week  to  the

five-day  week  in the English schools  before  the

Report is published.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the dispute is only on the

matter  of a few months by which time we  hope  the

Report will come out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, most teachers and students do not favour the

six-day  week  in  the  English  schools  and   the

teachers have reported that the students have  lost

efficiency  as  a consequence. On the  other  hand,

there  are people who are for the six-day week  and

they  argue that the parents prefer a six-day  week

to the five-day week because in the Chinese schools

the  six-day week which has been established a long

time  ago  has been going on well with the  Chinese

students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a very controversial

issue.  Since  a  Commission of  Inquiry  has  been

appointed   and  many  persons  better  versed   in

education  will appear before it, we should  decide

whether or not there should be a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



revision of the present six-day week in the English

schools  when  the  Report  of  the  Commission  of

Inquiry is published.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not an

educational  expert  but  I  am  a  father  of  two

children, one of whom is now in a secondary  school

and the other is still in a primary school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim says that this is a

matter  of  some  intricacy for the  Commission  to

decide  and  that  therefore we  should  await  the

decision  of  the Commission. I think the  Minister

for  Education will agree with me - I have  time  and

again mentioned this matter in the House and I have

told  the Minister - that so far as I am concerned  I

see  no  case absolutely whatsoever for  a  six-day

week in the primary schools. But I have conceded to

the Minister for Education that in view of the four-language  stream and the emphasis on languages  and

science, there may be a case for a six-day week  in

the  secondary schools. I have an open mind on that

and  I  await  the  Report of the  Commission  with

interest.  But insofar as the primary  schools  are

concerned,  I can see no case for it whatsoever.  I

wait  to be convinced that a child of six that goes

to  Primary I needs a six-day week. Sir, I  am  not

competent to judge Chinese education. Its  problems

may  be  different. But I know the  English  stream

because I was in it myself and my children  are  in

the  English  stream.  It  is  very  difficult   to

convince  me  that a child of six needs  a  six-day

week and a child of seven in Primary II needs a six-day  week. I am quite satisfied in my own mind that

there  is absolutely no case whatsoever for a  six-day  week in the primary schools; not only from the

children's point of view but also from the parents'

point of view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now education, to my mind, is not merely a

question of going to school, reading as many  books

as  you  can and cramming as much knowledge as  you

can. I think in the society which we are trying  to

build  up for ourselves, schools are important;  of

course, they have a place - a very great place. But I

think  what we tend to forget is that the child  in

the home and the training that it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



receives in the home is what will ultimately fit it

to  be a good member of society. There is a lot  of

juvenile  delinquency in Singapore. I think  if  we

ask   any  social  worker  why  there  is  juvenile

delinquency he will tell you that it is because the

child has no family background. It does not receive

the  love  of  its  mother or its father  for  some

reason or the other.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have suggested to the

Member  for Tanglin - of course I have not  overruled

these  sentiments as being out of order - that  these

arguments  could well be advanced in the Commission

of  Inquiry. I should imagine that the issue  today

would be: should there be relaxation now before the

Commission of Inquiry gives its findings or  should

we wait?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the point I was

trying  to make is that from my personal  point  of

view there is a case for the relaxation of the six-day week for the primary schools at the moment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we also

welcome this motion and we agree that relaxation is

necessary  at the present stage. We all  know  that

the  present Commission of Inquiry has been set  up

just  because  this  motion has  been  tabled.  The

Inquiry  will help the Government to solve some  of

their  problems and perhaps take away sonic of  the

fireworks from this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not disagree with the principle of a

six-day week. But as with so many other things with

the P.A.P. at the present moment, the principle has

been  distorted into something which is vulgar - just

like on the question of merger and Malaysia, and in

so many other -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Let us not go into

irrelevancies in this particular motion and start a

battle  between the right and the left. By  that  1

mean the right and the left sides of the Chamber. I

suggest, let us make a decision on whether  or  not

there should be relaxation now or whether we should

wait  until  the  Commission of Inquiry  gives  its

findings.  Let  us  not complicate  the  issue,  if

possible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> There have undoubtedly been

complaints  from many parents that  their  children

have not been able to do the things they used to do

before  and  that  there has been a  slackening  of

extramural  activities. By this, I do not  mean  to

bring  up  any controversial discussion as  regards

the  causation  or  effects of  the  six-day  week,

because, as you say, these can be dealt with by the

Commission  of Inquiry. But this six-day  week  has

been going on for the last 2� years. Looking at  it

from any angle it has proved to be a failure. Since

the  Government  have been talking  so  much  about

looking after the interests of the people, let them

on  this occasion prove that they are going to look

after  the  interests of the children,  admit  that

they have made mistakes, be honest and rectify  the

mistakes as soon as they can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the argument put forward by the

Member  for  Tanglin that it would be a good  thing

for the children to enjoy the holidays now that the

term is about to come to a close. But there is  one

factor which the Commission of Inquiry may not look

into,  namely, that the effects this  six-day  week

has  caused on the children have been due to a very

great  extent,  to the high-handed manner  and  the

arrogance of the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot see how that is

relevant to this motion. I do not think we ought to

prejudge  what  the  Commission of  Inquiry  itself

would be asked to judge. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I know that it is very

difficult  to  say what the Commission  of  Inquiry

will  judge on this issue. But as I say, this is  a

point  which is very unlikely to be looked into  by

the  Commission  of Inquiry. However,  I  will  not

dwell  on  it.  But let us ask the P.A.P. on  this

occasion to think of the interests of the children.

If  the children themselves and the parents are all

asking  for a relaxation of the six-day  week,  let

the  P.A.P. try and accommodate the views  and  the

wishes  of  the  children and the parents  on  this

matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This six-day week has become a farce because most

of  the  children and the teachers regard it  as  a

mere  waste of time. It does not contribute to  the

improvement    of   the   children's    educational

standards.  In  fact, it puts more  strain  on  the

pocket  of parents in some cases, as well  as  more

strain on the physical health of the children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we hope that the P.A.P. will at least give way

on  this particular occasion especially when  there

are rumours that the Government has already decided

to   convert  this  six-day  week  as  a  sort   of

compromise  to save their own faces  into  a  5�-day

week.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the six-day week was

imposed  upon the teachers in the typical  attitude

of arrogance -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am not allowing this type

of debate on this particular motion. I have already

pulled up the Member for Queenstown. The motion  is

quite  a  simple motion. It asks this  Assembly  to

hold  the  opinion that in the interests of, young

school children Government should not further delay

the  relaxation  of the six-day  week  pending  the

implementation  of  the  recommendations   of   the

Commission of Inquiry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should imagine that the only issue here is that

the  Assembly  is asked to decide  whether  or  not

there should be relaxation now or whether we should

wait  for the implementation of the recommendations

of  the Commission of Inquiry. I do not think it is

proper for Members to anticipate how the Commission

of  Inquiry  will view the six-day week.  What  the

Member  for  Thomson and the Member for  Queenstown

wish  to  say,  they can very well say  before  the

Commission of Inquiry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, what I do want to say on this

motion  is that while we ask for the relaxation  of

the  six-day week, we must, I believe, be aware  of

the  reasons  why  we think this relaxation  should

take place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the motion is worded in such a way

as  to  say that this relaxation should be done  in

the interests of young



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



school children it is nevertheless important to see

what  effects  the  six-day week  has  had  on  the

teachers,  because I believe the  attitude  of  the

teachers is significant as it would inevitably have

an effect on the children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the six-day week for English schools is an

idea   which   we  in  the  Barisan  Sosialis   had

supported. It had as its objective the increase  of

teaching  hours  in science and language  subjects.

This  is a praiseworthy idea and we are not ashamed

to  say  that we supported it. And I have no  doubt

whatsoever that the majority of the English  school

teachers  would  have  accepted  it  had  it   been

introduced  and conducted in a proper manner.  Sir,

instead of consulting the Singapore -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I bring the Member back to the

issue,  which  is  whether or not there  should  be

relaxation  now or whether we should wait  for  the

findings  of the Commission of Inquiry? But,  as  I

say,  all these remarks would be appropriate before

the Commission of Inquiry, because this Assembly is

not a Commission of Inquiry and it is not asked  to

decide whether there should be a six-day week or  a

five-day  week.  It is merely being  asked,  as  an

interim measure: will the Government relax the six-day week?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, briefly I just wish to say this:

the  original idea of introducing the six-day week,

as  I  have  said, was to increase  the  number  of

teaching   hours  in  the  language   and   science

subjects. It has been proved in practice  that,  in

fact,  there  has been no increase in the  teaching

hours of these two subjects. And I think it is well

known to many of us that in schools when there  are

language   periods,   no  language   teachers   are

available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the primary objective of having

introduced the six-day week has not been  achieved,

I think it is only proper that immediate relaxation

takes  place. And if I may be allowed to say  this:

all  that has happened is a stretching of the five-day  week time-table to a six-day week. That is  in

addition  to what I have earlier said. If  this  is

all that the six-day week



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>



means,  then I say, Sir, we in the Barisan Sosialis

ask  the  Government  to  relax  the  six-day  week

immediately. In fact, it has been long overdue.  It

is somewhat difficult for us to say more because of

the  Commission which has been set  up  to  inquire

into  the education system, but perhaps I can  only

say  that  we hope that the Commission  would  make

recommendations that are in the best  interests  of

our children.



<br><br>7.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, as stated by the Member for Tanglin,

some  four  months  ago, I had to  answer  an  Oral

Question from him in which he inquired whether  the

Minister  for Education - I am quoting from  Hansard,

Vol. 15, No. 3, dated 17th November, 1961, Question

No.   33,  in  which  he  asked  the  Minister  for

Education:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'if he will appoint an independent Committee of

Inquiry  to  investigate into  the  effects,, both

direct and indirect, of the compulsory full six-day

week in Singapore's primary schools, especially  in

regard to the welfare of these school children, and

to  make  recommendations for  its  continuance  or

discontinuance with effect from January, 1962.'



<br><br>My reply was that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Ministry of Education is at present in the

midst of discussions with the Malay Teachers'

Union, the Chinese Middle School Teachers'

Association, and the Singapore Teachers' Union for

a revised version of the six-day week for 1962.

Arising out of these discussions, the question

whether or not to appoint a Committee of Inquiry or

aa Commission of Inquiry will be decided.'



<br><br>On 21st December, 1961, with the tabling of a motion by the

Member for Anson, supported by the Member for Joo

Chiat, for a Commission of inquiry into the

Educational Policy of the Government which I

accepted, I did at the same time mention that I

would put into cold storage the proposal to bring

about a relaxed version of the six-day week for

1962. It was, therefore, three months ago when I

gave notice that the proposal would be put into

cold storage. And now when the Commission of In

quiry has actually been formed with a directive

that it should produce an Interim Report on the

six-day week



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



itself,  I  am  quite puzzled why  the  Member  for

Tanglin  now supports the course adopted by Members

of  the Barisan Sosialis. They accepted the six-day

week  in  principle but when it came into  practice

they said that it is a matter of urgency that there

should be relaxation. Surely after having taken  so

much  time to get members to sit on this Commission

of  Inquiry, which in my view would take  at  least

six  months to look into the educational  structure

of  Singapore - a complicated system of four language

streams - and having stressed to this Commission  the

need  to  produce an Interim Report on the  six-day

week,  we  should not prejudge the issue by  either

relaxing  or  going back to the five-day  week.  In

fact, Sir, I have been given to understand that the

Commission of Inquiry met for the first time  today

to  plan  out  how  they should  proceed  with  the

Inquiry. So I must say that, in my view and in  the

view  of  the Government, there is no necessity  to

make any changes and we should leave it in the good

hands of this independent Commission of Inquiry  to

make suitable recommendations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might add that it is rather fortunate that

today I received a 1962 publication by U.N.E.S.C.O.

on  the organisation of the schools here, and  this

is   a  comparative  study  of  a  survey  made  by

U.N.E.S.C.O. which  covered  81  member   States -Singapore  is  an  associate  member,  not  a  full

member - of U.N.E.S.C.O. There were 52 replies and it

might interest hon. Members of this House, who talk

of the five-day week as though it is the only ideal

system  for schools that is known to Singapore  and

Malaya, that  according to this survey  there  are

more countries in the world which adopt the six-day

week  than the five-day week. It is true  that  the

five-day  week  is  customary  in  English-speaking

countries,  and  I  quote  from  page  6   of   the

U.N.E.S.C.O. publication that for primary  schools

there  are 25 countries which have a six-day  week,

five   countries  with  a  5�-day  week,  and   the

remaining  other countries with either  a  five-day

week or even a four-day week. And



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>



for  secondary schools, 31 countries have a six-day

week,  and three countries with a 5�-day week.  The

countries  in  Asia which have a six-day  week  are

China  (that  would, of course,  include  Communist

China  and  Formosa), India, Japan and  Korea,  and

although   Malaya  did  not  send  in  returns   to

U.N.E.S.C.O. they did send Malay Education Advisory

Council  members  to  Indonesia  in  1960;  and  in

Indonesia they also have a six-day week. There  are

numerous  countries in Europe which adopt the  six-day  week. I will just mention a few, Sir: Austria,

Bulgaria,    Czechoslovakia,   Denmark,    Finland,

Germany,  Greece, Hungary, Italy,  Luxembourg,  the

Netherlands,   Norway,  Poland,  Rumania,   Sweden,

Switzerland,  Yugoslavia,  the  U.S.S.R.,   Africa,

Libya  and the Arab Republic. So I think it  should

be  quite  clear  that  the  six-day  week  is  not

something  novel  or  unusual  because   right   in

Singapore itself -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would suggest to the

Minister that if he goes on in that strain he  will

excite a debate on whether or not there should be a

six-day  week or a five-day week. I have  indicated

that  that  is  an  issue  for  the  Commission  of

Inquiry.  The issue before us is: should  there  or

should there not be relaxation now?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall

therefore   conclude  by  saying  that  since   the

Commission or Inquiry have already started to  sit,

let us allow them to get on with their task and  we

should   be  patient  enough  to  wait:   for   the

recommendations which they shall be putting forward

and which we shall table before this House.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

principle of relaxation of the present six-day week

is  not  in  dispute.  The Minister  for  Education

himself  has  said that in November he was  already

contemplating  the  introduction   of   a   revised

version,  beginning  from  January  1962.  So   the

principle was accepted, might I say, Sir,  by  both

sides  of the House. Now, if the principle was  not

in dispute then, it cannot be in dispute today. And

as it is not in dispute,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



why wait? If the principle was accepted then and it

is  also  accepted  now,  why  wait?  That  is  the

question to be answered - why wait? If the Commission

of  Inquiry has been appointed, still it  does  not

mean  that we should wait. The relaxation can still

be introduced.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b>

You are prejudging the issue.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> It is not a case of prejudging

the  issue. When two parties are at war,  Sir,  and

there is a Boundary Commission appointed, then  the

forces  go  back to the status quo ante.  Then,  of

course, the Boundary Commission will decide on what

is the proper boundary line. That is the point I am

trying  to make, Sir,If the principle was  not  in

dispute  before and it is not in dispute  now,  why

dig  your  toes  in  and say, "We  will  not  budge

because  of this and because of that." That  is  my

reply, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has often been an implied inference

that  the  Member for Tanglin knows  nothing  about

Chinese medium schools. Sir, I have not brought  up

here  these  two  facts: I was in a Chinese  medium

school  for  l�  years and I taught  English  as  a

subject  in  Tao Nan School which is  a  well-known

Chinese  medium  school  in  Singapore.  I   taught

English as a subject in Tao Nan School for 1� years

and  the  5�-day  week  carried  a  load  that  was

equivalent  to a five-day regimented week.  If  you

ask the Chinese students themselves, Sir, they will

say  that  the six-day week today is equivalent  in

load  to  a  seven-day week before. That being  the

case,  there  is  nothing complicated  at  all.  In

principle,   relaxation  is   accepted.   Why   not

introduce it now?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion accordingly negatived.

Legislature  of  51 Members, particularly  when  we

have two Members of the Opposition who are on their

own,  sometimes it might be difficult for  them  to

move motions, when they cannot get a supporter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, sometimes there are political

matters which the Member for Anson, who is alone in

this  House,  or the Member for Joo Chiat,  who  is

also alone in this House, may wish to bring up; and

in  the  interest of parliamentary democracy,  they

should  not be deprived of the opportunity to  move

motions  in  this House. Therefore, we  are  moving

this  motion to enable the Member for Anson  alone,

or  the Member for Joo Chiat alone, to move motions

in this House.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The motion stands referred to the

Standing  Orders Committee under the provisions  of

the Standing Order.
