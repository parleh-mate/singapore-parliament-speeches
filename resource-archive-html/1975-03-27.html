<div align="center"><b>INSPECTIONS ON REGISTERED FACTORIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ivan Baptist</b> asked the Minister for Labour

(a)  how  many inspections were made on registered

factories  by  (i)  the Factory Inspectorate;  and

(ii) the Industrial Health Unit, in 1974; and (b)

of those inspections (i) how many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>



arose   from  complaints  received  from  workers,

unions  and  others;  and  (iii)  how  many   were

unannounced or surprise inspections.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui) (for the Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1974 the Factory Inspectorate

of   the   Ministry  made  5,915  inspections   on

registered  factories.  If  the  figure  were   to

include  those made to factory premises  prior  to

their  registration, then the figure is 6,189.  Of

these, 411 visits were made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>



as  a result of complaints received by the Factory

Inspectorate from workers, persons living close to

factories and members of the public. The  majority

of   the  complaints  were  about  noise  and  air

pollution from factories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is not the practice for Factory Inspectors

to make appointments with factory occupiers before

they   inspect  their  factories,  most   of   the

inspection  visits made last year were unannounced

or  surprise  visits.  The  Factory  Inspectorate,

however,  does  not  keep separate  statistics  on

unannounced or surprise inspections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Industrial Health Unit is concerned, it

made  1,000  inspections in 1974.  Of  these,  160

inspections   were   made   in   connection   with

complaints. A total of 55 complaints were received

in  1974; 20 (or 36%) were from workers and unions

and  35  (or 64%) were from neighbouring residents

and anonymous callers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 1,000 inspections made last year, about

80%  were  made  without  prior  notice  given  to

factory occupiers. However, the remaining 20% were

announced  visits as arrangements had to  be  made

with  the  management  for  a  suitably  qualified

person  to  be  present  to  clarify  details   of

processes operating in the factory.

made  by  his Ministry under the Food Regulations.

1974  since  the  Regulations  were  brought  into

operation;  and  (b)  how many infringements  have

been  detected  and  what action  has  been  taken

operation on 1st May, 1974. These Regulations were

made  under the Sale of Food Act, which came  into

operation  in  May,  1973. The  Food  Regulations,

1974, govern the standards of the food sold in

<br><br>2.38 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Second Reading of the Parliamentary

Pensions  (Amendment) Bill be taken  after  a  few

other  items  on the Order Paper have  been  dealt

with." - [Mr E. W. Barker].



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>LOCAL GOVERNMENT INTEGRATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the provisions of the

Local  Government Integration Act (Chapter 210  of

the   Revised  Edition)  which  deals   with   the

construction,  widening and repair of  public  and

private  streets and back-lanes. In  view  of  the

massive  urban  renewal programme  that  is  being

carried  out  to  the  city and  the  Government's

desire  to  further  implement  the  Garden   City

concept,  it  has  been found  necessary  to  make

certain   amendments  to  the   Local   Government

Integration Act to empower the Director of  Public

Works to achieve this objective more readily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now draw Members' attention to the more

significant clauses of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 seeks to add a new section 16A to the

Act to facilitate the vesting in the Government of

lands  which have been set aside as road  reserves

pursuant to development proposals approved by  the

competent  authority under the Planning  Act.  All

these  road  reserves will eventually be  made  up

into  new  or  enlarged  public  streets.  It   is

customary  for  the owners of lands  to  agree  to

surrender part of their lands for road reserves to

the Government without charge in consideration  of

the approval given for their development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>

plans.  The  new section 16A will facilitate  the

vesting in the Government of such lands which have

been set aside as road reserves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 seeks to amend section 18 of the Act to

empower  the Government to require a developer  or

owner  of a property constructing a new street  to

make provision for the planting of trees along the

new  street. Section 18 of the Act is also amended

to  require  any person erecting any  building  or

planting of any hedge within any land set aside as

a  road reserve to seek the prior approval of  the

Director of Public Works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 seeks to amend section 28 of the Act,

which  empowers  the Director of Public  Works  to

acquire  premises for the widening of streets,  to

provide that no compensation shall be payable  for

the  acquisition of any premises for the  purposes

of  street-making when the premises are within the

street   reserves  set  aside  pursuant   to   any

development  proposal approved  by  the  competent

authority.  Since  the owner of the  premises  has

agreed to surrender the land free of charge to the

Government, the Government should not pay for  the

building standing on the premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 seeks to amend section 58 of the Act to

enable  the Director of Public Works to  construct

back-lanes  and to recover the cost  thereof  from

the  owners  of  properties fronting  these  back-lanes.  Under the existing provision the  cost  of

constructing   back-lanes   is   borne   by    the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 seeks to amend section 102 of the Act

to  empower  the  competent  authority  to  impose

interest  charges at a rate not exceeding  6%  per

annum for late payments levied under the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Mr E. W. Barker].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>APPORTIONMENT OF RENTS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, quit rents are payable to the Government in

respect  of lands held under State leases as  well

as  Statutory  Land  Grants which  are  grants  in

perpetuity  issued under the State Lands  Act.  In

the  case  of land held under a State  lease,  the

owner   may   make   an  application   under   the

Apportionment  of  Rents Act for apportionment  of

the  rent  payable in respect of the  land,  where

there  has  been a subdivision. The Act does  not,

however, make it mandatory for the owner  to  make

an application for apportionment and often no such

application is made. In such a case, the Collector

of  Land Revenue can only apportion the rent  when

the subdivision of the land subsequently comes  to

his knowledge. This procedure has been found to be

unsatisfactory and entails delay in  apportionment

of the rent. Moreover, land held under a Statutory

Land  Grant  does not at present fall  within  the

ambit  of  the  Apportionment  of  Rents  Act.  An

apportionment  of the rent payable in  respect  of

such land is done administratively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before this House will make it

mandatory for the owner of land held either  on  a

State  lease or a Statutory Land Grant  to  inform

the  Collector  of Land Revenue  of  any  approved

subdivision of his land by the Competent Authority

under  the Planning Act, so that the apportionment

of  the  rent  may be appropriately  made  without

delay. Under the Bill a penalty not exceeding $500

will  be  imposed  for  non-compliance  with  this

requirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to request the

Minister  to  explain  to this  House  why  it  is

necessary to make it obligatory



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>



for  a  landowner to inform the Collector of  Land

Revenue of any approved subdivision. Why not  make

it obligatory for the relevant authority to inform

the  Collector of Land Revenue of the  subdivision

when  approving the application? I can  understand

the  situation where if a landowner subdivides his

land  without Government approval, then it is fair

that he must inform the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it rather difficult to perceive in this

particular situation where the Government approves

an  application  for  land  subdivision  and  then

requires  the  landowner to inform the  Government

that  his  application has been  approved  by  the

Government. I would have thought that  this  is  a

simple inter-departmental communication - one  arm

of  the  Government telling the other arm what  is

happening.  Why  rely  on the  people  to  do  the

transmission  work  and  then  penalise  them   on

default?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, sometimes, as the Member has pointed out in

the  Budget debate, one Government department does

not  inform the other department. It usually does,

but  sometimes  one  does not catch  up  with  the

other. Therefore, the object of the Bill is to put

the burden on the applicant, whose application for

subdivision  has  been approved,  to  in-form  the

relevant  department  so that  the  Collector  may

apportion the rent. The penalty provided is really

not excessive for non-compliance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Sir, first of all, may I say that I fully support

this   amendment  Bill.  I  would  like  to   seek

clarification from the Minister. 1  note  that  in

the  Explanatory Statement to the Bill  a  penalty

not  exceeding  $500  will  be  imposed  for  non-compliance with this new requirement. I think this

penalty  is  far  too small a  sum  to  impose.  I

believe that during the property boom land  prices

soared up to incredible levels. As a result, quite

a number of landowners put up subdivisions of land

for  eventual sale. If that is the case, then  the

penalty on them must be heavy enough to deter them

from  taking the law into their own hands. I  hope

the Minister would care to clarify this point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, there is nothing to clarify. This is a new

amendment and, in the light of what the Member for

Kim  Keat has stated, I would prefer to leave  the

maximum  penalty at $500 rather than to  impose  a

punishment which might be too punitive.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister said that the

purpose of the Bill is to enable the Collector  of

Land  Revenue to apportion the rent. I am  of  the

view  that  it is rather premature to  inform  the

Collector  within  one  month  from  the  date  of

obtaining   approval  of  subdivision   from   the

relevant  authority, as the land  would  still  be

under the same ownership at that stage. Therefore,

the  question  of apportionment of rent  does  not

arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, the owner of the land may decide not to

proceed  further  with  the  subdivision.  He  may

decide  not  to  obtain separate  titles  for  the

subdivided  plot  through the  Registrar  of  Land

Titles  and Deeds. The apportionment of rent  will

only  be  effected when separate  titles  for  the

approved  subdivided plots are issued.  Would  the

Minister  not  agree then that it  would  be  more

appropriate for the Collector of Land  Revenue  to

be  informed at that stage in order to enable  him

to apportion the rent?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> No, Sir. The lessee or grantee is asked, after he

has obtained written permission from the competent

authority to subdivide his land, to inform or make

a  notification to the Collector in writing within

one month from the date of approval. If he changes

his  mind,  he  can  always inform  the  Collector

again.   But  the  important  date  is  when   the

subdivision has taken place. Conveyance  might  be

done later. 1 think one month should be ample time

for the purposes of this Bill. In any event should

the  Member  be  proved right, and  if  there  are

teething  troubles with this Bill, we will  extend

this period.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the Minister for his

explanation. If the Bill must be passed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>



today  as it stands, and I believe it is going  to

be  passed, may I make an appeal on behalf of  the

ordinary  citizen? We know that ordinary  citizens

are  not conversant with the numerous legislations

that  exist and are usually unaware of the  hidden

rules  and  regulations which are introduced  from

time  to  time as amendments are made to  this  or

that  Act.  May I request the Minister, therefore,

to  assure  the  House that he will  instruct  the

relevant authority, when approving any subdivision

of land, to advise the landowner of his obligation

to  inform the Collector of Land Revenue  of  such

approval  within  one  month  from  the  date   of

granting of the written permission.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Yes, Sir, we will do that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.

<div align="center"><b>HIRE-PURCHASE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal amendments that are proposed in the

Bill appear in clauses 2 and 8 and are designed to

confer  some  measure of protection  upon  finance

companies  which  are  owners  of  motor  vehicles

subject  to  hire  purchase agreements  and  which

suffer  loss due to acts or omissions on the  part

of  the  hirers  of  such  motor  vehicles.  These

amendments, if passed, will in no way detract from

the  paramount policy of the principal Act,  which

is to safeguard the interests of hirers under hire

purchase  agreements, as part of the larger  field

of consumer protection. They will, however, ensure

that hirers will be less likely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>



to  abuse their rights under the agreements to the

disadvantage of the lawful owners of  these  motor

vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 which amends section 26 of the Act makes

it  mandatory for a hirer to inform the  owner  of

the  vehicle  (the finance company) in  the  event

that he changes his registered insurer during  the

period  of  the  hire-purchase agreement.  In  the

past,  the new registered insurer, not being aware

of  the  interest  in  the motor  vehicle  of  the

finance  company,  have, in some instances,  where

there  has been a claim on a total loss  basis  by

the  insured hirer, made payments on a total  loss

basis  direct  to the hirer. Although  the  owners

have  a  right at common law to sue the  hirer  in

respect  of  their interest in the motor  vehicle,

this  has  not  been  shown to be  a  satisfactory

remedy,  for  hirers have been known to  disappear

with  the  insurance  monies  received  from   the

insurers.  This amendment, accordingly,  places  a

legal obligation upon the hirer, who by virtue  of

section  26  (1) of the Act alone must choose  his

registered  insurer, to advise  the  owner  if  he

decides to change his insurer. The owner will then

inform  the insurer of his interest in  the  motor

vehicle under the Hire-Purchase agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 33 (c) of the Act in such

a   way  as  to  provide  greater  flexibility  in

adjusting   interest  rates  payable  on   overdue

instalments.  With  the recent  rise  in  interest

rates  in money markets the existing provision  in

this  section  fixing a ceiling of  9%  per  annum

which finance companies may charge is unrealistic,

having  regard to the cost of these  companies  of

borrowing money. It is, therefore, proposed that a

maximum  rate of 12% per annum should be fixed  in

section 33 (c) but at the same time to confer upon

the  Minister power to determine such  lower  rate

from  time to time as he may think fit. This lower

rate,   it   is   envisaged,   should   correspond

approximately  to  prevailing  commercial   rates.

Though interest rates now appear to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>



on  a  downtrend, they are likely to  remain  well

above historical rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other major amendment appears in clause 8

which  amends the Fourth Schedule. The  effect  of

this  amendment will be to reduce  the  number  of

notices to repossess (under section 15 (1) )  that

are  sent  out by finance companies to hirers  who

tend to be continually in default in their payment

of  instalments. Such hirers often find themselves

in  further  arrears  of  instalments  which  have

fallen  due  after  the date of  the  notice.  The

existing  Notice, therefore, fails to reflect  the

true  position of the amount of arrears  that  are

due  up to the time that the finance company takes

action to repossess. The amendment, accordingly is

designed  to  deal with this matter  by  providing

that  the  hirer, in order to avoid  repossession,

must  pay  all  arrears of instalments  that  have

fallen due since the date of the Notice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the amendments proposed in clauses 4, 5,

6  and  7  seek to increase the penalties provided

for in sections 35, 36, 37 and 38 respectively  of

the  Act.  These  penalties, with the  passing  of

time, have become a little unrealistic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been complaints from the public

that  there  are owners of Housing and Development

Board  flats  who acquire and then let  out  other

immovable properties while they are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>



still  staying  in HDB flats. In order  to  ensure

that  the Board's flats are in the hands of  those

people  who  deserve  them  and  to  avoid  longer

frustration  by those on the Board's waiting  list

(at  the  moment there is a waiting list of  about

100,000  applications), this Bill  will  introduce

the following measures:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to make provision for the Board to

compulsorily acquire any HDB flat sold subject  to

the  provisions of Part IV of the Act  in  certain

circumstances which I will refer to shortly;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to prohibit any person from applying for an

HDB  flat  if  he,  his spouse  or  an  authorised

occupier either -   (i) owns or has an interest in

any  other immovable property; or (ii) has, at any

time  within  30 months prior to the date  of  his

making  an  application to the Board  for  an  HDB

flat,  owned  or  had  an interest  in  any  other

immovable property;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to make it an offence for any person to give

false  information in his form of application  for

an HDB flat and to make such an offence punishable

with   a   fine   not  exceeding  $5,000   or   to

imprisonment for a term not exceeding  six  months

or both such fine and imprisonment; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to make unauthorised subletting of an HDB

flat an offence punishable with a similar penalty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will compulsorily acquire any flat sold

subject to the provisions of Part IV of the Act in

any  of  the  circumstances set  out  in  the  new

section 48A to which I will now refer:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) if the owner thereof and his spouse, if any,

has, in the opinion of the Board, ceased to occupy

the HDB flat; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) if the owner thereof, his spouse or any

authorised occupier has acquired any title  to  or

an  estate  or  interest in  any  other  immovable

property; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) if the owner thereof has, in the opinion of

the  Board, used the HDB flat, otherwise than  for

the purpose permitted by the lease; or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) if the owner thereof has permitted any person

other  than  an authorised occupier to  reside  or

stay in the HDB flat; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) if the owner thereof has failed to perform or

observe any condition contained in the lease to be

performed  or  observed on the part of  the  owner

after  a  notice in writing has been sent  by  the

Board drawing his attention to the non-performance

or  non-observance of the condition in  the  lease

and  the Board is of the opinion that he is likely

to  continue to do the same if he should  continue

to own the HDB flat; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) if the owner thereof has made a misleading or

false  statement in his application to  the  Board

for the purchase of the HDB flat; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) if the owner thereof has made a mis-representation of a material fact, whether

innocently or otherwise, in his application to the

Board for the purchase of the HDB flat; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) if the owner thereof assigns, underlets or

parts  with the possession of the HDB flat or  any

part  thereof without obtaining the prior  written

consent of the Board as required by the lease; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) if, in the opinion of the Board, the HDB flat

is  not  being occupied by such minimum number  of

persons as the Board may require; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j) if the owner thereof has ceased to be a

citizen of Singapore; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(k) if the rent or any payments or any part

thereof due to the Board reserved under the  lease

or  mortgage  remains unpaid  for  three  calendar

months  after  they are due and  payable  and  the

Board  has  sent a notice of demand in writing  to

the  owner thereof. Any person who is dissatisfied

with a decision of the Board to acquire a HDB flat

under  section  48A of the Act may appeal  to  the

Minister whose decision thereon will be final.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, apart from these major

amendments to the Housing and Development Act, the

Bill also seeks



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>



to make other amendments which I will now refer to

briefly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to amend section 4 of

the  Act to permit the legal officers of the Board

to  execute certain documents for and on behalf of

the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 seeks to add a new section 27A to the

Act to empower the Board to appoint committees  to

carry out its duties under the Act and to delegate

its powers to such committees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 seeks to amend section 41 of the Act to

empower  the Board to forfeit any monies  paid  to

the  Board  by  an  applicant  who  has  made   an

application to purchase an HDB flat from the Board

in  contravention of the provisions of section  41

of the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 seeks to amend section 42 of the Act to

enable   the  officers  of  the  Board  to  attest

assurances pertaining to flats sold by the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 seeks to repeal and re-enact with

amendments section 45 of the Act to deal with  the

acquisition by the Board of a flat of  a  deceased

owner in the case where no representation has been

taken  out under a will or intestacy of a deceased

owner  of  the flat within twelve months from  the

death of the owner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 seeks to amend section 48 of the Act to

enable the Board to repossess a flat speedily when

it  exercises  its  right of  forfeiture  under  a

lease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 seeks to repeal and reenact sections 55

to  58  of  the  Act  to prescribe  the  financial

procedures to be observed by the Board and to make

provision  for  the  keeping  and  audit  of   the

accounts of the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, whilst I fully support this

Bill, I would like to seek clarification from  the

Minister  with regard to clause 10,  which  is  to

insert a new section 48A (1), paragraph (i), and I

quote:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(i) if, in the opinion of the Board, the flat,

house  or other living accommodation is not  being

occupied by such minimum number of persons as  the

Board may require; or'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it may well be that a flat owner in the

service of a company may be transferred out for an

overseas assignment. It is also possible that  his

family  will  have to go along with him,  and  the

flat  will  be left vacant. If this is  the  case,

will  the Minister consider, in view of the nature

of  work  to  which the flat owner  is  committed,

allowing the owner to continue to own the flat  in

his  name?  I have come across a case which  comes

under  this particular provision as laid  down  in

this proposed new section 48A (1) (i) in clause 10

of the Bill.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, our Government has all along been

advocating  the policy of home ownership  for  the

people  in order to look after their welfare.  The

people  can  thus own their own homes and  have  a

sense  of  security in life. This  amendment  Bill

therefore has come as a surprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain provisions in the Bill are rather vague

and  will  cause concern and confusion  among  the

people.  I  am  referring  particularly   to   the

provisions of clauses 5 and 8 of the Bill which, I

think,  ought to be clarified. Clause  5  provides

that  no  person shall be entitled to purchase  an

HDB  flat  if  he,  his spouse or  any  authorised

occupier,  is  the  owner of any  other  immovable

property.  What will be the position of  a  person

who  owns a shophouse or a nonresidential property

in  the  name  of  a company or  on  behalf  of  a

company, or who jointly owns such property with  a

company?  Will he be entitled to apply to purchase

a  Housing  Board flat? According  to  the  Public

Relations Officer of the HDB, after the  Bill  has

been   passed  the  Housing  Board  will  announce

details  specifying the circumstances under  which

persons  are entitled to purchase flats and  those

who  are not entitled to purchase flats. May I ask

why should the details of these new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>



provisions  be explained to the people  after  the

Bill  has  been passed? Is this not tantamount  to

effecting the law before any prior information has

been  given? The people who suffer will  be  those

who  live  in the HDB flats. They will be  at  the

mercy  of  the Housing Board after due passage  of

the  Bill. Therefore, I hope the Minister will  be

able  to clarify these two vague provisions as  to

which  category of persons possessing which  types

of  property are or are not entitled to  buy  HDB.

flats,  so  as  to  enable us  to  understand  the

intentions  of  this  Bill  and  its  measures  in

detail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another provision in the Bill provides that,

under certain circumstances, the Housing Board can

repossess  a  flat upon the death  of  the  owner,

whether  or  not the owner has left a will.  Again

the  Housing Board officials also said that  after

the Bill has been passed and become law, the Board

will   notify   the   people  concerned   of   the

circumstances under which the flat could be bought

back  by  the  Board upon the death  of  the  flat

owner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister would consider the fact

that  flat owners are not wealthy property owners.

Most  of them are not conversant with the law  and

being in the low-income group they are not able to

take  on any additional burden that is imposed  on

them. The Government should have sympathy for  the

hardship  of  the  people  and  simplify  all  the

necessary procedures. The Government should follow

the  example of the Central Provident  Fund  Board

system  of  authorising  a  nominee  successor  to

administrate the estate, which system is  for  the

convenience of the people and also to reduce their

burden. I hope the Minister can enlighten us  with

a  clarification as well as a direction  on  these

matters.



<br><br>3.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in general support of the

amendment Bill. However,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>



I  feel that clause 5, which prohibits persons who

have  sold property within 30 months prior to date

of  application,  has  the unfortunate  effect  of

penalising widows and orphans who may be forced by

circumstances to sell their homes. Such widows and

orphans  will then be forced to wait six or  seven

years  before getting a flat. I hope the Minister:

will amend this particular clause of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, as I pointed out earlier, the whole purpose

of  this Bill is to ensure that the Board's  flats

remain in the hands of people who deserve them and

to  avoid  frustration  by those  on  the  Board's

waiting  list.  At  the moment, there  are  75,000

applicants  wanting to buy flats and about  25,000

wanting  to rent them. The object of this Bill  is

not to make things worse for widows and orphans or

for the poor people living in HDB flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spelt out earlier in my speech details of

the  circumstances  under which  people  who  have

bought  flats  will lose them.  In  my  view,  the

provisions set out under clauses 5 and 8 are quite

clear.  One  deals  with the  position  where  the

owner,  his  spouse or any authorised occupier  is

the  owner  of any other flat, house, building  or

land or has an estate or interest therein; or has,

at  any time within 30 months immediately prior to

the date of making an application to the Board  to

purchase a flat, sold any flat, house, building or

land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa takes objection to the 30-month condition. It has been the experience of the

Board  that  this period is reasonable enough  for

people  to dispose of their properties, which  may

be  substantial properties, and with the  proceeds

buy a five-room flat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol is worried about people

who have to leave the country after buying a flat.

They  do  not have to give up the flat.  All  they

have to do in such cases is to inform the Board.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other clause which deals with the

position  where  the owner of an  HDB  flat  dies,

either  testate or intestate and his executors  or

administrators do nothing about it for years,  the

purpose  is to give them one year which should  be

enough   time  to  take  out  either  Letters   of

Administration or Probate of the Will so that  the

legal  formalities in respect of the flat  can  be

put right. Otherwise if they do nothing, the Board

cannot do anything. Hence this clause.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In section 14 pensions are withheld completely

for  any  term  of imprisonment for any  crime  or

offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has taken the Government some time to decide

how  to  modify these provisions to apply them  to

Parliamentary   Pensions   under   the   different

circumstances for Members of Parliament, Political

Secretaries, Parliamentary Secretaries,  Ministers

of  State  and  Ministers. The Government  decided

that  to  withhold part of an MP's  or  Minister's

pension   for  any  negligence,  irregularity   or

misconduct  was not practical. It  would  have  to

follow the findings of a disciplinary committee of

fellow-Ministers and MPs. Nor was  it  appropriate

since the careers and responsibilities of MPs  and

Ministers  were  different from  those  of  public

officers. Nor does imprisonment for any  crime  or

offence   unconnected   with   parliamentary    or

ministerial  duties appear valid  ground  for  the

withholding of pension.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there can be no question that if any

Minister,   Minister   of   State,   Parliamentary

Secretary,  Political Secretary  or  MP  has  been

convicted under the Prevention of Corruption  Act,

or  of  any  crime involving corruption under  any

other  written law, even if he has only been fined

and   not  imprisoned,  then  this  warrants   the

withholding  of the pension. The President,  after

consideration of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>



record of the proceedings of the Court, will

decide whether the whole or a part of any pension

should be withheld.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Honourable Member knows that nothing is

more likely to lower standards of integrity in the

conduct of government than to have a member of the

political  leadership setting a bad  example.  All

those   who  hold  office  must  abide  by  strict

standards of public and private conduct. It is not

possible to enforce high standards of integrity in

the  civil  service  if  the political  leadership

tolerates  any corrupt behaviour amongst  its  own

ranks.   An  MP  or  a  Minister  must  take   the

consequences  of  any  corrupt  act.  Losing   his

pension is one of the least of the sanctions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Prime Minister].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are aware of the Government's efforts to make Singapore a garden

city and to provide recreational facilities for

the urban population. For these purposes the

Ministry of Law and National Development set up

the Parks and Recreation Division in the Public

Works Department. The powers which are vested in

the Commissioner for parks and Recreation are at

the moment found in several pieces of legislation,

namely, the Trees and Plants (Preservation and

Improvement of Amenities) Act, 1970, (Act 59 of

1970), the Botanic Gardens



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>



Act   (Chapter  300)  and  Part  V  of  the  Local

Government Integration Act (Chapter 210).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it has been found necessary to amend the

existing  legislation to vest in the  Commissioner

new  powers to enable him to carry out  his  work,

the  opportunity has been taken to revise all  the

various legislation pertaining to parks and trees.

This   Bill,   therefore,  seeks  to   amend   and

consolidate the law which is found in the  various

Acts which I have referred to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main changes which will be made to the

existing legislation are as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A restriction will be imposed on the felling

or cutting of any tree on any vacant land with a

girth exceeding one metre (3 ft. 4 ins.) measured

half a metre (1 ft. 8 ins.) from the ground. Under

the existing provision of section 4 of the Trees

and Plants (Preservation and Improvement of the

Amenities) Act, 1970, this restriction applies to

trees with a girth exceeding five feet, measured

two feet from the ground. Vacant land is defined

in clause 2 of the Bill to refer to land which has

not been developed for residential or industrial

purposes. This change has been proposed after a

study was made by my Ministry's officers of the

sizes of the different types of trees found in

Singapore at their various stages of growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Clause 5 of the Bill introduces a presumption

that where a tree is felled on any vacant land  it

shall  be presumed that it has been felled by  the

owner  or occupier of the land. This provision  is

necessary  in order not to frustrate the  work  of

the Commissioner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) In clause 7 the Commissioner is given the

power to serve a notice on the occupier of any

vacant land or land on which a new street is to be

constructed to require the occupier to  plant

trees. Further, the Commissioner is empowered

under clause 11 to require housing developers to

make a deposit to ensure that trees are planted

and open spaces made up in accordance with the

approved plans and specifications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the

Bill,  the  purpose  of which is  to  promote  the

planting  and protection of trees and  flowers  in

order  to  make Singapore a garden city. Over  the

past few years the Government has observed one day

in the year as the national "Tree Planting Day" to

encourage people to plant more trees and shrubs in

order  to beautify our environment in the  concept

of a Garden City.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the people in my constituency have been

supporting  this  campaign every  year.  On  "Tree

Planting  Day"  hundreds of  people  of  different

races  would turn up voluntarily to take  part  in

tree  planting.  Thus  they have  not  only  shown

enthusiasm  in  their support of the  annual  Tree

Planting  Day, but they have also in  their  daily

life  been  actively  promoting  this  concept  by

planting  trees and shrubs on empty  plots  around

their  shophouses or houses to beautify and uplift

the environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Parks and Recreation Division under the

Ministry of National Development has contributed a

lot towards achieving the objective of beautifying

our environment. For instance, the stretch of land

along the east coast from Tanjong Rhu to Bedok  is

being  developed into a public seaside park.  This

is  being  developed  into a  first  class  public

resort   of   international  standard   even   for

tourists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as regards tree planting at other places

there  are  certain  shortcomings.  For  instance,

along  Bras Basah Road and Robinson Road  the  PWD

has  planted  trees along that side  of  the  road

which  originally was a pedestrian walk.  I  think

this  is  not  quite right because the  roads  are

already  quite narrow and in view of  the  traffic

congestion along these roads, the demand for  road

space  is  very urgent. So it would be proper  for

the  PWD  to  widen the roads instead of  planting

trees  along the sides, which worsens the  traffic

congestion.  Planting  trees  at  random   without

proper or advance planning is a sheer waste of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>



public money because tree planting costs a lot  of

money.  One tree can cost several hundred  dollars

if  a contractor were to do it. This is a waste of

public funds and is not justified. So I would urge

the  Minister  to  give careful  consideration  in

advance before planting any more trees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter relates to a strange complaint

which  I  have  received. This is the  case  of  a

private landowner who wanted to develop his  land,

but  there  stood  in the way a big  tree  several

decades  old. The developer applied for permission

to  cut  it  down. The authorities concerned  said

that the tree could not be cut down because it  is

under  the  protection of the law.  The  landowner

feels  that there is no reason for the authorities

to  deny  him  permission to fell the  tree  which

stands  in his own private land. I therefore  hope

that  the  Minister will look into this  complaint

too.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with reference to clause 5 of

the  Bill, I just want to make a brief observation

on   a   matter   therein  and  perhaps   seek   a

clarification from the Minister. In clause 5 there

is an exception made for the felling or cutting of

trees,  i.e, the prevention of imminent danger.  I

take   it  that  "imminent  danger"  in  the  Bill

contemplates imminent danger to human life.  Would

the  Minister  clarify  as  to  whether  the  term

"imminent   danger"  also  contemplates   imminent

danger  to  property and animals,  like  pigs  and

pets, etc.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Lim Guan Hoo)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I wonder if the Member for Sembawang would

care to clarify this point. In the earlier part of

his speech he supported the planting of trees, but

in winding up he seemed to favour the cutting down

of   trees.  He  seemed  to  contradict   himself.

Therefore, may I ask him this: does he or does  he

not  want  to  plant trees? Would he clarify  this

point?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I feel that the Parliamentary Secretary is

wasting his breath with a lot of trash.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I think the last remark of the Member for

Sembawang,  namely "trash", is not proper.  If  he

thinks it is proper, can he explain?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, perhaps the Member for Sembawang still

thinks  that  we  are  debating  in  Committee  of

Supply.  He  should  have  taken  the  opportunity

during the last few days in Committee of Supply to

grumble about trees planted in the wrong places or

narrowing down roads. But he has made one relevant

observation, and that is, about one big tree on  a

piece  of  vacant  land  which  is  about  to   be

developed. The position is this. Where  a  housing

developer  applies to build on vacant  land  which

may  have  beautiful trees there in existence  for

more  than 50 or even 100 years, we send  officers

to  the  vacant land to mark out where  the  trees

are,  and the developer is still allowed to  build

provided he preserves some trees. We are not  here

to  protect  all the trees nor to stifle  building

development.  We would allow developers  to  build

provided sufficient trees are preserved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not follow the Member for Serangoon

Gardens   who  wanted  clarification,  unless   it

appears in clause 10 which states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where the Commissioner is satisfied that any

tree  or plant, whether growing or not, is  in  an

inflammable state or is likely to be dangerous  to

life or property or to cause an obstruction . .  .

the  Commissioner may by notice in writing require

the occupier of the land on which it is growing or

lying to remove it within a time specified in  the

notice.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not propose to prevent all trees being

felled  or  cut down. `There must be a  few  trees

which  are  about to fall down either  because  of

root  trouble or some other disease to the  trunk.

Where a tree is likely to fall anti is a danger to

life and/or property, permission can be sought for

it to be cut.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like the Minister to clarify certain

points. The Minister said that if there is a  tree

on  a  piece  of  private  land  which  is  to  be

developed the authority concerned would first send

somebody to see where the tree is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, if the land is 10,000 sq. ft. and

the  building area of 5,000 sq. ft. is to be sited

in  the centre of the land according to the  plan,

then the tree which stands in the centre has to be

cut  down before development can take place. There

may   also   be  a  need  to  comply  with   other

regulations  such as the provision of  car  parks,

pedestrian walk, an open space in the property, or

other  requirements, all of which necessitate  the

cutting   down   of   that   tree.   Under   these

circumstances, although the tree is  protected  by

the  law,  can  the Minister enlighten  the  House

whether it should be cut down.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Yes, permission will be given to cut down such a

tree.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in full support of the Bill

which  is  tabled for Second Reading.  However,  I

would  like  to  point out some of  the  practical

problems which may arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As spelt out in clauses 11 to 14, the

Commissioner of Parks and Recreation is  empowered

to  take  a  deposit from the developer to  ensure

that  he plants trees and lays out the open spaces

in  accordance  with the plans and  specifications

approved  by the competent authority.  More  often

than  not, Sir, the developer has no intention  of

retaining ownership long after a project has  been

completed.  He  sells  the  property  to   various

buyers,  and  sometimes there are  differences  of

opinion  as  to  what  types of  trees  should  be

planted.  Surely, the buyer should have a  say  in

the  type of trees to be planted in front  of  his

house  or the type of hedges to be planted  around

his fencing and compound. I wonder if the Minister

would  agree  that  some  flexibility  should   be

allowed in instances like this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Yes, Sir, we have looked into this matter. Clause

11,  for  instance, was brought in for a  specific

reason.   Previously   some   developers,    after

obtaining subdivision of the land and planning and

building  approval  from the competent  authority,

would just sell the houses and leave the roads  in

a  very bad state. As the Member has pointed  out,

developers want to sell. So they sell all the lots

and  then  disappear; leaving the roads  not  even

properly   constructed   nor   the   road   lights

installed. This is the sort of situation  we  want

to   prevent.  Hence,  this  provision   that   on

application  for  building  approval  one  of  the

conditions  imposed is that the  developer  plants

certain  trees. We cannot allow them to  sell  the

land after development and then disappear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as far as the type of trees which the

developer   or  his  purchaser  may  prefer,   the

Commissioner is really not rigid. They can  choose

the type of trees and we can make recommendations.

All  we want to ensure is that the person who gets

the approval does something to plant in accordance

with  the  plans which he has obtained. Hence  the

deposit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Mr E. W. Barker].

<br><br>3.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a very short Bill and I will keep my

speech short. The Bill seeks to amend the Trustees

Act (Chapter 40) by increasing the borrowing power

of an "approved company" from two-thirds to three-quarters of its mortgaged assets.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections 3 and 4 of the Act lay down the

prerequisites  that  must be complied  with  by  a

company  before  it can obtain the  status  of  an

"approved company" within the meaning of the  Act.

An "approved company" is defined in the Act as one

that is incorporated in Singapore and which has  a

place of business in Singapore, having as its sole

or  primary object the promotion of home ownership

by   advancing   purchase  monies,  repayable   by

instalments over a specified period of time.  Such

an  "approved company" would then be permitted  to

seek   loans  from  trustees  in  accordance  with

section  4 (1) (e) of the Trustees Act. Section  4

(2)  of the Act, however, lays down the conditions

under  which trust funds may be invested  with  an

"approved company". One of the conditions is  that

the   total   borrowing  power  of  the  "approved

company"  must  not  exceed  two-thirds   of   its

mortgaged assets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representations have been received for an

increase  of  an borrowing power of  an  "approved

company"  from  two-thirds to four-fifths  of  the

company's mortgaged assets as the present limit is

considered too restrictive. Consideration has been

given  to  these representations. It is,  however,

felt  that the limit imposed by the Act should  be

raised  from two-thirds to three-quarters  instead

of  four-fifths  of  the  mortgaged  assets.  This

requires  an amendment to the relevant section  of

the  Trustees  Act;  hence the  Bill  before  this

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng (Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Health (Dr Ang Kok Peng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is perhaps a sad commentary on present-day

living  that there is such a large consumption  of

medicines. And because of this tremendous appetite

for  drugs, a vast pharmaceutical industry  exists

today.  In Singapore the total value of  trade  in

pharmaceutical products in 1973 was $170  million.

For the four years 1969-1973, imports increased by

over 80% while exports increased by 400%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In earlier times, medicines were of simpler

chemical substances or derivatives of herbs.  They

were  consumed in the form of powders prepared  by

pounding  or  in  the form of liquid  obtained  by

brewing    the    medicinal   preparations.    The

advancement of science has made it possible for us

to  extract  the  active  ingredients  from  these

medicinal preparations, synthesising them and even

modifying  their  structures  to  make  them  more

potent and specific. In these forms they are  then

made  available  to the public in  elegant  pills,

capsules, injectionables and suppositories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even preparations used as home remedies in the

traditional  systems  of  treating  ailments  have

changed  beyond  recognition. No  longer  do  they

conic  only  as dried parts of plants or  animals;

they  are  now  sold  in  powder  form  or  liquid

extracts  and some of them have been found  to  be

mixed  with  dangerous substances making  them  no

longer harmless remedies but potent poisons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing bewildering array of medicines of

high  potency  and  diverse  effects  has  created

certain  problems of control. Whilst  on  the  one

hand  the public needs to be protected and assured

that the medicines that are available are safe and

useful;  on the other hand, those who are  in  the

pharmaceutical  industry  should  not  be   unduly

discouraged  from introducing new and more  useful

medicines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing controls are no longer adequate in

dealing with a pharmaceutical trade that has grown

tremendously   and  a  situation   where   complex

chemicals with far-reaching effects on the human



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>



being now form the bulk of medicines available  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Medicines Act is an omnibus act

designed  to  bring together controls  which  were

formerly  exercised under various  separate  Acts.

Most of the provisions of the Poisons Act will now

be  incorporated into the Medicines  Act.  Only  a

residual  portion  on  the control  of  industrial

poison   will  remain.  The  Medicines  Act   will

supersede  the Sale of Drugs Act and the Medicines

(Advertisement and Sale) Act, both of  which  will

be  repealed.  As the control of opium  and  other

similar narcotic drugs is subject to international

conventions   because  of  international   illegal

trafficking, special controls will continue to  be

exercised under the Misuse of Drugs Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary purpose of the Medicines Act is to

protect  the  persons who use drugs, that  is  the

customers who, by and large, have no knowledge  of

factors influencing the safety and usefulness of a

medicine.  The Act is to ensure that the  medicine

which a consumer obtains is safe and useful and of

a  quality he should expect. Since he is generally

not  knowledgeable in this matter,  the  influence

brought to bear on him through advertisements must

be  fair. The drug he obtains, be it from a doctor

who  prescribes it or bought over the counter from

a   medicine  shop,  should  comply  with  certain

quality  and safety standards. Conversely, neither

should he have access to drugs for which he has no

need of; nor should he consume drugs which he  has

no knowledge of their potency or safety.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Act, all medicinal products will come

under strict scrutiny. Medicinal products prepared

from  herbs,  animals or insects which  have  been

used  in  traditional systems of treating ailments

and  which  were largely not controlled previously

will now be subject to similar scrutiny under  the

law.  This is essential. These products  are  more

often than not supplied as pills and potions where

the original herb or animal part



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>



is  no longer recognisable. It has been discovered

that  unscrupulous  manufacturers  and  charlatans

have  resorted  to adding highly  active  chemical

substances  to  lend  potency to  their  medicine.

Arsenic   discovered   in   several   brands    of

preparations  used  widely  in  the  treatment  of

asthma is an example. Potent hydrocortisones  have

been  found in others and so too have mercury  and

lead.  We  can no longer ignore the large  numbers

and   brands   of  medicinals  which  are   freely

available in the market, nor can we rightly assume

that  they are harmless. More often than not  they

are  mixed  with  poisons and  arc  compounded  by

persons  with  no knowledge of basic  pharmacy  or

pharmacology and distributed by persons whose sole

interest  is  profit.  Even  cosmetics  which  may

contain harmful or deleterious substances can also

be brought under the purview of the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simplest method of achieving the objective of

protecting the public in regard to medicines is to

impose  a ban on advertisements of medicines  anti

couple  this  with  a complete  control  over  the

dealing  in  medicines by only allowing  sales  by

prescription   and  restricting  the   import   or

manufacture of medicines to a few types of brands.

In  fact  such  controls  are  practised  in  some

countries.    Such   a   measure   would    reduce

considerably  the expenditure on  drugs  and  drug

control.  It  would  eliminate  malpractices   and

unscrupulous dealings in drugs. However, we cannot

adopt  this  simplistic  attitude  as  we  are  an

important  centre  of  communications  and  trade.

Nevertheless,  we  must exercise certain  controls

and   restrictions  while  permitting   legitimate

pharmaceutical trade without compromising  on  the

efficacy  and  quality of medicines  available  in

Singapore. This Act attempts to do just that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act accordingly provides close control at all

levels  of  the pharmaceutical trade  -  from  the

import  and  manufacture of drugs to the  sale  of

drugs  and  even  to the dispensing  of  drugs  by

practitioners and pharmacists. Strict  regulations

will be aimed at ensuring public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>



safety. This is paramount. Further, in view of the

general   ignorance  about  medicine   there   are

controls  over advertisements and other techniques

for   promoting  drug  sales  since  doctors   and

patients are normally not in a position to  verify

the claims of manufacturers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act lays down in considerable detail the

authority and the principles of control while  the

procedures for implementation will be set  out  in

the regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic instrument to effect the objectives

will  be  the product licence. Any persons wishing

to  import  or manufacture any medicinal  products

will  have to satisfy the licensing authority  who

is  the  Director  of Medical  Services  that  the

product  complies with certain quality  standards.

Medicinal  products will be classified  under  two

categories,  (a) non-general sales list  medicines

and   (b)  general  sales  list  medicines.   Only

qualified   persons,   i.e, doctors,   dentists,

pharmacists and veterinary surgeons, may deal with

non-general sales list products. Medicines on  the

general  sales list which are relatively  harmless

will be subject to less stringent control and  may

be  sold  as it is now being sold in our  medicine

shops,   over   the   counter   and   without    a

prescription.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medicinal products will now be screened by the

Ministry  before they appear on the local  market.

Where  necessary, the screening will  be  done  by

advisory  committees. The evidence that is  to  be

provided by applicants for a product licence  will

include  details  of pharmaceutical,  bio-chemical

and  chemical formulation, conditions and locality

of   manufacture,  details  of  qualified   person

supervising its manufacture, and results of trials

carried out, and whether it complies with the laws

of  the  country  of manufacture if  this  is  not

manufactured  locally. It shall be an  offence  to

misrepresent any of these facts and the  licensing

authority  is  authorised to refuse  to  grant  or

revoke  a  licence  and vary any  or  all  of  the

conditions upon



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>



which   the  product  licence  has  been  granted.

Penalties  are provided for those who  breach  the

law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturers of medicinal products will be

required  to apply for licences. The issuance  for

such  a  licence will be conditional  on,  amongst

other   requirements,  suitability  of  personnel,

equipment  and  premises, as well as  adequacy  of

storage facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only qualified persons should be employed by

manufacturers  to  supervise  production  at  each

stage  and  deal in medicinal products. No  person

may  manufacture a product if that product is  not

so licensed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wholesale dealers will also be subject to

licensing. The issuance of such a licence will  be

tied to amongst other requirements suitability  of

premises  as  well as the employment of  qualified

personnel. Their premises will have to be adequate

with  suitable storage and distributing space  and

equipment.  Persons  supervising  the  dealing  of

medicinal products at wholesale dealer's  premises

arc  to  be suitably qualified if dealers wish  to

deal  in the sale and supply of non-general  sales

list products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be mandatory for all licence holders to

maintain  adequate records for their  transactions

as  well as ensure that such records are well  and

safely kept for inspection at reasonable times  by

the   Ministry  officials.  Adequate  records  are

required also to facilitate easy recall of drugs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also protects the purchaser from

fraudulent representation on the safety,  efficacy

and   quality  of  medicinal  products.  Medicinal

products  shall have to comply with the  standards

of  relevant monographs if they are claimed to  be

sold   or   supplied  in  accordance   with   such

specification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act has provisions for it to be brought into

effect in parts. Thus one of the first parts to be

implemented   will  be  the  notice   categorising

medicines  on  a  general sales list  and  a  non-general  sales  list.  The  next  would   be   the

regulations  on registration of all medicines  and

medicinal products. The regulations would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>



be for provisional licensing of medicinal products

so  that  medicinal  products on  the  market  can

continue to be available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the advanced countries, research

establishments  undertake  research  into   drugs,

including  clinical  testing  of  their  toxicity,

effectiveness   and   side-effect.    While    our

facilities  and expertise in this  field  are  not

adequate for such comprehensive investigations  of

drugs,   we  are  able  for  the  time  being   to

concentrate on testing the toxicity of  drugs  for

which we can enlist the assistance of the Ministry

of  Science and Technology. We will also  rely  on

the independent reports published regularly by the

World   Health  Organisation  and  internationally

renowned  research  centres  for  making  rational

judgments on the safety and efficacy of particular

drugs and their use in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To administer the law will require a large

expansion   of   the  section   of   the   Poisons

Inspectorate  of  the  Ministry  of  Health.  This

section will be responsible for the keeping of the

registers,  issue  of  licences  and  inspections.

There  are provisions in the law for the  Minister

to appoint committees. Perhaps the one which would

be of more immediate interest would be a Committee

to  deal  with  appeals  against  decisions  taken

administratively   on  licensing.   Other   expert

committees  such as a committee on safety  may  be

introduced in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the complexity of the Act and its far-reaching controls which will affect the fabric of

medical practice and the pharmaceutical trade,  it

is  recommended  that the Bill be committed  to  a

Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, arising from an oral question

which  I  asked the Minister of State  for  Health

sometime last year, I am glad to note that he  has

kept his promise by referring the Bill to a Select

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to give some general

observations why this Medicines



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>



Bill  should  be  sent to a Select Committee.  The

Minister  of State has correctly brought  out  the

point  which I intended to raise, and that is,  it

appears  extremely restrictive that an  appeal  is

decided  by  the Minister alone. I  think  he  has

indicated just now that it would be better that an

appeal   committee  consisting  of   knowledgeable

representatives from the relevant  authorities  be

appointed  to  assess all appeals  and  makes  its

recommendations  to  the  Minister  for  a   final

decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Part II, clause 10 (3) the definition of

"product  licence" is not clear for  it  does  not

positively  say whether it is the brand  or  trade

name  or  whether  it is the chemical  or  generic

name.  Therefore,  the question of  issuing  third

party   licence   on  patented  products   becomes

relevant. It is reasonable to accept that products

with  patent  protection  still  in  force,  third

parties  should not be allowed to  apply  for  the

licence.  However,  product  licence  holders  can

assign the right to a third party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few medicinal authorities in the United States

have  questioned the adequacy of the United States

Pharmacopoeia (USP) standards. As with the British

Pharmacopoeia  (BP) or the European  Pharmacopoeia

(EP) bio-availability standards are generally  not

available.  Hence  in clause 12  (1),  the  safety

efficacy and quality of medicinal products  should

be thoroughly reexamined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 (a), (b) and (c) allows the Minister to

make  regulations  for  clinical  trials  and  for

medicinal  tests. It is recognised  that  we  have

limited  clinical  and testing facilities.  It  is

therefore  unlikely that we are in a  position  to

conduct   tests   on   tetratogenic   effects   or

congenital  deformities.  In  view  of  this,  the

licensing   authority  should   be   flexible   in

assessing   submitted  literature  for   medicinal

products. An example of this test in case  is  the

experience   relating  to  the   introduction   of

thalidomide  in Germany resulting in thousands  of

babies  being deformed. It is therefore  essential

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>



establish  whether local manufacturing  facilities

provide  certain  safeguards on the  consumers  in

case  of  such an unfortunate event  for  if  they

should  seek  monetary compensation,  how  do  the

manufacturers intend to meet these requirements? I

think  this  is  one area which is  worth  looking

into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again in Part III, clauses 34 and 35, and Part

IV,  clauses  37  (3) and 41(1), these  provisions

appear    to   discriminate   against   practising

pharmacists  or pharmacies. It appears  reasonable

that  these  similar  provisions  should  also  be

extended  to  all  those handling  and  dispensing

medicinal products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V, clause 47 (1), this provision is not

practical as most imported medicinal products  are

already  produced by multi-national pharmaceutical

corporations   for   the   international   market.

Therefore, it may be difficult for the Minister to

make  regulations stipulating distinctive colours,

shapes and markings of medicinal products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole of Part VI of the Bill deals with the

promotion  of  sales  of  medicinal  products  and

medical  advertisements. This has  extremely  wide

implications    and   requires    closer    study.

Representations  by interested  and  knowledgeable

parties will be made to the Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good intention of any Bill or Act will be

thwarted  and cannot achieve its required  effects

if  the implementation process is not as effective

and    sensibly   carried   out.   Hence    proper

consideration  should be given to the  formulation

of  various regulations by the licensing authority

for  the practical implementation of the Medicines

Act, 1975, when it is finally passed.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE FAMILY PLANNING AND POPULATION BOARD (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng (Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Health (Dr Ang Kok Peng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment is to allow the Singapore

Family  Planning  and Population  Board  to  adopt

certain  financial procedures so that the  Board's

financial accountability can be placed on  a  firm

footing. These amendments are now required of  any

statutory board set up by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with this move, the amendment will

require  the  Board  to keep proper  accounts  and

records  of  monetary  transactions,  ensure  that

payments made are credited and properly authorised

and  proper control is maintained over its assets;

in  short,  the Board is to take steps  to  ensure

that money given to it is well and properly spent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also allows the Board's accounts to be audited

by the Auditor-General. However, where it has been

decided  that  the  Board's  accounts  are  to  be

audited  by any other qualified auditor, it  shall

be  done with his concurrence. The duties  of  the

auditor are clearly spelt out. He



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>



shall  have  to certify that financial  statements

reflect  fairly  the  financial  transactions  and

state  of  the  Board as well as  report  on  such

matters which he considers should be reported upon

at any time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A penalty is also imposed on persons who wilfully

obstruct the auditor from performing his duty such

as  preventing access to any records which he  may

wish to see or withholding of information relevant

to  his work. The auditor is also entitled to make

copies or extracts of documents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, apart from submitting his annual report

the Auditor is empowered to inform the Minister on

any  relevant matter that comes to his  notice  at

any time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Auditor-General is not the auditor,

copies of the audited financial statements are  to

be  forwarded to him at the same time as and  when

the auditor submits accounts to the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

<div align="center"><b>NURSES AND MIDWIVES BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng (Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Health (Dr Ang Kok Peng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will bring about an amalgamation of the

nursing  and midwifery professions by  having  one

controlling body to regulate their activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two professions are now quite separate.

Each  is governed by its own regulatory body:  the

nurses  by  the Nursing Board and the midwives  by

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>



Midwives Board. Both Boards were established under

authority of separate laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first legislation on nurses known as the

Nurses Registration Ordinance came into effect  in

February,   1949,   and  a   Nursing   Board   was

established to maintain a register of  nurses  and

to regulate on the training and conduct of nurses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation for midwives was introduced very

much  earlier. The Midwives Ordinance was  brought

into  effect in July, 1917. Amendments were passed

subsequently  in 1923 and 1924, and  in  1959  new

regulations   were   incorporated.   Under    this

Ordinance,  a Midwives Board was established  with

the   function  of  maintaining  a  register   and

regulating the training and conduct of midwives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Times have changed. Midwifery has now become a

subject of study in the training of nurses. It  is

also  taken as a course in the post-basic  nursing

training.  Furthermore, fewer people arc  choosing

midwifery  training solely. The sophistication  of

our  population, increasing urbanisation  and  the

extensive and comprehensive medical services  have

reduced the demand for domiciliary midwifery. More

than  80% of all deliveries in Singapore  are  now

undertaken in our Government medical institutions.

The  rest are delivered mainly in maternity homes.

Only  a  few are delivered by private midwives  at

home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently midwifery should logically be

regarded   as  another  branch  of  nursing,   the

separate  law on midwifery be abolished,  and  the

activities  in regard to nursing and midwifery  be

put  under the jurisdiction of a single board  The

Singapore Nursing Board. This Board will supersede

the   Nursing   and  the  Midwives   Boards.   The

consolidation of the two professions and  services

will also lead to administrative convenience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, however, does not mean that midwives will

play  a  role  secondary to that  of  the  nurses,

neither  does it suggest that midwifery is  to  be

governed  by a nursing body. On the contrary,  the

composition of the Board allows for both



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>



midwives and nurses to be represented. In addition

to  the  traditional  role of midwives  which  was

confined  in the main to the delivering of  babies

and  giving  advice  to mothers  on  the  care  of

children,  the  midwives  nowadays  also  have  an

important  role  to  play in  family  planning  by

giving counsel to parents on the need for planning

a small family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Nursing Board will be responsible

for  ensuring that nurses and midwives who are  to

be  emplaced  on  the register or roll  have  been

adequately trained in accordance with the  courses

and examinations conducted by the Board. The Board

shall   also   have  powers  to   determine   what

qualifications are necessary for anyone seeking to

be  emplaced on its register or roll. In short, it

will  oversee, maintain and improve the  standards

of practice and conduct of nurses and midwives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is empowered also to impose punitive

measures   on  those  who  choose  to  bring   the

professions to disrepute. Accordingly the Board is

empowered to remove the names of such persons from

the  register  or roll or impose as  it  sees  fit

lesser penalties such as cautioning, censuring  or

suspending persons for adverse practice. The Board

is  also  empowered where it deems fit to  restore

names   of  persons  to  the  register  or   roll.

Aggrieved  persons are allowed to  appeal  to  the

High Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A registrar of the Board is to be appointed and

he  shall  be responsible for the preparation  and

maintenance of the register and roll  and  act  as

secretary to the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act also prevents unqualified persons from

taking the titles of nurse or midwife so that  the

public  will not be misled. An offence under  this

section carries a fine not exceeding $1,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to repeal the Nurses Registration

Act  and  the  Midwives Act. However, those  whose

names  are  already  on the register  or  roll  of

nurses  and midwives prior to the passing of  this

Bill  will  be  deemed to have been registered  or

enrolled.

<div align="center"><b>INCOME TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Income Tax (Amendment) Bill is necessary,

first,  to give legislative authority for a number

of  income  tax  concessions; second,  to  further

strengthen  the law against income tax  offenders;

and  third,  to streamline procedures and  improve

existing legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of tax concessions were announced by me

previously  in  Parliament. These included  income

tax relief for supporting parents and grandparents

and   child   relief  for  supporting  handicapped

children  over  16 years. Clause  8  of  the  Bill

provides  for  these  concessions  which  need  no

further elaboration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another announced concession was that with effect

from the year of assessment 1975, annuity payments

will  be taxed only on that portion deemed  to  be

income,  the balance being considered capital  and

not  taxable. Clause 3 (b) will provide  for  this

using  a simple rule adopted by actuaries in  some

countries  to determine the income portion  of  an

annuity  payment.  I  will not trouble  Honourable

Members with details on how this rule works except

to   say  that  the  method  of  apportionment  is

reasonable   and  is  favoured  because   of   its

simplicity  in  calculation both  for  the  Inland

Revenue Department and the annuitant.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 (b) will also provide for the method of

taxing  gains  from  Negotiable  Certificates  of

Deposits  (NCDs) which I hope will soon make  its

appearance  in  the Singapore  money  market.  An

announcement  on this will be made very  shortly.

Because  of  the  current  uncertainty   in   the

financial  world,  the introduction  of  NCDs  in

Singapore  has  been delayed but I  am  confident

that   eventually  NCDs  will  be  an  instrument

commonly traded in the Singapore money market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of our desire to consolidate the

development of Singapore as a maritime centre, it

has been our policy to give fiscal incentives  to

encourage shipowners to register their  ships  in

Singapore.  I  announced  previously   that   the

balancing charge which may arise on the sale of a

Singapore  ship will not be subject  to  tax  and

that there will be income tax exemption for crews

working  on  board  Singapore  registered  ships.

Clauses  3  (a)  and  4  (a)  provide  for  these

concessions.  In addition, I am proposing  a  new

concession  under  clause 5.  Hitherto,  although

income from a Singapore ship is exempt from  tax,

depreciation  allowances on the  ship  are  still

required to be charged against the exempt income.

The  effect is to reduce the amount of tax exempt

dividends  that  could  be declared  by  shipping

companies. I propose to lift this requirement and

allow Singapore ships the option to claim or  not

to claim depreciation allowances. However, should

a  ship  leave the Singapore registry and  become

liable  to  Singapore income tax,  any  unclaimed

depreciation  allowances accumulated  during  the

period of its Singapore registration will not  be

allowed.  At  the same time, it is also  proposed

that tax exempt shipping income be separated from

other  taxable  income  or  losses  of  the  same

company. In the past, shipping losses may be used

to  offset  against non-shipping  taxable  income

which is undesirable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 is also concerned with depreciation

allowances    and   provides   for    accelerated

depreciation over three



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>



years  on  capital  investment in  antipollution

devices.  This  concession  is  in  keeping  with

Government's  policy  to promote  a  cleaner  and

healthier atmosphere in industrial estates and in

the community as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The export of our manufactured goods is the

basis of our industrial strategy. I am pleased to

see   the  number  of  trade  missions  organised

recently  to  visit  potential  markets  to  push

exports of Singapore-made goods. To assist  these

efforts  in  export promotion, I  announced  that

double  deduction  will be allowed  for  expenses

incurred   in  approved  overseas  trade   fairs,

exhibitions   or  trade  missions  organised   to

promote  the  exports  of  Singapore-manufactured

goods.  This concession, however, will not  apply

to  enterprises which are already enjoying export

or  other incentives under the Economic Expansion

Incentives Act. Clause 6 of the Bill provides for

the  double deduction concession which will  have

retrospective effect from 1st April, 1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the amendments in the Bill

designed  to tighten the law against  income  tax

offenders.  Income  tax is the  mainstay  of  our

revenue  structure accounting for more than  one-third  of  total revenue. Compliance by taxpayers

is   therefore   of  paramount   importance   and

Government  must see to it that every person  who

is liable pays his fair share.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design of a penalty system for tax evasion

which  without excessive harshness would  yet  be

punitive enough to deter would-be offenders is no

easy   task.   Some  guidance  is   provided   by

experience  in  the day-to-day administration  of

the  law.  And  such experience  has  shown  that

certain  modifications in the  law  dealing  with

offenders should be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 of the Bill provides for modification

of  the penalty for failure to make an income tax

return  or  furnish particulars. There have  been

too  many  cases where a fourth, fifth  or  sixth

conviction  has  not had the  desired  effect  of

getting the taxpayer to submit his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>



returns  or  accounts. The present  penalty  of  a

maximum fine of $1,000 appears ineffective. It  is

now proposed that if the conviction is a second or

subsequent conviction relating to the same year of

assessment, the taxpayer shall be made to suffer a

further  penalty of $50 a day for every  day  that

the offence is continued after conviction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed to remove the requirement of

a  possible minimum of six months' imprisonment in

addition to a fine for taxpayers who are convicted

for  omitting  or  making  false  returns  without

reasonable excuse or through fraud. A minimum  six

months' imprisonment seems too harsh in this  case

and invariably this has led to offenders being let

off  with  only a fine. Clauses 14 and 15  of  the

Bill will allow for the length of imprisonment  to

he  decided  by the Court. However, for  cases  of

fraudulent  evasion for more than three  years,  a

minimum six months' sentence will remain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, only the High Court may impose the

full  penalty  in  respect of offences  under  the

Income  Tax  Act. As a good number of  income  tax

cases   are   dealt  with  in  the   District   or

Magistrate's  Court, clause 16  will  empower  the

District or Magistrate's Court to impose the  full

penalty as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 will require a married woman to sign

and   furnish  a  return  in  respect  of   income

assessable  in  her  husband's  name,  if   deemed

necessary  by the Comptroller. This will  make  it

possible  for  the  Comptroller  to  take   action

against the wife where she derives unearned income

which is assessable only in her husband's name and

which  has  not been declared to the  Comptroller.

Hitherto,  it  was not possible to  prosecute  the

husband since he may genuinely be unaware  of  the

wife's  undeclared income. At the time it  is  not

possible  to prosecute the wife since she  is  not

assessable on this income. The amendment will plug

this loophole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, provisions in the Income Tax Act

regarding the general secrecy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>



of  income  tax matters prevented the  Comptroller

from  making a complaint to any Professional  Body

even  if  he  is  aware of blatant  unprofessional

practices. This is an obstruction to the course of

justice. Clause 2 will take out this fetter on the

Comptroller  to allow him to make a  complaint  to

the  appropriate Professional Body of professional

misconduct  against a person in  his  professional

dealings with the Comptroller.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I come to those amendments which are

intended  to  streamline  procedures  and  improve

existing legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 will restrict the double child relief

given  to  taxpayers whose children  are  studying

abroad. It has been found that a number of parents

want  their  children  to be "expatriates"  at  an

early  age  by  sending them to  expensive  school

abroad.  In  the  past,  double  relief  could  be

claimed  for  these children but  there  seems  no

reason  why Government should continue  to  doubly

subsidize such unnecessary expenditure. Clause  18

therefore provides that double relief will only he

allowed  where the course of study abroad  pursued

by  the child is either not available in Singapore

or  the  child is unable to gain admission  to  an

institution of higher learning in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income of public entertainers is exempted from

tax  if  their  visits are supported  from  public

funds  of  foreign  governments.  Sometimes,   the

financial  support  from  foreign  governments  is

purely  nominal. Clause 4 (b) proposes to make  it

clear that exemption will apply only if the visits

of public entertainers are substantially supported

from public funds of foreign governments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To simplify procedures, clause 17 proposes to

vest  the Minister with powers to amend the First,

Third and Fourth Schedules to the Income Tax  Act.

The First Schedule deals with income tax exemption

for  statutory boards and other institutions.  The

Third Schedule concerns tax on income held by  the

Custodian of Enemy Property.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>



The  Fourth  Schedule  lists the  Government  loan

stocks  where  interest earned therefore  will  be

subject  to  half  the tax.  As  the  Minister  is

already  empowered to reduce tax or give exemption

in  the main Act, it would simplify procedures  to

vest  in  him  the  powers to  amend  these  three

Schedules  as  well.  It  is  intended  that   the

remaining two Schedules in the Act, the Second and

the Fifth Schedules, which deal with the rates  of

income   tax   and   amount   of   child   reliefs

respectively should continue to be amended only by

Parliament as these two Schedules would  affect  a

great number of people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining amendments are either consequential

in  nature  or  are  meant to tidy  up  procedural

matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Kuo Chuan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I merely would like to say a few

words  on  clause 2 of this Bill, which  provision

may  have  quite  unforeseen consequences  in  its

implementation. One could foresee a  situation  in

which   a  professional  man  may  have  committed

professional     misconduct,    justifying     the

Comptroller   laying   a  complaint   before   the

appropriate professional body authorised  to  take

disciplinary  action  but  whose  client  may   be

entirely   innocent.  In  such  a  situation   any

complaint laid by the Comptroller would result  in

the  confidential tax problem of the client  being

discussed by other professional men who sit in the

appropriate  disciplinary committee  and  who  may

well  represent  other  clients  with  conflicting

vested  interests  in  the  same  matter.  Such  a

situation would nullify the protection afforded to

a  taxpayer by the secrecy provision of the Income

Tax Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst I agree that clause 2 is desirable for

preventing   a  particular  form  of  professional

abuse, the machinery for its implementation, as it

now stands, is wholly inappropriate in the context

of  a  taxpayer's rights. This particular  problem

should be looked into in greater



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>



depth, in fact, Sir, on second thought, I  really

wonder  what prevents the Comptroller from  laying

such    a   complaint   before   the   appropriate

disciplinary  body in a given case  regardless  of

the provision of the proposed clause 2.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these comments, Sir, I support the

Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just wish to make observations

on  some of the clauses in this Bill. On clause  3

(a)  of the Bill, I am sure the shipping community

will welcome this proviso which no doubt will give

a  fillip to shipping activity in Singapore.  This

proviso  excludes  from tax the  balancing  charge

arising  on  the sale of a Singapore ship.  Up  to

now,  because of the absence of such a  provision,

the  Comptroller  has sought to tax  this  charge.

This  measure  has  to  some extent  defeated  the

purpose of section 13 (A) of the Act, that is,  to

exempt  from  tax  the  income  derived  from  the

employment  or  charter of a Singapore  registered

ship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clause that I wish to dwell on is

clause  4  (a) of the Bill. I feel that  this  new

amendment  will no doubt further assist  Singapore

shipping  but something should he said in  respect

of  the drafting of this clause. In clause  4  (a)

paragraph  (w) the use of the term "substantially"

can   give   rise  to  problems  of   construction

especially in the absence of a definition  of  the

term  in this Bill or in the Income Tax Act. I  am

led to wonder why the draftsmen have not chosen to

employ  a phraseology giving a definite number  of

days  in a year instead, as in clause 4 (b)  where

the words "sixty days in the year" are used.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, on clause 5 (a), (b) and (c) of the Bill,

this   is  another  favourable  development.  This

amendment no longer makes it mandatory for capital

allowances  to be deducted from the  income  of  a

shipping enterprise. At present, this is necessary

in  determining the exempt profits, the  resultant

of  which  is that in many cases, as the  Minister

quite rightly said, the huge allowances cancel the

profits  leaving  little or nothing  for  dividend

distribution.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I am in some difficulty in replying to these

criticisms  because they are matters of  technical

detail.  On  the  first proposal  about  revealing

information  on taxpayers' matters I thought  that

we  had  taken  care  of  the  problem  which  was

presented   and  that  this  had  been   carefully

drafted.  I do not know in what way this provision

can  be improved. If the Member for Kuo Chuan  has

any  special change in the drafting, perhaps  this

could be moved in the Committee stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that this provision was satisfactory. I

assume   that   professional  bodies   often   get

information which they must keep confidential even

in their proceedings before the professional body.

The  names  of  the particular taxpayer  could  be

suppressed. Names could be omitted or replaced  by

alphabetical  symbols  and  the  details  of   the

taxpayer  need  not be given. The  nature  of  the

misconduct  probably relates only to a  particular

act  which  may  not  concern  the  whole  of  the

taxpayer's financial affairs. I would be  prepared

to listen to any desirable amendment in Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the comments by the Member for

Serangoon Gardens on balancing charges, I think he

welcomes  clause  3.  But he  thought  that  under

clause  4 (a) (w) the word "substantially"  should

be  defined.  I  will give consideration  to  some

administrative    definition    of    the     word

"substantially", but I do not know whether in fact

a  line can be drawn as we have drawn for clause 4

(b)  (new  subsection (4) )  where  60  days  were

given.  This  is a well recognised limitation  for

that  particular purpose -employment exercised  in

Singapore  by  short-term  visiting  employees.  I

doubt  whether  there can be a  very  much  closer

definition  than  the  word  "substantially".  The

point  is  that in some cases the seaman  is  from

Singapore and he goes on a ship. The ship probably

operates  elsewhere but the seaman  comes  for  an

indeterminate period, I suppose on  leave  or  for

other     purposes,     back     in     Singapore.

Administratively, it is possible to come  to  some

satisfactory arrangement but I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>



do  not know whether we can do much better in  the

legal  definition in stating the total  number  of

days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member made another comment on clause 5 (a)

which I was not clear about. This is in respect of

allowances   which   leave  nothing   for   income

distribution.  I  thought  that  was  a  desirable

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, I did mention that was a desirable

amendment. I only referred to clause 4 (b).



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, since that is a desirable amendment, I do

not have any particular comment then.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Hon Sui Semi].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>5.31 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause I ordered to stand part of the Bill.



Clause 2 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 2 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was wondering whether we can

really  delete the whole of clause 2 for the  time

being and come back to it when Parliament sits  at

a  future date if at all necessary, because if the

information  which the Comptroller would  like  to

lay  before  the Disciplinary Committee  does  not

involve  a  confidential type of matter  then,  of

course, the secrecy provisions of the Act will not

apply  at  all.  He could just  as  well  lay  the

complaint  before the Committee. So I do  not  see

how   clause  2  is  really  going  to  make   any

difference to the present situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, it is a question of interpretation. The

Comptroller has been very scrupulous in  believing

that  he  cannot  even lay a complaint.  But  this

clause will enable him to lay a complaint in a way

which  will not reveal very much of the taxpayer's

financial affairs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>



We  want  to be sure that we can, in fact,  lay  a

complaint. We thought that at the moment this  was

debarred because of the secrecy provisions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> This would really imply that the nature of

complaints that the Comptroller may lay before the

Disciplinary  Committee will involve  confidential

tax matters. That is why he had a doubt in his own

mind as to whether he could do it or not. This  is

where  the problem is because once it goes  before

other professional men then, of course, a conflict

between respective clients becomes relevant.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps, Mr Hon, we can postpone the Committee

stage and reconsider the Bill later.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I think this is a matter of principle. I

believe  that  if the Member takes the  view  that

making  a  complaint  means that  we  must  reveal

information, then it means that we cannot  make  a

complaint  of  misconduct. My point  is  that  the

complaint  can be laid, the name of  the  taxpayer

suppressed,  and  the details of his  tax  affairs

need  not be revealed except to the extent of that

particular piece of misconduct. At the moment  the

interpretation  of  the  Comptroller  is  that  he

cannot  even  lay  a  complaint  because  of   the

prohibition in the Act which provides  that  there

should  be  nothing which would  indicate  that  a

taxpayer's affairs have been dealt with in such  a

complaint.  I  think we want to relax  it  to  the

extent  that a complaint can be laid but we would,

as we have done previously, be quite scrupulous in

trying   to   omit   details  which   would   give

information to other people about the  affairs  of

the taxpayer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether we can resolve it by just

postponing consideration in Committee. It is not a

matter of drafting. It is a matter of whether,  in

fact,  the  principle  must be  preserved  -  that

nothing  should  be revealed at  all  so  that  we

cannot even lay a complaint.



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> That is so, Mr Speaker, Sir, but if the client

concerned is completely innocent then, of course,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>



it  is  going to be very hard on him just  because

his   professional   adviser   has   mis-conducted

himself. The whole question relates to the  nature

of  the evidence that is going to be placed before

the professional body.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> On this matter, may I give the assurance that we

will  take  the  greatest  pains  to  prevent  any

revelation  of tax matters relating to  taxpayers.

But  we will in fact only do it to the extent that

complaints    can   be   laid   against    certain

professional men in the discharge of their duties.

<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, Sir. We will

accept  that  for the time being, and  perhaps  we

will  take  it  up in a different context  if  the

problems were to arise on a scale to warrant it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I would be prepared to accept suggestions

for  administering this particular  section  which

would satisfy both the professional bodies and  my

Ministry    as    to   the   ability    to    make

representations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 to 5 inclusive ordered to stand part of

<div align="center"><b>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BOARD (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Economic Development

Board Act so as to provide for:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the appointment of two Deputy Chairmen

instead of one Deputy Chairman at present;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the appointment of a member of the Board to

act on behalf of the Chairman outside Singapore in

relation to any matters or class of matters;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the appointment of not less than four and not

more than ten members of the Board (apart from the

Chairman and the Director) instead of six as at

present; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the manner in which the fixing of the common

seal of the Board is to be authenticated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also makes clear that the Annual Report

of  the  Board will be based on its operations  of

the preceding financial year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These organisational changes are necessary to

enable  the Economic Development Board to step  up

its  industrial  promotion  efforts  at  home  and

abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its establishment in 1961, the Economic

Development  Board  has  been  able   to   attract

considerable foreign investments into industry  in

Singapore. Foreign investments and fixed assets in

the manufacturing sector rose from $10 million  in

1964  to  $2,930 million by the end  of  1974,  an

average annual increase of 40%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High oil prices, inflation and massive

unemployment,  even  in industrialised  countries,

have  slowed  down our ability to attract  foreign

investments in industry into Singapore. Industrial

investment  commitments in 1974 amounted  to  $829

million, less than the figure of $957 million  the

year  before.  Though  the  prospects  of  foreign

investments  into  Singapore  are  currently  less

encouraging, the international division of  labour

will go on inexorably. Industries in Japan, Europe

and  North  America, which find that they  can  no

longer  compete if they continue manufacturing  in

their  own  countries, will seek to  locate  their

operations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>



overseas in countries where the factors  of

production are more in their favour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, located in the midst of a rapidly

growing  region of great mineral and  agricultural

potential, is one of perhaps no more than a  dozen

countries in the world in which multi-national and

even  smaller-sized companies will consider it  in

their interest to position themselves to face  the

future,  changed irreversibly by the oil producers

of OPEC.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oil producers' successful change of the terms

of  trade  so much in their favour and so  swiftly

marks an economic watershed. It presents Singapore

with immediate as well as long-term opportunities.

The   more  urgent  search  for  oil  has  greatly

benefited Singapore's marine and offshore-oil-rigs

construction and logistics industries.  In  recent

months,    the   Economic   Development    Board's

investment centre in Houston, which is  noted  for

the  number  of US oil industry companies  located

there, has been most active. In the long-term, the

higher price of oil will raise the cost of sea  or

air   transportation  substantially.  Energy   and

mineral  intensive industries  would  have  to  be

located  nearer  the sources of raw  materials  or

nearer  the markets for their products. Singapore,

with   its   well-developed  human  and   physical

infrastructure in the midst of a resource rich and

populous  region, is well placed  to  compete  for

such industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relatively higher price of energy should help

also  to improve the competitive position  of  our

established industries. The textiles and garments,

electrical   and   electronic,   and   woodworking

industries have played and will continue to play a

significant role in Singapore's industrialisation.

Value  added  by these three groups of  industries

rose  from  21%  in 1970 to 31% in 1974  of  total

value added by the manufacturing sector. They have

been  able  to  do this because, these  industries

have  been continually improving their design  and

quality  through heavier investment  in  machinery

and technical training. Value added per worker  in

the  textile  and  garment  industries  more  than

trebled  from $1,960 in 1965 to $6,900 last  year.

Similarly, value



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>



added  per  worker  in  the woodworking  industry,

which  progressed from simple sawmilling to  wood-moulding,  almost doubled from $4,170 in  1965  to

$7,100  last year. Value added per worker  in  the

electronics industry rose from $7,000 in  1965  to

$18,000  last  year as the industry advanced  from

component   assembling  to   instrumentation   and

testing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have quoted these value added figures at some

length  because of a tendency to dismiss  the  so-called  cheap textile and electronics  industries.

These  industries  far from declining  should,  in

fact,   grow   even  stronger.  In   future,   all

manufacturing industries spurred on by the  higher

price of oil would have to compete on the basis of

organisation  and  equipment  rather  than  simple

unskilled  labour. A relatively earlier start  and

nearness  to energy sources would enable Singapore

to  compete  on equal, if not better,  terms  with

countries further away from Southeast Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

<div align="center"><b>CONSUMER PROTECTION (TRADE DESCRIPTIONS AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is already an offence to apply a false trade

description  to goods under the Merchandise  Marks

Act. However, this Act, which was first enacted in

1917, has many shortcomings and is out-of-date for

our  present day needs. It is considered therefore

that  the Merchandise Marks Act should be replaced

by  new  and  more comprehensive legislation.  The

provisions of the Consumer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>



Protection  Bill have been drafted in consultation

with   the  Consumers'  Association  of  Singapore

(CASE)  and  are  on lines similar  to  the  Trade

Description  Acts  of  Malaysia  and  the   United

Kingdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more extensive provisions in the Bill

prohibiting  false and misleading  description  of

goods  will  not  only protect  the  interests  of

consumers,  but also those of honest traders.  The

coverage   of   the  Bill  is   not   limited   to

descriptions  appearing on products,  but  extends

also  to false information given in the course  of

enquiries or advertisements or oral statements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for the disclosure of

additional   particulars  of  goods   where   such

information  is  lacking  and  of  importance   to

consumers. It is not intended, however,  that  the

disclosure provisions will require the publication

of  trade  secrets or formulae. Indeed,  the  Bill

makes it an offence for any person to disclose  to

any  other  person  such  information  if  he  has

obtained them in pursuance of the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the Bill provides that advertisements

are  to  be  regulated so as to prevent misleading

statements   in  relation  to  the   goods   being

advertised.  The  consumer is entitled  to  expect

that the goods purchased fit the description given

in the advertisements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also relates to the safe composition,

design   and   construction  of  goods   for   the

protection  of  consumers. On  safety  and  health

grounds, it is required that certain goods  be  of

stipulated minimum standards. This is  not  a  new

requirement  as we already have minimum  standards

set for certain goods, for example, crash helmets,

industrial helmets, hair-sprays and the  like.  It

is  only after careful examination of the need for

minimum standards for consumers' safety that  they

will be required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill includes provisions for the Minister to

make   regulations  for  the   purposes   I   have

mentioned,  i.e.,  to require informative  marking

and  to  impose safety requirements  and  also  to

allow exemptions of goods from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>



operations  of  such  regulations.  It   is   the

intention  that  in such regulations,  exemptions

will  be  given for goods for export or re-export

in  any  particular case, or in  respect  of  the

particular  categories  of  goods.  Members   are

therefore assured that it is not the intention of

the   Government   to   restrict   regional    or

international trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the enforcement of the law, the ability to

take  prompt action will gain favourable consumer

reaction and will also act as a deterrent to  the

commission   of   offences.  The  Controller   of

Consumer Protection is therefore vested with  the

authority  to  compound offences for  a  sum  not

exceeding $2,000. Such an enabling provision will

make  administration of the Act  less  costly  as

well  as help to impress on the traders the  need

to adhere to the law.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may also like to know that under the

Act, the Court convicting a person for an offence

may,  at  the  same time, award  damages  to  the

injured  party up to $1,000 without prejudice  to
