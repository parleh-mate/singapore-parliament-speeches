<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON MINIMUM STANDARDS OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>LIVELIHOOD AND REPORT ON SOCIAL SECURITY MEASURE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for Labour

whether (a) Government would consider tabling a  White

Paper  on  the  Report  of the  Committee  on  Minimum

Standards  of  Livelihood (Cmd. 5  of  1957)  and  the

Report  to  the  Government  of  Singapore  on  Social

Security Measures (Cmd. 56 of 1957); and (b)  he  will

indicate what measures Government has in mind for this

Session   in   the  fields  of  social  security   and

unemployment insurance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Wee Toon Boon) (for the Minister for Labour):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the Government has  studied  not  only

these  two  Reports, but three other Reports  on  this

subject.  Each of these Reports examines the  findings

of  the Committee receiving it. All these actions  had

been  taken under the previous Government resulting  m

proliferation of paper without any decisions. The view

of  the  Government is that these measures  cannot  be

proceeded with unless the support of organised  labour

is  obtained. Without it, the implementation of social

security is impracticable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Minister had already stated, in answer to a

previous question, that leaders of certain sections of

organised labour had opposed the introduction



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>



of  social  unemployment insurance on  a  contributory

basis.  These leaders are Messrs. Lim Ching Siong,  S.

Woodhull, D. Puthucheary and the Member for Thomson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To force contributory social security against the

wishes of organised labour is something which does not

appeal  to  this Government. The Government  considers

that   these   measures  can  only   be   successfully

introduced  if  both  the  unions  and  employers  are

prepared  for  a contributory social security  scheme.

The  unions  and  employers will be  asked  for  joint

discussions  and  the Government hopes  that  after  a

thorough  exchange of views, agreement can be  reached

on  unemployment insurance as the first step to a more

comprehensive social security scheme.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Am I to understand, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  that  in  fact,  there  have  been  no

discussions in the past on this aspect?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> May the Member repeat the question,

Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If I might assist, the Parliamentary

Secretary  said  that discussions will  be  held  with

unions  and employers. Does that mean that there  have

been , no discussions in the past on this vital issue?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as

consultations between union leaders and the Government

are   concerned,  they  have  taken  place,  but   not

discussions between Government and the employers yet.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Would the Government consider publishing

a  White  Paper  in respect of its own recommendations

and  the  course of events which have arisen since  it

made  those  recommendations? The people of  Singapore

are entitled to know.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is a supplementary question. Mr Wee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> As I have said just now, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  Government hopes, through  discussions

with  the  parties  concerned,  i.e.,  employers   and

unions,  that  it  will be able to  find  a  basis  of

introducing the social security scheme,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> When is it anticipated that these

discussions will be held?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Of course, Mr Speaker, Sir, as

soon  as the Minister is convenient to look into  this

matter.

<div align="center"><b>THAT FOR 1959 AND ESTIMATED REVENUE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FOR 1962 COMPARED WITH THAT FOR 1961</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for Finance

what is (a) the actual revenue for 1960 compared with

that for 1959; and (b) the estimated revenue for 1962

compared with that for 1961.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked to

reply.  The  actual  revenue for  the  year  1960  was

$311,264,201 compared with $274,918,527 for 1959, that

is, an increase of about $36.3 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1962 revenue estimate is $391,109,000 compared

with  the 1961 estimate of $344,808,610, that  is,  an

increase of roughly $46.3 million.

<div align="center"><b>MERGER (SINGAPORE/FEDERATION OF MALAYA)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(White Paper)</b></div>

<br><br>2.40 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on

Amendment  [21st  November, 1961]  to  Question

[20th November, 1961],

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, whereas it has always been the avowed

objective  of  all nationalists  of  Malaya  to

achieve the reunification of Singapore with the

Federation   of  Malaya  and  to   remove   the

artificial  division created by the British  by

their  policy of "divide and rule", this  House

affirms  and declares that the first  objective

of  all  true patriots of Malaya is to  achieve

the reunification of these two territories in a

merger  of  Singapore with  the  Federation  of

Malaya .".-(The Minister for Labour-Inche Ahmad

bin Ibrahim).

<br><br>Which Amendment was,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To leave out from "a" in the second last line

to the end and insert:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"genuine merger of Singapore with the

Federation  of Malaya, with Singapore  entering

the  Federation as the twelfth state  and  with

all its Citizens automatically becoming Federal

Citizens on Merger Day".'--(Dr Lee Siew Choh).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the words

proposed to be left out, be left out."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.41 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr   Speaker,  yesterday  I  talked  about  our

proposal  which would look after the welfare  of

the  people  who  would not be deceived  by  the

machinators.  Therefore,  our  Party  Chairman's

amendment will show clearly who is real and  who

is  false:  who  is true and who is  untrue.  In

fact, although they talk about merger, it is not

a real merger. They are cheating the people. Mr

Speaker,  the  amendment  moved  by  our   Party

Chairman  is truly in accordance with the  hopes

and  aspirations of the people. Here, we can see

how the workers, farmers and people in all walks

of  life in Singapore react against the P.A.P.'s

merger. All the people have raised their  points

of  view, but the leadership in the P.A.P. still

refuse  to  listen  to the people  and  secretly

carry  on  their act of selling out the  people.

Mr Speaker, the people are very realistic about

citizenship.  That  has  made  the  P.A.P. talk

ambiguously.  Their aim has been disclosed  very

gradually. Our Chairman, by using simple  terms,

has very clearly and systematically explained to

the  people our opinions. No matter how eloquent

they  are,  they still cannot speak against  us.

They  cannot  defeat us verbally.  Mr  Speaker,

from  the debate of the past few days, no wonder

people  at large have all stated that the P.A.P.

now and the P.A.P. of former days are different.

This  is  really true. The people at  large  are

right. They are 100 per cent correct. We can see

the  Minister  for  Finance,  the  Minister  for

Health   and  the  Minister  for  Labour  making

eloquent speeches to try and deceive the people.

They  use  all  sorts of means to achieve  their

aims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now I want to quote the

Member for Cairnhill's speech. In the second day

of  his  speech, he denied what he said  on  the

first  day.  He said that he was not opposed  to

the  Barisan  Sosialis'  motion,  but  that  the

Barisan   Sosialis  had  special  motives.   Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  his  speech  appeared   to   be

rational.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion is apparently a real one. After

analysis, we can have a more rational  approach

and  we can express the people's views. We hope

that   everyone  will  think  of  the  people's

interests  and  try to attain the reunification

and  merger  of Singapore with the  Federation,

but  not  by  false expressions to deceive  the

people.  Only by this will the people's  wishes

be expressed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the sincerity shown by our

Party  Chairman  in his speech is  now  wasted.

From  the  speech of the leader of the  S.P.A.,

you  can  see  that  we  are  sincere.  We  are

fighting  hard  so that our citizenship  rights

will  not  be  sold  out. If  the  citizens  of

Singapore cannot automatically become  citizens

of  the  Federation, then  it  is  not  a  real

merger.  In this respect, the S.P.A. are  more

honest  and more frank than the P.A.P. leaders.

But  they are opportunistic because, on the one

hand, they support the P.A.P. and, on the other

hand, they attack the P.A.P. This contradictory

attitude  is  laughable.  The  general   masses

already  know  their  true  colours.  But   the

leaders of the P.A.P. are more dishonest.  They

continue with their sophisticated arguments and

they  can  only repeat what the Prime  Minister

has said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance

said  that  from  1954  to  1959  anti-colonial

forces united together to fight the British. In

those  days, the P.A.P. saw fit to  unite  with

all  nationalists - even with the  Communists - and

all  other anti-colonial forces. They said that

it  was  a  three-cornered  fight  amongst  the

nationalists, Communists and the P.A.P. at that

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what we are talking about

today  is  whether we are to have a true  or  a

phoney  merger. The question is whether we  are

to  agree to the proposed merger of the Barisan

Sosialis,  which  is for the interests  of  the

people of Singapore, or whether we are to agree

to  the P.A.P. phoney merger, which is to  sell

out the interests of the people of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance talked at length

about Communism. His purpose was to confuse the

vision  of the people from the issue of whether

it is a true or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>



phoney  merger and to direct their attention  to

the problem of Communism. He was actually trying

to  throw  a  red herring across the path.  From

this  we  can  clearly see that the  P.A.P. are

bankrupt  in  ideas. They do not  have  any  new

material to offer. All that they can do is  just

to  go on talking. From our experience with  the

colonialists,  we  should  fight  against   this

oppression. We should fight for true  democratic

rights and for the improvement of the livelihood

of  the  people. All this is in accordance  with

the  desires and wishes of the people. It is not

a  question  whether Singapore  is  a  Communist

State  or not. My purpose in joining the Barisan

Sosialis is to fight for the materialisation  of

parliamentary democracy and for a more just and

reasonable society in order to improve  the  lot

of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has also said that

now  the  nationalists have  to  part  with  the

Communists  and  that there should  be  a  clear

demarcation between them. Do the P.A.P. profess

themselves to be so-called nationalists? If this

is  what the Minister for Finance means, then  I

believe  the  people will reject  this  kind  of

reasoning. Since the P.A.P. came into power, the

people   of   Singapore  can  see  through   the

intrigues  of  the P.A.P. in putting  forward  a

phoney  merger  which is intended  to  sell  out

Singapore.  This is the common  talk  at  street

corners.  The people say that the Lim  Yew  Hock

Government sold Christmas Island, but the  Prime

Minister  wants to sell Singapore! Therefore,  I

advise  the  leadership of  the  P.A.P. not  to

disgrace the good name of the nationalists.  The

P.A.P. are  not  qualified to  call  themselves

nationalists. The Deputy Prime Minister has said

that there are only a few hundred Communists  in

Singapore. Why should the citizenship rights  of

thousands of people in Singapore be deprived for

the sake of a few hundred Communists?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to touch on what the

Minister for Health and Law said. He stated that

the  automatic conversion of Singapore  citizens

into Federation citizens on Merger Day will  not

be acceptable to the Federation Government. This

is quite honest,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>



but  this  also goes to explain one point.  The

way in which the P.A.P. leadership are behaving

is  very shameful. They want to monopolise  the

whole  thing.  If  they cannot  monopolise  the

whole  thing, they do not want to do  anything.

They   should  tell  the  people  of  Singapore

frankly  what  they intend to do.  They  should

seek strength from all classes of the people to

persuade the Tunku that if that sort of negotia

tion  is not agreeable in the interests of  the

people  of Singapore, then the terms of such  a

merger should not be accepted. We can fight for

our   constitutional  advancement  by  pursuing

another method. This would have saved a lot  of

time of this Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Minister for Health

and  Law clearly recognises our stand on merger

and thinks that it is a correct stand, then  he

should  not waste time arguing about it unnecessarily.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us go on to what the

Minister  for Culture said. He could only  talk

about  this  and that. He spoke  at  random  on

things  which were entirely irrelevant  to  the

matter  under discussion. He used very abstract

theories. His speech conveyed this meaning.  He

said  that the proposal of the Barisan Sosialis

for  a merger of Singapore with the Federation,

with  Singapore citizens automatically becoming

Federal citizens, will hearten communal parties - such  as  the  P.M.I.P. - in the  Federation  of

Malaya. This argument is not worth rebutting. I

hope  he  will  examine carefully the  analysis

given  by  our  Party Chairman with  regard  to

communal issues and matters relating thereto.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have moved our amendment because it is good

for  the  people of Singapore and Malaya  as  a

whole.   There  should  not  be  any   communal

conflicts  or  any  other  unpleasant   results

unless Machiavellian politicians want to create

greater differences among the different races.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture also pointed out that

the 13 Members in the Barisan Sosialis left the

P.A.P. not  because of their stand on  merger,

but because they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>

wanted  complete internal self-government.  This

proves  that the P.A.P. are unreasonable on  the

merger issue. They are irrelevant without giving

any reason.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at the time of the Anson by-election, the P.A.P. raised very vague merger

terms and they asked the people to vote on them.

In  the  end, the people passed very clear  judgment  on  the P.A.P. But the leadership  of  the

P.A.P. did  not  want  to accept  the  judgment

passed on them by the people. They did not  want

to  examine their own hypocritical act but  they

pushed their claim for -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Pasir

Panjang (Mr Tee Kim Leng) appears to be reading

a  newspaper. There is a Standing Order which  I

might  read  for the benefit of hon.  Members  - Standing Order 48 (d), which says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Members shall not read newspapers, books,

letters  or other documents except such  matters

therein as may be directly connected with the

business under debate.'

<br><br>So  I  take it that the Member for Pasir Panjang

was  probably  reading matters in the  newspaper

which  were directly connected with the business

under debate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): They accused

us of stabbing the P.A.P. in the back. They made

us a scapegoat for their defeat in Anson. But we

had  been in the P.A.P. for quite some time, and

we  clearly understand how the P.A.P. leadership

treated  the  people. They  used  to  resort  to

oppression,  and now they fall on all  fours  in

trying  to  appease  the colonialists  and  reactionaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leadership of the P.A.P. claim that merger

is  now  in  view.  Now that  this  question  is

raised,  the  people have many doubts  in  their

minds.   First,   everybody   knows   that   the

Federation  Government has all along refused  to

merge.   And  the  P.A.P.'s  fourth  Anniversary

Souvenir  also stated the reason why  the  Tunku

did  not  want merger - there are too many Chinese

in  Singapore, and the strength of the Left-wing

forces  in Singapore is too great. If  there  is

true merger between Singapore and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>



the  Federation of Malaya, it will affect their

political  status and position. But the  number

of  Chinese in Singapore today is not less than

before, and the strength of Left-wing forces is

even  greater than before. And yet why  is  the

Federation very interested in merger now?  Does

it mean that the Federation has already changed

its  original  view  on  merger?  What  is  the

reason?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the British have now changed their

attitude towards merger, from one of silence to

one  of  interest.  Everybody  knows  that  the

separation  of  the  two  territories  was  the

result of the colonialist policy of divide  and

rule.  But the present attitude of the  British

is that they are now very agreeable to merger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the leadership of the P.A.P. have

suddenly cried out that merger is now in  view,

and made use of it as a kind of panacea to save

themselves. This is what we doubt very much. We

were Party cadres in the P.A.P. before. At that

time, the leadership of the Party never pointed

out to us the possibility of reaching agreement

on  the  terms of merger. But now they suddenly

announce that merger is in view, and are  using

this  issue  as a very valuable bargain.  There

must be some reason for it. In the days when we

were   in  the  Party,  we  already  had   some

suspicion about the leadership of the P.A.P. We

found  out something - we knew they were prepared

to sell out the people, particularly during the

Anson  by-election,  when  the  Prime  Minister

frankly  said  that we should  not  offend  the

Right-wing  reactionaries.  This  created  more

doubts in the leadership of the P.A.P.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, on the question of merger, why did

the   leadership   of  the  P.A.P. not   seek

permission  from  the people  when  the  merger

terms  were  announced? Why did the P.A.P. dis

tort  the facts? When our terms of merger  were

announced,  the P.A.P. leadership  attacked  us

and  accused us of distorting the facts, saying

that  we were anti-merger. I think the question

of merger is a national issue. Everybody has  a

right  to know. Everybody has a right  to  give

his opinion on merger.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the people should have a final say on

this matter. Why do the P.A.P. try to intimidate

those people who have a sense of responsibility?

We  had asked the Central Executive Committee

to  accept our views on various aspects, but our

views  were all turned down or rejected. Instead

the  leadership  of  the P.A.P. were  very  dis

satisfied  and  accused us of many  things.  All

these  show  that the P.A.P. are  determined  to

sell out the interests of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Minister for Culture has said

that   since   we  the  Barisan  Sosialis   want

Singapore to merge with the Federation of Malaya

and  form a State in it, why did we also  demand

full   internal  self-government?  It  is   very

difficult to understand his logic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Minister for Culture, as one

of the three great leaders of the P.A.P. and one

who  was  at  one time an editor in the  Straits

Times,  could  not understand the organ  of  our

Party.   This  is  something  which   I   cannot

understand. I think he is trying to confuse  the

people on the merger issue. This also shows that

the  theories  and  arguments  advanced  by  the

leadership of the P.A.P. are empty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today things have changed. We have clearly

seen  that the leadership of the P.A.P., because

they want to keep up their names and at the same

time  attack  the Leftists, insist on  having  a

phoney   merger  which  sells  out  the  people.

Otherwise,, they have to accept our amendment to

the  motion for a merger of Singapore  with  the

Federation.

<br><br>3.10 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Inche M. Ismail Rahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche M. Ismail Rahim (Geylang East)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the points of my speech may

have  already been made by hon. Members of  this

Assembly.  But  let  me have an  opportunity  to

speak.  The  objects  of my speech  are  clearly

expressed in the Malay language.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, may I give a reminder that the

people  of  Singapore, on the whole, should  not

get involved when members of the Socialist Front

and others talk about politics in Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>



and   the  Federation,  particularly  political

speeches and utterances about Manchuria and  so

on.   What   will   happen,   particularly   in

Singapore,  if  the  policy  of  the   Barisan

Sosialis  with  regard to a genuine  merger  is

followed? The Barisan Sosialis fights  for  the

people. Which people, Mr Speaker? Nationalists

or  Communists? Mr Speaker, if we continue  to

hear arguments and reasons from the Opposition,

in  particular  from the Socialist  Front,  why

must  the  P.A.P. plan of merger  of  Singapore

with  the  Federation  of Malaya  be  rejected?

There  is  nothing in their arguments that  are

reasonable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we study the heads of agreement reached

between Singapore and the Federation of Malaya,

as  contained in the White Paper,  it  will  be

clearly  seen  that the contents of  the  White

Paper   generally  reflect  the   give-and-take

spirit   of   both  the  Singapore   .and   the

Federation  Governments with  a  view  to  safe

guarding  local  and special  interests,  which

form the legitimate rights of the people of the

two   territories.  Firstly,  the   fundamental

rights  of  the people of the two  territories,

Singapore and the

Federation,  will  not  be  violated   in   the

slightest  way  after merger.  The  fundamental

rights  of  the  people, Mr Speaker,  will  be

adequately   protected   and   guaranteed,   as

enunciated   in  the  Federation  Constitution.

Likewise, the special position of the Singapore

Malays  will  be safeguarded and guaranteed  in

the   future.   The  Federation   of   Malaysia

Constitution  includes, among the basic  rights

of  the  people  of  Singapore  which  will  be

guaranteed according to the Government's merger

proposals,     freedom    of     speech     and

representation, either orally or in writing and

expression  of  views in healthy  publications.

The  privileges  of the people  are  now  being

enjoyed.  The right of the people of  Singapore

to  follow their own religious belief  is  also

guaranteed in the Federation Constitution,  and

also  the  right  to  form associations,  trade

unions  of  workers, to strike and picket,  and

host of other conditions in accordance with the

laws  of  the  State. All these rights  of  the

people  of  Singapore  will  be  protected  and

guaranteed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>

in  the constitution of the future Federation of

Malaysia.  Mr  Speaker, there  are  many  other

basic  and  fundamental  rights  which  will  be

assured in the Federation Constitution and which

we need not go into in detail. Suffice it for me

to    reiterate   that   there   will   be   no

discrimination  at all between  the  people  of

Singapore  and  the people of the Federation  in

the   Federation   of  Malaysia   constitutional

arrangement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of representation in the

Federal House of Representatives and the Senate,

the  position is much the same as for the other

States  now  forming the Federation  of  Malaya,

such  as  Johore,  Selangor or Kelantan,  except

that candidates and voters in Singapore can only

cast   their  votes  in  Singapore.  We  should,

however, bear in mind that, likewise, candidates

and  voters in the Federation can only  vote  in

the  Federation.  Nevertheless,  Singapore  will

have   15   representatives   in   the   Federal

Parliament.  This agreement means that  although

the  electorate in Singapore can  only  vote  in

Singapore, and Federation voters can  only  vote

in  the  Federation, nevertheless Singapore  can

contest seats in the Federal Parliament. This in

turn  means  that, speaking from the  points  of

view   of   political  Parties   and   political

ideologies,  there  is nothing  to  prevent  any

political Party in Singapore, for example,  from

forming an alliance with another political Party

in  the Federation in order to capture power and

eventually hold the reins of government  in  the

Central   Government,  provided  that  the   two

Parties  can  successfully obtain a majority  of

seats  in  the Federal Parliament.  The  Barisan

Sosialis Members demand that all citizens should

become  Federal  citizens  unconditionally.  Mr

Speaker, it is clear in this House that this  is

a  demand  in  extremism. Can we who  are  in  a

position   of  an  applicant  put   forward   an

aggressive  demand  so that  the  supplier  will

accede  to  our demand? It is clear that  if  we

merge with the Federation, we must abide by  the

Federation  laws as laid down by the  Federation

Government. Then only can we say that this is a

judicious and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>



parliamentary  action. Mr  Speaker,  you  will

agree with me that if we ask for the hand of  a

girl,  as  explained  by  a  Member  from   the

Alliance,  both  parties must  be  prepared  to

compromise,  and  whatever  agreement   reached

should  be  satisfactory to both sides.  If  we

simply  try  to  impose our conditions  on  the

other  party the marriage proposal will in  all

likelihood be rejected. If it is rejected, whom

will  the  Members of the Barisan Sosialis  woo

next? I believe the reply is Mao Tse-tung or Ho

Chi Min.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hon, the Prime Minister

has  explained  that if we  effect  a  complete

merger  with  the Federation of Malaya  on  the

basis  of  Penang and Malacca, this  will  mean

that  a  large number of our Singapore citizens

will  lose their citizenship rights. The reason

is that many Singapore citizens cannot meet the

citizenship requirements of the Federation, in

order  to  become  Federal  citizens.  In  this

event,   hundreds  of  thousands  of  Singapore

citizens   will  be  frustrated.  Citizens   of

Singapore  who  are now enjoying various  privileges and benefits in Singapore will lose these

privileges.   These  privileges   include   the

securing  of  Housing Development Board  flats,

jobs  in  the Government service, land  in  the

Jurong development scheme, social welfare dole,

free  education and other social services.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  only those persons  who  become

Federal citizens and only

those  who can satisfy the citizenship laws  of

the   Federation  can  enjoy  such  privileges.

Whereas  all the people of Singapore  who  have

hitherto enjoyed all these privileges will lose

their citizenship rights. They will be deprived

of  all  the privileges I have enumerated  just

now,  because, according to demand made by  the

Barisan  Sosialis and the Member for Queenstown

and  his colleagues, there will be no Singapore

citizenship.  There  will  only  exist  Federal

citizenship. Surely the people of Singapore  do

not want this to happen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the marathon speech of the

Member  for  Queenstown,  he  touched  on   the

education  and labour policies of the Singapore

Government. If we were to accept the demand  of

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>



Barisan   Sosialis,  the  education  policy   of

giving  equal treatment to all language  streams

would   disappear.  Likewise,  much  progressive

labour  legislation which has been  approved  by

the P.A.P. Government would disappear. This will

be  the  result of complete merger. On  complete

merger,  we will have to abide by the  education

and    labour   policies   of   the   Federation

Government. The Barisan Sosialis fear  that  the

wrath  of  the people of Singapore  will  be  on

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to explain further

the  points  raised by Members  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis. They say that the P.A.P. is misleading

the  people, that the P.A.P. is insincere,  that

the  P.A.P. is  cheating the people,  that  the

P.A.P. is bankrupt - blank cheque - and is selling

out the people and frightening the voters. I pay

no  heed  at all to all this. But if the  Member

for  Hong  Lim  says that this is three-quarters

merger,  I  say it means that he agrees  to  the

spirit  of  compromise. Mr Speaker, it  is  not

surprising to me, if we think we are smart or if

we have gone astray, to mislead the others. This

is  a  great  sin.  I would remind  the  Barisan

Sosialis about this. It is like a parrot who can

still talk even now.

<br><br>3.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it the hon. Member for

by the Speaker.'

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can assure the House that I

have  not  the same ambitions as the Member  for

Queenstown  has.  I  was  just  coming  here  to

clarify  a  few  points with my  colleague,  the

Minister for Health and Law.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I had better clear the

atmosphere  in  regard to  that.  There  is  no

objection  at all to any Member taking  another

seat  so  long  as  he takes it  just  for  the

purposes  of  clarification or having  a  brief

conversation with other Members. But it must be

brief.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member for Delta

has such a charming voice that I always say  to

myself  that I should not say "Order"  to  her.

Dr Thio.

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was

saying  just now that the Member for Queenstown

and  the  other Members of the Barisan Sosialis

have  raised three main issues. The first issue

is  based on the term "genuine merger"  in  the

amendment.  By that, Sir, they put  before  the

House  and  before the people of Singapore  the

issue that their's is a genuine merger and  the

P.A.P. type  of  merger is phoney.  Then  they

raise  another issue, that their type of merger

is  complete  and the other type is  incomplete

and,  therefore,  bad or tiga suku.  The  third

issue  raised,  Sir,  is  that  on  Merger  Day

Singapore citizens should automatically  become

Federal nationals and Federal citizens not only

in Singapore but that they should also have the

right  of  transferability to vote or to  stand

for election in any part of the Federation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a former school-master and a student

of history, I have been very unhappy about this

incorrect use of the term "merger". However, it

was  pointed out to me that since it  is  being

used  in the local context to mean any form  of

political union, therefore, I should not raised

any  objection. But listening to the debate,  I

realise that because of the inaccurate  use  of

the  term "merger", there has been a great deal

of  misunderstanding. So the  Barisan  Sosialis

Member  for  Queenstown has rightly brought  us

down to the realisation that we must define the

term  "merger",  and  he  has  used  the  words

"genuine merger". Sir, we have been going round

and round the merry-go-round, round the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



merry Member for Queenstown for days and days. I

think it is time we go to a proper authority and

ask for clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we go to the historians and the

constitutional  experts,  we   find   that   the

information  they give us is very startling.  It

shows   that   the   so-called  genuine   merger

described  by the Member for Queenstown  is  not

only  not genuine but not a merger! If a diamond

claimed  to be a genuine diamond is not genuine,

how   can   it  be  even  a  diamond?  A   clear

explanation  of  the  term  "merger",  as   used

historically to apply to a political  union,  is

given,  Sir,  in  a  book written  by  a  Rhodes

Professor  of History of London University.  The

book

is entitled "Federal and Unified Constitutions"

by A. P. Newton. I propose, Sir, to read very

short extracts from page 2. He is talking about

the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A State's existence continues until society

is completely dissolved into anarchy or until it

is merged into some other State. The merging may

be  complete [so there is a case for a  complete

and an incomplete merger] either by conquest  or

by  voluntary absorption, in both of which cases

[and this is the important point], the existence

of the merged State has come to an end.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if that is what a merger is, then what

the Barisan Sosialis Member for Queenstown wants

is  not  a  genuine  merger,  because  he  wants

Singapore  to go in as the twelfth State.  In  a

genuine  merger, Singapore cannot go in  as  the

twelfth State. Singapore politically must  cease

to  exist  as a State. It can only go  in  as  a

county, as a district or as a province. It  must

lose its State Assembly. It cannot legislate. In

that  case,  we can then describe a State  as  a

unitary State - an example of a genuine merger.

Sir, if this is what a genuine merger really is,

in  the  light  of  history  as  exemplified  by

political unions which are of the genuine merger

type, then we have all gone wrong somewhere.  By

being  too loose in our use of the term, we  are

confusing Members in different sections of  this

House and also members of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>



public.  I  think it is time that  we  in  this

Assembly help people here and outside to  think

rightly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me quote two examples of genuine

merger. Great Britain is a good example,  where

England,  Scotland and Wales have  been  merged

into  one  unitary  State. There  is  only  one

Parliament and these separate States have  lost

their  political  existence - Scotland,  England

and  Wales.  Northern Ireland,  which  came  in

later,  Sir,  refused  to  lose  its  political

identity and existence and, therefore, it  went

in  on  a  special basis, on a loose Federation

basis or confederation basis. That is why today

we  get  the  grouping described as the  United

Kingdom  of Great Britain (that is, the  merged

State) and Northern Ireland.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;South Africa is another example of a genuine

merger. The United States of America are not an

example of a genuine merger. They are a Federal

union. In South Africa, Sir, there is only  one

Central   Parliament.  There  is  no   separate

legislature  in  Natal,  Cape  Colony  or   the

Transvaal. They only have provincial  councils.

All  have been merged under one supreme central

government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one danger about this type of

merger.  Reference has been made to  apartheid.

Where differences of race and language have not

been   completely  reconciled,  it   is   quite

possible  in a merged state for one section  to

dominate  Parliament  and therefore  pass  laws

which are

not quite fair to another section of the

population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Malaya we had a genuine merger type

of  political union from 1946 to 1948. That was

the  Malayan Union. It lasted only three years,

Sir, because the Malays all over the Federation

protested   strongly  against  this   type   of

political  union. The result was  that  it  was

abandoned  and  the Federation  of  Malaya  was

restored to them in 1948. So there is  no  real

example today of a genuine merger -

<div align="center"><b>COMPLAINT ON MATTER OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>PRIVILEGE AFFECTING MEMBER</b></div>

<br><br>3.36 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Acting Leader of the House (Mr S. Rajaratnam)</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes. It is a point of order

affecting  the  privilege of a  Member  of  this

House.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Minister make his

complaint?

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

raise a question of privilege of this House  and

its  Members. The Government Whip, who  is  also

the  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Education, has been prevented by picketers  from

attending today's Legislative Assembly sitting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 2.15 p.m. today, when he was leaving the

Ministry  of  Education at  Kay  Siang  Road  to

attend  this  sitting, some 300  picketers,  who

were   ostensibly  there  for  the  purpose   of

preventing students from going into the  schools

to  take  the examination, stopped  him  at  the

junction of Kay Siang Road. They surrounded  him

and abused him and refused to let him through to

attend  this sitting, despite the fact  that  he

explained  to  them that he was on  his  way  to

attend this Assembly sitting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary was already aware

that  at the T.T.C. earlier this morning,  rowdy

picketers,  who  wanted to  intimidate  students

from  taking  the examinations, had resorted  to

violence  and  hooliganism. Stones  and  bottles

were thrown at the candidates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, not wishing, under the

circumstances,  to  force his  way  through  and

thereby  cause an incident in which  the  police

would  have  to  interfere  and  would  then  be

falsely  accused  of manhandling  students,  the

Member  for Bukit Panjang did not force his  way

through.  He is now beleaguered in the  Ministry

of Education.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, Sir. Sir, there may be

an  impression  outside among these  picketers,

who  are now turning to hooliganism, that  some

Members  of the Assembly support their  pickets

and these acts of hooliganism. I would ask you,

therefore,  'Sir,  to  clarify  the  rights  of

Members  of this House. In particular,  Sir,  I

would  request you to ask all Members  of  this

House  to endorse the motion that no Member  of

this House should be prevented from standing or

leaving  sittings  of this Assembly  under  any

circumstances whatsoever. I seek your guidance,

Sir, on enforcing the motion which was formally

moved  by  the leader of the House on  20th  of

November  and  approved by  this  House,  which

reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That this Assembly orders that the Com

missioner  of Police do take care  that  during

the  present session of this House the passages

through the streets leading to this House be

kept free and open, and that no obstruction  be

permitted  to hinder the passage of Members  to

and  from  this House, and that no disorder  be

allowed in the passages leading to this  House.

and  that  there  be no annoyance  therein  and

thereabouts;  and  that  the  Clerk   of   this

Assembly do communicate this order to

the Commissioner aforesaid.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I ask, therefore, that the Members of

this  House approve this motion, that no Member

should be obstructed or intimidated from  doing

his duty as a representative of the people.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not suppose the Minister is

really moving a motion. This is not the time to

move a motion. I understood the Minister to say

"motion"?

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was

seeking your guidance on this matter.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Of course, I must be satisfied - I

am,   in   fact,  satisfied - that   the   matter

complained  of  does  prima  facie  affect  the

privileges  of  the  Assembly,  and  that   the

complaint  alleging a breach of  privilege  has

suddenly  arisen. Therefore, under our Standing

Orders,  the  matter must be  referred  to  the

Committee  of Privileges, and it is accordingly

so  referred.  But  I would like  to  draw  the

attention of Hon. Members to the fact  that  we

have a Privileges Bill which the Government had

intended to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>

put through all three stages on a Certificate of

Urgency,  perhaps anticipating that  trouble  of

this  nature would arise and that Bill  has  now

been referred to

a  Select  Committee. It will, of  course,  take

some  time before it is passed. Under that Bill,

if,   in  fact,  the  police  had  arrested  any

stranger  who  had  prevented the  Parliamentary

Secretary  from  coming to  the  Assembly,  that

stranger could

have been brought before this Assembly and could

have  been  dealt with at once. But we  are  now

operating  under  the old Privileges  Ordinance,

and section 15 of that Ordinance is the relevant

section. It reads



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Any stranger in respect of the Assembly

who -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) hinders or obstructs any member of the

Assembly  coming to, going from or being  within

the Chamber or the precincts thereof;',



<br><br>and then there are other offences which

are not relevant,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'shall be guilty of an offence and shall be

liable  on conviction to a fine of one  thousand

dollars or to imprisonment for six months or  to

both such fine and imprisonment.'

<br><br>And under section 32:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No prosecution shall be instituted for an

offence  under  this Ordinance except  with  the

written sanction of the State Advocate-General.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in so far as the incident complained of is

concerned, I have no doubt that if the  culprits

or  the strangers are apprehended, they will  be

prosecuted under a fiat from the State  Advocate-General   under  section  15  of  the   present

Privileges Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point, the conduct of Members, I

might as well read the relevant section which is

applicable now - section 20 of the same Privileges

Ordinance:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(1) Any member of the Assembly who -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) assaults or obstructs a member of the

Assembly within the Chamber or precincts of the

Assembly; ...



<br><br>shall be guilty of contempt of the Assembly.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That has not arisen at the moment. For

contempt  in  this Assembly, it is,  of  course,

this  Assembly which can deal with the  culprit.

That covers the point, Mr Minister?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.45 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are

two  points  arising. I mentioned one  whets  I

raised  this  question. Though  I  concede  the

point that the Committee of Privileges has  not

come into being, there is an impression outside

among  the picketers that some Members of  this

Assembly  are not with this House in condemning

them,  and are also perhaps with them in  their

attempt now to prevent Assemblymen from  coming

to this Assembly. A member of this Assembly who

wanted  to  come to this Assembly informed  the

picketers that he wanted to attend a sitting of

this Assembly, but he was prevented. Therefore,

one  way  would be for this House  to  make  it

quite  clear to the picketers that any  attempt

by  any  picketer to obstruct  Members  of  the

Assembly from performing their duties will  not

be  condoned  by  any  single  Member  of  this

Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> That is the first point which

I  think  will greatly assist Members in  being

able  to  perform their duties. If it is  made

quite  clear  outside that any attempt  by  any

outsider to interfere with the right of Members

to  attend  this  Assembly would  at  least  be

condemned  by  this  Assembly,  then  it  would

certainly have a salutary effect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point, I would ask for your

guidance  on  a  practical issue.  There  is  a

Member of the Assembly who has been intimidated

into staying in the Ministry of Education.  How

do  you  propose to help him out of a situation

which  as  you yourself indicated earlier,  has

been brought about because, rightly or wrongly,

there were objections to the rushing through of

the     Legislative    Assembly    (Privileges,

Immunities and Powers) Bill? Therefore, we  are

now  put in a situation where a contingency has

arisen,  where  one  of  our  Members   is   de

liberately  prevented by picketers from  coming

to  this Assembly. Therefore, I am seeking your

guidance on the second end more practical issue

of  how  to ensure the attendance of the Member

for  Bukit Panjang here. I also understand that

the  Minister for Education may be in a similar

predicament.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two points. First, Members of the

House   will  make  it  quite  clear  that   any

picketers  who  interfere with  the  rights  and

privileges  of  the  Assembly  will  meet   with

public  disapproval, and secondly, your guidance

on  the  more  practical matter of how  to  deal

with this situation.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On the first point, it is up to

Members  either in this Assembly or outside  the

Assembly to make definite pronouncements on  the

matter. I cannot, of course, ask them to do  so.

But  they  as Members of the Assembly  would,  I

take it, wholeheartedly approve any action which

might  punish any stranger who is  guilty  of  a

breach  of  the privileges of this Assembly.  On

the  face  of it, it is clear that a  breach  of

privilege has been committed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point as to what can be done,

all  that comes to my mind is that, prima facie,

an  offence has been committed by a stranger  or

strangers  and, therefore, we must rely  on  the

police to bring that stranger or those strangers

to  book.  I  suppose  by  that  means  the  Parliamentary   Secretary - and  the   Minister   for

Education  if  he  is  being  hindered - would  be

released  and perhaps escorted to this  Assembly

House.  As  far  as the Assembly  is  concerned,

nothing further can be done.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am sorry if it is

really true that this Assembly is reduced  to  a

state of impotence as a result of our not having

passed  the  Legislative  Assembly  (Privileges,

Immunities and Powers) Bill. But surely,  whilst

we may not have executive powers, it is our duty

as  a Legislature to express the collective will

of  the  people so that all can know which  side

this House is on - for law and order according  to

the  rules  laid down by the representatives  of

the  people, or according to the rough-house  of

stones and bottles and mobs and hooligans. Since

you  have  so  expressed yourself as discharging

your   functions  as  Speaker  in  drawing   the

attention of Members to relevant sections of the

Ordinance,  and  more  or less  indicating  that

perhaps the police should act, may I say that it

is  not a question of the police being unable to

act but of the Ministers restraining



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>



them  from going into a situation in  which  it

would  be said subsequently that innocent young

students  were  manhandled  by  burly  bullying

policemen.  For this reason, the  Minister  for

Education, who is not here today because, as  I

understand  it,  he  is  beleaguered,  has  not

allowed the police to intervene in any  of  the

incidents  relating  to  the  intimidation   to

enforce the boycott.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you would allow us now, Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  suggest, as a matter of urgency, to  move  a

motion first, that we condemn this conduct, and

second,  that  we  as  representatives  of  the

people  call upon the police - not the Government

calling  upon the police - to ensure  that  those

sections  of  the present Legislative  Assembly

(Powers and Privileges) Ordinance are enforced.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Perhaps you would permit a

suggestion? I would like to suggest that  since

this seems to be a matter of urgency - if we  are

to  accept the Government's statement - that  you

authorise  the  Serjeant at Arms together  with

leaders  of  the  Opposition  Parties  here  to

proceed  to  the place where this gentleman  is

supposed to be beleaguered. I am offering

myself.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. All that I can do is to

say   that   the  matter  will   have   to   be

investigated by the Committee of Privileges. It

might be too late but it has to be investigated

by the Committee of Privileges, proper evidence

taken, and a decision arrived at. What effect a

motion  of  the nature proposed  by  the  Prime

Minister will have, I cannot say. It is  up  to

Members  to  indicate what effect  that  motion

will  have. I myself will give my consent to  a

motion of that nature being moved, and it is up

to hon. Members of this House to express assent

whether or

not  they  wish a motion of that nature  to  be

moved.  Could I have the terms of that  motion,

to start off with?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

suggest perhaps the Acting Leader of the  House

should move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House, taking cognisance of the

complaint on a matter of privilege reported  to

it  by the Acting Leader of the House, condemns

the  conduct  of  the hooligans  who  illegally

prevented the Member for Bukit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>



Panjang  from  attending this  meeting  and  dis

charging his duties as a representative  of  the

people, and calls upon the police to ensure that

the culprits are dealt with according to the law

as laid down in the Legislative Assembly (Powers

and Privileges) Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> A motion of that nature, of

course,  would  require  notice  under  Standing

Order 32 which reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Notice shall not be dispensed with in the case

of   a   motion  or  in  respect  of  any  other

proceeding  for which notice is required  except

with  the consent of the Speaker and the general

assent of Members present.'

<br><br>I  give  my consent. Is it the pleasure of  hon.

Members that the motion be moved?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Aye.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There is no dissentient voice.

Mr Rajaratnam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I formally

move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House, taking cognisance of the

complaint  on a matter of privilege reported  to

it  by  the Acting Leader of the House, condemns

the  conduct  of  the  hooligans  who  illegally

prevented  the  Member for  Bukit  Panjang  from

attending  this  meeting  and  discharging   his

duties  as  a representative of the  people  and

calls  upon  the  police  to  ensure  that   the

culprits are dealt with according to the law  as

laid  down  in the Legislative Assembly  (Powers

and Privileges) Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Member

should   be   described  as  "the  Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Education, who  is

the Member for Bukit Panjang".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

speaking now from memory, but may I suggest that

the  question of privilege is not the  privilege

attaching to him as Parliamentary Secretary  but

to him as a Member of this Assembly?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think that can he

brought  out in the debate. I am just trying  to

decipher  somebody's handwriting which seems  to

be as bad as mine!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

already  indicated the circumstances which  have

induced me to raise this matter, but it is a bit

more pertinent that a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>



motion  of this kind should be endorsed by  the

House  in  view  of  our failure  to  pass  the

Legislative  Assembly  (Privileges,  Immunities

and Powers) Bill, we are powerless. So a motion

of  this  kind would at least indicate that  if

anybody  at any time, not only now but  in  the

future,  prevents any Member of  this  Assembly

from discharging his duties, we would have  the

approval  of the whole House in any  method  we

might  resort to to ensure that the rights  and

privileges  of an Assemblyman are  safeguarded,

even to the extent of calling on the police  to

ensure   that   his  rights  are   safeguarded.

Therefore,  it  is not only a matter  affecting

the  present  case, because  if  there  is  any

wavering  now,  any equivocation,  then  it  is

quite  clear, Sir, that this is the green light

for   hooligans  of  any  sort   to   beleaguer

Assemblymen,  intimidate them and prevent  them

from  discharging their duties as  Assemblymen.

Especially, Sir, in view of the fact that until

such   time   as   the   Legislative   Assembly

(Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Bill  comes

into  being, obviously any hooligan, any  thug,

any   gangster  can,  with  impunity,   prevent

Assemblymen from attending to their  duties  in

this Assembly. Therefore, it is, I think, quite

clear  that  no single Member of this  Assembly

should  have any doubt as to what his  attitude

should be on this motion.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is as proposed by

the Minister. I am having that motion typed, but

Members  are  at  liberty now to  speak  on  the

motion.

<br><br>4.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we on

this  side of the House feel that a motion such

as  the  one moved by the Leader of  the  House

should,  in fact, have the support of the  full

House. We agree with him. But what we are still

a  little uneasy about is that a complaint  has

been  made,  and that there is no investigation

into  the  complaint, and we  are  not  assured

whether  the  fact  that the Member  for  Bukit

Panjang  has not been in this House is that  he

was obstructed, or that he has wilfully decided

not  to come, thereby bringing this matter into

the forefront.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would be very happy to associate .ourselves

with the motion, Sir. If it is only a motion  of

principle which says, "That this House  condemns

in  the strongest terms any people or any  group

of people who wilfully obstruct a Member of this

House,  a  representative of  the  people,  from

entering  this House to fulfil the functions  to

which he has been elected into this House", then

we feel that the words used by the Acting Leader

of  the  House  are not quite  becoming  of  the

spirit  in  which this motion should  be  moved.

This  motion,  Sir,  should  have  no  political

implications nor should it be politic. It should

merely  express  the feeling of the  Members  in

this House that any Member who is privileged  to

sit  in this House should not be obstructed from

coming into this House. And if the Government is

prepared  to amend this motion so that political

implications   are  taken   out   of   it,   and

presumptions  and assumptions are taken  out  of

the  motion, then we are quite prepared - we  are,

in  fact, fully prepared - to support the  motion,

Sir.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the hon. Member then seeking to

move an amendment?

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Sir, what we seek to move

is  more  than an amendment. We seek to ask  the

Government to rephrase or reword the motion,  so

that  words  like "hooliganism"  and  all  those

things  are  taken out, and so that  it  becomes

only  a motion expressing the principle to which

we  are  all committed, that is, any  Member  of

this   House  should  not  be  obstructed   from

entering this House to perform his functions.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think the hon. Member is

entitled  to  ask the Government to  rephrase  a

motion.  If he is not satisfied with the motion,

then  he  moves  an amendment and the  amendment

then could be debated.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Sir, perhaps I might be

permitted  to go just a little bit beyond  that?

In  view  of the fact that the Acting Leader  of

the House has asked for a unanimous vote on this

motion we are asking the Government whether they

are  prepared to rephrase the motion  so  as  to

express only the principle of it, in which  case

he may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>



very well get the unanimous support of the whole

House. I think, Sir, we are more concerned  with

the  principle  behind it and not  the  politics

behind it.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> So the hon. Member is not moving

an  amendment?  I just want to be quite  certain

about that. If the hon. Member wishes to move an

amendment,  then  this is the  time,  unless  he

wishes to move it later on.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Sir, if the Government is

prepared to rephrase the motion, we -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I thought I made myself

very  clear.  The  motion is  a  motion  by  the

Government. And if it is to be altered,  it  has

to be altered by an amendment.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> We will move an amendment,

Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I just make the point

clear,  Sir?  We are not interested in  abstract

principles -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Prime Minister will

have  the  opportunity to debate  the  amendment

when it is moved.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> May I suggest that we

adjourn  this  sitting to allow us  to  make  an

amendment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is a waste of time.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The motion is being typed.

It will be ready in about ten minutes. Is it the

pleasure  of  the House that we  suspend  for  a

short time?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, whilst the motion is

being  typed, perhaps you will allow me to  make

an  elucidation of the Government's attitude  to

this,  because  the  Member  for  Nee  Soon  was

extremely  anxious that he should  not  move  an

amendment  but  that  the Government  should  be

asked  to  rephrase  it. And  I  would  like  to

clarify  that position, although you  have  very

kindly indicated that the proper way is for  him

to  move  an amendment. But, nevertheless,  the

public  impression is, of course,  that  he  has

made  a  request  for rephrasing  to  which  the

Government must respond.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Government prepared to

respond to that? Did I understand that to be the

case?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I must respond at least in

indicating the Government's view  to  it.  The

Member  for Nee Soon was extremely reluctant  to

move  an  amendment for various reasons  of  his

own,   although  he  does  not  alike  the  word

"hooligans" and perhaps one or two other  words.

And  he  has  asked  us to  rephrase.  You  have

pointed  out to him that that is not the  proper

way.  He  must  amend  if he  wishes  it  to  be

removed. Sir, no doubt the debate will go on  to

its  logical  conclusion where if  there  is  no

unanimity,  sides are taken to the  discomfiture

of the people who take the wrong side.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned that there should be no misimpression on the Members, the Stranger's

Gallery,  the  Press  and  the  general   public

outside, that what we are debating now is not  a

question  of abstract principle but two  Members

of this Assembly who are at present beleaguered.

And,  therefore, I would like  to  say  that  no

matter how the thing is phrased or rephrased, as

it  stands it assumes nothing, Mr Speaker, Sir.

It  only  assumes that this House  endorses  the

principle  that  the  law  should  be   enforced

against  these  people,  be  they  students   or

whoever else.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That, I think, is what the

Member  for Nee Soon doubts. And that is why  he

wishes  to make an amendment. I have a  copy  of

the motion; I shall check it first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in case hon. Members have not heard the

exact  terms of the motion, these are the  exact

terms of the motion - copies are being made

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That this House, taking cognisance of the

complaint  on a matter of privilege reported  to

it by the Leader of the House, condemns the

conduct of the hooligans who illegally prevented

the  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Education, who is the Member for Bukit  Panjang,

from attending

this  meeting and discharging his  duties  as  a

representative of the people, and calls upon the

police  to  ensure that the culprits  are  dealt

with  according to the law as laid down  in  the

Legislative Assembly (Powers and Privileges)

Ordinance.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might, for the guidance of the Member

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>



for  Nee Soon, indicate that any amendment which

seeks to enlarge upon this motion will be wrong.

Any  amendment which seeks to lessen the  effect

of the motion will be correct.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No, Sir.

have to wait.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members conferring:

point of order?

make.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will take the motion first. The

motion  before the House is, "That  this  House,

taking  cognisance of the complaint on a  matter

of privilege reported to it by the Leader of the

House, condemns the conduct of the hooligans who

illegally  prevented the Parliamentary Secretary

to the Minister for Education, who is the Member

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Nee Soon has the floor, but a

further statement, of some importance I take it,

has  been received by the Minister. Is there any

objection  that he should add this to his  statement?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members indicated none.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, since the motion was put

before  the House and during the adjournment  we

have received information that when the Minister

for  Education  and the Parliamentary  Secretary

decided  to  come  down and break  through,  the

picketers, for some mysterious reason, this time

agreed to allow them to come here. It is a  very

odd  coincidence,  Sir. But, anyway,  that  only

reinforces  the  need for future  protection  of

Members.  This motion should be passed with  the

assent of the full House today.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Nee Soon.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> The Member for Queenstown

will move the amendment, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The motion at the moment is before

the House. Dr Lee.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we

heard  that  explanation just in time.  We  knew

that  things like that would happen, Sir.  These

were   all   conjured  up.  We  get  strip-tease

politics,  strip-tease  revelations,  the  whole

idea being that they could surprise us with  new

moves  every second. This is not the proper  way

for   the  Government  to  deal  with  important

matters, Sir,If there are important things, let

them be known to the House.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The matter has been raised

as  a matter of privilege, and the Committee  of

Privileges  will have to sit on it. This  motion

is  an  interim motion referring to a particular

incident.  Is the Member for Queentown  alleging

then that the information is false?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would, of course, warn

the  Member for Queenstown that if he makes that

allegation without any substantiation,  then  he

might be before the Committee of Privileges.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Let me explain, Sir. You

yourself   heard  of  the  Tommy  Koh   incident

yesterday. It is right before



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>



our  eyes, Sir. How do we know that this  time

they have got their facts correct?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of elucidation,

Sir, before the Member commits himself further.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member gives way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An Hon. Member:</b> Coward.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member does not give

way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Knowing how the Government

always  twists  and turns, Sir, and  having  the

clear precedent of Tommy Koh's case right before

our  eyes, you cannot blame us for having doubts

on    Government   statements.    Under    those

circumstances,  we cannot possibly  accept  this

motion and we wish to make an amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move, Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 3, to leave out "who", and to insert

therein "if in fact such hooligans",



<br><br>and also, Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 7, to leave out "the police" and

therein to insert "all party leaders to proceed

to such scene at any time necessary and to

report back to the House for further action".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> To leave out from "upon" to the

end in line 7, is that right?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> From "upon" to the end.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I have the amendment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged, Sir,I

understood the Acting Leader of the House to ask

approval of police action because of the persons

being  beleaguered and consequently  they  would

have to be rescued. But in the circumstances now

that  they  are freed, and in the light  of  the

exact   provisions   of   our   Privileges   and

Immunities Ordinance, it seems to me  that  that

part is now tautologous.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>



I would ask whether the Acting Leader of

the House would consider that aspect.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Would the Acting Leader of the

House   like   to   reply  to  that   point   of

clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, Sir. It is quite clear,

Sir,  that  within a few minutes of a motion  of

this  kind having to be debated, there is a  lot

of  agitation. It is not for me to mention  that

outside  the Chamber a lot of phone  calls  were

made, and they had a salutary effect. But it  is

essential,   Sir,  that  this   business   about

beleaguering  people  in schools  will  not  end

today, it would -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is only a point of

clarification.  The Member for Anson  wishes  to

know whether the Minister wishes to retain these

words  in relation to police action in  view  of

the  fact  that the Parliamentary Secretary  and

the   Minister  for  Education  are  no   longer

beleaguered.  That  is the  only  question.  The

answer is "yes" or "no".

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of

clarification, Sir. I understand  the  amendment

moved by the Member for Queenstown.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We had better wait for the

amendment.  I  would  like  to  read  it  very

carefully first before I decide whether it is in

order.  Could  I  have the  last  part  of  the

amendment, please? To leave out from  "upon"  to

the end in line 7, and therein to insert -?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And then to insert therein

"all  party leaders to proceed to such scene  at

any  time  necessary and to report back  to  the

House for further decision".

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> "Such scene", meaning the Ministry

of   Education,  does  it  not?  I  just  cannot

understand it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> This one, at the present

moment, is consequent on the report that came to

us  a  little while ago, and does not apply  any

more,  Sir.  Therefore, I am talking on  general

principle.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is what I understood.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I did indicate before the

adjournment  that  the  effect  of   moving   an

amendment  is  to restrict the field  of  debate

which would otherwise be open on a question. Now

the   motion   itself  relates  to  a   specific

incident, and in so far as the first part of the

amendment  is concerned, that is in order,  when

the Member seeks to leave out the word "who"  in

line   3,  and  to  insert  "if  in  fact   such

hooligans".  The  second part of  the  amendment

seeks  to open out a matter of principle  which,

of  course,  enlarges the present  motion  which

confines  itself  to  a specific  incident.  The

second  part of the motion calls upon the police

to  ensure  that the culprits in this particular

instance are dealt with according to the law  as

laid  down  in the Legislative Assembly  (Powers

and  Privileges)  Ordinance. Therefore,  as  the

Minister has indicated that he does not wish  to

withdraw that part of the motion, the motion  is

still  a  motion  with specific  relation  to  a

specific  incident, and therefore the  amendment

which  seeks  to  open out a  larger  matter  of

principle is out of order.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Under those circumstances,

Sir, I withdraw the second part .



<br><br>4.45 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The question is,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House, taking cognisance of the

complaint on a matter of privilege reported  to

it  by  the  Leader of the House, condemns  the

conduct  of  the  hooligans who  illegally  pre

vented  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to   the

Minister  for Education, who is the Member  for

Bukit Panjang, from attending this meeting  and

discharging  his duties as a representative  of

the people, and calls upon the police to ensure

that  the culprits are dealt with according  to

the law as laid down in the Legislative

Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Ordinance."

<br><br>Since which an amendment has been moved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 3, to leave out "who" and there to

insert "if in fact such hooligans".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the word proposed to be

left out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> We accept the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture the Minister for Education

(Mr  Yong  Nyuk  Lin) walked into  the  Chamber [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am just trying to see

whether the amendment makes sense. Does it  make

sense, Mr Minister?

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I assume the first amendment,

not   the  second - "the  Leader  of  the   House,

condemns the conduct of the hooligans if in fact

such  hooligans illegally prevented  the  Parlia

mentary   Secretary   to   the   Minister    for

Education,".

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Does any other Member wish to

speak on the amendment?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, I am very happy to see this

collaboration  on a matter vital to  the  House.

One cannot but take a serious view of conduct of

the  character  alleged on the  part  of  school

children.

But I would -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are on the amendment

now, which is the addition of the words, "if  in

fact such hooligans".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original Question as amended proposed, "That

this  House, taking cognisance of the  complaint

on  a matter of privilege reported to it by  the

Leader of the House, condemns the conduct of the

hooligans  if  in fact such hooligans  illegally

prevented  the  Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister  for Education, who is the  Member  for

Bukit  Panjang, from attending this meeting  and

discharging  his  duties as a representative  of

the  people, and calls upon the police to ensure

that  the  culprits are dealt with according  to

the law as laid down in the Legislative Assembly

(Powers and Privileges) Ordinance".

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir, I cannot understand. At the time the motion

was  first moved, the second part of the motion,

calling upon the police was logical in the light

of the probable need to force an entry to rescue

the  Member.  But now that he is  free,  I  find

myself at a loss to understand what steps it  is

expected  that  the  police should  take.  As  I

understand  our Privileges Ordinance,  Sir,  the

only  steps  that  would be available  and  that

would make sense

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>



would  be to replace the word "police" with  the

words "State Advocate-General", because it is he

who   issues  the  fiat  for  the  purposes   of

prosecution,  and  not  the  police.  I  am  not

seeking to be obstructive in any way, Sir,I  am

happy  that  the  amendment is  accepted  and  I

completely  agree  with  the  principle  of  the

motion. But I would ask you and the Hon. Members

on the Front Bench to direct their minds to that

aspect. What is it that is intended by the words

"calls  upon the police to ensure", and  whether

what  is intended is that there should be a fiat

for the prosecution?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Anson   is  aware  of  the  provisions  of   the

Constitution in which it is clearly laid down -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> On a point of order. Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I thought the Member  for  Anson

moved  an  amendment to change  the  words  "the

police" to "the State Advocate-General".



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No. I suggested it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I beg your pardon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no doubt

that  the  Member for Anson, being a  practising

lawyer,  is  aware  of  the  provisions  of  the

Constitution  in which it is provided  that  the

State  Advocate-General is the sole  arbiter  to

decide  whether a prosecution should be  brought

or  not. This House has no authority whatsoever,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, to direct the State Advocate-General to adopt any course of action.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Any other Member wishes to speak

on the amended motion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this motion

by  the  Government is a sad reflection  of  the

state  of  affairs to which this Government  has

led  Singapore. As a matter of fact, the  people

of  Singapore, as individuals have the right  to

freedom  of  movement,  and  it  is  up  to  the

Government  to  bear the responsibility  to  see

that every individual,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>



including     Assemblymen,    Parliamentary

Secretaries, Ministers and Prime Ministers, have

the right of movement. The instrument to enforce

this  freedom and right of movement  rests  with

the Government, i.e., the police. Why should the

Government  ask the House to call on the  police

to

ensure that the citizen of a State has the

freedom of movement? In other

words, the Government is abdicating its powers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have not had time to go through the

sections of the Legislative Assembly (Powers and

Privileges) Ordinance, but I see that what  this

Assembly can do under this Ordinance is  to  ask

these  so-called  culprits to  come  before  the

Committee  of Privileges and explain themselves,

and  not to call upon the police to ensure  that

our  Parliamentary Secretaries have got  freedom

of movement.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I have the section

which the hon. Member is referring to, that this

Assembly  has power to call upon these  culprits

to come before the Committee of Privileges under

our  present law? Could the Member give  me  the

section?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, this being a

surprise motion, we did not have the time to  go

through  the Ordinance and I am not sure whether

the Assembly has or has not the power to call up

the culprits.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I might as well explain the

position again. I think I have explained  it  at

length.  The position now is that we are working

under  the old Privileges Ordinance, section  15

of which says that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Any stranger in respect of the Assembly who -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) hinders or obstructs any member of the

Assembly  coming to, going from  or  being

within the Chamber

or the precincts thereof; ...

<br><br>shall  be  guilty  of an offence  and  shall  be

liable  on conviction to a fine of one  thousand

dollars or to imprisonment for six months or

to both such fine and imprisonment.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An offence is committed, and there is nothing

in the Privileges Ordinance to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>



enable the Assembly to bring any culprits under

that section before the Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And section 32 says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No prosecution shall be instituted for an

offence  under this Ordinance except  with  the

written   sanction  of  the   State   Advocate-General.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position, as I see it, is that if an

offence  has been committed under the Privileges

Ordinance,  the  police  act  by  arresting  the

culprits and then it is up to the State Advocate-General  to  decide whether or not a prosecution

would follow.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if this is

a  matter of general principle, we would support

it,  but if this is only just to ensure that the

Government   does   not   want   to   bear   its

responsibility  of  governing  the  country  and

throwing the responsibility of governing  on  to

this Assembly, then we say we have to reject it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I disagree

wholeheartedly  with the Member  for  Hong  Lim.

Sir,  this  is  not a matter which concerns  the

Government. This is a matter which concerns  the

privilege  of  this  House. Now,  this  is  most

unlikely, but it could happen, Mr Speaker, Sir.

If  the  Minister  for Law  disapproves  of  the

conduct of the Members of the Alliance, and  for

some   reason  decides  to  send  one   of   his

detectives to incarcerate the whole  lot  of  us

and  does in fact incarcerate us, and if one  of

us  should  be  so fortunate as  to  escape  the

clutches  of  the  Minister  for  Law  and  come

running  to  this Assembly and lay  a  complaint

before  you,  Mr Speaker, Sir; and  the  House,

what  does the House do? Is the Member for  Hong

Lim  going to say that this is a matter for  the

Government?   It  is  not  a  matter   for   the

Government.  It is a matter which concerns  each

one of us here - the 52 Members of this House -

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification,

please.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I am

faced  with that situation, before I  enter  the

gate of this Assembly, I will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>



see  the  police.  If  I  am  cornered  in  that

position after I have entered the gate,  I  will

see you, Mr Speaker.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in this one

instance,   I   take  pride   that   I,   as   a

representative  of  the  people,  am  above  the

police  and my privileges are entrusted  to  the

custody  of this House, and I will come to  this

House and appeal to it for my protection and not

to the police.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now that is the position. If

the  Leader  of  the House has  misinformed  the

House of the facts, the remedy is with us. If on

subsequent investigation we find that the Leader

of  the  House  has misled the  House  into  its

accepting  this motion, then I think the  Leader

of the House is up for contempt. But in a system

of  democratic  government,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

especially parliamentary democracy, we  reach  a

point  of time when we must trust somebody.  And

when  the Leader of the House in a parliamentary

democracy gets up and makes a statement  in  all

earnestness and all seriousness, the House  must

accept it and not reject it. We entirely support

this motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we

have  been sitting here for the last 8  days,  I

believe,  debating an amendment  to  the  merger

motion  moved by the Minister for Labour,  which

is  going to affect the lives of all our people.

I  have no doubt, Sir, that the Ministers on the

Government  Front  Bench are  fully  aware  that

public  attention is focused on this  House  and

the debate on the motion. But, unfortunately, in

the  last  couple  of days, we have  had  urgent

statements made by Ministers.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I, as Speaker and

guardian  of the privileges of this House,  must

bring this debate into proper focus. A matter of

privilege  has  been reported to this  House.  I

have referred it to the Committee of Privileges.

By  leave of the House, a motion has been  moved

relating to the very incident which has now been

referred to the Committee of Privileges.  It  is

irrelevant  whether  Members  are  prepared   to

believe  the Minister or not at this stage.  The

position is clearly that a statement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>



has  been made by a responsible Minister and - as

the  Member for Farrer Park has rightly said - if

subsequently it is found that the Minister  has

misled this House, then he will be prima  facie

guilty  of  an abuse of privilege and  he  will

find  himself, I take it, before the  Committee

of Privileges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I want now is a debate on the motion as it

stands. Mr Bani.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, in so far as the principle of

this motion goes, we have made our stand clear.

We are all in favour of Members having free and

direct access to this Assembly to perform their

functions. What, in fact, I wanted to ask  just

now was whether the intention of the Government

is   to   contribute  to  the  maintenance   of

respectability and decorum of this House.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I shall not allow that.

This motion is based on the principle which has

been accepted by the Opposition Members. Let us

stick to that aspect of the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I shall just say this, Sir. After

the  motion was moved and the adjournment,  the

Minister   informed   us  that   whoever   were

preventing  the  Minister  for  Education  from

coming  here were not preventing him any  more.

All  that  I  want to point out here  is  this.

Members of this House do not know, in the first

place,   whether  in  fact  the  Minister   for

Education  and the Parliamentary  Secretary  to

the   Minister  for  Education  were  detained.

Secondly, we do not know whether they  were  in

fact  detained by hooligans. Thirdly, now  that

we  are told that the picketers have dispersed,

I  do  not know whether in fact they have  done

so.  But  as  far as the Barisan  Sosialis  are

concerned,  we  agree wholeheartedly  with  the

Government  that  no Member  of  this  Assembly

should  be illegally prevented by anybody  from

entering these premises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to point out that in

so   far   as   this  particular  incident   is

concerned, the place in which it took place  is

outside  the vicinity of this House, and  I  do

not  understand why the Government should  have

thought it necessary to raise this matter here,

ask

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>



Members  of  this House to express their  views,

and  to  state  their stand. I am quite  certain

that  the  fact  that  we have  the  Legislative

Assembly  (Powers and Privileges) Ordinance  and

the  fact  that  there is  a  police  force  are

sufficient provisions to safeguard the rights of

any  individual - be he an ordinary citizen  or  a

Member  of  this House. But however, Sir,  since

this has been brought up here, I want to say, in

conclusion, in quite categorical terms, that  in

so far as the Barisan Sosialis are concerned, we

fully agree with the spirit of this motion  that

no  Member  of  this  House shall  be  illegally

prevented  from  coming  to  sittings  of   this

Assembly  and from performing his duties  as  an

elected representative.

<br><br>5.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, the motion before the House is

something very dear to those who really want  to

see parliamentary democracy at work -





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What do you know of -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> - and not made a mockery of.

Perhaps  I should inform this House of a  little

event which took place this morning when I  went

to work in the Ministry of Education.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am trying to confine the

debate  to this particular incident and  to  the

particular  motion,  otherwise  we  will   never

finish.  If  there are other incidents,  perhaps

tomorrow  will be a very apt opportunity  for  a

Ministerial statement. Mr Yong.





<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> There is, I think, an Order

Paper  for  tomorrow  in  respect  of  which  as

Minister  for Education I would have to  present

the University of

Singapore Bill for Second and Third

Reading. I was preparing this with my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>



Personal  Assistant at around two  o'clock  this

afternoon  when my Parliamentary Secretary  came

into  my  room  and I indicated to  him  that  I

doubted  that  I would be able to  come  to  the

Assembly at 2.30 p.m. and that I would  have  to

finish my work first before coming here. He told

me that he did not have his transport. So I told

him  that  he  could use my car to come  to  the

Assembly.  He  was accompanied by  two  security

officers  and my driver. The car is SS  6103.  I

believe  my  Parliamentary  Secretary  left  the

office  at  about  2.15  this  afternoon  and  I

decided  to walk right across to the other  side

of  the  building where I could at least have  a

look  at  the  group  of  people  who  had  been

picketing  Kay  Siang Road since early  morning.

What   I   could   see  was  my  car   gradually

approaching this nest of young students - boys and

girls - numbering  between 50 and  60.  They  were

chanting. I remember having gone to Bali to  see

what  is called a "ketjak" dance, where a  group

of  people  would  sing  songs  in  this  manner

"ketjak,  ketjak, ketjak". I could  see  from  a

distance that my car was not permitted to  leave

and  that  it  had to get into reverse  gear  to

return.  They  were jumping with  joy  at  their

victory  to prevent the Parliamentary  Secretary

from  coming  to  this Assembly to  perform  his

duties both as an Assemblyman and as the Whip of

this Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, Sir, is what I personally saw. There

were  witnesses  to this. I am sure  there  were

many  people  in the Ministry of  Education  who

were watching.

<br><br>5.10 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very fortunate

to  have  got  myself free  and  to  reach  this

Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Events developed in this way. This morning at

about 9 I went to my office at Kay Siang by  way

of  Kay  Siang Road. I saw a group  of  students

blocking the road. I came out of my car and told

them  that I wanted to go to my office for duty.

I asked them to let me go on, but they shouted a

slogan,  "Lee  Khoon Choy, go into the  coffin!"

They

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>



shouted "Lee Khoon, khoon Choy" I asked them why

they  did  not  want  to  take  the  Government

examinations and they replied, "Your  Government

want to destroy Chinese education." I told them,

"Let us not talk about this. Will you please let

me go to my office for duty?" They replied, "No,

you  cannot  do  that. You must  accede  to  our

request." Then I said, "This is something  which

I  cannot do. So will you please let me go  in?"

But  they  surrounded me. I found the  situation

was  not right because they were sitting on  the

road with their buttocks facing me. I found  the

situation  not very pleasant. So I proceeded  to

my office by way of another path. There was also

another  group of students who were not  perhaps

well  organised, and they were shouting slogans.

Later on, at 2.15 in the afternoon I borrowed  a

car  from the Minister, because my car was under

repair, - I had told my mechanic to take  away  my

car  at about 11 o'clock in the morning - to leave

the  office  by  Kay Siang Road. This  group  of

students saw me and they blocked me again. There

were  about  seven  or eight of  them  and  they

pressed against the car. Some of them surrounded

me. I told them that I was on my way to come  to

this  House  for  a sitting but they  would  not

listen. 'They continued to shout that slogan and

they would not listen to what I said. As I found

the  situation was not right and as  I  did  not

want  to  see any incident, I had to turn  back.

When  they  saw  this, they put up  their  hands

shouting,  "We  have  won! We  are  victorious!"

These are the events which took place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have forgotten to mention another point. When

I  went  out, there was a member of a radio  car

following me. If you do not believe what I  have

told  you here, we can let you know the kind  of

slogans  they shouted. Some of them were abusive

and I was called bad names.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I would like to ask the

Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for

Education this question. He speaks

of  a quarter past two. What happened between  a

quarter  past  two  and  the  time  this   House

received  the  motion  about  4  o'clock?   What

happened in the interim period?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): After my

return  to the Ministry of Education,  I  saw  a

group  of  students. And since they  were  still

there, I thought it was useless to force my  way

out.  And my staff reported to me that all of  a

sudden   those  students  dispersed.  They   had

disappeared.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> What time was it?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): This came as

a  surprise  to me because at that time  it  was

round  about  4.10  or 4.15, and  the  time  for

office hours to be over is half-past four.  They

told  me,  "If you want to leave, you can  leave

because the students have dispersed." But I  was

wondering whether the students could disperse so

easily  and  so  early.  And  where  could   the

students  get the information? Could it  perhaps

come from this Assembly? I was wondering. Now  I

have come to this House.

<br><br>5.17 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, just now we have

moved   an  amendment.  The  principle  is   the

safeguarding of all Assemblymen so that they can

move  freely in the vicinity of this House. This

is  without question. We quite agree.  But  from

what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for  Education  has reported to us,  this  shows

that  there  is  some motive in suddenly  moving

this  motion  today. The point is whether  there

was  anyone who had telephoned the students from

here  about the Assembly discussing this matter,

and the students therefore dispersed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support the motion safeguarding the rights

of  Assemblymen.  But  from  the  motion  as  it

stands,  we  have ample reasons to believe  that

the  Government is making use of this motion  to

hint that we have connections with the students.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that the Government, while

debating  on a very important question affecting

the  future  of  the people of  Singapore,  were

aware  that  they  were at a disadvantage,  that

there were no reasons or grounds to support -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is completely

irrelevant. Come back to the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, according to the Parliamentary Secretary to

the Minister for Education, we, in fact, had  no

need  to  pass  this  motion in  this  Assembly.

According to him, the hooligans were only  about

the  ages of 15 and 16, and they were not trying

to  hurt him or put him in a coffin. There was

no   such   intention.  But   if   he,   as   an

educationist,    could   not   persuade    these

youngsters  and youths, then he should  go  back

and  ask the staff of the Education Ministry  to

persuade    the   students.   But   since    the

Parliamentary Secretary felt that it was a great

danger  to  him  and that he  needed  the  whole

Assembly  to  protect him, then, of  course,  we

sympathise with him. But if what he has told  us

is  a  fact,  then in principle,  as  our  Party

Chairman  has said, we have moved the amendment.

And  I  hope that after the amendment is passed,

the Parliamentary Secretary will feel safe to go

to  his  office. Psychologically  he  will  feel

safe.  This  will give him a sense  of  security

perhaps.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is a very simple motion,

Sir. I  think it was useful that we  moved  and

debated it in this Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are passing through an extremely

delicate situation -

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Last days!

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, the last days for

adventurers  who  wander off into  the  unknown,

guided by wrong Barisan stars.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. He must try and keep

strictly to the motion. None of these jibes  and

counter-jibes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The position, as we see it,

is  quite  simple.  There is absolute  calm  and

reasonable serenity in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>



City.  And a desperate group of people  want  to

provoke  an incident somewhere, some  place,  to

cause      resentment,     chaos,     confusion.

[Interruption].

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And nothing better, Sir,

than  the  traditional usage  of  young,  little

school   children.  They  are   young,   usually

innocent, sometimes misinformed. And if they get

injured in a collision with the police, sympathy

must  naturally go to them. The Member for Anson

went through it, Sir, at tremendous cost to  his

own peace of mind, as he tried very hard through

the  years 1955-56 to get a semblance of  order,

decency and fair play. And he went through a lot

of stresses and strains.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Point of order, Sir. I wonder if

this is relevant to the motion.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have indicated that we are now

debating a specific incident and, therefore,  we

must stick to it. A peroration is all right, but

it  should not become too lengthy or go into too

much details.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am not particularly fond

of  perorations, but I have an aversion to riots

where students are

concerned.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> His successor, the Member

for   Cairnhill,  went  through  an,  even  more

difficult and trying phase.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am sorry to have to

interrupt  the Prime Minister, but  we  are  now

debating a particular incident. And if the Prime

Minister  is  allowed to go on in  that  strain,

then,  of  course,  it will open  up  the  whole

debate  as  to who are hooligans,  why  are  the

students  acting in this way, and so on  and  so

forth. I cannot allow it. We are now asking  the

House, having taken cognisance of the complaint,

to condemn the hooligans who illegally prevented

the  Parliamentary Secretary from coming to this

House.  And the House is asked to call upon  the

Police  to  ensure that the culprits  are  dealt

with. That is all.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And that is a great deal,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, because had we  not  debated

this  motion  and had we tried  to  enforce  the

Legislative  Assembly  (Powers  and  Privileges)

Ordinance, there would have been a riot. That is

the  point  I wish to, make, a very simple  one,

and  obvious to the Member for Thomson.  He  has

been  through this drill before, and he  is  not

such an innocent man. We wanted to ask them here

in   this  Assembly  this.  First,  whether   an

Assemblyman should be prevented from  coming  to

this  House, on principle. And second, if he  is

prevented,, whether the police  should  enforce

the  law  according to the Legislative  Assembly

(Powers and Privileges) Ordinance. Because if we

had  not asked them first, I suggest to you, Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  whilst  we  are  debating   the

proceedings and hearing dreary repetitions which

you  yourself, I understand, have  indicated  to

Party  leaders and the Whip are getting drearier

and drearier and more and more repetitious, then

the  police  would  have  had  to  intervene - the

Parliamentary Secretary wants to  get  out,  the

students push the car back, somebody is  injured

in the scuffle, the police come in, and students

would  have  been  browbeaten, battered  by  the

police.  Resentment  mounts,  temper  goes   up,

confusion, wild allegations, rumours [Interruption].

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> So we adopted a very simple

procedure  and a very constitutional one - to  ask

all  Members in this Chamber to state where they

stand.  And when they were asked to state  where

they stood, fortuitously, Mr Speaker, Sir,  the

kids  decided  to go home. Cannot  we  at  least

congratulate  ourselves on the forbearance,  the

patience - I  know you must find it a bit  trying,

so  do  we  on this side of the House - which  had

saved us a great deal of trouble?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not going to end here. Let us face

it. The Member for Queenstown has suggested that

Party   leaders  should  visit  the  scene,   on

principle.  And you have ruled it out  of  order

because - obviously  such a situation  will  arise

again  in  the  future - he suggested  that  Party

leaders,  after  a  man  had  been  beleaguered,

should go there and explain.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That has been ruled out of

order,  and  I do not think the Prime  Minister

will be in order to refer it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I was only supporting

your ruling.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think I need any

support!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Perhaps that is a wrong

choice   of  words.  May  I  express  my   deep

admiration for the ruling?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this? This is not the end. And I think

the Leader of the House is going to suggest that

those who do not support this kind of act, which

is  bound  at  least  to be provocative - at  some

stage  or  the other, a fuss, a bloody  nose,  a

broken arm, the police brought in -



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You will be safe!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b>Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> - I suggest to those

Party  leaders  who do not like this,  let  them

tomorrow  join hands with the parents  and  stop

this hooliganism.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Rajaratnam, in reply?



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Yes. Mr Speaker, Sir, I

wonder  whether this motion is necessary because

the   power  to  deal  with  people  who  hinder

Assemblymen  coming  to  Assembly   sitting   is

already contained in sections 15 and 16  of  the

Ordinance.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have tried to explain it two or

three  times. I do not know whether  the  Member

for  Hong  Lim  is deliberately misunderstanding

the  Chair. The Chair has just pointed out  that

there has been an allegation that an Assemblyman

has  been prevented from coming into the  House.

The  law  says  that anybody who  does  that  is

guilty  of  an  offence.  That  person  can   be

arrested  and then prosecuted in court  under  a

sanction  of the State Advocate-General.  In  so

far as the motion is concerned, it asks the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>



House  to  condemn  such conduct  and  asks  the

police  to  ensure that the culprits  are  dealt

with according to the law. That is all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rajaratnam, in reply?

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I do not propose to spend

a  great deal of words over this, except to  say

that this motion is being passed purely because,

as   has   been   indicated,  Sir,   since   the

Legislative  Assembly  (Powers  and  Privileges)

Ordinance has not come into force, we  are  left

helpless.   But  let  us  not   use   the   word

"helpless",  because we have not been  helpless.

The fact that we are able to bring a motion like

this  and  have  it debated has had  a  salutary

effect.  We  have  been able to  deal  with  the

situation without having to call in the  police.

All Members of this House have indicated plainly

and categorically that any group of individuals,

whether  today or in the future, who attempt  to

prevent any Assemblyman, whether on this side of

the  House  or on that side of the  House,  from

coming  here to discharge his duties  would  not

only  meet  with the condemnation of Members  of

the  House  but any action taken to enforce  the

will  of  this House would have the approval  of

the Members of this House. That is the point  of

this  motion,  and it is on that basis  that  we

have  brought  it forward and have persisted  in

asking  the House to declare its stand  on  this

motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That this House, taking

cognisance  of  the complaint  on  a  matter  of

privilege  reported to it by the Leader  of  the

House, condemns the conduct of the hooligans  if

in  fact such hooligans illegally prevented  the

Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for

Education,  who is the Member for Bukit  Panjang

from attending this meeting and discharging  his

duties  as  a representative of the people,  and

calls  upon  the  police  to  ensure  that   the

culprits are dealt with according to the law  as

and Privileges) Ordinance".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Item 2 on the Order Paper,

debate  on the amendment as shown in that  item.

Dr Thio.

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

afraid  most  of us have forgotten what  I  said

before the interruption. So, Sir, forgive me  if

I try to bring the threads together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying, Sir, that in the eyes of

historians and constitutional experts, the  term

"genuine  merger" or "complete  merger"  is  not

really applicable to the Malayan situation.  Use

it  loosely if we must, but we have  to  say  it

clearly that in a loose sense, the word "merger"

applies  to  practically any form  of  political

union.  Because of the Government's  mistake  in

not  clarifying  the term, the Barisan  Sosialis

Member  for Queenstown has followed up that  mis

take by arguing in favour of a genuine merger as

against a phoney merger. I am afraid the  public

outside are being misled because of that. It  is

important   to   realise  that   what   we   are

considering



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>



for  Malaya are various forms of partial merger,

and  these  forms  are known  to  historians  as

Federal  unions. Federal unions are  of  roughly

two  kinds.  One kind is that of  a  federation,

sometimes  tighter than others,  sometimes  less

tight.  Another form is the confederation  type.

In   between,   there  again   may   be   slight

variations.  Each one, Sir, has its own  special

characteristics.  For the sake  of  analogy,  to

enable  some  people  to understand  better  the

difference between these two types, let  us  say

that  a  federation  is like  a  hand  with  the

fingers  linked  together to the  main  body  by

means  of the palm and the arm. Now, the  States

in  the Federation have some liberties, Sir, but

they  cannot move round and round like the  arm.

They are restricted in their movements. They are

States in a federation. They are one in a sense,

but the emphasis here is on all the powers being

given  to  the  Central  Government  except  for

certain  specified ones given to the States.  In

the  case  of  a confederation type  of  partial

merger, Sir, Singapore is like the whole arm. It

gives  to  the  Central Government only  certain

specified powers like external affairs,  defence

and  security; then all the rest  are  given  to

Singapore.  It is a very loose type  of  federal

union, generally known as a confederation. Where

the  people  are  not ready to be  closely  tied

together  because  of differences  of  language,

customs  and  religious  beliefs,  they  usually

start  by  going  on  to the  first  stage,  the

confederation type of federal union.  When  they

have  learnt  to trust one another better,  then

they  go  on to the second stage, the federation

type  of  federal union. When they  have  really

sunk  all differences and have become completely

malayanised  so that they can think together  as

one  without reservation, without any fears  and

any  suspicions then they go on to the last  and

ultimate  stage,  that  of  genuine  merger   as

exemplified in Great Britain and in the Union of

South  Africa. But to press for a genuine merger

right  away when we have not yet sorted out  our

differences may give rise to a situation, as  in

South Africa, where the coloured races feel that

they are being discriminated against.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Swiss confederation began as far back

as  1291. That was the first federal pact  known

in  modern history  - 1291 - centuries before they

learned to trust one another enough until  final

ly,  round about 1848, they formed their federal

republic, the same type of federal union  as  we

see  in  the Federation, with slight variations.

The  American States also went through the  same

stages. On 15th November, 1777, 13 States signed

the Articles of Confederation. Their purpose was

for a firm league of friendship with one another

for common defence, security of their liberties,

and their mutual and genuine welfare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if Singapore wishes to link up with the

Federation  in  a tight federation  but  if  the

Malays  are  unprepared to accept  Singapore  on

that basis, then, of course, our - I am using  the

term roughly now - merger plans will never advance

one  inch. But because the American States began

with  a  confederation,  10  years  later,  Sir,

having   developed  sufficient  trust   in   one

another,  and  having become  convinced  of  the

greater  strength  to  be produced  in  a  tight

federation,  they then formed the United  States

of America on a federal basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the Alliance believe that although

we  all  aim for genuine merger as the ultimate

type, in order to ensure success, we have to do

it  by  stages. If necessary, we should go  for

the  first stage, the confederation stage; then

after  five years, review the position, and  go

for  the federation type; then after that, when

the people are all ready, we can have a genuine

merger type of union.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another important point to remember is

that  political unions are like different suits

of   clothes  of  different  sizes.  They   fit

different  people at people at different  times

according  to their different ages. One  cannot

say  that this suit is complete and, therefore,

it  is  good  that  suit  is  incomplete,  and,

therefore,  it  is bad. On that basis,  Sir,  I

suppose,  because  I  wear  a  complete   suit,

therefore, I am in a better position than those

who wear incomplete suits. They find themselves

more comfortable,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>



perhaps,  to  be  in  incomplete  suits.   The

Barisan  Sosialis  friends may  find  it  more

comfortable to be in incomplete suits -

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> In bikini!

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I would not want to say,

Sir, that their type of clothes is inferior to

mine.  They just like those clothes, so  there

they are. If people like an incomplete type of

merger  today, well, that is the best  way  to

make  them  happy. Why insist, Sir, that  they

should

wear one type of clothes? I would not want  to

insist  that every Member of this House should

wear  a suit like yours, Sir, with due respect

to -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon Member is

drawing analogies, he should try and draw  his

analogies   as  against  extraneous   matters,

because I can assured him I am feeling  a  bit

hot in my wig!



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I am trying to bring

out this point, that the issue that a complete

merger  is therefore superior to an incomplete

merger  is  a  wrong issue.  At  the  seaside,

people find it better to be in scanty clothes.

Here  they  prefer to have warmer clothes.  In

the  same way, Sir, in Singapore with so  much

independence  of spirit shown  by  youngsters,

they may prefer greater freedom. They may want

a  looser  form  of merger than  that  in  the

Federation. Therefore, the confederation  type

of  federal union would suit them well,  where

only certain specified powers are reserved  to

the Central Government and all residual powers

are given to the State of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I suggest we reconsider whether or not

a  form of political union is suitable for us

on   the  following  basis.  We  should   ask

ourselves  whether  this  form  of  political

union is suitable, workable and acceptable to

the  contracting countries. If it is suitable

to  only  one  or two and not  to  the  rest,

acceptable only to one and not to the  other,

Sir,  then  we  do  not have  the  basis  for

agreement.  Therefore,  merger  negotiations,

again using the term roughly, would fail.  Se

condly,  we should ask ourselves whether  the

type  of political union we are pressing  for

makes for greater or less racial

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>



harmony  and happiness. Thirdly, is it  mutually

beneficial?  And  fourthly,  does  it  help   to

promote   greater   economic   prosperity   and,

therefore, greater chances of employment for our

people?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, considered on this basis, the Barisan

Sosialis suggestion that a citizen ,of Singapore

should  have  transferability of votes - they  say

they  have the right to transfer themselves over

the  Causeway  to vote or to stand for  election -

would frighten the Malays in the Federation.  If

I  were a Malay, I would appreciate it better. I

ask my fellow Members who are not Malays to look

at  it from the view-point of the Malays, to  be

fair.  It  is  like saying we  want  to  have  a

confederation with more liberty for  the  State,

yet we want the right for one arm to go over and

be merged with the other arm. Two arms to become

one  arm.  If  you want a choice,  you  have  to

choose  one or the other. You want more liberty,

then  there is the confederation. You want  less

liberty  for  the  State,  then  that   is   the

federation status.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viewed, however, from the Chinese side in

Singapore, the Barisan Sosialis type of  partial

merger is wonderful. We want everything. We want

freedom  and  we  want  the  right  to  have   a

majority. If we are indifferent to the  feelings

of  the  Malays, then we will say, yes, that  is

the  type  of partial merger we want. But  I  am

sure,  having  lived in Malaya so long,  we  are

appreciative of the fears and resentments of our

Malay friends and brethren. If we are trying  to

develop  a  new nation, we should be fair-minded

and  not arouse unnecessarily in them more fears

and   suspicions.  If  we  do  that,  then   the

confederation type is the best for everybody.  I

have said, Sir, that after 5 years we can review

the  position. Supposing we say that the Barisan

Sosialis insists and we all vote for the Barisan

Sosialis  amendment that there must be automatic

conversion  of Singapore citizens to  Federation

citizen  nationals, and not only  that,  but  we

also  must  have  the right to go  over  to  the

Federation and vote and stand for election, then

we  know the answer. It will be no. We may  like

it  in  Singapore, but from the Federation  side

the  answer  will be no. That being so,  we  are

then forced to go back to the status quo.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>



Here,  Sir,  there are two groups of people  who

might   favour  the  status  quo.  The   Barisan

Sosialis have said that they are willing to have

self-government   with  the  Internal   Security

Council  removed.  But,  Sir,  we  can  see  the

dangers  here. If the internal Security  Council

is removed, we might become an East Berlin where

there will be even less freedom than now. On the

other hand, I think there are a small number  of

people  who  are dreaming of the time  when  the

British  will  scrap the Constitution  and  they

will  go  back to the colonial status.  If  they

want  that,  I  think  they are  dreamers.  They

cannot  turn the clock back. In order to  awaken

them  from their sleep, I would like to  recount

an  incident  which took place in  Kuala  Lumpur

some  six  or seven years back when Sir  General

Templer - a  man  who should know British  policy - said  (this  is  a paraphrase),  "Even  if  some

people  may want us to stay here longer,  events

may  take place outside this country and in  the

United Kingdom which will compel us to hand over

the  government to you people. So  for  goodness

sake, organise yourselves as quickly as possible

to  take  over  the government."  Sir,  when  an

officer  of  that calibre gives  advice  to  the

local  people to organise themselves as  quickly

as  possible  and  be ready  to  take  over  the

government,  then  I plead with  those  who  are

still  sleeping that they must not stand on  the

side-lines  and allow the country  to  be  taken

over  by  extremists.  They  must  assume  their

responsibilities and make sure that democracy is

a success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today we stand at a very important point

on  the road towards nationhood. The past has  a

lesson  for  us  so that we can build  a  better

future.  In  1946-48, many of us  remember  that

there  was  a great deal of communal tension  in

Singapore  and  the  Federation.  There  was   a

hartal. The Malays were organising themselves to

resist. People were keyed up for a big fight.  I

am  glad  to  say that a spirit of goodwill  and

understanding came to ten top Malay leaders  and

ten  top Chinese leaders, and they met at Johore

Bahru  to discuss the problem. The Malays  said,

"We have political power but you have economic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>

power.  If you help us to rise economically,  we

must naturally share with you our economic power

because  the  Chinese  and  Malays,  being   the

largest  communities,  must  live  together  har

moniously  like brothers or we shall never  have

peace  and  harmony  in this country."  In  that

spirit, I am glad to say, they were able to turn

the  course  of  history. Now  people  say  that

Malaya is an example of racial harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Sir, on this merger issue, we face

another  cross-road. I appeal to the leaders  of

the   various  communities  in  Singapore,   the

Federation and even Malaysia, to have  the  same

spirit  of  goodwill and understanding  and,  in

that  spirit, seek to find the best form of poli

tical  union which will enable us to come closer

and closer together until

we become a united nation. Sir, this takes time.

Some  want to rush into a united nation at  once

by  forcing their own brand of merger, but I ask

them to consider that if we force the Malays  to

accept  a  political union on  those  terms,  it

might   mean   failure;  whereas   if   we   are

understanding and are prepared to move  forward,

first on the basis of a confederation, and  then

reconsider the position after five years  to  go

into  a  tight federation, we shall be  able  to

reach  the goal which the Barisan Sosialis  want

but  do not quite comprehend - the goal of genuine

merger.



<br><br>6.36 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, in the last few days, Members  of

the  Opposition, especially those in the Barisan

Sosialis,  have  made lengthy  speeches  on  the

question  of genuine merger. They have talked  a

great  deal  on the amendment of the Member  for

Queenstown in the hope of dealing the Government

a blow. As a matter of fact, we have seen in the

last few days that it is impossible for a fox to

hide  its own tail. It may be able to do so  for

the time being, but its appearance -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of order. Is the

hon.   Member  referring  to  Members   of   the

Opposition as animals?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the interpretation is correct -

I  am  sure it is correct - then she is  alleging

that some Members are foxes hiding their tails.

I  have always discouraged likening Members  to

any type of animal.

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, if that is the case, I will  use

another form of expression. They are trying  to

make  use  of  the clothes of other  people  to

cover themselves. But in any case, however hard

they  try to cover themselves up, they will  be

shown for what they are.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moving of the amendment by the Barisan

Sosialis clearly shows what it amount to.  They

pretend  to  be sincere in learning the  Bible,

but  all the time they are pretending to  learn

it.  So this is only a very lame excuse. If the

Barisan  Sosialis have no intention  whatsoever

of  reflecting the desire of the people in  the

Federation  and Singapore, then  how  can  they

think  of  such things as a genuine merger  and

their amendment to the motion? If a person does

not want to do good deeds, what is the point of

asking a priest to pray for him? This behaviour

of the Barisan Sosialis is significant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday I heard the Member

for  Choa  Chu  Kang say - this  is  reported  in

today's   Nanyang  Siang  Pau - that  since   the

inception of the Barisan Sosialis, it  has  not

changed its stand on

merger  of  Singapore with the  Federation  and

that  its stand will remain the same in future.

But if it only wants to express its stand, then

I  think  it is totally unreliable. We can  see

from  the  speeches of Members of  the  Barisan

Sosialis that their stand on merger is changing

all  the time. They can change like the  Monkey

God   which  can  change  itself  into  several

shapes. In a statement reported in the Sin Chew

Jit  Poh  of 30th August, they said that  their

stand   on   merger  of  Singapore   with   the

Federation  was  that they  must  have  a  true

merger  immediately so that  Singapore  can  go

into  the Federation as a State like Penang  or

Malacca. However, on 2nd September, the  leader

of   the   Barisan  Sosialis - the  Member   for

Queenstown - was  reported in the same  newspaper

to  have  said  in reply to certain  statements

made in this House that he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>



reiterated the stand of the Barisan Sosialis for

a  self-governing  State of Singapore.  He  said

that  the  abolition  of the  Internal  Security

Council  should  be achieved  by  1963  so  that

Singapore  will  be an internally self-governing

State. From this kind of statement -

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of order. The

hon. Lady is reading from a document. Would  she

mind  quoting the other paragraphs as well, Sir?

She  is  only  quoting a portion of  it  and  it

distorts the whole view.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If there is a paragraph in the

cutting  of  the  newspaper which  contains  the

quotation,  then the whole paragraph  should  be

read,  so that the quotation will not be out  of

context.

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, if it is necessary, I do not  mind

reading  the paragraph. But I feel that what  he

said in this particular paragraph is contrary to

what has been said previously. He said that  the

Barisan  Sosialis may consider the confederation

proposal, including the Borneo territories,  but

it  must  be  one in which there  must  be  full

internal  selfgovernment. Therefore, as  I  said

just now, if the stand of the Party is what  the

Member  for  Choa Chu Kang has said,  then  that

stand is unreliable. And if what he has said  is

only  his personal view, then that is even  more

unreliable.



<br><br>6.47 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair].</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Why do I

say so? It is this: I remember the time when  he

was in the P.A.P. He obviously agreed to the  ob

jectives and stand of the P.A.P. And because  he

agreed  to such objectives, he joined us in  our

struggle. But how does it come about that he has

now  parted from us? Well, mainly it is  because

he  wants a stand that is different from that of

the  P.A.P. For this reason, he has crossed  the

Floor to join the Barisan Sosialis opposite. Now

that  he is in the Barisan Sosialis, he  is  not

sure  whether the Barisan Sosialis has  a  clear

stand.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>



And  if  this stand is not agreeable to him,  I

wonder whether he will do anything about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the question of merger, which is

a  reflection  of the desire of the  people  of

Singapore and the Federation, we must say  that

the  reunification of these two territories  is

inevitable  because geographically, culturally,

and  economically, Singapore has all along been

a part of the Federation, and the reunification

of   these   two   territories   is   therefore

inevitable. Since 1946 all anti-colonial people

and  true nationalists have shouted this slogan

of  reunification, and the P.A.P. has been  one

of  them. Even as early as 1954 the P.A.P. put

forward its own objectives, that is, to end the

rule  of  the  colonialists in order  to  bring

about  a  democratic, non-Communist,  socialist

Malaya.  All along, the ideology and spirit  of

the   P.A.P. has  never  deviated  from   such

objectives.  All along we have been  struggling

honestly and decidedly according to our  stand,

i.e. to  lead  the  people  forward  in   the

achievement  of  a  democratic,  non-Communist,

socialist  Malaya. And it is  because  of  this

correct stand of ours that we have been able to

get  the  support  of  the various  classes  of

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Barisan Socialis Members opposite

say that the question of merger today is a sort

of  trick played by the P.A.P. in the past  few

months in order to save its precarious position

in  power.  They say that since the P.A.P. has

assumed power, there has been little or no talk

at  all about this matter. As a matter of fact,

in  our  policy speech as reported in a booklet

published in 1960 by the Editorial Board of the

P.A.P.,    we    said    this-regarding     the

constitutional talks with the British on merger

between the Federation and Singapore, "We  must

reiterate  the  stand  of  the  P.A.P.  We  are

standing  firm on our stand. If we do not  have

sufficient  force or strength  and  ability  to

carry out our policy and get the support of the

people, then we shall fail."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this booklet, there is yet another

paragraph  which touches on this.  Some  people

think  that Singapore can become an independent

State by itself. There



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>

is  another proposal - we must start talks on  co-operation  between Singapore and the Federation.

Are  we  to  achieve independence through  talks

with  the  Federation, or are we to  have  talks

with   the  British  to  get  independence   for

Singapore itself?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1957 when our Secretary-General stood for

the  by-election  in Tanjong  Pagar,  there  was

controversy  in this matter. At  that  time  the

question  was  whether  it  was  practical   for

Singapore to get independence. Or whether it was

proper for Singapore to get independence through

merger  with  the  Federation,  which  meant   a

greater   unity,  viz, from  a  merger  between

Singapore  and  the Federation, Singapore  could

get  its independence. And because this question

was brought up during the by-election in Tanjong

Pagar,  our representative was returned.  So  it

would  be incorrect to say that we never  talked

about  the  question of merger in the  past  few

years. As a matter of fact, merger is one of the

objectives of the P.A.P.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the propaganda line of the

Barisan  Sosialis  is  not  well  defined.  They

cannot,  on  the one hand, disregard  the  clean

record of the P.A.P. over a period of some seven

years, and on the other hand, accuse us of being

unreasonable in trying to sell out  the  people.

As  a  matter of fact, I say that those who  say

this are themselves unreasonable. They tried  in

the past to overthrow the P.A.P. Government. The

situation actually became clear during the Anson

by-election.  At  that time  the  so-called  six

trade  union  leaders in Singapore  published  a

statement  against the objectives of the  P.A.P.

that  is,  that  we  should have  a  truly  full

internal  self-governing State of  Singapore  by

1963.  And  before the by-election,  our  Deputy

Prime Minister reiterated the objectives of  the

P.A.P.'s  struggle, namely, to go  through  with

merger  with  the Federation and  to  achieve  a

fully  independent Singapore. On the 13th  June,

the six trade union leaders of the P.A.P. issued

a  statement in which they repeated their desire

to  have a full internal self-governing State of

Singapore. Four of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 954.</b></font><br><br>



these six trade unionists are now in the Central

Executive  Committee  of the  Barisan  Sosialis.

Subsequently,  unfortunate  events  took   place

within  the P.A.P. Eight Members who broke  away

from  the  P.A.P. published a statement  in  the

papers  saying that they endorsed the  proposals

brought up by the six trade unions leaders, i.e.

to  have  a truly full self-governing  State  of

Singapore by 1963 through constitutional talks.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy Speaker, it is fortunate that what  I  am

saying  now  is  not  written  by  my  back-seat

driver,, otherwise I would have been at a  loss.

I  was just trying to tell this House that I was

quoting from the Sin Chew Jit Poh of the 14th of

July. They maintained their stand that they  had

broken  away from the P.A.P. At that  time  they

thought  that by overthrowing the P.A.P. itself

and  the Government they could continue on their

path  to  sell  the Government  to  prevent  the

coming  into being of merger. They thought  that

by doing this they could still maintain the open

front  of the Communists and their influence  in

Singapore.  This ambition of theirs  has  failed

badly.  Therefore, they are now sitting opposite

us  and  are travelling in a different way.  The

Barisan  Sosialis Members sitting in this  House

have,  by  delivering lengthy speeches in  these

few days, become the puppets of the Communists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formerly, when we were happily together within

the  Party,  I had occasion to know or  to  hear

that  the  Member  for Queenstown  said  certain

things to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>



Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance.  He

said that it did not matter if we could make use

of  the co-operation between the Communists  and

ourselves  as long as the British did  not  lose

their base in Singapore. He also said that  they

did  not mind being mouth-pieces. But this is  a

sort of gamble. I believe that of the gambles in

which  they have been involved, this one is  the

most  precarious and dangerous. If at that  time

we had followed the suggestion of the Member for

Queenstown  and had made use of the co-operation

of the Communists and received instructions from

them  to  achieve the abolition of the  Internal

Security Council by 1963 so as to have  a  fully

self-governing Singapore, then I  believe  today

we  would  still have been quite happy  together

sitting on the same side of the House. Then they

would  not have left the P.A.P. But we  did  not

want to do what they had suggested. We felt that

if  we  were  to do what they had suggested,  we

would only weaken the relationship between Singa

pore  and the Federation. Can they say  that  we

are not complying with the desire of the people?

The  people want a merger of Singapore with  the

Federation.  But  not the Communists.  The  main

reason  for this is that they want Singapore  to

be  out of the control of the Federation so that

they  can make use of Singapore to liberate  the

Federation. But we must try to achieve a  merger

of Singapore with the Federation so that it will

come as early as possible in order to solve  our

economic problems. This will be conducive to the

interests of the people. This stand of  ours  is

just  the opposite of their stand. Since we have

different objectives, we must part -company.  On

our  side, we must continue to do our  work  and

achieve merger. The Communists may go ahead with

their struggle for a fully self-governing State.

We wish them well. In any case, how can they say

that  we  are  unreasonable? Well,  it  is  very

simple.  In the past, because we all  wanted  to

achieve  a  common objective, namely, to  defeat

British colonialism, they came to our side to co-operate   with  us.  But  now  this   artificial

separation is coming to an ,end very soon. [The

English translation not being forthcoming.]

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I think there is something

wrong   with  the  microphone  of  the  Chinese

interpreter.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The

Communists want to have self-government. So  as

a  result of such differences we have  to  part

company. This is only natural. Is it because we

do  not want to allow them to go their own  way

to  sour the relationship between Singapore and

the   Federation?   Can   they   say   we   are

unreasonable in not allowing them to do  things

their  own way? We can tell them now that,  for

the  sake  of  achieving the  reunification  of

Singapore and the Federation we are prepared to

face any attack.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second method of the Barisan Sosialis is

this.  They  say that by trying to bring  about

merger we are trying to sell out the people  of

Singapore. I want to ask them this. In what way

is  the  P.A.P. selling out Singapore,  and  to

whom?  Is  the P.A.P. selling out Singapore  to

the

British,  or  to  the  Japanese,  or   to   the

Americans?  They are really more naive  than  a

child.  Mr Deputy Speaker, let me quote  again

in   this   House   the  former   Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Prime Minister,  who  is  the

present Member for Upper Serangoon. At one time

he  was  reported in the Nanyang Siang  Pau  of

13th July to have said this. This statement was

made  after the Anson by-election. He said  that

during  the by-election, people were  talking  a

great deal about the Malaysia and merger plans.

I want to remind Members of this House that the

Prime Minister had said this at a street corner

meeting, i.e.,

that this question was to be decided finally by

the  people  themselves because it  was  not  a

matter  for only a few Ministers. The statement

of  the  Prime Minister is still in the papers.

Since the Prime Minister has already said  such

a  thing,  why  should Members of  the  Barisan

Sosialis come to this House and shout that  the

P.A.P. is selling out the people of Singapore?

They  come  here every day and start  shouting.

The  people in Singapore and the Federation are

after  all  in the same family. They will  come

together  again.  We are now  trying  to  bring

Singapore back to the bosom



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>



of the Federation. I feel that it is but natural

and  reasonable.  I  say  that  it  is  also  in

conformity  with the geographical and  historial

conditions of these two territories. After  all,

the  people of Singapore are part and parcel  of

the Federation people. The merger arrangement is

just  like  the  handling over of  the  domestic

chores of a younger brother to an elder brother.

I  do not see anything wrong in that. So how can

they  say  that  we are selling  out  Singapore?

Perhaps their accusations have come about purely

because  the Federation Government is  a  Right-wing  Government and maybe it is because of this

they  say  that we are trying to  sell  out  the

people  of Singapore to the Tunku. Well, can  we

say   that   the  Tunku's  Government   is   not

representative  of  the Federation  people?  The

Barisan Sosialis' logic is very unreasonable and

irrational. They even talked contradictorily  on

their own amendment. As the Leader of the House,

the Deputy Prime Minister, has said, and rightly

so, the amendment brought forward by the Barisan

Sosialis  is just like kicking somebody  in  the

back and then shaking hands with him, and asking

him, "Well, are you all right?" They do not want

to  clarify the true situation before they  make

their  accusations which cannot be substantiated

by  facts. If there is actually a sell out, then

the  people's interests in Singapore would  have

been  injured or damaged; but according  to  our

merger proposals, the interests of the people of

Singapore will not be damaged in any way at all.

The  people  of Singapore will not  only  retain

their   citizenship,  but   will   also   obtain

nationality  in  the  new  Federation.  And   on

questions  such  as  labour,  education,  social

welfare  and  the entrepot status of  Singapore,

they  will  still be what they are, that  is  to

say,  these  subjects will still remain  in  the

hands  of  the  Singapore Government.  The  only

difference is this. We are now carrying  British

passports.  In  future, British  passports  will

turn  into Federation of Malaya passports. These

rights cannot be had in the other States in  the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few days, the Member for Hong Lim

opposite, when making his speech on merger, did

not have the guts to deny that we are going  to

have  special rights. In this case, he  was  at

least  a little more frank than the Members  of

the Barisan Sosialis. The Barisan Sosialis,  on

the  one hand, advocate genuine merger, but  on

the other hand, are afraid of internal security

being handed over to the Federation Government.

Therefore, their amendment about the  so-called

genuine merger and the automatic conversion  of

citizenship is nothing but a smokescreen and  a

camouflage. Their method is just like  the  Cow

King  in  Chinese mythology who was  trying  to

stop  the  Monkey  God  from  climbing  over  a

certain  mountain. They have done so  many  for

the  interests of a few people in  the  Barisan

Sosialis. Their act cannot cover their  attempt

and  intention to prevent a merger of Singapore

with  the Federation. Because of this,  I  come

forward to oppose strongly the amendment.

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  in full  support  of  the

amendment  tabled by the Member for  Queenstown,

who  is  the Chairman of our Party. I feel  that

this  amendment of ours is meant  to  strengthen

and  enhance the spirit of the original  motion.

It  is not intended to sabotage the principle of

the  original  motion.  We  can  see  this  very

clearly.  From  our amendment and  the  speeches

made  by  Members  of the Barisan  Sosialis,  we

clearly   show   our  sincere   desire   for   a

reunification  of our countries. We  have  given

many  examples to explain the difference between

a  true  merger  and a phoney  merger.  We  have

spoken sincerely on parliamentary democracy, but

the  Ministers in the Government  accuse  us  of

talking  empty  words. Whenever Members  of  the

Barisan   Sosialis  criticise  them  for   their

faults, we see from their expressions that  they

are  very  worried.  They  try  to  cover  their

personal   feelings  by  laughing.  Mr   Deputy

Speaker, Sir, the Ministers accuse us of  having

made empty talk.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon.

Member should bear in mind that she must  speak

on  the amendment and not on the Minister. Will

she confine herself to the amendment?

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): These

remarks  of mine are relevant to the  amendment

because  in the last few days we have talked  a

great  deal on this question, but the Ministers

say  that we are indulging in empty talk. I  am

saying that this is not true.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, they cannot take the

advice given by us. I can liken their behaviour

to this story. There is a musician playing to a

cow but it cannot appreciate the music.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chew Chua):</b> Where is

the cow?

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> The hon. Member knows

that  there is no cow in this Assembly and  she

must not imply that any Member of this Assembly

is a cow.

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I am not pinpointing anybody as a

cow.  I  am just telling a story. The Ministers

cannot force them to do so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> What advice?

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If they

cannot  take heed of what we say, it  does  not

matter. But we can repeat what we have said  to

you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to the people  out

side.

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon.

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

representative of the people and want to listen

about  what  the  people  are  talking  in  the

streets,  lanes and coffee-shops. If they  have

not heard about what is spoken, I can tell them

now. I have other things to tell them. They  do

not have to worry about it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I have already

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, let me tell them now in this House

that  the  people are saying that the P.A.P. is

coming to an end.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Goodbye!



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The people

are   saying  that  the  P.A.P.  Government   is

proposing a phoney merger or a sell-out  merger.

The  people are also saying [Interruption] - well,

do  you  want to listen to this? The people  are

also  saying  that the Barisan Sosialis  Members

are  very right in what they say, especially  on

the  citizenship  question. Mr Deputy  Speaker,

Sir,  this  is a factual reflection.  I  am  not

lying in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am very surprised

because all of a sudden the P.A.P. seems  to  be

interested in merger. But the P.A.P. is actually

interested  in a phoney merger and  not  a  true

merger. They do not support our amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, all the people in

Malaya  and  Singapore have a common but  tragic

history.  The  British colonialists  are  to  be

blamed  for  the  artificial separation  between

Singapore  and  the Federation, otherwise  there

would  not  have  been  this  need  now  for   a

reunification of the two territories. The aim of

all  patriots  is to break down this  artificial

barrier,  because the reunification of  the  two

territories will bring about greater  democratic

rights  to  the  people and  prosperity  to  the

country. Therefore, we hope that our territories

will come together again as soon as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>



possible.  Since we have made a  beginning  on

merger,  we must sit round the table and  talk

about  it  amongst ourselves. This  Government

should  not go and talk about it with somebody

else  and then come to this House to  tell  us

that we must accept their merger proposals. It

was  because  of this that we  have  moved  an

amendment to the motion. Our amendment is just

like  a ship with a compass sailing to a  true

merger so that we will not be misled and  lose

our  way. In this way, some 600,000 people  of

Singapore will not be brought to the edge of a

cliff.  This  is  one of the reasons  for  the

amendment  to  the motion. Another  reason  is

that we have completely lost our confidence in

the  P.A.P.  Government. Since the  Government

came  into  power, it has done many things  to

the  disappointment of the people.  We  cannot

entrust   the  question  of  merger  and   the

livelihood of the people of Singapore  in  the

hands of the P.A.P. Government alone. We  want

the   P.A.P.  Government  to  give   a   clear

explanation  to  us  and  to  the  people   of

Singapore so that we can then have a chance to

decide for ourselves, otherwise the Government

has  no  right  to  represent  the  people  of

Singapore on the question of merger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I feel that our

amendment  is  just like a  mirror  which  can

reflect  the  reactionary  appearance  of  the

Government.  By means of this mirror,  we  can

really tell who is interested in a true merger

and who is interested in a phoney merger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I hope the

Government  will not try to play up  communal

feelings,  because communal feelings,  hatred

and   conflicts  are  very  unfortunate   and

tragic. This will do nobody any good,  either

to  the  country  or to the  people.  If  the

P.A.P. resort  to  such dangerous  means  in

order to save their political career, then  I

advise  them not to do it. I hope the  P.A.P.

Government  will think carefully before  they

disregard my advice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I hope out friends

in  U.M.N.O. know the true situation so  that

we can still maintain

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>



our  friendship  with them. As  the  Member  for

Anson  has  said, we have not made any  personal

attack on the Tunku. We do not have any communal

discrimination.  All along we have  been  living

together. So let us be calm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to

refute  a  statement  made  by  the  Member  for

Cairnhill.   He  said  that  the  amendment   is

redundant  and  repetitive. I  feel  it  is  not

redundant  at all. I say it is very appropriate.

It can be likened to this. When you go to a cold

country, you must bring more clothes with you to

keep  yourself  warm so that  you  will  not  be

frozen.  This can also be likened to people  who

have to put on glasses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is this. The Member for

Cairnhill  has said that some people are  afraid

of  internal security falling into the hands  of

the Federation Government. I will say that he is

not  correct.  If we have true  merger,  we  are

prepared   to  accept  that.  The   Member   for

Cairnhill  seems  to  be  on  the  side  of  the

Government by defending them on a false premise.

So I must quote the Member for Cairnhill - this is

reported  in  the  Sin  Chew  Jit  Poh  of  23rd

November  this  year. The Member for  Cairnhill,

talking  about  some people's fear  of  internal

security    falling    into    the    Federation

Government's  hands, is reported  to  have  said

that  the  Federation Government, after  merger,

might take action on behalf of the P.A.P. Govern

ment.  He says that this will not happen because

at  present the Internal Security Council has  a

representative of the Federation  who  does  not

interfere   with  or  instruct   the   Singapore

Government  to do this or to do that.  This  has

been  the  position for the past two years,  and

therefore, we should not fear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let us say that this

is true. Therefore, if we have no claim to make,

then  there should not be any opposition.  If  a

child is good and well behaved, there is no need

to  punish him. But the fact does not seem to be

like  this.  Very often we hear  the  Government

claiming that the Internal Security Council  has

given   the   Government  a  lot   of   trouble,

particularly  in  respect  of  the  release   of

political detainees. The Government say they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>



have  tried  to  argue  this  question  in  the

Internal  Security Council, but in vain.  I  do

not  know what is the actual voting which makes

their attempt fail. The assurance of the Member

for  Cairnhill seems to have come from  nowhere

because  he  is  not a member of  the  Internal

Security Council. So I am just wondering how he

got this information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me talk about the

speech of the Minister for Culture. He is a man

with the "Ah Q" spirit. From his speech, we can

see  that  these words prey on his  mind,  "The

First Prime Minister of Malaysia". He is trying

to distort the fact that the people should have

more  democratic rights. He tries to  say  that

Members of the Barisan Sosialis use this  right

of  the people to gain more constituencies.  He

disregards  the  problem that  comes  with  the

increase  in constituencies, i.e.,  the  people

must  have more democratic rights after  merger

so that they will be able to move freely in the

eleven States in the Federation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me quote the Minister for Culture. He

said, "It is only when people in the Federation

have  more favourable terms than the people  of

Singapore    that   this   term   "second-class

citizenship"  can be established.  That  is  to

say,  people  in the Federation  can  come  and

stand  for election in Singapore, but those  in

Singapore   cannot  go  there  and  stand   for

election, i.e. to enjoy the same rights, and it

is  only  when such a position has  come  about

that  this term "second-class citizenship"  can

be  said  to  be  true and  correct.  There  is

equality only when the people can enjoy  common

rights."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, from this part of his

speech,  we can say that the term "second-class

citizenship"    is   true;   because    in    a

reunification, the people must be able to enjoy

equal  rights. But how is it that after merger,

the  people of Singapore are confined  only  to

the small island of Singapore and the people in

the   Federation  are  confined  to  their  own

territory  in Malaya? If that is the case,  how

could  you  have  merger,  and  where  is   the

reunification? I must point out  in  particular

that  after merger Singapore citizens can enjoy

civic rights within the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>

State  of Singapore only, but the people in  the

Federation  can enjoy civic rights  in  all  the

eleven States. So it is very correct for  us  to

say  that  after merger Singapore  citizens  are

second-class  citizens. Can we ask the  Minister

for Culture with the "Ah Q" spirit to explain -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on a

point of elucidation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b> resumed her seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Is she saying that I have the

"I. Q. spirit" or the "Ah Q spirit?"



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, let me again quote  the  Minister

for Culture.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Ah Q.

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes. This

is  what  the Minister for Culture said  in  his

speech  which was reported in the Sin  Chew  fit

Poh of 22nd November:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I feel that this claim for automatic con

version  of  citizenship is  a  sabotage.  These

people  who seem to be interested in merger  are

actually afraid of merger. They have left

the  P.A.P. not because of the merger  question

only.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we say that this claim of automatic

conversion of citizenship is not the basic right

which should be given to the people of Singapore

after  merger?  If the people should  be  denied

such  a fundamental right, then how can you call

this  a  merger?  All  this talk  of  sabotaging

merger when actually we are trying to damage the

phoney merger of the P.A.P.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to their saying that we left the P.A.P. is

not purely because of the question of merger, we

say in reply that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>



it  is  true,  because at the time we  left  the

P.A.P., there was no such controversy as one  of

true  merger or phoney merger. This question  of

merger  was  then not conspicuous or  clear.  We

left  the  P.A.P. because there was no  internal

democracy,  and  the leadership  of  the  P.A.P.

could  not  accept the views, of their  members.

After they have taken office, they do things  at

their own will -



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I think I have

reminded hon. Members that the debate is on  the

amendment and not on the reason why the  Barisan

Sosialis left the P.A.P. and so on. So will  the

hon.  Member  please confine the debate  to  the

subject of the motion?

<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  this  was touched  upon  by  the

Minister  for  Culture during his speech.  So  I

must offer some explanation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time we were dissatisfied with the

P.A.P. and so we left it. We left the P.A.P. for

this  reason  and  not  because  of  the  merger

question.  Now,  let me quote the  Minister  for

Culture  again  for the third time.  This  is  a

report in the Sin Chew fit Poh of 24th November,

in  which the Minister is reported to have  said

this:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If the leaders of the Barisan Sosialis are

really interested in having a merger, then they

must unconditionally leave their objective  for

abolishing -'
