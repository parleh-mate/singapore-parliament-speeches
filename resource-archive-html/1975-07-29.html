<div align="center"><b>HOUSING SCHEME FOR PUBLIC OFFICERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Use of CPF savings)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for

Labour if he will consider introducing legislation

to allow government officers to make use of the

amounts standing to their credit in the Central

Provident Fund, and their contributions to the

Fund, for the purchase of executive flats under

the Housing Scheme for Public Officers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui) (for the Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in line with its declared policy

of encouraging home ownership, Government provides

housing  loans on attractive and favourable  terms

to  civil  servants. The interest at the effective

rate   of   6%  per  annum,  i.e.,  the   interest

calculated on a monthly rest basis, levied for the

loans  advanced  by the Government  is  still  the

lowest compared to those charged by banks, finance

companies  and  building  societies.  Furthermore,

repayment is stretched over a maximum period of 20

years deductible from salaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil servants may secure a Government housing

loan to purchase a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>



privately-developed property,  or  one  developed

under the Housing Scheme for Public Officers. They

may, however, purchase properties developed by the

Housing & Urban Development Co (Pte) Ltd, in which

case they may utilise half the balance of the  CPF

savings  standing to their credit for  payment  of

the  flats and meet the remaining cost from  loans

offered  by the HUDC at an effective rate  of  9½%

per annum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As civil servants are generally well catered for

in  this respect, it is therefore not necessary to

introduce legislation to allow them to make use of

their  CPF  savings for the purchase of  executive

flats   under  the  Housing  Scheme   for   Public

Officers.

construction  of  the Canberra Hawker  Centre  and

when the Centre will be completed.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to inform the Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>



for Sembawang that tenders for the construction of

the  Canberra  Gate Hawker Centre will  be  called

early next month. Construction work is expected to

anticipated  that the Centre will be completed  by

the end of next year.

<div align="center"><b>RESIGNATION AND RETIREMENT OF POLICE OFFICERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs the number, according to grades, of Police

officers of the rank of Inspector and above who

have resigned or retired optionally from the Force

during the period 1st January, 1974 to 30th June,

1975.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Sir, during the period from 1st January, 1974 to 30th June, 1975, 1 DSP, 3 ASPs and 18 Inspectors

resigned  from  the Force making  a  total  of  22

resignations.   There  were   also   10   optional

retirements as follows:-

<pre>



          Superintendent         1

          DSP                    4

          ASP                    5

                               ---

                      Total     10

                               ===

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the above, 2 officers proceeded on

retirement under section 7(2) (j) of the  Pensions

Act.  Therefore,  the total loss from  resignation

and retirement during the period 1st January, 1974

to 30th June, 1975 is 34 for the rank of Inspector

and above.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong may be interested to know

that the total strength of Inspectors and above on

30th June, 1975 was 582 out of an approved es-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>



tablishment    of   664,   i.e.   82    vacancies,

representing  12.3% of the approved establishment.

In  comparison, the total strength  of  Inspectors

and above on 31st December, 1973 was 500 out of an

approved  establishment of 653, i.e. 153 vacancies

or 23.4% of the approved establishment.

<div align="center"><b>VEHICLES OWNED BY CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Exemption from double road tax)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Finance

if  he  will consider exempting vehicles owned  by

charitable   institutions  which  are   non-profit

making organisations from double road tax.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Sir, may I

answer for the Minister-in-charge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The double rate of road tax is meant to apply to

all   motor   cars,  except  hearses,   owned   by

organisations and the Minister does not intend  to

exempt    any   such   organisations.   Charitable

institutions which find it necessary to own  motor

cars will have to pay the double rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is not expected that charitable

institutions will be badly affected. It is  likely

that  for  their activities, they will find  mini-buses  or vans more suitable than saloon cars,  if

motor vehicles are required at all. Mini-buses  or

vans will not be subject to the double road tax.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I ask a supplementary

question, as the Minister who is now answering the

question is not the Minister for Finance?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, how could the Minister allow

donations to recognised charitable institutions to

be deductible from income tax on the one hand, but

on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>



the  other  hand  he refuses to  exempt  the  same

charitable institutions from double road tax?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The answer has already been given just now. The

question   of  income  tax  is  one   matter.   If

charitable institutions want donations,  naturally

the  donors  should be given some  inducement.  So

donations  to  charitable  institutions  are   not

liable  to income tax, whereas road tax is another

matter. As I have pointed out, if they use vans or

mini-buses  they will not have to pay  the  double

rate.

<div align="center"><b>(Development of light industries)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  if  he  will consider the development  of

light  industries  in  addition  to  the  proposed

medium type industries in the industrial estate in

the Sembawang Constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Sir, the Jurong Town Corporation is planning the

development  of 1,500 acres of sea-front  land  at

Sembawang   for   heavy  and  medium   industries.

Immediately  behind  JTC's  Sembawang   Industrial

Estate,  the  Housing  and  Development  Board  is

planning  to develop 300 acres of light industrial

area  as  part  of  its Nee Soon New  Town.  There

should,  therefore, be adequate  land  for  heavy,

medium  and light industries in Sembawang and  Nee

Soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Armed Forces Act, 1972, has been in

operation since June

1972.  Experience in implementing the Act  during

this period has shown that it is inadequate in  a

number  of respects in dealing with new  problems

that  have  arisen and requires  to  be  amended.

Accordingly, this Bill is before us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill extends the jurisdiction of courts-martial to SAF personnel who have committed the

offences   of   murder,  culpable  homicide   not

amounting  to  murder,  waging  war  against  the

Government  and  offences against the  President.

This  is  to ensure that if there is a repetition

of  last year's incident in which a soldier  shot

and  killed  an  officer, such offences  will  be

tried  swiftly  and  punished swiftly.  A  court-martial  will, however, try a case of  murder  or

culpable homicide not amounting to murder only if

all  parties, victim and accused are SAF members.

These are grave offences. In view of this, it has

been provided in the Bill that the President of a

court-martial  trying  these  offences  will   be

appointed  by  the Chief Justice and  will  be  a

Judge   of   the  Supreme  Court.  An  additional

safeguard is that in such cases an appeal will be

determined  by  a specially constituted  Military

Court  of Appeal composed of three Judges of  the

Supreme Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courts-martial inflict sentences of between two

months   and  24  months  detention  for  absence

without  leave (AWOL) depending on the length  of

AWOL.      Detention     for     insubordination,

disobedience, and so on is also for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>



similar  lengths.  It  is doubtful  whether  long

detention  sentences  are appropriate  for  these

offences, taking into account the nature  of  the

offender,  usually  a  poorly  educated   teenage

national  serviceman. Keeping  large  numbers  of

soldiers under detention is also costly in  terms

of food they consume and the administrative staff

needed to house and look after them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these facts the Bill provides that

such  offenders  will be sent to  a  disciplinary

barrack  for a short stint, where offenders  will

be  subject  to  a harsh regimen. Such  detention

would  serve  as a more effective deterrent  than

present  detention under conditions  of  well-fed

idleness.  Detention in the disciplinary  barrack

can only be awarded by courts-martial and will be

for a short period not exceeding three months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A harsh regimen in the disciplinary barrack is

bound  to encounter resistance and, unless  these

instances  are  handled firmly, the  system  will

break  down.  In view of this, the Bill  empowers

the officer-in-charge of the disciplinary barrack

to  inflict corporal punishment for offences such

as mutiny, escape or attempted escape, assaulting

a  disciplinary barrack officer,  and  such  like

offences. This power is similar to that given  to

the Superintendent of Prisons under section 54 of

the  Prisons  Act  (Cap. 79). Certain  additional

safeguards, which I shall enumerate below,  have,

however,  been provided when corporal  punishment

is to be inflicted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National service intakes cover all strata of

society,  including those of  low  education  and

intelligence.   Past   experience   shows    that

recalcitrant offenders belong to this  group  and

existing  forms  of  punishment  have  not   been

adequate  as a deterrent. In view of this,  apart

from  detention in the disciplinary barrack,  the

Bill   provides   for  corporal   punishment   of

incorrigible offenders committing the offences of

prolonged absence without leave, desertion,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>



escape from custody, disobedience of order,

disobedience     of     general     orders     and

insubordination. Care has, however, been taken  to

ensure  that  punishment administered under  these

regulations  will not be of the kind  administered

to  hardened  criminals. Firstly, such  punishment

will  not cause bleeding or leave permanent scars.

Secondly,   the  Bill  provides  that   all   such

punishment  must be approved by the  Armed  Forces

Council before it is carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present limit for dealing summarily with

offences  is  six  months from  the  date  of  the

commission  of the offence. This limit has  caused

problems in dealing with those reservists who fail

to report for routine or occasional reporting, in-camp  training, etc, and who cannot be traced till

after  six  months.  There are also  instances  of

negligence  in  stores  administration  and  other

similar  work being detected by MINDEF's  Internal

Audit  or by Boards of Inquiry. However,  in  some

cases,  by  the time the offence is  detected  six

months  have  passed  and the  offender  has  been

released from full-time national service into  the

reserve. Often these offences do not merit a court-martial  but because of the six months limit  they

cannot  be  tried  in any other  way  such  as  by

summary  proceedings. The Bill  therefore  extends

the  period of summary dealing to three years  for

offences   committed  by  reservists   and   those

committed within six months prior to the date that

a serviceman is released from the SAF.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two other amendments deserve attention. One of

these  empowers the Armed Forces Council to review

a  case  on  its  own initiative  even  though  no

petition  for  a  review has been submitted  by  a

serviceman.  The other provides that a  serviceman

under open arrest will not lose his pay.

amendment  would facilitate proof of knowledge  of

registration,  medical examination and  enlistment

<div align="center"><b>MONEYLENDERS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Moneylenders (Amendment) Bill was introduced

in  Parliament on 24th March, 1975. The purpose of

the   Bill   is  to  facilitate  the  control   of

moneylending  in the Republic and to increase  the

penalties   for  offences  committed   under   the

Moneylenders  Act  (Chapter  220  of  the  Revised

Edition).



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at present 453 licensed moneylenders in

the  Republic, whose main clients are  the  poorer

members   of  our  community.  It  is,  therefore,

necessary  to safeguard the interest of  the  poor

and  to  ensure that the law protects them against

exploitation   by   unscrupulous   persons.    The

Moneylenders  Act is not wholly satisfactory,  and

the  proposed amendments are essential to plug the

loopholes  in the Act and to curb malpractices  in

moneylending activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalties for illegal moneylending will be

heavier  under the proposed amendments. Section  8

of the Act will be amended to increase the maximum

fine  for  such offences from $1,000 to $5,000.  A

second   or  subsequent  offender  is  liable   to

imprisonment not exceeding 12 months or a  maximum

fine  of  $1,000  or both imprisonment  and  fine.

Under  the  proposed amendment, the  maximum  fine

will  be  raised  to $5,000.  In  the  case  of  a

company,  the  penalty for a second or  subsequent

offence   will  be  increased  from  a  fine   not

exceeding $5,000 to a fine not exceeding  $10,000.

My Ministry takes a serious view of illegal money-lending  and will not hesitate to act against  any

person who is guilty of this offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to amend section 9 of the Act

to  empower  the Registrar to refuse  to  issue  a

licence  if the applicant or any partner, director

of  other person responsible for the management of

a  moneylending firm is below the age of 21  years.

Furthermore, section 10 will be repealed  and  re-enacted  to give the Registrar powers to revoke  a

licence.  However,  the person whose  licence  has

been  revoked  will be allowed to  appeal  to  the

Minister whose decision will be final. Some  forms

of  malpractice in the moneylending  business  are

difficult  to  prove, and this new provision  will

enable the Registrar to cancel the licence of  any

moneylender if there is adequate information  from

various sources to indicate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>



that the moneylender is not fit to hold a licence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 16 of the Act will be amended to make it

mandatory for moneylenders to give out every  loan

in  the form of a crossed account payee cheque. If

they fail to do so, they will be liable to pay the

penalty   of  a  fine  not  exceeding  $2,000   or

imprisonment for a term not exceeding  six  months

or  both fine and imprisonment. The safeguard that

this   requirement  provides  for   the   borrower

outweighs  the inconvenience to the  borrower  who

has  no  bank  account. In addition,  moneylenders

will  be required to obtain from the Registrar  of

Moneylenders forms to be used as promissory notes.

Such   forms   will  be  serially   numbered   and

controlled by the Registrar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to amend section 19 of the

Act. Moneylenders will be required to account  for

or  explain  any item or detail appearing  in  the

quarterly  statements  of  their  cash  and   loan

position which they submit to the Registrar  under

this  section. The penalty for failure  to  comply

with  the  requirements  of  section  19  will  be

increased from a fine not exceeding $50 to a  fine

not  exceeding $1,000. In the case of a continuing

offence, the penalty will be increased from a fine

not exceeding $10 to a fine not exceeding $100 for

each  day  during which the offence  is  continued

after  conviction. The present penalty  is  not  a

sufficient  deterrent and many  moneylenders  have

repeatedly  contravened this section of  the  Act.

Since  1970,  the  Registry  of  Moneylenders  has

recorded 94 convictions under this section. It is,

therefore,  desirable to increase the  penalty  to

ensure  that the requirements of the Registry  are

complied with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, section 20 of the Act requires a

moneylender to issue a receipt for every repayment

he  receives,  only if the payer demands  it  This

section will be amended to make a moneylender give

such receipts for every repayment





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>



regardless of whether the payer demands  one.  The

penalty  for  an  offence  committed  under   this

section  will be increased ten-fold to a fine  not

exceeding $2,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to amend section 23 of the

Act  to  make  usury an offence, and a moneylender

convicted under this section will be liable  to  a

fine  not  exceeding  $2,000.  For  a  second   or

subsequent offence, he will be liable  to  a  fine

not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term

not  exceeding  one  year  or  to  both  fine  and

imprisonment.  If it is a company that  lends  the

money,  the  penalty  for a second  or  subsequent

offence  will be a fine not exceeding $10,000.  At

present,  interest rates above 18% per  annum  for

unsecured  loans  and 12% per  annum  for  secured

loans  are considered excessive, but there  is  no

provision  to prohibit moneylenders from  charging

interest above these rates or to penalise them  if

they  do  so. The Bill seeks to make it an offence

for  a  moneylender to charge  a  higher  rate  of

interest  for  a  loan than is prescribed  in  the

Rules made under the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 25 of the Act will be amended to require

a moneylender to accept any repayment above $10 in

the form of a cheque, money order or postal order.

Moneylenders who contravene this requirement  will

be  liable  to  a  fine not exceeding  $500.  This

provision is desirable to protect the borrower and

also to facilitate Police investigations. Many low

wage  earners and poor traders settle their  loans

by instalments of $10 to $50, and the amendment is

necessary  to ensure that such borrowers  are  not

cheated  at  the  time when repayments  are  made.

Although a moneylender will be required to issue a

receipt  for  any payment received  by  him,  this

alone  is  not adequate because, in any particular

case,  it  would  be difficult  to  prove  that  a

receipt  was  not issued when a repayment  was  in

fact  given.  The  extra costs  involved  for  the

payment of bank commission or fee for the purchase

of postal order or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>



money  order  are  negligible,  and  it  is  worth

incurring such expenditure to further protect  the

borrower. Cheques, money orders and postal  orders

can  be  easily obtained, and I am confident  that

this  requirement  will soon  become  an  accepted

practice  although  it  may initially  cause  some

inconvenience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to amend section 31 of the

Act   to   increase  the  penalty  for  making   a

promissory note in which the principal or the rate

of  interest is not truly stated or is left blank.

The  maximum  fine  for such an  offence  will  be

increased  four times to $2,000. For a  second  or

subsequent offence, the present penalty is a  fine

not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment not exceeding

six  months,  or  both fine and imprisonment.  The

maximum fine will now be increased to $5,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, section 33 of the Act will be amended

to increase the penalty for harassment of a debtor

or  any  member  of his family.  At  present,  the

penalty   is   a  fine  not  exceeding   $250   or

imprisonment not exceeding three months,  or  both

such fine and imprisonment. The proposed amendment

will  raise  the  maximum fine to $2,000.  If  the

offender  is  a company, the fine will  be  $5,000

instead of the present $1,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill also seeks to introduce a new

section 34A to the Moneylenders Act. The Registrar

or   a  Police  Officer  not  below  the  rank  of

Assistant Superintendent of Police may authorise a

Police  Officer of the rank of Sergeant and  above

to  enter  the  premises  of  any  person  who  is

suspected of having contravened the provisions  of

the  Act  and  to  inspect or seize  any  book  or

document  relating  to moneylending  transactions,

without  warrant from a magistrate. This provision

will  facilitate  Police  investigations.  In  the

past,  legal  action could not be  taken  in  many

cases   of   alleged   illegal   moneylending   or

malpractices   by  moneylenders   simply   because

evidence was lacking. For instance,





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>



since  1970, the Registry of  Moneylenders

has   received   80  complaints  against   illegal

moneylenders,  and yet only five  of  these  cases

resulted in the conviction of the culprits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, it has been difficult to convict

moneylenders  for other offences  committed  under

the  Act,  partly because the borrowers themselves

are  reluctant to cooperate with the  Registry  of

Moneylenders    and   the    Police    in    their

investigations.  It  is, therefore,  desirable  to

widen the powers of the Registrar and to introduce

amendments  to the Act which will help curb  these

malpractices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I seek clarification from the

Minister for Social Affairs on clause 5, amendment

to  section  16  of  the  Act,  which  requires  a

moneylender to make a loan to the borrower in  the

form  of  an  account payee crossed cheque.  I  am

afraid  this  may  create  difficulties  for   the

borrower because, in encashing the cheque that  is

so  endorsed,  the borrower must  have  a  banking

account  unless  he banks it in  the  Post  Office

Savings  Bank. Moreover, if the borrower wants  to

open  a  bank account, he must have a  minimum  of

$500.  In  other  words,  we  are  encouraging   a

borrower    to    borrow    more    than     $500.

Administratively this requirement will create some

difficulty for the borrower.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I seek clarification whether any other form

of payment can be allowed, such as the moneylender

purchasing a money order or a postal order in  the

name of the borrower?



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, as I have said just now, in the initial

stage,  there  will be inconveniences.  I  presume

everyone has a Post Office Savings Bank



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>



account.  If it is so, the moneylender can  buy  a

postal order or whatever it is in the name of  the

borrower  to  enable him to put  it  in  his  Post

Office Savings Bank account. But in the case of an

account payee cheque, if he has no bank account  I

think  he  could sign it and pass  it  on  to  his

friend who will put it in his own bank account.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> No. He cannot do that unless it is a simple

crossed cheque. If the cheque is an account  payee

cheque,  only the person named on the  cheque  can

bank it if he has his own bank account.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Sir, I think my colleague, the Member for Toa

Payoh,  is  correct when he says that  any  cheque

that is made out as an Order cheque is paid to the

order  of  the person so named on the  cheque.  So

unless  the person has a bank account he will  not

be  able to encash the cheque. But perhaps to  get

round   it,   the  moneylender  could  state   the

borrower's  name and identity card number  on  the

cheque, without the need to cross it. This  is  my

<div align="center"><b>WATER POLLUTION CONTROL AND DRAINAGE BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.22 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House deals with water

pollution  control, sewerage, drainage  and  water

resources.   The   Bill  is  needed   because   an

integrated   and  comprehensive  Water   Pollution

Control and Drainage legislation is very necessary

for  the  Republic.  Since the  enactment  of  the

Municipal  Ordinance on which  the  present  Local

Government Integration Act is based, circumstances

and   environmental  problems  have  changed.  The

population  has grown and there  has  been  rapid

economic and industrial development over the  past

10  years.  New towns and large numbers of  public

housing units have been built. There has also been

a  corresponding increase in the demand for  water

and,  with  rising  affluence,  a  demand  for   a

healthier and cleaner environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has developed new water catch ment

areas  and constructed new reservoirs to  increase

the  collection and storage capacity of  water  in

the Republic. It is important that these catchment

areas  are  protected from pollution  from  farms,

households,   industries  and  other   activities,

otherwise the run-off water would not be  suitable

for  drinking purposes. While the Government  will

make  every effort to ensure that adequate  supply

of  water  is available, the provision of sewerage

and  the  control of water pollution must also  be

given  equal  priority  as sewerage  is  the  most

effective  method  of  water  pollution   control.

However,  the  cooperation of the public  is  also

required  to ensure that these sewerage facilities

are  fully  utilised. Until recently,  only  waste

water  from  the water closets and some industries

were  discharged  into the  sewers.  We  have  now

required  all waste water from premises, including

trade  effluent, to be discharged into the sewers.

This  will  reduce and minimise the  pollution  of

water  in  our streams and canals, some  of  which

drain into our reservoirs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a small urbanised and industrialised country

like  ours,  frequent and heavy  rainfall  demands

that there must be good drainage. Land development

alters the natural topography and affects the run-off  characteristics of surface water. More  often

than  not,  it  will  affect  drainage  and  cause

flooding. It is therefore essential that there  is

an effective drainage system to ensure a free flow

of  water in our drains and canals. The Government

is giving priority to drainage projects, and funds

will be provided for this purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present laws governing water pollution

control  have  been  found to  be  inadequate  and

somewhat  obsolete. By updating and extending  the

existing  provisions as well as  by  incorporating

new  provisions,  this  Bill  will  enable  better

enforcement of the various sewerage, drainage  and

water  pollution requirements. More  broadly,  the

Bill is designed not only to create and promote  a

healthy  and  aesthetic environment  but  also  to

conserve our water resources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill incorporates many of the provisions of

the  Local  Government Integration Act (Cap.  210)

and the Environmental Public Health Act (Cap. 155)

which  deal with matters of sewerage and drainage.

The sections of the Acts dealing with sewerage and

drainage  will be repealed and replaced with  more

detailed  provisions  in  the  Bill.  As  I   have

indicated,  Sir,  the  existing  Local  Government

Integration   Act   does  not   contain   adequate

provisions  on the control of pollution  of  water

courses   and   drainage   and   the   departments

responsible have been relying on powers vested  in

other  authorities.  The  Bill  will  remedy  this

inadequacy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authority for sewerage, drainage and water

pollution  control will be vested in the  Director

of  Water Pollution Control and Drainage who  will

also  have  the  powers  to control  the  quality,

extraction, storage and use of water in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions on drainage empower the authority

to  construct  and  maintain any drainage  system.

There  are new provisions which can require owners

to execute any drainage work to provide for better

drainage.  New  provisions for  the  control  over

earthworks or construction sites which pollute and

affect  the  drains  and  canals  have  also  been

incorporated in the Bill. The authority will  have

the  powers  to  vest private drains  or  drainage

reserves in the Government which it does not  have

under   the  Local  Government  Integration   Act.

Another  new  provision  is  the  control  on  the

erection  of  structures over  drains  and  canals

which may obstruct the flow of water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the Bill deals specifically with Water

Pollution  Control. A new provision prohibits  any

person  from  extracting  water  from  any   place

without permission. The Public Utilities Board  is

exempted, of course, from this prohibition on  its

own  property. Another new provision empowers  the

Minister  to  make  regulations  to  control   the

quality,  storage and use of water  in  any  water

course,  river,  lake or pond  and  prohibits  the

discharge of any pollutant in any such places.  In

addition,  any person who discharges any pollutant

into  any  water  course whether  wilfully  or  by

accident must report to the authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V of the Bill deals with sewerage. There are

general provisions for the authority to deal  with

the construction, operation and maintenance of the

sewerage   system.  It  covers   the   collection,

treatment   and  disposal  of  sewage  and   trade

effluent  and  the approval and  control  of  such

facilities. Under the new provision an owner of  a

building  may  be  required to construct  adequate

sewerage   system  and  to  provide  and  maintain

sanitary  facilities  in his  premises.  The  Bill

extends control of water pollution into farm areas

to  protect our water catchments. The Bill further

empowers the authority to prohibit the unauthoris-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>



ed discharge of trade effluents into the sewer and

to   prescribe  the  charges  for  the  discharge,

collection, maintenance and disposal of any waste.

Powers  are also given to vest any sewerage system

and  land set aside for a sewerage system  in  the

Government.  The construction or erection  of  any

structure  across  or over a sewer  is  prohibited

under a new provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VI of the Bill deals with miscellaneous

matters  such  as  the issue of mandatory  orders,

appeals  to  court, procedures for enforcement  of

the   Bill,   compensation,  recovery  of   costs,

penalties  for the contravention of the provisions

of  the  Bill, exemptions, appeals to the Minister

and the making of regulations under the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I support this Bill. This Bill is designed to

control the pollution of water and to maintain the

cleanliness of the drainage and sewerage  systems.

This  Bill  has  much to do with  my  constituency

because Sembawang is bounded by the sea. Hence the

Bill   will  preserve  the  cleanliness   of   the

watercourses  in my constituency so that  we  will

have a cleaner and healthier living environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the Government is allocating

millions   of   dollars   every   year   for   the

construction  of  drainage and  sewerage  systems.

Hence  many  roads have been dug for the  purpose,

thus  causing obstruction to traffic. But for  the

long-term   interest   of   the   country,    such

inconveniences should be put up with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All along the Government has been paying great

attention to public health. In the past few  years

there  have been several nation-wide campaigns  to

promote  public  cleanliness  and  public  health.

However, recently there was an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>



epidemic of conjunctivitis. We have also heard  of

outbreaks of typhoid and other diseases. All these

diseases  were  brought  about  because   of   the

unhealthy environment and the spreading of  germs.

Therefore,  the Public Health Division  should  be

more  concerned with the maintenance of a hygienic

environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also received complaints that there has

been  an  increase  in  the  number  of  cases  of

mosquito breeding, particularly on vacant plots of

land.  This brings about all kinds of diseases  to

the  people. So Health Inspectors should  be  more

effective  in  their work. We  used  to  see  them

spraying  insecticides on certain places. However,

this practice seems to have stopped and this could

be  the  reason  for  the  increased  breeding  of

mosquitoes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have complained that the Inspectors

from  the Public Health Division are very arrogant

and  fault-finding. Let me quote an example. In  a

certain  worksite, certain parts of the land  have

subsided  because  of  the  piling  work,  causing

potholes  here and there. One day a Public  Health

Inspector  visited this worksite to carry  out  an

inspection.  He saw these potholes  and  told  the

foreman whether or not he was aware that it was an

offence  to  leave such potholes in the  worksite.

The foreman was surprised and asked the Inspector,

"What  law have I broken?" The Inspector  replied,

"You  have  allowed mosquitoes to  breed  in  such

potholes." The foreman was even more surprised and

asked  him,  "There  are no  mosquitoes  in  these

potholes.   There  is  no  water  in  them."   The

Inspector  said,  "Stupid.  These  potholes   will

collect   water  when  it  rains,  and   therefore

mosquitoes  , will  breed in  them.  Do  you  not

understand  this? Therefore, you  must  fill  them

up."  The foreman replied that whenever there  was

piling  work  there would inevitably be  potholes.

Nevertheless the Inspector told him to fill up the

potholes, otherwise he would issue a summons.  The

foreman was helpless. The Inspectors



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>



from the Public Health Division should not be

arrogant.  They  should  be  impartial  in   their

attitude  so  as  to gain the cooperation  of  the

people   in   helping   to  maintain   a   healthy

environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to bring up another matter to the

Minister. In my constituency there is a big swampy

land along 14 m.s. This swampy land has all along

been  used  as  a rubbish dump by  people  in  the

surrounding  areas. Because of the  narrowness  of

the  watercourse, dirty water cannot flow out into

the big river, thus causing the water to stagnate.

Residents   there  often  complain   of   mosquito

breeding  in  that place. Now that  we  have  this

Bill, the authorities will be in a better position

to  cope with public health and the environment of

the  people.  I hope the Minister will  look  into

this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Sir, I must say that public interest and anxiety

in relation to water conservation, water pollution

and  drainage are arranged with some coherence  in

this  Bill. Having studied this Bill,  I  wish  to

seek some clarification and to invite the Minister

to respond with some answers on the matters that I

intend to raise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 5 of the Bill, there is provision for

the  Director to declare the adoption  of  private

drains. There is also provision for appeal by  the

person  or owner affected. If the grievance  is  a

possibility  of loss of land, as would  appear  to

arise under subclause (4) of clause 5 of the Bill,

then  provision  in regard to compensation  should

have been made here. But there is no reference  to

compensation in the clause. The question therefore

arises  as  to whether or not the aggrieved  owner

can  make a claim for compensation because  clause

39, the section that refers to compensation, makes

reference  to compensation only when it arises  in

that particular provision in the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, with reference to clause 11 of the Bill

which  refers to drainage works that the  Director

can   undertake,  will  notice  arise  under  this

provision  as  much  as notice  will  arise  under

clause S of the Bill?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, with reference to clause 40 of the Bill,

there is provision to allow the occupier or tenant

of  the  premises to undertake drainage  works  as

approved  by the Director and to make a  claim  on

the owner for the cost of such work. Provision  is

also  made  here  for the occupier  or  tenant  to

offset against the rental due to the owner of  the

premises.  But  such offsetting could  be  written

into  an  agreement  between the  tenant  and  the

owner,  in  which  event this  would  deprive  the

tenant of the facility to offset under this clause

against  the  rental  due  to  the  owner.  Is  it

contemplated  in the provision that  the  Director

will  claim from the owner the cost of  the  works

undertaken by the tenant? I will appreciate it  if

the  answers to my queries will be accorded by the

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, if I may first deal with the Member for

Sembawang.  Earlier in his speech he talked  about

mosquitoes and then he went on to criticise Health

Inspectors  for requiring building contractors  to

fill up potholes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many building sites in Singapore have been found

to  be  breeding grounds for mosquitoes.  Whenever

there  are complaints, the Inspectors go  down  to

look  for the breeding places and either eradicate

them or, if that is not possible, oil the water in

which the mosquitoes are breeding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the swamps, this Bill has been drafted to

deal with swamps just like those in Sembawang. Let

me  assure  the  Member that if  he  can  tell  me

exactly where the swamp is we will do our best  to

eradicate mosquitoes breeding thereon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens sought

clarification on certain clauses. If I  may  start

with  clause 40. Surely the answer he seeks  would

depend on the agreement between the owner and  the

occupier.  As for clause 5(4), it ideas  with  the

provision  where the Director may cause drains  to

be  constructed after reasonable notice in writing

has been given. Clause 5 gives the Director powers

to  declare  under  subclause  (I)  notice  of   a

proposal  to the owner or owners of the  drain  in

question  for  the adoption of the private  drain.

Subclause  (2) gives the owner, aggrieved  by  the

proposal  of the Director, a chance to  appeal  to

the  Minister. One deals with the drain, the other

deals  with the grievance. Surely a grievance  can

arise  not  only because the Government is  taking

over  the private drain but also because the owner

may   have   other   reasons  for   objecting   to

Government's proposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not exactly follow the Member's speech on

clause  II.  If  he wants an answer,  probably  he

could stand up and repeal what he has said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, if I may first clarify. With regard to

clause  5  (4), I was making reference to  line  3

where  there  is  a possibility of  enlarging  the

private  drain. If it is adopted by the  Director,

such  enlargement, I think, would necessarily mean

a  loss  of land. And if there is loss of land  in

such  a  case,  will  there be  any  compensation?

Matters of compensation as provided for in  clause

39  can  arise only if they specifically refer  to

compensation  arising from that particular  clause

39.  But  in  clause  5 there  is  no  mention  of

compensation. Therefore, if there is loss of  land

on  the part of the owner due to an enlargement of

the  drain which has been adopted by the Director,

will  the owner be entitled to compensation?  That

is  the  point  that  I intended  to  make  in  my

reference to clause 5.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to clause 11, the only point that I

intend to make thereto is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>



this.   If  any  action  under  clause  11(1)   is

contemplated by the Director, will any  notice  be

issued  to the owner? I ask this question  because

no mention of notice has been made in this clause.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> As for the first question, Sir, it appears from

the Ordinance that the answer is no. As for clause

11,  although notice is not specifically  provided

for  or  required to be given under clause  11,  I

assure the Member that such a notice will be given

in the ordinary course of business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr E. W. Barker].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 28 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 29 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 15, line 37, to leave out from "fit" to

the end of line 23 in page 16 and insert -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"and charge such fees as may be prescribed therefor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Such fees shall be payable by the occupier of

the  premises  so served and by the owner  thereof

when   the  premises  are  vacant  and  shall   be

recoverable in the manner

provided in section 41.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment together with the new clauses

A and B and the amendment to the First Schedule as

shown in the Order Paper Supplement, which I shall

be  moving  shortly, are necessary to  remove  any

ambiguity  as to the powers to collect water-borne

charges from any premises whether or not they  are

connected to the sewers and powers to control

the discharge of trade effluent into  public

sewers  within limits to be prescribed and subject

to the approval of the Director of Water Pollution

Control  and  Drainage. The collection  of  water-borne  charges  of all premises is not  new.  Such

fees  have  been  collected  since  1970  and  the

necessity  for  so  doing has  been  explained  to

Members by the then Minister for Finance,  Dr  Goh

Keng Swee, in December 1969.

<br><br>4.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, honourable Members will be aware

of  the  efforts of my Ministry to  encourage  the

further  development  of  Singapore  as  a   major

regional  and international financial centre.  The

success  we  have achieved has been due  in  large

measure to our policy of welcoming the free inflow

of all capital, whether regional or international,

and whether for use directly in trade, industry or

construction  or merely for portfolio investments.

Few  if  any  restrictions  are  imposed  on  such

investments  which, when so desired,  may  be  and

often  are  in  wholly-owned locally  incorporated

companies  as  well as in branches of  foreign  or

multi-national companies. The presence of many old

and  new trading houses, manufacturing industries,

banks,   insurance  companies,   merchant   banks,

discount  houses as well as holding companies  and

conglomerates  is  sufficient  evidence   of   the

effective  operation  of our policy.  However,  to

ensure  orderly  conditions  and  fair  terms   of

competition   -  and  where  many  investors   are

concerned, fair treatment of minority interests  - it  has  been  necessary, here  as  elsewhere,  to

provide  by  law  for  the regulation  of  company

operations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last five years I have paid special

attention to the question of im-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>



proving the system of regulation of the securities

industry  and  of  enforcing  high  standards   of

conduct  on  the  part of companies  operating  in

Singapore. Honourable Members will be aware of the

many  legislative measures introduced during  this

period  in the form of amendments to the Companies

Act  and  the Securities Industry Act. A  Code  on

Takeovers   and  Mergers  was  enacted   and   the

Securities Industry Council was entrusted with the

responsibility for administering it. The rules and

bye-laws  of the Stock Exchange of Singapore  were

made  subject  to  my approval.  These  and  other

measures which I have taken are by now well  known

to  companies whose shares are listed on the Stock

Exchange of Singapore. Companies have also  become

familiar  with  the  new  procedural  requirements

imposed by the Code and the rules of the Exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Securities Industry Council, in which members

from  the private sector outnumber those from  the

Government,    has   so   far    discharged    its

responsibilities in a conscientious and  efficient

manner.  Together with the Committee of the  Stock

Exchange,   the   Council  has   exercised   close

supervision of the securities industry and ensured

maximum protection for the small shareholder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few weeks the Securities Industry

Council  and  the Committee of the Stock  Exchange

have  had  to  deal with an important  transaction

involving  a  leading  quoted Singapore-registered

company,  namely,  Haw Par Brothers  International

Ltd.  In  view of the large number of shareholders

involved and the very considerable publicity which

has been given to the transaction in Singapore and

abroad, I deem it my duty to make a full report to

this  House  on  the Council's  decision  on  this

transaction and also on my decision to appoint two

Inspectors  to  investigate  the  affairs  of  the

company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 27th May this year, the then Managing Director

of Haw Par, Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>



Ogilvy Watson, asked my secretary for what he said

would  be a brief ten-minute appointment with  me.

He would be leaving for Kuala Lumpur the next day,

he  said,  and he would like to see  me  about  an

important and rather urgent matter before he left.

At the interview he handed me an advance copy of a

Press statement which he said his company would be

issuing  the next day. The statement was  about  a

proposed  exchange of shares between Haw  Par  and

PERNAS  Securities Sdn Bhd of Malaysia. It  was  a

brief  interview and I did not have time to elicit

any  details regarding the transaction. After  the

interview, I made enquiries in my Ministry and was

told  that  it  had no previous knowledge  of  the

proposed transaction. But my Ministry was aware of

a local newspaper report which appeared on 3rd May

over  three  weeks  earlier  to  the  effect  that

turnover  in  the shares of Haw Par on  the  Stock

Exchange was exceptionally high and that there was

speculation  as  to whether any major  development

affecting the company was afoot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Press statement announced that agreement had

been reached between Haw Par and PERNAS Securities

Sdn Bhd whereby Haw Par would issue 70,413 million

shares to PERNAS in exchange for the entire issued

share capital of Tradewinds (M) Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned  subsidiary of PERNAS. The principal  assets of Tradewinds were:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20% of the issued capital of London Tin Corp Ltd



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19% of the issued capital of Island & Peninsular Development Bhd



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10% of the issued capital of Sime Darby Holdings Ltd



and   other  quoted  securities  valued  at   M$l2

million.  PERNAS would thus acquire a 40% interest

in  the  enlarged Haw Par, while  London  Tin  and

Island



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>



& Peninsular would become subsidiaries of Haw Par.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Securities Industry Council was informed of

this  transaction by Haw Par on 28th May, the  day

on which the company's Press statement was issued.

There  was  no prior consultation whatsoever.  The

then Managing Director, Mr Ogilvy Watson, appeared

before  the Council on 30th May, at the invitation

of the Council, and argued that the Singapore Code

on  Takeovers  and Mergers did not  apply  to  the

transaction. This was an argument Mr Watson was to

abandon on the 4th of June. Nevertheless,  it  was

not  until the 11th of June that the Council  even

received a copy of the Agreement executed  by  Haw

Par and PERNAS.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 29th May the Stock Exchange suspended the

quotation of the shares of Haw Par and invited the

company to justify the proposed issue to PERNAS of

70.413 million shares with a market value of  $169

million  in  exchange for Tradewinds whose  assets

had  a  market value of only $114.4 million.  This

was  the first of a series of queries by the Stock

Exchange.  The directors of the company  were  not

able  to give satisfactory answers to any of these

queries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am tabling as an Annex (See cols. 1161-3) to this Statement a

summary of these queries and the answers received.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 3rd June I saw the Chairman of PERNAS

Securities  Sdn Bhd, Tengku Razaleigh  Hamzah,  in

Singapore  at his request. I assured him  at  this

meeting  that  the  Singapore  Government  had  no

objection  in principle to PERNAS or  any  foreign

company  acquiring  an  interest  in  a  Singapore

company.  I also told him of my concern  that  the

proposed  deal  with PERNAS would  result  in  the

small  shareholders' interest  in  Haw  Par  being

diluted   from  74%  to  44%.  It  was   important

therefore  that  the Securities Industry  Council,

which was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>



responsible  for  safeguarding  the  interests  of

small shareholders, should have the opportunity of

examining  the proposed deal in the light  of  the

provisions of the Takeover Code. Tengku  Razaleigh

for  his part acknowledged that the proposed  deal

was  subject  to  the approval of  the  Securities

Industry  Council and indeed of  the  London  City

Panel,   in  addition  to  the  approval  of   the

regulatory  authorities  of  Malaysia.  After  our

interview,  my Ministry issued a Press  statement,

the   text  of  which  was  agreed  to  by  Tengku

Razaleigh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Securities Industry Council ruled on 3rd June

that  the  Takeover Code applied to  the  proposed

transaction.  On  4th June, the  Council  informed

PERNAS  of its ruling and enquired of PERNAS  what

steps  it  proposed  to take to  comply  with  the

provisions  of  the Code, in particular  Rule  27.

This  Rule  laid down that partial offers,  though

generally undesirable, may be contemplated on  the

grounds  of  special circumstances but  even  then

only  with  the prior approval of the Council.  In

the  light of Tengku Razaleigh's statement at  his

meeting with me that he realised that PERNAS would

have to have the approval of the Council before it

can  proceed  with  its deal  with  Haw  Par,  the

Council had expected to hear representations  from

PERNAS  as  to why approval should be given  under

Rule 27 of the Code. However, in its reply to  the

Council  dated 10th June, PERNAS argued that  none

of  the  provisions  of the Code  applied  to  the

proposed  transaction except the general  rule  to

give   the   fullest   possible   information   to

shareholders.  PERNAS must  or  should  have  been

aware  that  the Companies Act provides  that  the

rulings of the Council are final.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter from PERNAS went on to say that PERNAS

wished to see maintained



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>



on  a  lasting basis the present  liberal

policy  of  enabling investors in  our  respective

countries   to   participate   in   the   economic

development  of  both countries.  The  partnership

with  Haw  Par  investors would  be  an  important

milestone  in that direction". Four days  earlier,

on 6th June, the London City Panel had this to say

on the concept of partnership:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The concept that there should be a partnership

between    British   industrial   and   commercial

interests and those of Malaysia is to be welcomed.

However,  the  Panel considers  that  for  such  a

partnership to be successful, it should arise as a

result of an association entered into willingly by

all   shareholders  in  accordance   with   normal

commercial practice.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 19th June the Securities Industry Council

ruled  that  PERNAS, having failed to advance  any

reasons to justify a waiver, had an obligation  to

make  a  general offer to the shareholders of  Haw

Par  at  $2.42  per share, and that  the  proposed

issue  of 70.413 million Haw Par shares to  PERNAS

should  also  be  at that price. The  London  City

Panel  had  already ruled that Haw Par and  PERNAS

had  acted in concert in acquiring a 51%  interest

in London Tin and that they should make or procure

a  bid  for the remaining shares of London Tin  at

197  3/16  pence  per share.  There  has  been  no

significant  development since these  two  rulings

were published.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stock Exchange was unable to verify the claim

made by the company that 57% of the group's assets

was situated in Malaysia. Nor could Mr Watson,  Mr

Tamblyn  or  Mr Gammell explain the diminution  in

the value of shareholders' assets to the extent of

over  $112  million  - from $234.4  million,  as

stated  in the offer document for the takeover  of

Motor  &  General Underwriters Investment Holdings

Ltd  in January 1974, to $121.6 million, as stated

in  the company's Press statement of 28th May 1975

-  all  in  the  course of less  than  18  months.

Queries  from the Stock Exchange produced  replies

from the company which merely led to further



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>



queries.  Finally, at a meeting with the Committee

of the Stock Exchange, Mr Gammell, the Chairman of

the company, requested the Stock Exchange to query

the  company on a confidential basis. This request

was  unacceptable to the Stock Exchange  as  their

sole  purpose in asking the questions was to  keep

the general public, including the shareholders  of

the company, fully informed. Mr Gammell also asked

for  a  waiver of the requirement imposed  by  the

Stock   Exchange  that  the  information   to   be

furnished  to  shareholders by Chartered  Merchant

Bankers  Ltd,  who  had been appointed  to  advise

outside    shareholders,   should    include    an

Accountant's report on the business of the company

and  all  its subsidiaries. This request  too  was

turned down by the Stock Exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Securities Industry Council was

examining  the terms of the proposed deal  between

Haw  Par  and  PERNAS and the Stock  Exchange  was

scrutinising the accounts of Haw Par, my  Ministry

received information which strongly suggested that

there  might have been misapplication  of  company

funds  in  the  past.  The information  was  about

transactions which took place well before, and did

not  appear  to  be related to, the proposed  deal

between   the   company  and  PERNAS.  Preliminary

investigations  tended  to confirm  the  suspicion

that there may have been serious wrongdoing on the

part of some of the company's officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was evidence of the existence of a company

in  Hong  Kong  known as Spydar  Securities  (Hong

Kong)  Ltd,  which  was formed  in  1972  for  the

purpose  of share dealing for the personal benefit

of  directors. The parent company, i.e.  Haw  Par,

would  sell  quoted securities of its subsidiaries

to  this Hong Kong company at cost which was  well

below  prevailing  market prices.  The  Hong  Kong

company would in turn sell



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>



these securities in the market and distribute  the

profit  to directors participating in the  scheme.

The existence of Spydar Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd

was never disclosed to the shareholders of Haw Par

Brothers International.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also evidence of directors setting up

Unit Trust operations to circumvent the provisions

of  the Companies Act. There appeared also to have

been  other  irregularities  or  breaches  of  the

Companies Act relating to share options  given  to

some  directors which have not been  disclosed  to

shareholders as required by the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 2nd July I consulted the Securities Industry

Council, whose unanimous advice was that  Haw  Par

Brothers  International  Ltd  should  be  made   a

Declared  Company under Part IX of  the  Companies

Act  and that an Inspector should be appointed  to

investigate its affairs. It was unacceptable  that

a  cloud  of suspicion should hang over a  leading

Singapore-registered  company,  whose  shares  are

quoted on the Stock Exchange of Singapore and  are

held  by  a  wide cross-section of the  public  in

Singapore and Malaysia. On 10th and 11th  July,  I

appointed two Inspectors -- Mr G. Starforth  Hill,

a  senior  member of the Bar, and Mr  PG.  Grundy,

senior   partner  of  an  international  firm   of

Accountants  - to investigate the affairs  of  the

Company.  A public statement issued by my Ministry

made  it clear that recent developments in respect

of a proposed takeover of Haw Par by PERNAS had no

direct   bearing   on  my  decision   to   appoint

Inspectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appointment of the Inspectors was quickly

followed by the resignations and the rather  hasty

departures from Singapore of both Mr Ogilvy Watson

and  Mr  Tamblyn.  It  is of course  open  to  the

Inspectors to invoke the powers conferred on  them

under the Companies Act to obtain the evidence  of

persons  who,  in  the opinion of the  Inspectors,

would be able to assist them with the investiga-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>



tion.  It is to be hoped that both these gentlemen

will,  in  accordance  with  their  assurances  of

cooperation and affording every assistance to  the

Inspectors, duly show up when requested to do  so.

However,  up till now the Inspectors'  notices  to

these  two  gentlemen have not been answered.  The

Inspectors  have accordingly taken steps  provided

for  under  the  Companies  Act  to  compel  their

appearance. Motion papers have been filed  in  the

High  Court this morning, and leave to serve these

papers  outside this jurisdiction is being sought.

Once   this  is  obtained,  the  actual   contempt

proceedings,  consequent upon a continued  failure

to  appear  on behalf of a witness so required  to

appear before the Inspectors, will be heard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a matter of the utmost importance that

pending   compliance  with  the  ruling   of   the

Securities Industry Council, no major asset of the

Haw  Par group of companies should be disposed of.

As  a  precaution, the present Board of  Directors

have  called  for  the immediate  resignations  of

Messrs Gammell, Ogilvy Watson and Tamblyn from the

Boards of all subsidiaries and associate companies

of Haw Par Brothers International Ltd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inevitably there has been speculation in the

Press  as to the repercussion of the investigation

on  the  proposed deal between Haw Par and PERNAS.

The  Securities  Industry Council recognises  that

there  may well be sound commercial logic  in  Haw

Par  entering into an arrangement with PERNAS.  So

long as the requirements of the Companies Act  and

the  Takeover Code are complied with, there is  no

reason why the two companies should not enter into

any such arrangement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Haw Par directors originally concerned with

initiating the negotiations appeared to have tried

to  force  the transaction through the  Securities

Industry Council and the Stock Exchange. They  may

have believed that, because of its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>



connection with PERNAS and because the transaction

appears  as  the  carrying out  of  the  Malaysian

Government  policy of controlling its own  natural

resources,  the deal would not be subject  to  the

scrutiny of the regulatory agencies. The directors

of  Haw  Par who have resigned and left  Singapore

after  the appointment of the two Inspectors  must

have  believed  that they could  ignore  complying

with  any of the regulations of the Stock Exchange

or  the Code on Takeovers and Mergers. They do not

seem  keen to help ascertain and clarify the  true

present  financial position of  Haw  Par  for  the

benefit of shareholders and investors, in spite of

the  discrepancies  between the  Haw  Par  figures

given  for the present transactions and  those  it

had  presented  on  other occasions,  and  in  its

Annual Reports and accounts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless we are prepared to accept the dismantling

of  our regulatory agencies, the normal procedures

must   be  observed  in  the  interests   of   the

securities industry and the investing public.  But

I  restate  my assurance to Tengku Razaleigh  that

there  is no intention to frustrate the legitimate

aspirations of Malaysia in the control of its  own

natural   resources.   The   procedures   of   the

Securities  Industry  Council  allow   for   prior

consultation and advice on any proposals which may

be  contemplated. The Securities Industry  Council

has  ruled  on  the arrangements which  have  been

submitted. It is possible that if these  proposals

are  now  formally  withdrawn,  new  and  suitable

alternative   proposals  can  be   submitted   for

consultation and consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigation by the Inspectors, however,

will continue irrespective of the outcome of these

discussions  or of any possible fresh negotiations

between Haw Par and PERNAS.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the investigations by the two

Inspectors  are  to  discover,  first,  the  facts

regarding Spydar Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd and  a

Unit  Trust,  second, the circumstances  regarding

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>



offer  of  share  options  to  specific  directors

contrary to the law and third, the reasons for the

diminution   of   assets  of  Haw   Par   Brothers

International   Ltd.  The  investigations   cannot

prevent,   and  indeed  were  never  intended   to

prevent,  the Malaysian Government taking  control

of  any  percentage of the equity of  any  company

operating  in  Malaysia, be it in  tin  mining  or

rubber  and  palm  oil plantations  or  any  other

corporate  investment.  These  investigations  are

designed   to   unravel  the  facts   related   to

wrongdoing which appears to have been committed by

at  least  two of the directors who have  resigned

and  left  Singapore. The Government is  under  an

obligation to unravel the facts and to protect the

assets of innocent shareholders of Haw Par as best

it can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps I may be allowed to read

the  Annex  which I have tabled and  which  I  had

previously intended to circulate to Members except

that insufficient copies were available. The Annex

is on:



<br><br><i>Queries  by  the Stock Exchange of  Singapore  and

Replies from Haw Par Brothers International Ltd.</i>



<br><br>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On  29th  May, the Stock Exchange of  Singapore

pointed  out to Haw Par that the market  value  of

the 70.413 million shares it proposed to issue to

PERNAS  Securities Sdn Bhd was $54.6 million  more

than  the market value of the assets of Tradewinds

(M) Sdn Bhd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply, the directors of Haw Par said that, for

the  purpose of the transaction, they had used the

net  asset  backing rather than  the  much  higher

market  value  of Haw Par shares. But  Tradewinds,

whose  assets  were  all  quoted  securities,  was

valued  at  market value. The directors sought  to

justify  this enormous capital gain for PERNAS  on

the   ground  that  participation  by  PERNAS  was

essential for the further



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>



development  of  one  of Haw Par's  major  assets,

namely, London Tin.



<br><br>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On  4th  June, the Exchange wrote to Mr  Ogilvy

Watson  for  an  explanation of the diminution  in

value   of   shareholders'  assets  from  $234.363

million  (as stated in the offer document for  the

takeover   of   Motor   &   General   Underwriters

Investment  Holdings Ltd in January 1974)  to  $12

1.584  million  (as stated in the company's  Press

Release of 28th May). The Exchange also asked  for

an  explanation of the company's announcement that

57%   of  the  Group's  assets  were  located   in

Malaysia,  17% in Singapore and 26% in Hong  Kong.

Finally,  the  company was asked  to  explain  why

there  was  no  mention, in  the  company's  Press

Release  of 28th May, of options on 2.125  million

shares granted to certain directors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company's reply of 16th June stated that the

diminution  in  the value of shareholders'  assets

was   mainly  attributable  to  Consolidation   of

goodwill  and  excess of book  value  over  market

value;  that  the  figures  for  the  geographical

distribution of assets were based on the net  book

assets  employed  in each country after  deducting

holding   company's  liabilities;  and   that   no

interest  in  the options had yet  arisen  as  the

options had not yet been accepted by the directors

concerned  and that, in any event, the  offer  was

received only on 2nd June.



<br><br>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 25th June, the Exchange informed the company

that, on the basis of net book assets employed  in

each  country  after deducting  holding  company's

liabilities, the proportion of assets employed  in

Malaysia was only 15.5% not 57% as claimed by  the

company,  and  that  no  more  than  22%  of   the

company's  income was derived from  Malaysia.  The

company's explanation of the diminution  in  asset

values  was  vague and the Exchange  asked  for  a

fuller statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its reply dated 27th June, the company said

that the figures for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>



geographical distribution of its assets were based

on unpublished, unaudited balance sheet as at 31st

March  1975  and  not, as the Exchange  had  done,

<br><br>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On  4th July, the Exchange wrote to the company

saying  that,  in view of the many  unsatisfactory

features  in the replies it has received from  the

company   on   the   questions   of   geographical

distribution of assets and the diminution of asset

values,  the company should furnish an independent

Accountant's   Report  so  as  to  avoid   further

confusion in the minds of the investing public. No

reply has yet been received from the company.



<br><br>5.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, in view of Malaysian interest in this matter,

apart  from  the  very brief contact  with  Tengku

Razaleigh,   I  am  just  wondering  whether   the

Minister has es-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>



tablished any other form of official contact  with

the  Malaysian  Government so that  our  intention

will  not  be  minister pretend as to  strain  the

relationship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in the light of the evidence which

has  been  unearthed so far, I am  just  wondering

whether the Minister is satisfied that the present

Board of Directors is still effectively in control

and  able  to supervise the day-to-day running  of

the various managements within that group so as to

make   sure  that  whatever  there  is   left   of

shareholders'   interest  will  not   be   further

squandered away.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> With regard to the first question which the

Member for Jalan Kayu has raised, I agree that

perhaps greater contact can be established with

Malaysia. I hope that my present Statement will

clear the air that there has been no intention

whatsoever to frustrate any plan of the Malaysian

Government in the control of its assets and that

this would be accepted as a statement of our total

attitude towards this particular transaction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member's second question on

whether the Board of Directors as at present

constituted is able to manage its day-to-day,

affairs of the company, I am not able to express

any definite opinion because I have not been

acquainted with the members of the Board of

Directors. But I believe that these are executive

directors responsible for the operational

management of the company other than the

management of financial affairs or the dealings in

shares or stocks. I can see no reason why they

should not be equally effective in carrying out

the day-to-day operations of the company as they

have done before. I believe the company's

operating divisions are able, by and large, to

make an adequate return on the capital invested in

them. In view of the fact that the Chairman,

Managing Director and Deputy Director, who must be

key members of the Board of Directors, have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>



made  themselves unavailable to the  company,  the

remaining  members of the Board of Directors  must

be  commended at least for staying on to carry out

their  duties and I am sure that these efforts  of

theirs  should assure shareholders to some  extent

that the company is still being managed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I am appreciative of the Minister's reply.

But  on the first point it still seems to me  that

perhaps  a  more direct form of contact  could  be

established, especially when we have been  talking

of ASEAN cooperation and so on. If it were only as

a  matter of courtesy to establish direct contact,

it  will not cost us anything and I am quite  sure

that  that  will remove quite a lot of unnecessary

speculation or misunderstanding.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> I accept the suggestion that there is a need for

greater contact with the Malaysian Government. But

at the moment the transaction is based on a purely

commercial basis. I realise that Tengku  Razaleigh

is  an eminent personality in Malaysia but in this

matter, while he may be pursuing the wishes of the

Government  on the control of natural assets,  his

status  is  that of Chairman of PERNAS  Securities

and not as a member of the Malaysian Government. I

will,  of  course, be very happy to  try  and  re-establish contact with him on the assumption  that

he   accepts  the  assurance  that  there  is   no

intention   to   frustrate  the  wishes   of   his

government, whatever these wishes are in  relation

to  this  particular operation. But, of course,  I

must stress that having established the Securities

Industry   Council  and  the  Stock  Exchange   of

Singapore   any  transaction  affecting  companies

which comes within their purview must receive  the

attention  of  both  the Stock  Exchange  and  the

Securities Industry Council.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, there was Eupoc. Now we

have  Haw  Par. Could the Minister tell the  House

whether  new measures are being taken or  will  be

taken to prevent the same thing happening again in

the future?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> There is no way in which we can prevent the

failure  of  companies. It is a fact  of  business

life  that  some companies succeed, some companies

fail;  some companies are well managed and make  a

handsome  return  on investment  by  shareholders,

while   others  are  badly  managed   and   suffer

misfortune because of the acts of officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of this particular transaction,

although it has not been allowed by the Securities

Industry  Council,  the company  itself  is  still

operating effectively in all its divisions.  I  do

not  think there is any comparison with Eupoc,  at

least for the moment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Chairman of PERNAS, Tengku

Razaleigh,  has  in a statement in  Utusan  Melayu

stated  that  retaliatory measures  may  be  taken

against Singapore, if we do not oblige. May I  ask

the  Minister  whether  such  measures,  economic,

political  or  otherwise, have been taken  against

Singapore in this respect?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I am not aware of such measures. I hope the

statement  which he has made merely reflected  the

dissatisfaction, discontent or unhappiness that  a

transaction which he has been concerned  with  has

not  been  put through. I think there  were  other

factors of which he may not be aware. The question

of  the investigation which has been initiated has

not  in  any  way been due, as I explained  in  my

Ministerial    Statement,   to   the    particular

transaction in which he is interested.  I  see  no

reason, as I said in my Statement, for, if  he  so

desires,  a  new  basis on which some  association

between PERNAS and Haw Par should not be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, following what the Member for Toa

Payoh has said, I think the matter of interest and

concern to members of the public and to some of us

is,  of  course, the statement by Tengku Razaleigh

about   retaliatory   measures   that   they   are

contemplating.  That  was unfortunate  because  it

gave  a  wrong twist to the measures taken by  the

Finance Ministry. I think it has been stated  from

the  outset  that the whole intention behind  this

exercise  is  purely to protect  public  interest,

i.e, the interest of the small-time shareholders.

This is not something which comes out of the blue.

This  measure is a natural sequence of the several

measures  that  have  been taken  by  the  Finance

Minister earlier over the question of ensuring the

proper   conduct  and  management  of   companies,

particularly  those listed in the Stock  Exchange,

so   that   the   interests   of   the   smalltime

shareholders are protected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I myself find it difficult to believe that the

Singapore  Government would want to frustrate  any

intention  of the Malaysian Government to  have  a

greater  control of the interest of the  companies

that operate in Malaysia. That is not possible. So

I  would  congratulate  the Finance  Minister  for

taking these measures in the light of some of  the

revelations that have just been made known to  us.

I  think  this  is all for the good of  our  Stock

Exchange  to ensure that confidence in  the  Stock

Exchange  is  always  there.  We  have   had   the

unpleasant experience previously of a boom in  the

share  market and how prices came down  overnight,

and  in the end it was the small-time shareholders

who suffered such operations. This is one case  of

a  very big-time operator. So this action is  very

timely and perhaps this experience would encourage

the  Ministry  of  Finance  to  think  of  further

measures, as mentioned by the Member for Delta, to

plug  the loopholes that may exist in the  present

legislation with regard to the management  of  the

Stock Exchange.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could the Minister indicate, if

possible,  the  extent of losses incurred  on  the

part of the investing public, or any other kind of

losses  resulting from the irregularities  he  has

referred to?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, in my Ministerial Statement I strove to make

it  clear  that  the Stock Exchange  made  various

inquiries  and certain replies were received,  but

many  of  the replies had unsatisfactory  features

that  prompted  the  Stock  Exchange  to  want  an

assessment  made by an independent  accountant.  I

think that is the present stage, at which most  of

us,  as far as knowledge of the Haw Par operations

are   concerned,  would  like  to  have  a  proper

financial assessment of the value of the company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having regard to the statements which have been

made  regarding Tengku Razaleigh,  I  am  sure  he

himself  would like to know the financial standing

of  a  company in which he is going to have a very

close association. We would all like to know  what

the  state of the company is. One of the  purposes

of  appointing  the Inspector is to  inquire  into

whether there has been any improper application of

company  funds  and, therefore, in the  process  I

have  no doubt that he would come to some kind  of

true  assessment of the financial state of affairs

in Haw Par.

<div align="center"><b>MAINTENANCE ORDERS (RECIPROCAL ENFORCEMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to repeal and reenact with

amendments    our   Reciprocal   Enforcement    of

Maintenance Orders Act (Chapter 26 of the  Revised

Edition). The existing Act gives a special  status

to  maintenance orders of a court in  England  and

Northern  Ireland  (excluding  Scotland)   without

subjecting    the   matter   to   any   reciprocal

arrangement. The legislation is typical  of  those

enacted  for a British colony. Since it  has  been

considered desirable to make certain amendments to

our existing Act, it is now considered appropriate

to  introduce  an  entirely new Act  in  order  to

secure   new   arrangements  for  the   reciprocal

enforcement of maintenance orders. In the drafting

of  the  Bill,  consideration has  been  given  to

similar  legislation enacted in the United Kingdom

in 1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has dealt with the subject of reciprocal

enforcement of maintenance orders in great  detail

while,  under the existing Act, some of the matter

are  dealt with by regulations made under the Act.

Apart from changes of a procedural nature relating

to  the  powers  of  a court  to  vary  or  revoke

maintenance  orders  and provisional  orders,  the

other  changes  introduced  by  the  Bill  are  as

follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Bill would enable the whole of the United

Kingdom, including Scotland, as well as any  other

country within or outside the Commonwealth  having

similar  legislation,  to  be  designated   as   a

reciprocating country. Once a country has been  so

designated,  persons who are entitled to  payments

under  maintenance  orders  made  by  a  court  in

Singapore  will be able to enforce the maintenance

orders  in the reciprocating country and similarly

persons   who  are  entitled  to  payments   under

maintenance orders made in a reciprocating country

will be able to enforce the maintenance orders  in

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The definition of "maintenance orders"

appearing in the Bill has been amended to  include

maintenance orders made in favour of ex-wives  and

affiliation orders. A maintenance order is defined

to be an order for the periodical payments of sums

of  money  towards the maintenance of  any  person

whom   the  payer  is  liable  to  maintain,  e.g.

maintenance   of  a  child,  whether   legitimate,

illegitimate or adopted, maintenance of  a  spouse

and  maintenance of a former spouse after divorce.

An   affiliation  order  is  an  order  adjudging,

finding or declaring a person to be the father  of

a  child.  In  other  words,  the  Bill  makes  it

possible for an ex-wife and an illegitimate  child

to available themselves of the facilities afforded

by  the  Bill  for the enforcement of  maintenance

orders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The Bill makes provision for applying the

machinery for making provisional orders to be

used in respect of affiliation orders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to, move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole House,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill, - [Mr E. W. Barker].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 11 inclusive ordered to stand part

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I beg, to move,

the end of line 23 and insert -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An applicant shall have the same right of appeal, if any,

against a refusal by a court in Singapore to make

a provisional order under any provision of this

Act as he would have had against a refusal to

make the order had a summons been duly served on

the person against whom the order is sought to be

made.",



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendment proposed will enable a

complainant  to make an appeal to the  High  Court

against  the refusal of a lower Court in Singapore

to  make a provisional maintenance order. This new

subclause  preserves the existing  position  under

our  Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance  Orders

Act which is to be repealed by this Bill.

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malayan Pineapple Industry Board is a joint

Board   with  members  from  both  Singapore   and

Malaysia.  It has a representative each  from  the

pineapple canners and the pineapple small growers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 seeks to increase the representation of

these pineapple canners and small growers from one

member  to  two members each. The Board will  then

have   altogether  nine  members,  including   the

Chairman.  Singapore is represented by one  member

on  the Board. With the increase in the number  of

members, the quorum of the Board is, therefore, to

be increased from four to five.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board also wishes to be in a position to

receive moneys from the Government. Clause 4 makes

provision for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>



moneys provided by Parliament to be paid into  the

Pineapple Industry Fund and for such moneys to  be

applied for any purpose within the objects of  the

Act,  and to grant vehicle and house loans to  its

employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysian Government has already made the

necessary amendments to its legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enable the Board to implement its decisions,

it   is  necessary  for  Singapore  to  make   the

corresponding   amendments   to   our    Singapore

Pineapple Industry Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.



<br><br>5.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Workmen's Compensation Bill was committed to

a  Select  Committee on 26th March this year.  The

Select    Committee    received    four    written

representations. It decided to amend clause 8  (1)

(a)  of  the  Bill to take into consideration  the

payment  of  the annual wage supplement  or  bonus

made outside the six months' period when computing

the  average  monthly earnings of a workman.  This

will  ensure  that the workman whose  annual  wage

supplement or bonus was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>



paid earlier than six months immediately preceding

the accident would not lose out in the computation

of his compensation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also decided to amend clause 8 (1) (b) of the

Bill which `provides that in the case of a workman

who  was employed at the time of the accident  for

less  than six months his average monthly earnings

will  be  computed on the basis of the six average

monthly earnings of a co-worker who has been doing

similar work for the same employer for a continued

period  of not less than six months. The  Ministry

of  Labour has experienced difficulties in finding

such  a  co-worker.  It is  felt  that  for  those

workmen who had worked for a period of one to less

than  12  months immediately prior to the accident

the  monthly earnings should be the average of the

earnings during that period, and for those who had

worked  for less than one month immediately  prior

to  the accident their monthly earnings should  be

calculated on the basis of the earnings they would

have  received for that month if the accident  had

not happened. These have now been incorporated  in

the amended clause 8 (1) (a) and (b) respectively.

Except for the abovementioned amendments, the Bill

in  its present form is very much the same  as  it

was originally before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To recapitulate, the new Bill aims mainly to

remove  the  time-consuming procedures for  claims

laid  down in the 1971 Act and replace it  with  a

new  and effective procedure of administration and

enforcement.  Under  the new  Bill  there  is  now

expeditious  and adequate payment of compensation.

The  long  delays caused by the need to  ascertain

the  dependency status of the victim, the need for

the  parties to sign a memorandum of agreement and

to  wait  for  a  period of  seven  days  for  the

registration  of  an agreement and  common  delays

associated   with  the  insurance  companies   are

eliminated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the quantum of compensation has been

increased  and the range of compensable industrial

diseases  extended.  A  Workers'  Fund   is   also

incorporated in the new Bill which aims inter alia

to  finance  rehabilitation  schemes  for  injured

workers.  This  is not a legislation  intended  to

prevent  accidents  or to offer  remedies  to  the

problems of safety and health regulations  but  an

attempt to strike a reasonable balance between the

needs  of the victims and their families and  what

industry can bear.

Malacca  incorporated  under  the  Roman  Catholic

Bishop   Ordinance  (Chapter  314  of   the   1955

of this House for the information of hon. Members,

and  about  220 hectares (543.62 acres) of  swamp,

foreshore and seabed (up to the edge of the  reef)

as  shown  coloured  green on the  plan.  For  the

purpose   of  the  proposed  development   it   is

necessary  to  reclaim  the swamp,  foreshore  and

seabed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reclamation, which is expected to commence

next  year,  is estimated to cost the Jurong  Town

Corporation  about  $150  million.  Fill  for  the

reclamation  will  be  obtained  by  dredging  the

surrounding areas shown coloured blue on the plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On completion of the reclamation the reclaimed

land will be proclaimed as State land and together

with the 29 hectares (71.65 acres) of the dry land

(coloured yellow) will be alienated to the Jurong

Town Corporation on terms and conditions to be

agreed with the Commissioner of Lands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament in accordance with section 4

of  the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270) approves  the

reclamation by Government of those portions of the

swamp,  foreshore and seabed around Pulau Semakau,

containing  a  total  area  of  approximately  220

hectares  as  shown  coloured green  on  the  plan

marked  "LAND  OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN  NO.  7/75"

which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion* standing in my name as it appears on the Order Paper.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves the reclamation by Government of that portion of the foreshore and seabed at Changi containing a

total area of approximately 607 hectares as depicted coloured pink on the plan marked

"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 13/75" which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.'

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is proposed to develop the existing

airport  at  Changi  into  a  civil  airport.  The

proposed development involves the construction  of

a second runway which necessitates the reclamation

of  about 607 hectares of the foreshore at  Changi

as shown coloured pink on the plan marked as "LAND

OFFICE  RECLAMATION PLAN NO.  13/75",  a  copy  of

which  is  displayed in the Library of this  House

for the information of hon. Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reclamation, which will be undertaken by the

Port   of   Singapore  Authority  as   agents   of

Government, is expected to take about  four  years

to  complete  and  will  cost  some  $165  million

inclusive  of shore protection works. Tenders  for

the  reclamation  have  already  been  called  and

contracts are expected to be awarded by the end of

next  month. The construction of the second runway

could  probably start in 1978 on portions  of  the

consolidated  reclaimed land and be  completed  by

1982.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill for the reclamation will be obtained by

dredging  the nearby shallow foreshore within  the

area  coloured  yellow and hatched  black  on  the

plan. Additional fill will be obtained by dredging

existing navigation channels within port waters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section

4  of  the  Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves

the  reclamation by Government of that portion  of

the  foreshore and seabed at Changi  containing  a

total  area  of  approximately  607  hectares   as

depicted coloured pink on the plan marked

"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 13/75" which  is

deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.
