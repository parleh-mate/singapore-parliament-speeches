<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>TALKS WITH MR. CHIN PENG</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> asked the Chief Minister

whether  he  has talked to Mr Chin  Peng  from  a

position of strength, or as equals, or how.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the event predicated by the question

has not taken place. It does not arise.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MEETING WITH MR. CHIN PENG</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> asked the Chief Minister

whether  he  will,  if  necessary,  postpone   his

journey to London in order to meet Mr Chin Peng.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

occasion has not arisen for consideration  of  the

eventuality envisaged by the question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does the

Chief Minister consider it more important to  meet

Mr Chin Peng, or to meet the Rt. Hon. Mr Lennox-Boyd?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. That

question, I think, seeks an expression of  opinion

and is not permitted by Standing Orders.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE SPECIAL CONSTABULARY (ACTIVE UNIT)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Pay and Conditions of Service)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b> asked the Chief

Secretary what measures are being taken to improve

the pay and conditions of service of the Singapore

Special Constabulary (Active Unit).



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> The Government have received from

the Commissioner of Police recommendations for

the  improvement of conditions of  service  of

the  Special Constabulary (Active Unit). These

are now being considered.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE SPECIAL CONSTABULARY (ACTIVE UNIT)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Free Housing Facilities)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b> asked the Chief

Secretary   whether  the  Government  intends   to provide free housing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



facilities  to  members of the  Singapore  Special

Constabulary (Active Unit).



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> No, Sir. At present it is not

possible  to provide quarters for members  of  the

Special   Constabulary.  They  receive  a  housing

allowance in lieu of quarters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Does the Chief Secretary

realise  that  one of the important  things  about

morale in the Police Force is housing?



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> I realise that, Sir. I also realise

that some 600 members of the regular force are  at

present without housing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What does the Chief Secretary

propose to do about it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> That is a matter which is part of

the housing problem of the Public Works Department

and raises very wide issues. I can assure the hon.

Member  that  this is a matter very  much  in  the

Government's mind.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE SPECIAL CONSTABULARY (ACTIVE UNIT)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Dissatisfaction over Discharge from Service)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b> asked the Chief

Secretary  if  he  is aware of the dissatisfaction

among   the  members  of  the  Singapore   Special

Constabulary (Active Unit) over the fact  that  26

Special  Constables were discharged  from  service

without  compensation or gratuity as a  result  of

suffering from tuberculosis, and 120 on grounds of

inefficiency  after  several  years   of   service

without any complaints as to their efficiency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> No, Sir. Since 1945, 22 Special

Constables  have  been discharged  suffering  from

tuberculosis. In each case, one month's notice was

given,  in  addition to vacation leave  due.  Sick

leave is normally 270 days, but may be extended if

recovery is probable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not known over what period the figure of

120 in the question is calculated, and in the time

available  it  has only been possible  to  examine

existing  records  as far back  as  January  1950.

Since



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



then,  31  Special Constables have been discharged

on  grounds  of inefficiency. In some  cases,  the

work   of  the  officers  had  deteriorated  after

several years of satisfactory service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT AID TO DEPENDANTS OF SPECIAL CONSTABLES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b> asked the Chief

Secretary  if  any aid has been  provided  by  the

Government to the families or dependants of  those

Special  Constables who have died while they  were

in service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> Pensions are payable to dependants

of  Special Constables killed on duty. Regulations

governing the grant of such pensions have recently

been  made by the Governor in Council and  provide

for  a  temporary allowance to a widow  for  three

months  at  the rate of pay drawn at the  time  of

death,  and  thereafter a pension at one-third  of

this rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pensions are also payable at one-fifteenth of

this  rate in respect of each child up to six.  In

special  circumstances, pensions may also be  paid

to parents and orphan brothers or sisters, and, in

addition, education allowances are provided for.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Will the Chief Secretary

inform us what form of compensation or gratuity is

given  in  the case of those not killed on  active

service?



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> This may seem a hard answer, but the

answer is No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Will the Chief Secretary tell

us  what is the answer in the case of those in the

ordinary Police Force?



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> I am afraid I cannot give the hon.

Member any exact information. The regulations  are

laid  down,  1  think,  in the  Police  Pay  Code.

Special Constables are treated in exactly the same

way as any other temporary Government servant.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>SPECIAL CONSTABULARY (ACTIVE UNIT)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b> asked the Chief

Secretary  whether the service of the  members  of

the  Special Constabulary (Active Unit) is counted

if  and  when they are absorbed into the Singapore

Police Force.



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> Special Constables absorbed into the

regular   force  are  permitted  to  count   their

previous  service as pensionable  service  in  the

regular  force under the same terms as other  Open

Vote  employees, which means, I believe, that only

two-thirds  of their service is counted;  but  the

whole of this question is under consideration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>VISITS TO INDONESIA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Subsistence allowances)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr William Tan</b> asked the Financial Secretary

what  subsistence or other allowances from  public

funds  in addition to their salaries were  granted

to   the   Chief  Minister  and  his   ministerial

colleagues during their first Goodwill Mission  to

Indonesia;  and  whether allowances  on  the  same

scale were granted to the official members of  the

Pan  Malayan  Economic Working Party during  their

recent visit to Indonesia.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> Members of the Goodwill Mission

were  the guests of the Government of the Republic

of Indonesia, and no charge for accommodation fell

on public funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of hotel accommodation for the Pan-Malayan Economic Working Party was paid from

Singapore funds, and averaged about $53 a head per

day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Ministerial members of both the

Goodwill  Mission and the Working Party were  paid

an  expense  allowance  of  $20  a  day  to  cover

incidental   expenditure   on   such   items    as

gratuities, laundry and minor entertainment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>PRIVATE TELEPHONES FOR OUTLYING DISTRICTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  and Works what efforts  are  being

made for the installation of private telephones in

the outlying districts of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The Telephone Board has a five-year development plan to meet present and

prospective demands for telephones in all parts of

the island, provided that adequate staff and

finance are available. I do not think it would be

right for me to give details of the Board's plans,

but I am arranging with the Chairman of the Board

for a report to be laid before this Assembly in

the very near future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE POLYTECHNIC ORDINANCE, 1954</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Powers and functions of Board of Governors)</b></div>

Education  what regulations have been  made  under

section 13 of the Singapore Polytechnic Ordinance, 1954,  for  the  purpose of giving effect  to  the provisions  of  the Ordinance and particularly  of

defining the powers and functions of the Board  of

Governors.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> No regulations have yet been

made  under  section 13 of the  Ordinance,  but  a

Committee  has  been appointed  to  prepare  draft

regulations for the consideration of the  Governor

in Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers and functions of the Board are

already  defined  in section 5  (2),  but  may  be

modified under section 13 as the need arises.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE POLYTECHNIC</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Chairman's visit to United Kingdom)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr William Tan</b> asked the Minister for

Education  whether the Chairman of  the  Board  of

Governors of the Singapore Polytechnic went to the

United  Kingdom  solely in the  interests  of  the

Singapore  Polytechnic; and if he  will  state  in

detail  what expenditure of public funds  directly

or  indirectly is involved in meeting the cost  of

passages,   allowances  and  other   expenses   in

connection with this visit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> To the first part of the

question,  my  answer to that is,  so  far  as  my

Ministry is aware, yes. To



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



the second part of the question, the details are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Return air passage to United Kingdom... $3,410



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Personal accident insurance... $175



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) An allowance of £10 per day for hotel

expenses, fares and entertainment while in the

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b> asked the Minister

for Health whether the Government intends to build

a district hospital in the Sembawang rural area.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> May I take that question, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, Mr Chief Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> The answer to the question

is in the affirmative.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Will the Chief Minister, on

behalf of his Minister for Health, inform us  when

he proposes to build this district hospital?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Mr

Speaker, Sir, the question of priority of district

hospitals  is  being worked out,  but  a  site  in

Sembawang has already been reserved - I use the word

"reserved".  At present I am not in a position  to

indicate  exactly  where a  district  hospital  at

Sembawang  will  come into the four-year  plan  we

have in mind for medical services.

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b> asked the Minister

for  Labour and Welfare whether the Government has

sought  to bring about a settlement of the dispute

between  the  Naval  Base  Labour  Union  and  the

Management of H.M. Dockyard over the discharge  of

16 workmen from service so as to avert a strike in

the H.M. Dockyard.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer

is   yes.  Officers  of  my  Ministry  have   been

following  the situation in the dispute  and  have

satisfied

themselves  that  the  parties  were  meeting  and

gradually approaching a settlement of the issue by

mutual   agreement.  As  reported  in  the  Press,

<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I should like your  indulgence  to

make  a very brief statement on an Ordinance known

as the Documents (Uniformity of Names) Ordinance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>



which  was  passed by the previous  Government  in

November 1952, as a result of representations that

the   register  of  business  names  was  rendered

inaccurate  and unreliable because of the  Chinese

custom  of  using  different names  for  the  same

person   in  different  businesses,  and  it   was

considered  that  the  practice  was  leading   to

widespread  evasion of income tax.  The  Ordinance

was  passed,  and it provided that it  should  not

come  into  force  for the first six  months,  and

thereafter it could come into force only on a date

to be fixed by the Governor in Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing has been done since 1952, and as it

happened to be in my Ministry when I went there, I

have  since  made enquiries. I am satisfied,  Sir,

that the Ordinance, as framed, will not adequately

meet  the  position that it seeks to  rectify  and

that  it  could be a cause of irritation  with  no

resultant benefit to the welfare of the territory.

In   the  circumstances,  I  wish  to  inform  the

Assembly  that my Government will not  bring  into

force   the   Documents  (Uniformity   of   Names)

Ordinance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, is of a very minor character. On

the  assumption of office by my Government, a view

was  put  forward of the procedure for appointment

to  various statutory bodies. In a number of cases

where  it  was  provided that the Governor  should

appoint,  that  provision  was  changed,  and  the

appropriate  Minister  was  given  the  power   of

appointment. We have also considered other  powers

of  appointment, and we have come across this  one

in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>



Hospitals   Board  Ordinance - in  section   3 - which

provides for the appointment of a large number  of

officers and, inter alia, section 3 (1) (g), which

provides  for two persons to be elected  for  each

year  by the Unofficial Members of the Legislative

Council.  That  was quite an appropriate  proviso,

Sir,  in  the days when the Council was a minority

of  Unofficials  and also when the  Executive  was

very much in the hands of Officials. But it is our

view that, now that the government is in the hands

of  the elected representatives of the people, and

in order to avoid any suggestion that appointments

are   being  made  a  matter  of  politics,   this

provision  of  appointment of two persons  to  the

Medical  Board  should  be  by  the  Governor   in

Council,  that  is  to  say,  by  the  Council  of

Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, has been incubating for a long

time.  It  has  now arrived in the  Assembly.  The

Objects  and Reasons state fairly clearly what  it

is  all  about, but there have been some  comments

since  it  came  before the public,  and  I  think

Members may expect me to give some explanation why

a  reduction is proposed for the minimum  age  for

drivers of motor vehicles and motor cycles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present minimum age of 19 for a driver of a

motor car is high by the standards existing in any

of  the civilized and progressive countries of the

world,  many  of which have traffic problems  much

more  serious than our own. As far as I am  aware,

there  is no minimum age laid down for drivers  by

any international body, but it is significant that

a  United  Nations conference on  road  and  motor

transport,   which   met  in   Geneva   in   1949,

recommended  that, for purposes  of  international

traffic,  States  should  recognise  the   driving

permits  of other countries, subject to a  minimum

age  of 18 years, or a lower age if they so  wish.

You  will note, of course, that this means that  a

driver,  who has been licensed to drive,  say,  on

the left-hand side of the road, can, at the age of

18,  go  and drive on what is to him on the  wrong

side  of  the road in France. It assumes that  the

driver is not merely capable of driving in his own

country,  but  driving in any other country  where

there is a somewhat different traffic system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our own International Circulation Motor

Vehicle  Rules,  we provide that an  international

driving permit can be granted to a person  at  the

age  of  18. You thus have the anomalous situation

where  we  will  license somebody to  drive  in  a

foreign country, yet we refuse to license  him  to

drive  in our own country. The Objects and Reasons

of the Bill state that the age of 19 is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>



unnecessarily  high and that, by reducing  it,  we

will  come  into line with the United Kingdom  and

the  Federation, where the ages are 17  for  motor

cars and 16 for motor cycles. There is no absolute

need  for  Singapore to do what  is  done  in  the

Federation,  but  it  is very  advisable  that  we

should,  wherever possible, keep closely  in  step

with them. It is also not wholly necessary to keep

in  step with the United Kingdom, but you  do  get

quite   a  number  of  people  coming  from   both

territories  to Singapore. In fact,  at  the  very

first  "Meet-the-people" session  that  the  Chief

Minister had, he received a complaint or a request

from  a  young  person who was licensed  to  drive

elsewhere  but  was restricted in Singapore.  This

question  of people coming from the Federation  or

the  United Kingdom is not a major question. There

are really much more serious reasons why we should

at least keep in line with the Federation, because

both  territories recognise each  other's  driving

permits,  and it is most necessary and  convenient

that  drivers,  who  do have to  pass  across  the

causeway  from one territory to the other,  should

be   able  to  pass  freely  without  a   lot   of

unnecessary restrictions. At present,  the  effect

is  that  a  17-year old or an 18-year old  driver

from  Johore  Bahru, or even from Kota  Bahru  for

that  matter, can, in practice, drive his car into

Singapore  and drive all round the place  and  out

again,  whilst  our  own boys and  girls  are  not

allowed  to  drive on the roads.  It  seems  again

quite anomalous and unfair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation lowered their ages for driving

way  back  in 1950, and they seem to have  got  on

very  happily  with it. Since we  have  reciprocal

recognition  of driving licences, it is  desirable

that  we should keep in step. I am sure there will

be  no  difficulty in keeping in step, because  we

have  such  very happy and cordial relations  with

the Ministers in Kuala Lumpur.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other objections have been raised - and I am

dealing  with all these now so that  we  can  save

time when we get to the Committee stage - about  the

age limit. It is said that our roads are in -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>

conveniently crowded. There are too many  cars  on

them  and  therefore  we should  not  allow  young

people  to  drive,  and  that  only  the  old  and

experienced be allowed to get on to the  roads.  I

do  not  think that is at all a fair  attitude  to

take.  If  the  roads are over-crowded,  then  the

solution  is probably to reduce the size of  cars,

and  allow only small cars on the roads. This will

create much more space than possibly can be  taken

up  by an increase in the number of younger people

on  the  roads. The fact is, of course,  that  our

traffic is heavy, but it is nowhere near as  heavy

as  in central London or in New York. We know that

in  America  they have one car  for  every  three

persons,  and  Singapore  is  nowhere  near   that

standard  yet.  In places where they  have  really

difficult  traffic  problems, there  have  been  a

number of proposals on how to improve the flow  of

traffic  on  the  roads, but no  one  has  so  far

suggested  that you should discriminate against  a

certain  age  group and say that just because  you

have  not  reached this particular age, you  shall

not  be allowed on the roads. The solution, if you

are  going to take an age group off, will probably

be  to  take the old people off and not the  young

ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there still remains another argument,

and that is, that the young people, if they get on

the  roads, will be reckless and dangerous drivers

and  cause innumerable accidents, speeding around,

as  one newspaper puts it, in cars which have been

given them by their millionaire parents. The  fact

is  that  Singapore  boys and girls  are  just  as

sensible   and  responsible  as  boys  and   girls

anywhere else. There is no reason to suppose  that

they  are going to go mad on the roads when people

of   the  same  age  in  the  Federation  do   not

misbehave,  nor  do the young  men  and  women  in

England  misbehave. This is based, I think,  on  a

misapprehension on the part of the people who have

raised  this objection about dangerous driving  by

those  who are young. There is no evidence at  all

to  show that young drivers in Singapore are  more

dangerous than those that are older. In fact,  the

evidence  that  I have been able to get  indicates

exactly the opposite. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>



have had the accident figures for September broken

down,  and they reveal that the number of  drivers

at  the age of 19, 20 or 21, who were involved  in

accidents,  is  very considerably  less  than  the

number  of  drivers who are aged  22  to  30.  The

actual peaks of accidents come at the ages of  24,

30 and 35. These are the three peaks in the graph.

Of course, the significance of that figure depends

on  how many young people are actually driving  at

the ages of 19 to 21. I have not got exact figures

of how many there are, but that age group accounts

for  more than 50 per cent of the applications for

driving  licences. It is fair to  say  that  there

must  already  be a considerable number  of  these

relatively young people at the age of 19, and they

do  not account for a large part of the accidents.

In  fact, it is much more likely that young men or

young  women will be better at avoiding  accidents

because  their  reflexes  are  quicker  and  their

powers  of  observation and attention  are  better

than those of elderly drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, of course, licences are not given to

people  without proper testing. They are  required

to  pass their test and about 50 per cent of  them

are failed, so that these young men and women will

have  to learn their traffic code and learn  their

driving  very  carefully, because  otherwise  they

will not get their licences from the police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that somebody will wish to query the

amendment   dealing   with   the   provision   for

compounding of offences. That comes under section

82 of the Ordinance. The situation here is that  a

very  large  and increasing number  of  offers  of

compensation are made. It was 2,600 in  September,

I  think,  and  2,000 in the previous  month,  and

about  99 per cent of these were accepted  by  the

people  who committed the offences, and the amount

of  money  involved was relatively  small.  It  is

proper  that these offences should be  handled  by

people  below the rank of Assistant Superintendent

of Police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have covered everything that people

are  likely  to  say, Mr Deputy Speaker.  Sir,  I

formally move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, my sympathies

are   surely  with  the  Hon. the  Minister   for

Communications and Works (Mr Thomas).  I  thought

the  Assembly would have the pleasure  of  hearing

approximately the number of applicants  who  would

fall  within  the age group of 17 to  19.  I  also

thought, Sir, that the Minister would give  us  an

idea  of  the  additional  manpower  required   to

control traffic in the event of this Bill becoming

law.  I  also thought that he would bring  to  the

notice  of this Assembly various other aspects  of

the  problem involved in this amended Bill, but  I

am really very disappointed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my own part, Sir, I would like to bring to

the  attention of this House some of  the  salient

points  arising out of this amended Bill. A person

applies  for  a driving licence for one  of  three

reasons. Firstly, if he is the owner of a vehicle,

he  applies for a driving licence. Secondly, if he

does  not  own  a  vehicle, but  thinks  that  the

possession  of  a  driving  licence  is  a  social

accomplishment, he applies for a driving  licence.

And,  thirdly, if he thinks that a driving licence

is  an  insurance against unemployment, he applies

for a driving licence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us analyse these three points individually,

Sir. The first one is that of a person who applies

when he owns a motor car or motor cycle or any other

vehicle,  and he is entitled to a driving licence.

The  number  of people, Sir, who come  under  this

category will be very few and far between. Unless

he  is  the son of some millionaire, as  the  Hon.

Minister  points out, there is very little  chance

of his applying for a licence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, when he does not own a vehicle, but he

thinks  that  knowing how to  drive  is  a  social

accomplishment, he applies for a driving  licence.

Who  are these people? The amendment gives the age

group  as between 17 and 19. We have seen  on  the

Singapore  roads,  Sir, traffic accidents  in  the

past -



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Not due to the young people!



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> But we cannot forecast when an

accident  can occur. There are nearly 30,000  cars

in  Singapore  today, with, I think, about  10,000

lorries, and a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>



very  large  number of motor cycles.

Can one imagine the sight of a teenage  boy  driving a 3-ton lorry  on

the Singapore streets? I think that

would be a very dangerous situation

and  this  is the time we  have  to

think of the age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, people who apply

for   driving   licences   as    an

insurance against unemployment. Not

long ago, Sir, the President of the

Singapore   Hire  Car   Association

approached   our  Chief   Minister,

informing  him of the  position  of

pirate taxis. One of the effects of

reducing  this  age limit  will  be

that in Singapore, from the day the

Bill  becomes law, we will  see  a

large number of pirate taxis plying

for  hire. I do not blame  them.  I

agree  that they also have to  have

some occupation. But then what I am

worried about is the number of cars

that  will  be on the roads  which

will   bring  about  very   chaotic

conditions  in  Singapore.  Against

this  age  limit, Sir, section  285

(1)   of  the  Municipal  Ordinance

clearly  states that the  Registrar

of  Vehicles may grant a licence to

a  driver  of  a hackney  carriage,

other than the first class, to  any

person above the age of 20. So,  if

anybody were to think that this  is

an  insurance against unemployment,

that  argument would fail. He  must

be  more than 20 years of age if he

were  to  be a taxi driver.  So  I

come to my earlier point again, and

that  is, that if he wants to  have

employment,  he can have  it  as  a

pirate  taxi driver, or as a driver

for  some car owner. I do not  know

whether   there   will   be    many

vacancies for drivers for  motor car

owners.  I think there is now  more

unemployment in the driver category

than  we  ever had. I  think,  Sir,

this   amendment   will   be   very

ineffective  as  a measure  against

unemployment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, for what purpose are we

going  to have this amendment?  The

Hon. Minister said that he does not

wish  this  Assembly  to  become  a

rubber  stamp of the Federation  or

any  other  country.  He  is  quite

right,  but, at the same  time,  he

has not -



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Could you repeat that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> When I said the Hon.

Minister explained to this Assembly

that he did not intend to become  a

rubber



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>



stamp for the Federation or, for

that matter, any other country in

the world -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order,

please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes, Mr Thomas?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Which Minister is the speaker referring to?



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> That is a compliment

for  him, Sir! I said the Hon. the

Minister     for     Communications

explained to this Assembly that  he

was  not willing to become a rubber

stamp  of  the  Federation  or  any

other  country; in other words,  he

is  not  blindly following what  is

happening in the Federation and  in

other    countries.   It    is    a

compliment, Sir. I do not want  him

to get annoyed!



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I am bewildered! I do

not know what he is talking about!



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> English is a foreign

language. I am an Asian  and  I  am

arguing  this  point with  whatever

knowledge of English that  I  have.

Sir,  on these grounds, I feel that

this amendment is very untimely.  I

have   not  got  figures  for  1954

traffic  accidents and applications

for licences. The latest I have got

are  1953 figures. I would like  to

quote   a   few  figures  for   the

information of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1952, 21,767 persons - the

minimum age was 19 then - applied for

licences. In 1953, 25,969  applied.

Against these applications,  17,180

licences  were issued in  1952  and

20,019  in 1953. Apparently,  4,000

new licences are being issued every

year.  As far as I can see,  nearly

50,000  more applications would  be

received  if we were to  lower  the

age  from 19 to 17, because I think

in  Singapore today we have  89,000

people who come between the ages of

17  and 21 - if I am not mistaken.  I

may  be  wrong, because I  did  not

refer  to the statistics  which  I

received recently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, traffic accidents also count

a lot in this matter. In 1951, 34,656 reports were received. In 1952, 52,351 and in 1953, 66,139. 9,432 summonses were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>



issued  in  1951;  11,045 in 1952 and 15,378 in 1953.  Now  these

figures, I think, will show an increase in 1954 and 1955, because

there  has been a considerable increase in the number of vehicles

on the roads. Looking at these figures, I feel that this lowering

of the age limit would definitely react on the traffic problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the whole, I do not agree with this amendment and my

reasons  are  two. The first is traffic accidents.  However,  the

Hon.  Minister  might  argue  that there  is  bound  to  be  some

apprehension in the minds of the public that more vehicles  would

mean  more accidents, and I think it would be better to save  the

lives  of  a  few  than enter into a catastrophic situation.  The

second  reason,  Sir,  is that the number of  pirate  taxis  will

increase very considerably, which, I think, is not a very healthy

situation. Pirate taxis are run for the purpose of making  money,

and  I  do  not think that we should contribute to that.  Sir,  I

think  this amendment will do more harm than good. I also believe

that  it  is very untimely and unwise, and that the Minister  has

been ill-advised.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not think it

is  generally  known  that the most adept  pupils  as  pilots  of

aircraft  are  those in the teenage group, and I  understand  the

reason  is that their reaction is much quicker than older pupils.

That  perhaps explains why the figures of accidents given  by  my

hon.  Friend  and  colleague the Minister for Communications  for

those  under  20 are far less, proportionately, than  those  over

that age. I would like to say this, Sir, that if that is true - and

we  must  accept  the evidence of statistics and  those  who  are

experienced in these matters - then it is preferable that we should

educate  our  drivers when young, in order that  they  should  be

better drivers as they grow older.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it more than a little difficult to understand this

business  about  pirate  taxis. I do  not  understand  why  young

persons  should be presumed to go in for pirate taxis.  Is  it  a

carry-on from their infancy at playing pirates? I am quite  at  a

loss to follow this business of pirate taxis and why it is deemed

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>



that  particular age should attract that particular  activity.  I

think  it  is  quite fallacious to suggest that the more  driving

certificates there are, the more cars there will be on the roads;

the younger they are, the more they will be given to piracy!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of traffic accidents, Sir, has been dealt with by

statistics, and there is only one other thing that I  would  like

to  add - that laws should not be repressive, and where  they  fall

unjustly  on  any  particular section of the  people,  then  that

injustice should be remedied. No case has been made out, Sir, for

this particular discrimination. Figures have been used between 17

and  19,  and, in fact, we have the evidence of other territories

to  show that where they have had the opportunity to drive,  they

have, in no way, abused their responsibilities and privileges.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think

we must all agree that motoring is now a part of our lives, and I

believe that, as we learned how to pedal a bicycle 20 years  ago,

we  should  now  all  learn how to drive  a  car.  It  should  be

considered as part of our education. I certainly feel that a  boy

graduating from high school should also know how to drive, and  I

think  they have made it as part of a person's general  education

in  some countries that he should be able to drive before  he  is

given a certificate from the school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have just one problem, which I want the Minister in

charge  of this Bill to consider. We are now trying to lower  the

age  of these drivers. It is very good indeed that you lower this

age  so that more people are eligible to drive, but, at the  same

time,  it will not be within the reach of these people, or  other

people  who  will be affected, if the machinery  for  testing  of

drivers is also not stepped up. I have been keeping in touch with

people who applied for driving licences and they came along to me

and said, "It is very difficult to fix up a day for testing."  If

we  are  going to increase the number of people eligible for  it,

then  probably the duration for getting a date for testing  would

be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>

even   longer.  I  think,  if  the  Minister   for

Communications will consider this point  of  view,

the Bill will do some good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Thomas, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it has been

a  very  interesting little debate. I must express

my regret to the Member for Seletar (Mr Nair) for

not  making  myself clear. He was anxious  to  say

that  I  was not a rubber stamp. I never suggested

that I was. I never used the word at all. I merely

said  that it was not essential in this case  that

we should keep in step with the Federation on this

very, very minor matter indeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong)

raised the question of more speedy testing so that

people  will  get tested, and fail  or  pass  more

quickly.  It is not a matter which I, personally,

have to deal with in my Ministry, but it is purely

a  matter  of  how  many  testers  you  have,  and

consequently how much money this Assembly supplies

for  paying  the  testers,  and  the  other  costs

involved. If the Member is dissatisfied  with  the

number of testers, he can criticise it, presumably

on the Estimates when they come up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Seletar made a rather confusing

speech. I do not think I need deal with the  whole

of   it,  but  there  are  two  points  which  are

particularly confusing. He gave three reasons  why

people wanted licences, and one of them, he  said,

was owning a car. He said these young people would

not  own cars - or very, very few of them would - and

therefore there was no need to give them licences,

and  then  they  would not have  cars.  Well,  the

answer is, of course, that a large number of  cars

are continually being licensed, and the number  is

growing every month - some fantastic figure which  I

cannot remember at the moment - but the increase  is

a  very  rapid one. Obviously, when father  has  a

car, his son is likely to drive it as well. It  is

a  great  convenience that he should  be  able  to

drive  it  so  that perhaps when father  goes  to

office, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>



son  can  bring  the car back to  take  mother  to

market.  It  is a great convenience  to  have  two

people  in  the house who can drive. It  does  not

increase the number of licensed vehicles,  but  it

does, of course, mean that the car is on the  road

for longer periods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the confusing thing is that - that although he

argued  that there were very, very few extra  cars

as a result of this, yet he talked most vigorously

about  the congestion of traffic that would result

and  the fact that more vehicles on the road would

cause  more accidents. I think there was confusion

in  his mind there because different parts of  his

speech were not quite well related.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point on which he spoke vigorously was

unemployment.  He  tried  to  horrify  us  with  a

picture of a teenage boy driving a 3-ton lorry. If

he had done his home work and read the Bill and not

the original Road Traffic Ordinance, he would have

found that section 23 subsection (1) restricts the

age  of  driving  a motor vehicle. Subsection  (2)

restricts   the  age  of  driving  motor cars.   In

subsection  (3) you have to be 21 before  you  can

have  a  heavy  locomotive, a light locomotive,  a

motor  tractor, or a heavy motor car on the  roads,

and so forth. In fact, his arguments do not apply.

We  are not going to get teen-agers tearing  round

the  streets with 3-ton trucks. It is not part  of

the intention of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think there is anything much in his

quotation  from  the  1952  traffic  figures   for

accidents and licences and so on. I have the  last

few  months' figures if anybody would like to hear

them.  I  do not think anybody will. They keep  on

going up more or less. The answer does not lie  in

putting  an unjust restriction on a small  section

of  the  population, but in taking proper measures

of road safety and road education and other things

which are not associated with this Bill in any way

at all.

be  taken by the Police Courts, second offences in

respect  of possession of opium or opium  utensils

attract  a  punishment of one year's imprisonment.

As  Police  Courts have only powers  to  give  six

months' imprisonment, they therefore have no power

to  deal with second offences, although they  have

considerable  experience  in  dealing  with  first

offences. Sir, there is no reason why



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>



the  Police Courts should not have this power, and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is rather a formidable sounding motion,

but  I  do  assure the House that it really  means

very  little at all. It is a pure formality. Since

the Departmental Titles (Alteration) Ordinance was

enacted  in 1950, there have been several  changes

of  title  due to constitutional changes  and  for

other reasons, and it is necessary to validate the

statutory   acts   performed  by  the   Government

officers in the Schedule. The sole purpose of this

motion, therefore, is that officers may be able to

fulfil  their statutory requirements  under  their

correct titles.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  this is another step forward to Merdeka!  We

used  to  call  him  the Deputy  Commissioner  for

Excise,   and  now  we  call  him  the   Assistant

Comptroller  of Customs. We used to call  him  the

Curator  of the Herbarium, and now we call him  the

Keeper  of  the Herbarium, Botanical  Gardens.  We

used to call him the Controller of Labour, and now

we  call him the Commissioner for Labour!  No  one

will  object  to  this change to more  progressive

titles.  But let us all hope and pray  that,  with

this change of titles, there will come a change in

the  spirit in which their holders discharge their

duties.  We have the same persons imbued with  the

same spirit, having the same old concepts and  the

same  old habits, but now they are clothed with  a

different constitution - not quite as radical as  we

would  wish  them to be. If they  could  meet  the

changing circumstances and the changing times with

a   spirit   that  could  infuse   in   this   new

constitution a meaning which those who  framed  it

perhaps might not have fully intended, then I  say

we  may yet have a future, not altogether as  dark

and  bleak  as  one would imagine looking  at  the

Chief Minister in his present mood -

short?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am much

obliged  to the Chair for having put my  intention

in  such a kind manner. After all, even if we were

to  change,  for  instance,  the  title  of  Chief

Minister  to  that of Prime Minister - if  we  still

have  the same constitution with the same sort  of

petulant and petty spirit with which the office of

Chief  Minister  might have been  infused - then  we

would not really have made much progress -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir. I

would  enquire from you, Mr Speaker, Sir, whether

it  is  appropriate that terms of  that  character

should be applied to a Member of the House and  to

the Chief Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The objection, I take it, was the

use of the word "petulant"?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Various terms of abuse, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member implied that the

Chief  Minister is petulant, then, of  course,  he

was completely out of order. He must withdraw that

word.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Far be it from me to imply

that  the  Chief Minister is petulant! All  I  was

suggesting was a hypothetical case. If  the  title

of Chief



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>



Minister is changed to that of Prime Minister,  it

would  not  make much difference if, in fact,  the

same  spirit  infused  the Prime  Ministership  as

infused the Chief Ministership. What I was  trying

to  convey,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, was  that  with  a

change  in  titles, there should come a change  in

the  spirit with which these persons who have been

invested with authority discharge their duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, perhaps more on the Opposition Benches than

on   the  Government  Benches,  realise  the  deep

significance of the age we are passing through. It

is  a  time  when  changes in  outward  trappings,

unless  accompanied by a dynamic  and  a  decisive

change in spirit, will reach a stage where we will

begin  to  make-believe. We begin to change  names

and  become  completely unrealistic and completely

mad.  Whilst  we  all support this  Bill  to  call

people  by  their right names and make them  sound

more   democratic,  we  would  like  to  add  this

note - that it is important that they not only sound

democratic,  but  that  they  should  act   in   a

democratic manner.
