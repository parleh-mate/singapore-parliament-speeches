<div align="center"><b>SCHOOLS BUILT SINCE 1959</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for

Education  (a)  how many schools  have  been  built

since 1959; (b) are all those schools provided with

adequate  sports grounds; and (c) in  how  many  of

those schools have the ground floors cracked;  what

are  the  reasons  for  the  cracks;  and  has  any

remedial action been taken.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since 1959 the Government has

built 55 primary and 56 secondary schools, and  one

junior college. All Government schools are provided

with playgrounds, but the size of these playgrounds

varies,  depending on the availability of land.  In

the past years it has become increasingly difficult

to  secure school sites in or near to the heart  of

the  city  big  enough to provide adequate  playing

fields. Where



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>



such  grounds are not quite adequate,  the  schools

concerned  are  encouraged to  share  other  school

playing  fields  in  the neighbourhood  or  to  use

public open spaces and sporting amenities belonging

to  community centres. On the whole, the  provision

of grounds for sports and games in schools is quite

adequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past three or four years, several cracks

have  developed in some parts of the ground  floors

of  five schools as a result of the sinking floors.

However,  these occurred only in schools  built  on

low-lying  sites  that  had been  filled.  Remedial

action   has   been  taken  by  the  Public   Works

Department to reinforce the concrete ground  floors

in these five schools.

<div align="center"><b>(Applications for free water supply)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for Law and

National Development (a) what are the procedures in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>



respect of an application for free water supply  to

rural  areas, where water-mains are not  available,

during a drought; and (b) how long it will take for

such an application to be considered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development (National Development Division) (Mr Ho Cheng Choon) (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all requests for the supply of drinking water

can  be  made orally or in writing to the Chairman,

Secretary, or District Secretaries of the Urban and

Rural   Services  Committee.  Such   requests   are

attended  to immediately, and water is supplied  as

soon as the number of households requiring water is

ascertained.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong):</b> Sir, can the

Parliamentary  Secretary  inform  the  House  which

department  is  responsible  for  ascertaining  the

number of households?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Water

Department of the Public Utilities Board  has  been

requested to ascertain the number of households.

<div align="center"><b>OVERSEAS MARKETS FOR</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>POULTRY PRODUCTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for Law

and  National  Development what efforts  have  been

made  by the Primary Production Department  in  the

promotion of overseas markets for poultry products.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Primary Production

Department  is  essentially a technical  department

whose   efforts  are  directed  towards   assisting

farmers  to  produce  better livestock  and  better

crops.   Export  promotion  is  not  one   of   its

functions.  However, the Department is in  constant

touch with the Economic Development Board, Intraco,

and  exporting  firms to encourage  export  of  our

livestock products.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important prerequisite of export

promotion  is,  of  course,  to  maintain  a   high

standard  of  our products. Towards this  end,  the

Primary  Production Department insists  on  certain

veterinary health standards to ensure that  poultry

and other livestock products are wholesome and that

processing   and  canning  factories  comply   with

certain  hygienic  standards.  As  a  result,   our

poultry   products  are  allowed  entry  into   and

exported to several countries, like Australia,  the

United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and Vietnam.

<div align="center"><b>(Office accommodation)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for Law

and  National  Development whether  there  are  any

plans  to provide better office accommodation  for

the Attorney-General and his staff than the offices

they are currently occupying.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, arrangements have

been  made  for the Attorney-General's Chambers  to

occupy  the entire first floor of the Public  Works

Department  building  at  High  Street,  when  that

Department moves to its new office at Mount Erskine

sometime  this  year.  This move  will  enable  the

Attorney-General and his staff to be provided  with

better and more adequate office accommodation.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may  I  ask the Minister whether he means  that  it

will  not be possible for Parliament to extend  its

premises  to the old P.W.D. building, or  at  least

part  of  it? Or does he not think that  Parliament

needs  to  extend  its  premises  for  purposes  of

parliamentary business or for business ancillary to

Parliament.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, active

consideration  is now being given by Government  to

extend  the parliamentary premises, and the  P.W.D.

building  would  be  an  ideal  building  for  such

extension.  But  in that event the Attorney-General

will have to move out again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0902 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0902 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs. P. Govindaswamy, N. Govindasamy, Cheong Yuen Chee, Lim Soo Peng, J. F. Conceicao, P. Selvadurai, and Madam Chan Choy Siong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can the Minister inform the House how many

foreigners  who have invested $125,000 or  $250,000

here  have  been given permanent residence  in  the

Republic?  Does he not think that these investments

are  too  small a sum for foreigners  to  be  given

permanent  residence in Singapore? There  are  also

people who have invested millions of dollars either

in  industries  or  hotels. These  people  are  not

permanent residents but are living in Singapore  on

visas  granted  to them on a yearly  basis  by  the

Immigration Department. If they apply for permanent

residence,  will their applications be approved  on

the strength of their investments?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the entry of non-citizen wives into

Singapore,  the Minister answered an oral  question

on  this  topic  asked by the Member  for  Geylang

Serai on 9th March, 1970. My question is this: will

the   Minister  consider  asking  the   Immigration

Department  to  maintain  close  liaison  with  the

Registry  of Marriages? In this respect, perhaps  a

questionnaire  can be given to those  citizens  who

wish  to  marry non-citizen wives to  complete  and

return  either to the Registry of Marriages or  the

Immigration   Department.  If   this   measure   is

introduced,  it will caution Singapore citizens  of

the consequences of taking



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>



non-citizen  wives. They will then be more  careful

about  marrying non-citizens. However, this measure

perhaps deserves consideration, especially when our

male  population exceeds our female  population  by

about 85,000, according to a recent census taken in

the Republic.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

know  that  many Singapore citizens  in  the  lower

income  group who have wives outside Singapore  are

not  allowed  to bring them here to stay,  even  if

they are qualified to do so. May I know the reasons

for refusal?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is the case of a boy who was born

in  China  but who came to Singapore in 1956.  Some

time  later,  he went to work in Kuala Lumpur.  His

parents,  brothers  and sisters are  all  Singapore

citizens  and  are staying here,  and  he  used  to

travel  up and down Malaysia. One day, while coming

down  to  Singapore  to visit his  family,  he  was

caught  unawares by the travel restrictions imposed

at  the  Causeway, and his blue Singapore  identity

card  was taken away by the Immigration authorities

at  the  Woodlands checkpoint, as he did not follow

the proper procedure. He was sent back to Malaysia.

Unfortunately, his Malaysian work permit  had  also

expired and could not be renewed. As a result, this

boy,  who is only 17 years old, is jobless  and  is

stranded  in  Kuala  Lumpur. He  has  no  relatives

there,  and  is  left to face starvation.  He  then

cabled  his  father  in Singapore  saying  that  he

wanted  to  join his family. The father applied  to

the  Immigration  authorities for consideration  of

his  son's  case, but the application was rejected.

The  boy's  family are all Singapore citizens,  and

there  is  a  job here waiting for  him.  Will  the

Minister  consider  returning  the  blue  Singapore

identity  card to him so that he can stay with  his

family in Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, from the list of Members who have given notice

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>



speak  on  this  subhead, it  is  clear  that  the

Immigration  Department  is  in  for  a   lot   of

criticism. However, I will confine myself to  just

one   aspect,   and   that  is,  locally-domiciled

residents who are non-citizens. When these  people

wish  to  travel  abroad, they  are  issued  with

certificates  of  identity,  and  only  on  urgent

grounds. Generally they are allowed to travel only

from Singapore to Malaysia, and their certificates

of  identity are good for one journey  only.  Sir,

most  of  these people travel for the  purpose  of

visiting sick relatives or urgent private matters;

in  certain  cases  they travel for  some  festive

occasion.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Immigration Department charges something

like  $24.60  for  this certificate  of  identity,

which includes reentry permit charges, etc. In  my

opinion,  $24.60 is a little too much,  especially

when  only one trip can be made, and in some cases

this  trip  is  made only as far as Johore  Bahru.

Sir,  for  a  Singapore resident to visit  a  sick

relative in Johore Bahru, and to have to pay a fee

of  $24.60  is, in my opinion, too much  when  you

consider  the fact that an international passport,

which  has  a life span of five years, costs  only

$25  and  can  be used for as many  trips  as  one

likes.  On  the one hand, we charge $24.60  for  a

certificate  of  identity for  one  trip  to  East

Malaysia.  On  the  other hand,  we  are  generous

enough  to maintain the archaic practice of paying

good conduct allowances to our policemen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of these certificates of identity is

also  a  little too restrictive. When one  applies

for  a  certificate of identity to  visit  a  sick

relative  in  Malaysia, one has to show  proof  of

illness  in  the form of either a  telegram  or  a

letter,  etc.  Our telephone system is  efficient,

and  more often than not, the news of the  illness

of  a  relative across the Causeway is often  made

via  the telephone. Therefore, requiring proof  of

illness in the form of a letter or a telegram  is,

I  think,  making  it a little too  difficult  and

inconveniencing the local residents. Therefore,  I

would  suggest that more liberal consideration  be

given to this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>



issue   of   certificates  of  identity   by   the

Immigration Department. At the same time, I  would

be  grateful to the Minister if he would look into

the  possibility  of  reducing  the  cost  for   a

certificate of identity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in  the past many of our citizens have  gone

across the Causeway to seek employment. The recent

action  by  the Malaysian Government  to  restrict

employment  opportunities  to  our  citizens   has

forced many of them to return to Singapore to earn

a living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During their period of residence in Malaysia,

many of these citizens have raised families there.

For obvious reasons, the members of their families

have  taken out Malaysian identity cards. The men-folk,  however, were allowed entry into  Singapore

without  any  restriction, but not the  wives  and

children of these citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have raised this problem with the Immigration

Department, and was surprised to receive  a  reply

stating that the people concerned could only apply

for  social visit passes for the members of  their

family  in this instance, as there is no provision

in  the  regulations to enable them to  return  to

Singapore  for  permanent  residence.   Will   the

Minister  consider measures to assist the families

of  these  Singapore citizens who are affected  by

the  Malaysian Government's action to  return  and

reside permanently in Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am  informed that there are quite a few  cases  of

people   who  were  denied  entry  into  Singapore

because their passports had expired. These people,

all  Singapore  citizens,  were  in  Indonesia  or

somewhere  else,  and, for one  reason  or  other,

could  not renew their passports. Later  on,  when

they  wanted to renew their passports,  they  were

not  allowed  to  do  so. Without  renewing  their

passports,  they  were  not allowed  reentry  into

Singapore. Will the Minister state whether  it  is

his  policy  to deny such people readmission  into

Singapore?  If  so,  please  state  the  rationale

behind it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> I am not moving my amendment, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> I am also not moving my amendment, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I would like to touch on  a  certain

case concerning the immigration regulations and, at

the  same  time,  to  air my complaints.  With  the

achievement  of  independence, it is  our  duty  to

create   employment  opportunities  for   our   own

citizens.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary  for   the

Immigration  Department to  take  measures  against

illegal immigrants entering our country to share in

our  prosperity. I think everyone agrees with  this

policy. However, I think the Immigration Department

should  relax some of its regulations. For example,

one  regulation is that if a person wishes to apply

for  his relative to come to Singapore, he  has  to

state   the   age   of  his  relative   and   their

relationship before he or she can be admitted  into

Singapore.  If a son wants to apply for his  mother

to  come to Singapore, he must first prove that she

is  more  than 65 years old and that  she  has  no

other  people abroad to support her. If  a  husband

wants  to  apply for his wife to come to Singapore,

there are certain regulations which state that  she

can  be allowed into Singapore to be reunited  with

him  provided  they have met each  other  within  a

certain period. All these regulations are laid down

by the Government and everybody must abide by them.

Although   sometimes   I  feel   that   all   these

regulations  must  be observed, I  still  think  we

should relax them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one example of a husband who applied for

his wife, who is in China, to come to Singapore  to

be  reunited  with him. However, according  to  the

Immigration Department, if the husband has not  met

his  wife for five years, it means that the husband

and  wife relationship has been broken off.  It  so

happened that when this person applied for his wife

to  come  to Singapore, she fell sick. As a result,

she  was  not  able to come here.  So  he  was  not

successful



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>



in  his  application. He wanted to  visit  her  in

China but was not able to do so. Five years later - his wife had by then recovered from her sickness  -

he reapplied for her to come to Singapore. However,

the  Immigration  Department  rejected  it  on  the

grounds  that she was not eligible for  entry  into

Singapore  because  he had not  met  her  for  five

years, and, according to the regulations, she could

not come here. This person came to me for help, and

I  informed the Minister concerned about it. But he

said,  since there were so many women in Singapore,

why  did  he  not  want  to marry  a  local  female

citizen? I told him that this man was already  past

60  years  of  age, so how could he  marry  another

young girl locally? I also told him that, according

to  Chinese  custom, a man is not allowed  to  take

another wife if the present wife still lives.  This

man  also said that he had married his wife out  of

love.  It was not an arranged marriage. Their  love

for  each other was very deep and they were willing

to  live  together  to  the  end  of  their  lives.

Therefore,  how  could we force them  to  separate?

This person was in despair and he asked his son  to

apply  for his mother to come to Singapore. As  she

was   then   67   years  of  age,  the  Immigration

Department  said that at this age she was  eligible

to come to Singapore. However, when the son applied

for  an  entry permit for his mother,  it  was  not

granted  because  another application  had  already

been made on her behalf by his father. I then asked

the son to try again. However, when he was about to

send   in   his   application  to  the  Immigration

Department, the father died.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are all human and laws are

made  by man. Therefore, all these troubles created

by man should be resolved by man.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from this case, we should be sympathetic

to certain applicants in future. In this particular

case,  we  should have tried our best to  help  him

reunite with his wife before he died. That was  his

wish.  But  under the circumstances  this  was  not

fulfilled because he could not see her. This is  an

example  of  our Government not being  in  sympathy

with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>



the applicant. Everything must be done according to

the  law, it is said. I hope the Minister  will  be

sympathetic  to  applications  of  this  nature  in

future.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will reply first to the Member for

Changi  before proceeding to the other Members  who

have raised almost the same points. The Member  for

Changi  wants to know how many foreigners who  have

invested  between $125,000 and $250,000  have  been

given permanent residence in Singapore. I regret to

say  that I do not carry the figures around  in  my

head.   But   if   the  Member  still   wants   the

information, he can put in a question and  it  will

be made available. He also wants to know whether  a

locally-domiciled resident who invests in  industry

will  be given permanent residence. If a person  is

locally-domiciled, it means that he is  allowed  to

stay here and, in time to come, he will qualify for

citizenship. Is that what the Member wants to know?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> No, Sir. I am referring to a

person staying in Singapore but who holds a foreign

passport. Therefore, he is not domiciled  here.  He

is  a  national  of  another  country  residing  in

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Then he comes under the category

of  persons who apply for permanent residence  with

an  investment  of $1/4 million. If the  person  so

mentioned  by the Member for Changi wants permanent

residence, he will apply in the normal way  as  the

others. There is no difference between them. If  he

is  thinking  of  investing or  has  invested  $1/4

million --



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, he has invested millions

of  dollars in industry, hotels and other projects,

and  he is trying to apply for permanent residence

on  the  strength that he has already  invested  in

Singapore  prior to the introduction of the  scheme

to  give  permanent  residence  to  foreigners  who

invest $125,000.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker Sir, I must confess

that  I am unaware of such cases. It is not because

of  ignorance.  If a man is astute enough  to  have

earned  a few million dollars, I think he is astute

enough to take advantage of any scheme that we  may

have so that he can obtain permanent residence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to come to the other Members, I think there

are two points in common which they raised. One  is

with  regard to the entry of non-citizen wives  and

children  of  Singapore  citizens.  What  they  are

asking  for  is a liberalisation of the  law  which

permits non-citizen wives and children of Singapore

citizens  to  come into Singapore  on  a  permanent

residence basis. I think it will help a great  deal

and  will  save a lot of time if I mention  briefly

the  conditions under which non-citizen  wives  and

children  of  Singapore citizens  are  eligible  to

apply  for  permanent residence  in  the  Republic.

These   are  laid  down  in  section  10   of   the

Immigration   Ordinance,   1955,   and    in    the

consideration of applications various  factors  are

taken  into consideration; namely, (a) whether  the

marriage  is  lawful;  (b)  whether  the  wife  and

children  qualify under paragraphs 4 and 5  of  the

Immigration  (Prohibition of  Entry)  Order,  1966.

i.e.,   whether  the  wife  has  not  been   living

separately from the husband for a continuous period

of  five years after the date of the marriage, and

whether the children are under six years of age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, may I digress a little and take up the

points raised by the Member for Delta on a specific

case? She probably knows more about Chinese customs

than I do. But my understanding is that the Chinese

of this generation of about 50 years and over, more

often than not, would prefer to take more than  one

wife!  Here  again,  without going  into  the  case

specifically, I have my doubts whether  this  is  a

bona   fide  case  of  husband  and  wife  because,

normally,  again I stand to be corrected, according

to  Chinese  custom, usually the  husband  is  much

older  than  the wife. In this instance,  the  wife

appears  to be seven years older than the  husband.

Therefore, I think the application was not approved



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>



because the Immigration officials may have doubts

whether that was a bona fide case of love at first

sight, or whatever it is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta also mentioned that they had

not been living together for five years because attempts had

been made during that time for the wife to gain entry

here. First, the wife was sick and there was the

question of permits. If they were so much in love

and if the husband really required the presence of

his wife here, it would not have taken five years to

go through the official procedure. And if he could

live - I presume that he lived well.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Point of clarification,

Sir. The Minister should not forget that the cause of the

delay was that the wife could not come here unless she is older

than the specified age limit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, this is a different matter,

The Member says the woman had not reached the specified

age. At first, probably the application was prepared

wrongly. As far as I understand, the application was

made on the ground that she is the wife of a local

resident. If she is the wife of a local citizen, it is

not the age that is to be taken into consideration. It

is the other factors which I have mentioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now come to the third factor to which consideration will be given for admitting non-citizen wives and children of Singapore citizens. It is whether the husband is in a position to support his wife and children. We are not a hard-hearted Government and

I believe the Ministers here have got feelings. At the same time, in deciding upon policy, we must not allow ourselves to be swayed by sentiment. The only sentiment we should allow ourselves to be swayed by is, is it for the good of Singapore? If it is for the good of Singapore, then we will carry out the policy. And once a policy has been decided, as my colleague, the

Minister for Foreign Affairs, has said, we must stand firm.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>



On the question of entry permits, we do relax

the regulations sometimes under exceptional

circumstances, because of our feelings, our sentiments, and on humanitarian grounds. We are not that hard-hearted as was

made out to appear by the Member for Delta.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now take up the suggestion put up by the

Member for Changi that there should be closer liaison

between the Registry of Marriages and the Immigration

Department. He suggests that Singapore citizens who

intend to marry non-citizens should be provided with

a questionnaire. I do not know what questions he has in mind.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Questions like how much money the person has and

whether he can support the woman.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, as I said, if a man is intent on, marrying a woman out of love, no amount of prevention

by any Government official will stop that marriage. But I think we have

announced time and time again - and I have just made it clear - the conditions under which we will allow a non-citizen wife to enter Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take up the point again that we have no feelings,

as my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, said the

other day, it is only those cases which have not

been approved that come to Members' notice. Cases that have been

approved do not come back to thank them for their assistance. For the information of Members, I would like to give some figures. In 1968, there were a

total of 910 applications of Malaysian

wives of Singapore citizens. Out of these

910 applications, 742 were approved. In

1969, out of 902 applications. 795 were

approved. So you will see that we have

not been very hard-hearted in enforcing

this regulation, and whenever we can,

we will let them through and make life

happier for our citizens who have

married non-citizen wives.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, as regards

applications which were not approved,

namely, 168 in 1968 and 107 in 1969,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>



these were mainly due to the fact that

the husbands' income was low and they

were not considered to have capacity

lo support their wives, much less their

children, later on in Singapore. I think

that answers the point raised by the

Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Point of

clarification, Sir. I quite agree with the

Minister's reply. But what happens if a

citizen brings in a non-citizen wife and

the next day he wins a lottery prize of $400,000?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

we do not gamble on the future of

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> But what

about the lottery and the gambling that

is now going on in Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> That is gambling.

But I hope the Member for Anson will

listen closely to me. I said we do not

gamble on the future of Singapore. We

take no chances with the future of

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Yes, I agree.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I may not have

heard the Member for Toa Payoh

correctly. Singapore citizens do not

require work permits to take up employment in Singapore. Is that the Member's

question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> When they

were in Malaysia, they had work

permits in order to be able to work.

When their work permits were withdrawn, they wanted to bring their

families to Singapore. The men were

allowed to come in, but not their wives

and children.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Their applications

to bring in their wives and children

would be governed by the three factors

that I have mentioned. If they are

economically viable, there is no reason

why their wives and children cannot be

allowed in. As I have indicated, about

eight out of ten applications have been

approved.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah asked

why non-citizens have to pay $24.60

for a certificate of identity when citizens

pay $25 for an international passport

which is valid for five years. As a

Singapore citizen, you have certain

privileges. Surely we should treat our

citizens better than non-citizens. And

for these certain privileges - privileges

over and above those not enjoyed by

non-citizens, and I think every country

does that - our citizens have got more

responsibilities than non-citizens. I think

the Member is also mistaken because the

fee for a restricted certificate of identity

for travelling to West Malaysia is only

$5 and not $24.60. The sum of $24.60

is charged for an intemational certificate

of identity for travel overseas other

than West Malaysia.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> On a point of

clarification, Sir. I think the present fee

for a certificate of identity for travelling

to Malaysia, including the re-entry permit charges, etc, is $24.60.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> May I take some

time to check the figures again, Sir?

Either the typist has made a mistake

here or the Member has been misinformed. My information is that in the

case of a restricted certificate of identity for direct travel between West

Malaysia and Singapore, the fee is $5.

However, I am willing to go back and

seek further clarification. If there is a

different charge for citizens and non-citizens, there is a very good reason for

it. As far as possible, I will keep this

distinction because it indicates how valuable Singapore citizenship is. A Singapore citizen has more privileges than a

non-citizen. This is as it should be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I clarify how a certificate of

identity is issued? It is governed by

Article 28 of the United Nations Final

Act and Convention. It is an International Geneva Agreement. It requires

that before we can issue a certificate of

identity to a person, he must produce

documentary evidence from his country

of birth that he is stateless, and if he

can produce that evidence, then he will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>



be  issued with a certificate of identity with  re-entry  facilities  upon  application.  This  is  to

prevent  anyone issuing a certificate  of  identity

from  infringing on the rights of  the  country  in

which  the  applicant  is born.  That  is  why  the

applicant    is   covered   by   an   international

convention. That is the law and, as the Member  for

Delta  has said, laws are made by man and they  can

be  un-made by man. She said that we must have some

human consideration in the application of the  law.

We have shown human consideration here. That is why

in   genuine   cases  where  special  consideration

justifies it, we issue a certificate of identity to

a  person  who  is normally not eligible  for  such

travel facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has suggested that

we  should  accept a telephone call as evidence.  I

think he has a higher regard for the honesty of the

average  man  than  we  who  have  worked  in   the

Government for some time have. I will not take  the

responsibility of directing my officer to accept  a

telephone call as genuine evidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Havelock wants to know the

rationale  for not issuing passports  to  Singapore

citizens  abroad  who have forgotten  or  have  not

renewed  their  passports in time. There  are  many

reasons, some of which I cannot divulge. It may  be

that  during  a person's stay abroad, he  may  have

been  involved  in  activities which  constitute  a

security  risk to us when he returns. May I  remind

Members  that  the  issue  of  a  passport  to  any

applicant is not one of right? It is a privilege.



<br><br>3.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is "guillotine" time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I am sorry, Mr Speaker. I would

like  to reply further. However, I believe  I  have

covered most of the points raised.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time allotted for Head 0902 having expired, the

following amendment, standing in the name of Madam Chan Choy Siong, was not proceeded with:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the total sum to be allocated for Head

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $2,183,710 for Head 0902 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1001 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Madam Chan Choy Siong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there have been a lot of

cultural  activities in Singapore in the  past  few

years. More and more people have come to understand

the  importance  of cultural activities  in  nation

building.  As  I  am  very interested  in  cultural

activities, I am pleased to see marked progress  in

this   direction.   I  have  spoken   on   cultural

activities  during the Adjournment debate  in  this

House  on  two occasions. This was as long  ago  as

1966.  I  gave  my  views then on  how  to  promote

healthy  cultural activities and foster a  cultural

consciousness  among our people in  order  to  help

build  our nation. Let me quote what I said on  5th

December, 1966. It is in Hansard, Vol. 25,  No.  7,

col.  515. I said then that a healthy culture could

imbue  fine  thinking in our people. On  the  other

hand,   yellow   or  degenerating   culture   could

demoralise a people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is the Member quoting

from Hansard or a newspaper? Mr Speaker, Sir,  the

Member said he is quoting from Hansard, but  he  is

reading from a newspaper.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is what the Member said.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, may I

clarify the position? The proceedings reported in

Hansard are in English. This newspaper that I have

here published the text of my speech in Chinese. I

am quoting from this newspaper. It is the same as

my speech in Hansard. I feel that the

Parliamentary Secretary is trying to be too smart!



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> I was trying to help him, Sir.

He  was quoting from a newspaper, although he said

it  was  a translation from the Hansard.  I  would

like  to  have some clarification whether what  he

was saying is actually the official translation of

the  Hansard, the newspaper translation,  his  own

translation, or a translation by somebody else.  I

think  it  is  the business of the House  to  know

this.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary must

understand  that  the Member for Sembawang  cannot

read  English.  So he has to get  the  translation

done somewhere by somebody.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> The Member must indicate

whether  he is quoting from the newspaper or  from

the   translation  in  the  Hansard.  I  am  quite

prepared  to  accept it if he says he  is  quoting

from a newspaper.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  since you have already made a ruling, I hope

the Member will not make any unnecessary remarks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, I insist on a ruling.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I

think  the Member for Sembawang should not  regard

his  speech  in  the  newspaper  as  the  official

translation of his speech made in this House.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Member for Sembawang says he

wishes  to quote from a newspaper, we will  accept

it  provided  he gives the date and  name  of  the

newspaper.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, it comes to the same thing. It

is the Sin Chew Jit Poh and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>



the  date of publication is 7th December, 1966.  I

am  quoting  from  page 8. I  made  the  following

points  then. Ours is a multi-racial  society.  We

must  develop  the  traditional  cultures  of  the

various  races.  We do not mean to  do  away  with

Western  culture or to impose the culture  of  one

race upon the other races.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another paragraph deals with imported cultures.

We  should  stop the import of poisonous cultures.

As  a  newly independent Republic we should create

our  own culture and try to enrich it. Our culture

should aim at enriching the life of our people. We

should   participate   in   and   enjoy   cultural

activities   which  will  help  us   achieve   our

objective of nation building. I will stop  quoting

here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should pursue a healthy cultural policy to

help  us  in nation building. The People's  Action

Party's  policy  is to promote a healthy  culture.

But  the question is whether the officials in  the

Ministry of Culture, or even the Minister  himself

and  his Parliamentary Secretary, have carried out

this  policy.  I  would like  to  quote  from  the

magazine, the Singapore Monthly, published on 15th

March, wherein you will find some criticism of our

culture. It says that the Government has  put  the

onus  on public officers to execute the policy  of

promoting a healthy culture to achieve its purpose

of  nation  building. However, public officers  do

not   understand  the  full  significance  of  our

policy. What with the administrative machinery and

their   poor   understanding  of   the   political

situation,  public officers do not understand  the

purpose  of  this policy and cannot implement  it.

They  are,  therefore, behind  time.  How  can  we

expect anything good out of them? In the hands  of

such  people, the policy implemented is  different

from what is envisaged.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very serious deviation. This goes to

show   that   when   certain  officers   implement

Government policy, they do so not in the interests

of  the country or to meet the requirement of  the

age,  but  according to their personal  whims  and

fancies. They totally disregard the policy of  our

Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from this we can see that the Minister in

charge  should  seriously reconsider  how  best  to

promote our cultural policy. In fact, I should  say

that in the Adjournment debate in this House on 5th

December, 1966, I made ten proposals on the  matter

of  promoting  culture in nation building.  If  the

Minister has the time, he can refer to my speech to

see  whether  any  use can be  made  of  these  ten

suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two suggestions to make here. First, we

should  organise  a  large-scale cultural  festival

every year to enable our youths to perform cultural

activities  for mutual emulation and study  by  the

different  races. Second, a certain  professor  has

recently   suggested   the   establishment   of   a

scholarship for cultural pursuits. I think this  is

a  very good suggestion. I wonder what the Minister

thinks  of  it. If we can introduce this award  for

national cultural pursuits, then we will be able to

help cultural activists to create more artistry  in

their  songs, novels, dramas, and other  fields  of

cultural activity. Thus they will be able to enrich

the spiritual life of our people and make Singapore

very  much advanced in culture. I hope the Minister

will consider my suggestions seriously.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the Member for Sembawang has raised a  number

of points on cultural policy. I would like to raise

a few points too. These relate to what the Ministry

of Culture should do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that it has for a very long time not done

much.  Singapore is not a cultural desert. Quite  a

large  number  of  people are engaged  in  cultural

activities  and  what they produce  is  of  a  high

standard.  But  the Ministry has not established  a

close and proper relationship with cultural workers

in  improving our culture that is more  in  keeping

with  the  policy of our Government.  The  Ministry

should set up something like an Academy of Arts  so

that the people can engage in cultural activities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this: other than the artistes

and  actors who have gone abroad, many of our local

talent  have not been able to go abroad to  further

their  artistic pursuits because of their financial

limitations.  They have to rely  on  self-study.  I

think  this type of people - actors, artistes,  and

so  on,  who are quite large in numbers  -  can  at

present have an opportunity to express their talent

only in a limited way in the field of culture. They

do  not  have much scope for expression, much  less

achieve the complete fruition of their talents.  As

a  result,  we  have lost a great number  of  these

talented people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for example, those amateurs who are engaged

in  the  activities staged at the National Theatre.

Very  often  they collect a few dollars'  transport

allowance whenever there is a rehearsal., If  there

is  no rehearsal, they do not get any allowance for

transport.  They are only amateurs.  Most  of  them

have  their own jobs. Their working hours are long,

and  they  do not have an opportunity to engage  in

these cultural activities properly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Ministry of Culture should set up

something  like  a  national  institute  for   our

artistes, so that those people engaged in  cultural

activities can become professionals. They can  also

concentrate  on their own fields, such  as  how  to

promote the standard of culture and how to give the

people  of  Singapore a more colourful  and  richer

cultural life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. Very often these days, the

programmes we see on T.V. are, in fact, part of our

cultural activities. These programmes have not been

properly  organised, and the cultural workers  have

not  been  given an opportunity to develop  and  to

create talent. They become the tools and are at the

beck  and  call  of  businessmen who  organise  the

shows.  If  they are not wanted, they  are  chucked

into  the  rubbish  bin. I am afraid  these  people

cannot survive on stage for very long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to express is that

many  of our talented people have not been properly

trained.

The  Ministry  of Culture very often makes  use  of

artistes   and  singers  from  abroad   for   their

programmes,  and  they have been  elevated  to  the

height of heaven. Very often these foreign artistes

are the main attraction of the shows, and the local

people   are  only  supporting  stars.   I   cannot

understand the logic of this. We are not doing  our

best  to  help local artistes express  and  develop

their  talents. This is contrary to what we  should

do to develop fully our local talent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have suggested just now that the Ministry of

Culture should set up an institute for our artistes

so  that they can fully develop their ability.  Our

T.V. producers  can then make use  of  their  high

standard  of ability. In this way our T.V. viewers

will receive proper educational and cultural values

from  these programmes. Otherwise we will only hear

foreign stars singing such songs as "I am not going

home  today," which is a popular Chinese song. Very

often we see the two comedians, the fat one and the

thin  one, on T.V. Other than these, we do not have

very  many  programmes.  I am  afraid  the  present

programmes are rather empty in cultural  values.  I

hope  the Minister will be able to do something  in

this direction and give an opportunity to our local

artistes to develop their talent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan (Crawford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Culture was set up in

1959.  At  that time it was given a lot of  duties,

for  example, to develop a sense of patriotism, and

to  instil in the people a higher set of values  in

order  to eliminate racial prejudices, and  so  on.

All these are but beautiful and grand talk and very

pleasing to the ear. But what I would like  to  ask

is:  what has the Ministry of Culture done  in  all

these  years? What contribution has it made towards

its  objectives, especially in the  field  of  mass

education? What has it done to instil in our people

a higher set of values?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to know what

the Ministry of Culture has contributed in the past

10 years



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>



towards  the  cultivation of  spiritual  values?  I

completely  disagree with the Member for Sembawang.

If  by promotion of a lively cultural standard, one

refers  to  the programmes we see in  the  National

Theatre  and on T.V., such as the "All  Stars"  and

variety shows



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Low, are you prepared to give way?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): No. If these

programmes  represent the set of  values  that  the

Ministry  of Culture can promote, then I am  afraid

the  Minister  for Culture has done  the  people  a

great  wrong.  I remember the former  Minister  for

Culture,  who  is  now  the  Minister  for  Foreign

Affairs,  said  in 1960, "Man is a product  of  his

culture.  Whether one is a Chinese, Malay,  Jew  or

American   is   largely  the  result  of   cultural

conditioning."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after all these 10 years, what

sort  of cultural environment have we given to  the

people of Singapore? How are we going to create the

sort of environment that a Singaporean should have?

Of  course, the Acting Minister for Culture can say

that  we cannot suppress whatever the people  would

like to have, such as the new style of soul dances.

But  if  we  just  allow things  of  this  sort  to

continue, and if the Government can only  give  our

people  this, then we have wasted all  the  efforts

made over the past 10 years. We have prolonged this

unhealthy life of the people for 10 years.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before and during the time when we were in

Malaysia,  the Ministry of Culture  did  a  lot  of

useful  things  in promoting some of our  political

tasks.  Very often Government departments paid  too

much  attention to politics and, as a result,  they

neglected their other duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am ashamed that very often I

hear my friends describe the people of Singapore as

being  too materialistic. If we continue like this,

we will become soulless animals. What



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



we   hear   and   talk   about   is   materialistic

achievements.  For example, how  to  climb  up  and

struggle for greater materialistic success.  If  we

just concentrate on materialistic pursuits, we will

gradually   and   slowly  lose   the   ability   to

discriminate between right and wrong. We will begin

to   disregard   the  fundamental   principles   of

righteousness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the time has come for a change.

I  would like to ask the Minister for Culture  what

he   has  prepared  for  the  new  environment  for

Singapore. What sort of adjustment has he  made  to

our  cultural  policy? I would also  like  to  know

whether the Ministry of Culture has any new set  of

objectives  in giving our people a new  and  richer

spiritual  life, and what adjustments it  has  made

since  last  May  in  cultivating  right  attitudes

towards our neighbours amongst our people.  I  hope

the  Minister will pay a great deal more  attention

to  these matters, because we cannot afford to make

mistakes,  to go wrong. I hope he will be  able  to

correct any past mistakes because we cannot  afford

to  go  wrong.  I am sure our acting  Minister  for

Culture  who,  in the last ten years or  more,  has

worked  closely  with our people and  has  actively

tried  to  understand their aspirations,  will  not

himself  be  affected  by  the  new  style  in  our

political arena. I am sure he understands it better

than  I  do.  I  hope he can express  our  cultural

policy better and achieve better results, because I

believe  that, going on his past history,  he  will

not  do  anything wrong to the people. He will  not

let  them  down. He will not do anything to  please

the new style or the new fashion in our culture. He

will  only  do  what he absolutely believes  to  be

true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to touch upon the environment

of  our writers. Writers in any progressive society

have  their  status. In Singapore we believe  in  a

progressive  and democratic policy. Writers  should

have  their rightful place in our society, but  the

fact  is  that  this  is not  so.  Let  me  draw  a

comparison. Whether a person is just a singer or  a

singing star,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>



he  is still a person who sings. In one case, there

was  a  local singer or singing star and he  cut  a

love song record. High officials in the Ministry of

Culture  gave a press conference for  him.  On  the

other  hand,  Mr Speaker, Sir, a well  recognised,

very  capable  and intelligent writer  had  to  run

around  looking for advertisements so as to publish

his  works  and  make  a cultural  contribution  to

society.  This  writer is not  given  his  rightful

place  in  our democratic and progressive  society.

Mr  Speaker,  history has witnessed the  rise  and

fall  of  great powers and writers were responsible

for  the  fall  of some regimes. Are  we  going  to

create  an  environment  of  discontent  among  our

writers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want the Minister to take immediate steps to

raise the social status of our writers. I have  two

suggestions to make. I will not say that they  will

completely solve our problem, but at least  I  hope

our  acting Minister for Culture will consider them

carefully.  I  am sure he can, with his  experience

and expertise, come up with better suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my suggestions is the granting of honours

to  people  of distinction in cultural  fields.  We

have  all sorts of awards, for example, the  Public

Service Award, the Sportsman of the Year Award  and

various  other  kinds of awards. But  what  are  we

going  to  do  to raise the social  status  of  our

cultural  workers and writers? Are we going  to  do

nothing, to leave them out of all these? We  should

give them some sort of award too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second suggestion is that the Ministry should

set  up  a publication bureau to help local writers

publish their works. This will also help us in  our

task  of nation building. Of course, I cannot shift

everything on to the shoulders of the Government. I

feel  that  writers themselves must also bear  some

share  of this responsibility. They should organise

themselves and I am sure some of them have  already

done  so.  In  this way, they can  consolidate  and

strengthen  their position, exert an  influence  on

our  society, and strengthen the democratic  forces

of our people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, scholars and writers are

important  people.  I  am  sure  the  Minister  for

Culture   will  do  his  best  to  cater  for   the

aspirations of our scholars and writers. I hope  he

will  do  something for them so that they can  take

their rightful place in society, and to thank  them

for carrying out their sacred duty.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): When I made my

speech just now, did I say something about the T.V.

programmes?  I  think the Member for  Crawford  was

feeling a bit sleepy when I was talking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker.

Sir,  I believe that the Member for Sembawang  will

not  deny  that he has said that in  the  last  few

years  we  have  had a lot of cultural  activities.

What I said was that if our cultural activities are

reflected in what we see on T.V., then I deny  that

this  is  what  we  should  have  for  our  cultural

activities. I cannot agree with the statement  that

this represents the cultural life of our people. In

fact,   this  should  not  represent  the  cultural

activities of our people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): What I said

was  completely different from what the Member  has

said.  If he wants to give his own explanation,  it

is his business.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  just  now  the  Member  for   Delta

mentioned  T.V. programmes under this Head.  I  was

going  to  speak on subhead 1371, and although  she

has  already mentioned T.V. programmes, I would  like

to add some of my own views now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, television in Singapore today

is  a very popular form of entertainment. According

to  statistics, at the end of 1967  the  number  of

television licences exceeded 80,000. Up to now  the

number of people who have purchased television sets

has increased quite a lot. Almost all the community

centres  are  equipped  with  television  sets   to

provide   entertainment  for  our   people.   Since

television sets are so widely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>



scattered  in our country, we can see how important

television  programmes are in our  task  of  nation

building. The arrangement, design and production of

our  T.V. programmes will exercise a great deal  of

influence,  either directly or indirectly,  on  our

people,  so  they  must  be  undertaken  with   the

greatest care and in keeping with the values we are

trying  to inculcate at this initial stage  of  our

nation   building.  We  should  not  go  about   it

haphazardly.   We   should   not   concentrate   on

entertainment  alone. We should  pay  attention  to

this  problem  - how are we going to encourage  our

people  to  play  their  part  in  nation  building

through  the aid of these programmes?  There  is  a

Chinese  saying  that  in  everything  we  do,  the

beginning is the most difficult. The task of nation

building  is in the initial stage and it depends  a

great  deal upon our work. We can depend  upon  our

human  resources only in this task. The  foundation

and  development of nation building will depend  on

the  incessant efforts and hard work of our people.

Thus  will  our nation building grow, flourish  and

bear fruit. If our people do not work hard, if they

are  weak, slow and unintelligent, and indulge  all

the time only in unhealthy activities, then I think

even  if  we have the best plans in the world,  our

nation  building  will  completely  collapse.   Mr

Speaker, Sir, what I mean to say is that Television

Singapore    should   not   produce   entertainment

programmes  only. These must go hand in  hand  with

other  kinds  of programmes in our task  of  nation

building.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But our Radio and Television Singapore have

failed to do this. The programmes they produce  are

simply  for the sake of entertainment and are  full

of  unhealthy sounds. These programmes are  popular

with  our young people and small children, so  much

so  that they are completely absorbed in them. Even

in  their  dreams,  as  the Member  for  Delta  has

pointed  out,  they will utter sentences  like,  "I

will  never forget you," and "I am not coming  home

today."  Some of them do the twist or the  Hawaiian

dance on their beds. If we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>



allow  this state of affairs to continue, then  our

young people who will be the future pillars of  our

society will become decadent and rotten.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have seen certain countries

producing  programmes  of recreational  value,  for

example,  programmes of songs and dances. And  they

make  use  of them to educate, guide and  encourage

the people to play their part in the task of nation

building,  how to make their country  stronger  and

more  prosperous, and how to love and protect their

country.  These programmes have not only  made  the

country  more lively and energetic, but  they  have

also  enriched the people's lives. This is  what  I

mean  when  I  say  that  entertainment  programmes

should  also  go  hand in hand with  programmes  on

nation building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are democratic and pragmatic socialists.

We  believe in the truth of the Chinese saying that

we  must  learn from the good points of  others  so

that we can improve ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to speak on the

programme   Woman's  World  over   Radio   and   on

Television  Singapore. The items in this  programme

cover cookery, dress-making, flower arrangement and

application  of cosmetics. I do not see  how  these

topics  are going to encourage our women folk,  who

number  almost one million, in the task  of  nation

building, and to tackle our challenging and  trying

era.  Furthermore, I have my doubts  whether  these

programmes  can  raise  the social  values  of  our

women.  I  think the producers of these  programmes

will  only  tie our women down. As such, fifty  per

cent of the motivating force of our country will be

tied  down in the kitchen and in the bedroom.  Sir,

we want to encourage our women to stand by the side

of  the  men  and play their part in  the  task  of

nation building.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

there  is  a  programme called  Breakfast  Bulletin

which  is  broadcast at 7.10 a.m. every morning.  I

feel that the time allotted to it is too short



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>



and  it is impossible to give a full report of  the

parliamentary  proceedings in this  programme.  The

acting  Minister for Culture may say  that  a  full

report of the parliamentary debates is broadcast in

the evening. But then most people watch T.V. in the

evening  and  may  not listen  to  this  programme.

Therefore, I urge the Minister to extend  the  time

for Breakfast Bulletin, so that our people may know

all about the parliamentary debates. The Ministers'

and  Parliamentary Secretaries' speeches are  fully

broadcast,  but  the speeches of  Backbenchers  are

not.  Therefore,  the Minister should  request  the

Director  of  Broadcasting  to  broadcast  all  the

speeches of Back-benchers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although Singapore is a small country, it

has many industries. We should inform our people of

the  success of our industrialisation programme and

the  progress  of  our country. In  this  way,  our

people  will  know what is happening in  Singapore.

The   appropriate  programme  to  do  this  is  the

Breakfast Bulletin. Therefore, if the time of  this

programme is extended, these items can be included.

I   have   been   informed  that  the  Broadcasting

authorities  have allotted only a limited  time  to

Breakfast  Bulletin. I do not know  on  what  basis

they  allot  times  for programmes.  The  Breakfast

Bulletin   should   not  only  include   Ministers'

speeches,  but  should  also  include  speeches  of

Backbenchers.  In  this way, the people  will  know

what  their M.P.s have said in Parliament.  And  in

the elections, they will know what their M.P.s have

done  for  them. Otherwise they may ask, what  have

their  M.P.s done for them if they do not  hear  or

read about their speeches in Parliament?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Wee Toon Boon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Acting Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Culture (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr, Speaker, Sir, I believe there are many

Members who wish to speak on Broadcasting. I prefer

to hear them before I reply.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right. Mr Ho.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I share the sentiments of my colleagues who have

aired their views on the cultural matters of our

country. Culture should be coordinated with

political development in order to enrich the

spiritual lives of our people and also to educate,

inspire and instil enthusiasm in them through

artistic forms, especially at this juncture of

nation building. The people are entitled to

healthy cultural activities in order to encourage

them to take part in nation building. Radio and

television are important media for educating our

people. However, it is regrettable that our radio

and television programmes have not followed a

specific cultural policy. If there is any policy

at all, it is the policy of the Director of

Broadcasting himself. Sir, if the Director is well

versed in culture, then there will not be so many

complaints. Unfortunately, in the past few years

the incumbents in this post have been civil

servants and they are not cultural workers. In

other words, they do not specialised in cultural

activities. Hence, in the last few years, radio

and television programmes have not been able to

keep up with our political development. Although

Radio and Television Singapore has made

improvements recently, most of the programmes, as

the Member for Paya Lebar has said, consist of

decadent songs. Some comic sketches are

meaningless and vulgar. Television has degenerated

into a night club where singers perform their art.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I also note that many members

of  the  audience  made criticisms  and  suggested

improvements  to  R.T.S. in the press.  At  first,

they  were replied to. However, lately R.T.S. has

stopped  replying to the complaints made.  Instead

they have even blamed the editors of the press for

criticising   the   Television  and   Broadcasting

Services



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>



and for publishing letters of complaints. Not only

have  they  not  accepted the  criticisms  of  the

public,  but they have also reprimanded those  who

made such complaints.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to raise is that too many

advertising programmes are shown on T.V.  There  is

no  sense  exercised in selection. The  impression

given  is that Television Singapore has now become

a  forum where commercial enterprises may make use

of T.V. to sell their products. We must not give too

much  thought to making money in this manner.  Our

T.V. policy should not be based solely  on  making

profit out of commercial advertising.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have expressed their discontent

with  our  cultural policy. I agree with them.  We

are  trying to instil a sense of patriotism in our

students  and build a rugged society. However,  in

cultural matters we are not giving our people  the

right  material.  This will  have  a  demoralising

effect  on  them. In view of what I have  said,  I

hope  the  Minister  will  seriously  review   the

content   of   our   T.V.   programmes   and   radio

broadcasting. He should overhaul the whole  policy

and  keep  it  in line with our policy  on  nation

building.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have an

amendment* standing  in my  name  in  respect  of

broadcasting. We have just heard the Minister  say

that  he preferred to answer all the points raised

together. With your permission, may I speak on the

Broadcasting Department?



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendment reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) That the sum to be allocated for Head 1001 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1301.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, last year

this  House  approved a supplementary estimate  of

$50,000  to enable the Broadcasting Department  to

purchase   stereophonic   broadcasting   equipment

costing  some $65,000. Sir, we were told  that  in

commemoration  of  the 150th  anniversary  of  the

founding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>



of   Singapore,   stereophonic   broadcasting   was

commenced  last year. I am told that  in  order  to

receive  stereophonic broadcasts, the radio  should

be  fitted  with an attachment known as a  decoder.

Unless  this is done, no stereophonic sound can  be

heard.  Can the Minister inform this House  whether

the  Broadcasting  Department has  ascertained  the

number  of receivers in Singapore which are  fitted

with  this  device  in order to enjoy  stereophonic

music? If it has not undertaken such a survey,  can

it do so?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally feel that there are very few radio

sets  in Singapore equipped to receive stereophonic

music.  I  am, therefore, wondering if  the  amount

that   we  have  spent  on  the  purchase  of   the

stereophonic  equipment has been worthwhile.  I  am

also told that nowadays dealers who sell radio sets

equipped   with  decoders  remove  the  attachments

before  they  sell  the radio  sets  in  order,  of

course,  to sell the decoders separately  and  make

more money. I am told that sometimes a decoder  may

cost  as  much  as  $50.  I  am  wondering  if  the

Broadcasting Department can undertake to  see  that

where   radio   sets  are  already  equipped   with

decoders, such decoders are not removed before  the

sale  of the radio sets to the public. If there  is

no  such tampering, the people who buy modern radio

receivers  can enjoy stereophonic music  which  the

Broadcasting Department is able to produce now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Broadcasting Department has expanded very

rapidly  during the last few years. However,  going

through the estimates, I see that the establishment

has  not  kept  pace  with  the  expansion  of  the

services that it is trying to provide. As a result,

the services are not very satisfactory. We hear  of

innumerable  mistakes  both  from  the   Television

Service  and the Broadcasting Service.  There  have

been  no less than three instances in the last year

or  so  when I myself heard broadcasts of  speeches

attributed to me when, in actual fact, they  should

have  been  attributed to my colleague, the  Member

for Anson. I do not mind if what the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>



Anson  has said is attributed to me. But I  do  not

know  what his feelings will be. What is  a  little

more  disturbing  is the fact that  the  Television

Service  and Broadcasting Service could not  differentiate between a Back-bencher on this side of  the

House  and  a Parliamentary Secretary on the  other

side. Recently, the Member for Moulmein had a  bash

at  the  government and he was referred to  as  the

Parliamentary Secretary having a dig at Government.

My  sympathy  is  with the Parliamentary  Secretary

referred   to  for  the  embarrassment  which   the

Broadcasting  Department caused  him.  Mistakes  of

this   nature  should  not  be  made  that  easily.

Although  the staff in the Broadcasting  Department

may  be overworked, I think they should be a little

more  careful  when making reports of this  nature.

The  Prime Minister made a speech recently  in  Joo

Seng  Community Centre. However, the very next  day

it  was  reported that he made a speech at the  Joo

Chiat  Community Centre. I know, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

Joo Chiat Community Centre is in your constituency.

Perhaps  it  is  better known  than  the  Joo  Seng

Community  Centre. Anyway, I do not know  how  this

simple mistake could have been made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Minister has noted these matters. I

hope he will take the necessary precautions to  see

that  mistakes of this kind are not repeated often.

It  is  understandable if it is made once or twice,

but when the Member for Anson says something and my

photograph appears on T.V., I begin to wonder  when

I have said these things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has referred just now to

the  frequency of advertisements on T.V. and  that

too  much  consideration should  not  be  given  to

commercial  advertising. The frequency  with  which

they  interfere  with  the regular  programmes  can

sometimes  be  very upsetting. I  do  not  see  any

reason  why  the  advertisements  cannot  be  shown

either  at the beginning or the end of a programme.

To  show advertisements every five minutes will not

make  people  enjoy watching the T.V. programme  as

much as they would like to. Sometimes it helps,  of

course, if one is going for a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>



drink  when there is an advertisement on,  but  not

everybody  would  like  to  do  that.  I  hope  the

Minister will take this into consideration and look

into  the  possibility  of showing  commercials  in

between  programmes and not during  the  programmes

every five or ten minutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to make is selectiveness in

commercial advertisements. We have heard so much of

cigarettes and the spread of cancer and  so  on.  I

wonder whether it is worth the amount we make  from

commercial  advertisements to  continue  with  this

form  of  advertising cigarettes. In  almost  every

programme   at   one  time  or   another   we   see

advertisements  for  cigarettes  staring   at   us.

Surprisingly,  Sir,  the tunes  that  they  use  in

advertising  cigarettes are so catchy that  I  have

heard children sing them. Sir, let us not waste too

much  on this aspect of commercialisation. I  would

suggest  that  we  be a little  more  selective  in

commercial advertising.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> Sir, I wish to speak on

broadcasting.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There have been many speakers, and

the  Member  must  give the Minister  a  chance  to

reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> I abide by your decision, Sir, and

will not take up too much of the time of the House.

Thank  you  very much for allowing  me  to  add  my

little  sound to the thunder that has  arisen  over

broadcasting. With regard to the points  that  have

been   raised   by  Members  about   relating   our

broadcasting policy to national purposes,  I  would

like to suggest that greater attention be given  to

the  process  of  what I might describe  as  cross-cultural education. By this I imply that I  do  not

think  sufficient  is  being  done  to  familiarise

people  of  one cultural background with the  forms

and expressions of another cultural background. For

example,  it would be interesting to know how  much

Indian   music   and   dance,  Chinese   opera   or

traditional Malay art is being put across to  those

who  view programmes in the English medium. I think

this  kind of activity would be a big step  forward

in raising the cultural



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>



level of programmes about which we have had several

suggestions from the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have another point to make. It is not enough

just  to give a presentation of a bare performance.

There should be an explanation as well. In this way

people will find it easier to understand, and, with

this   understanding,  there  may  come  a   deeper

appreciation  of  the programme, so  that  on  this

basis  we  hope that the climate may be appropriate

for   patronage  and  encouragement  of   all   the

performing arts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point has also been raised regarding commercial

advertisements.  I would like to add  my  voice  in

support  of  what the Member for Telok Blangah  has

said,   that  consideration  should  be  given   to

removing   all   commercial   advertisements    for

cigarettes  from  the air. I  do  feel  that  these

advertisements  are  couched  in  such  persuasive,

seductive and alluring terms that they may have  an

effect  on  those of our people who  have  not  yet

acquired the habit of smoking. With regard to those

people  who have already become addicts, I  do  not

suppose  much  can  be done. But  thinking  of  the

younger  people  I suggest it would  be  better  to

balance the health of the young people against  the

revenue    that    we   get   out   of    cigarette

advertisements.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to say that since we have

research officers in the Ministry of Culture,  some

attempt should be made to find out what the  people

really  think about our programmes -  to  find  out

their tastes, and what the audience-rating is like.

In  this  way  we can provide them with  what  they

want.  And  if  what they want is healthy,  we  can

provide  it; if not, we can devise some  method  of

educating   our  listeners  by  giving  them   more

desirable programmes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank you for giving me permission

to speak. If we do not have food, we will die. If a

person  has  no  spiritual  food,  he  will  die  a

spiritual death. Therefore, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>



must   have  spiritual  food.  What  is  meant   by

spiritual food? It means all the healthy  forms  of

art.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of my colleagues have criticised the T.V.

and  broadcasting programmes, for example, that the

films  are all yellow in content. Many people  dare

not  watch this kind of films. This means that they

have  no  spiritual food to feed on. It seems  that

this   is   due  to  a  lack  of  healthy  cultural

activities  in our country. Therefore, I  sincerely

urge  the  Minister  to import certain  films  from

China  to  give  Chinese viewers an opportunity  to

watch  them. Films from China should be allowed  to

be  imported.  We  should  not  be  afraid  of  the

propaganda influence of these films, because  these

films  have  a  healthy cultural  and  recreational

content. If they smack of Communist propaganda,  of

course,  we  must  not import  them.  I  think  our

enlightened  Minister for Culture  should  consider

this, otherwise he will die, and I will also die, a

spiritual  death.  Why? Because we  lack  spiritual

food.  Therefore, spiritual food is very  essential

to our cultural life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on fire crackers on

Chap Goh Meh and Chinese New Year.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lee, what have fire crackers to

do with culture?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes, they have

something  to  do with culture. We should  not  say

that  cracker firing is no good, and we should  not

ban  the import of fire crackers. We must look into

the technique of producing good fire crackers. When

our  Prime Minister toured the constituencies, many

fire  crackers were fired. Even when our  Ministers

toured  the constituencies, a lot of crackers  were

fired. The firing of crackers is a good omen.  Even

the  Malays  and the Indians are now  indulging  in

cracker-firing. Therefore, I urge the Minister  not

to ban totally the import of crackers or the firing

of crackers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will first

deal with the criticisms of the organisation and

structure of the programmes presented by Radio and

Television Singapore. I appreciate the concern

expressed by Members on programmes which do not

effectively contribute to a sense of participation

in national construction and development, and which

lack educational and cultural values. It would

appear that Members have come to this conclusion

purely on the basis of local entertainment

production, like the Chinese variety shows, and of

imported films, particularly those which depict

crime, violence and sex. However, before I deal

with these criticisms, may I be permitted to put in

proper perspective the general planning and

presentation of programmes which will have the

desired psychological and sociological impact?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programme structure is broadly divided into

three  main groups, namely, information, education,

and   entertainment.  Information   and   education

programmes  are of two categories. One category  is

our  own  production,  and the  other  category  is

foreign production. Our own production covers  such

items   as   news,  social  and  current   affairs,

programmes  for  children  and  youths,  programmes

especially designed for women, programmes on music,

literary and art appreciation and criticism,  etc.,

and  finally, sports programmes. It is not possible

for  me  to  itemise the programmes in detail  but,

very  broadly,  social  and current  affairs  would

include  topics on Singapore's development, debates

and forums on various matters of national interest,

opinions  and  discussions,  and  interviews   with

prominent personalities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to foreign productions, films or video

tapes are obtained for programmes for children,  on

music,  literary and art appreciation, and  so  on.

There  are also programmes on general matters  such

as  science, business management, foreign  affairs,

animal  life, adult education, history, and so  on.

Entertainment programmes involve drama,  the  arts,

and variety shows, and they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>



comprise both local and foreign productions



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the above prospectus of the programmes,

Members will appreciate that every effort is  being

made  to  achieve  an  overall  balanced  programme

structure. It is not entirely true that  all  local

and  imported  items lack cultural  or  educational

value.  Members  seem  to  have  arrived  at   this

conclusion  by  merely  pin-pointing  the   Chinese

variety  show.  I  agree that this  show  does  not

possess   either  a  cultural  or  an   educational

background,  as its purposes is merely  to  provide

pure  entertainment. Some of the songs and sketches

leave much to be desired, because of the suggestive

content,  and  so  are  the  dances  in  which  the

participants are sometimes inadequately attired. In

so  far  as  the songs are concerned, Members  will

appreciate that we have to depend to a large extent

on imported material. Until we are in a position to

produce  our own songs of good quality, however,  I

have instructed the producers to exercise more care

in  the  selection and production of items in  this

regard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that the present inadequacies in the

overall  programme structure arise mainly from  the

fact  that  there  is a paucity of locally-produced

programmes  of songs, dances, plays, and  sketches,

with a cultural or educational theme. It is through

such  programmes that we can inculcate a  sense  of

belonging and a sense of participation in  national

construction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already pointed out the existing

inadequacies  to my officials who are  now  in  the

process   of   reviewing   and   reorganising   the

programmes   for  the  current  year.  There   are,

however,  limitations at the  moment  in  producing

these  types  of programmes because,  unlike  other

countries  where  professional  talent  is  on  tap

easily,  we  in Singapore do not have an  organised

pool of talent which can be easily tapped for radio

and T.V. purposes. There is a lack of creative skills

for  composing  music, writing plays and  sketches,

and  producing  dances. If  there  are  more  local

writers and composers with creative



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>



skills,  who could produce work reflecting national

and  cultural values, we could get a greater supply

of suitable material for such programmes. There is,

therefore, an urgent need of our local writers  and

composers to produce more plays, songs and  dances.

Dramatic  societies, music and dance  schools,  and

other  cultural organisations should  come  forward

and  actively participate in the production of such

programmes. This would facilitate the production of

programmes of an aesthetic and cultural value.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, however, like to address some caution in

this   regard.   R.T.S. is   not   a   commercial

organisation  with  monetary profit  as  the  prime

objective.  It is a public service and,  therefore,

subject   to  limitations  of  funds.   Those   who

participate  in the programmes cannot  expect  high

monetary reward. But in the interest of the  nation

and,  in  particular,  in the pursuit  of  cultural

development,  I  sincerely hope that  local  talent

will  actively  co-operate  in  the  production  of

better  and  meaningful programmes. The  result  of

such   co-operation  would  be  of  immense  value;

firstly,  writers and artistes will find an  avenue

to  display their talents and, secondly, they would

have,   through  their  works,  developed  national

consciousness and stimulated cultural values.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as films are concerned, in the absence of

a  film  industry in Singapore, we have  to  import

foreign films in selecting films, care is taken  to

ensure   that  those  which  over-emphasise  crime,

violence  and sex are not screened. Films depicting

human   interest,   like   "Then   Came   Bronson",

adventures such as "Tarzan", and domestic  comedies

like "My Three Sons", are also screened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the review and

reorganisation  of the programme structure  now  in

progress, R.T.S. should be able to correct existing

inadequacies  and  provide  wholesome  and  healthy

programmes  containing  educational  and   cultural

values consonant with our national needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder if it is time for a tea break.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>

Department are concerned, I have given

the general policy of the Department on

the proposed reconstruction and organisation of the programmes. I shall reserve

the other details later if I have the time.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Crawford seems not to understand what

the Ministry of Culture has done for

the past ten years to promote culture.

He must appreciate that we became an

independent country only a few years

ago. Prior to that, we had self-government status, and did not have

absolute political power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to promote culture, you

have to achieve political freedom first.

Without political freedom you will not

be able to develop your culture. That is

why in the past we often accused the

colonial power of suppressing our culture

during  our  struggle  for  political

freedom. I think this fact will refute

the Member for Crawford's allegation

that for the past ten years we have been

too absorbed in the political struggle

and have neglected the cutural development of our nation. Now that we have

acquired our political power, that is,

we are a people of our own, we can

promote our own culture. In this respect,

Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say that we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>



are a migrant society. Therefore, we

have first to create a sense of belonging

among those of our people who are

citizens of this country. Then we have

to try to promote and develop a culture

of our own. So I fail to understand the

allegation from the Member for Crawford that in the past ten years we have

not achieved anything in this respect.

Culture is not something which you can

develop overnight. It takes years.

Further, it cannot be done on instructions or orders or policy directives from

the Government. Everyone in the country

has to co-operate, to work and to

dedicate himself to the cause. Therefore

it takes time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Members for Crawford and

Sembawang raised the question of

cultural awards. I consider this a very

good idea. Although Singapore is an

independent country, there is a relative

dearth of creative cultural works in

music, dance and literature. Before we

can consider any plans to award prizes,

we should endeavour earnestly to

stimulate the growth of cultural works

in various areas. Members will appreciate

that there are difficulties in the immediate implementation of a system of

cultural awards. For instance, there may

be a few outstanding persons in some

of the fields, and it would appear that

they would merit awards, when, in point

of fact, they have very little or no

competition to face. When more individuals  come  forward  with  high

standards, then the outstanding ones

will be forced to improve their standard,

and this will make for a raising of

standards as a whole. Then there will

be competition and any awards will be

meaningful. Then again, in some fields,

the standard, as the persons themselves,

I think, will readily admit, has much

room for improvement. Members will

appreciate that to give an award to the

best candidate among many mediocre

entries will not be a very appropriate

token. Thirdly, such awards must be

properly organised and the inherent

difficulties of the scheme must be carefully worked out. For instance, it must

be clearly defined what standards ought

to be set for each area of culture, who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>



may qualify for such awards, distinguishing the professionals from the

amateurs, and the extent, the value and

The status of such awards. On balance,

therefore, I am of the opinion that there

should firstly, be general encouragement

from the public and organisations, and

funds to improve the general standards

and, secondly, when the standards have

generally improved, appropriate schemes

can be worked out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to illustrate, by way of

example, what happened when the

National Library in 1968 organised on

behalf of U.N.E.S.C.O. a national

contest for award of a prize to the

author of the best manuscript written

in any of the four official languages in

Singapore on a cultural, literary or

popular science topic most suitable for

new reading audiences and/or children

and juveniles. A sum not exceeding

$1,525, representing one prize, was to

be awarded to the prize-winning author.

The response to the contest was surprisingly poor. Only a total of 15

manuscripts were received - two

Malay,   five   Chinese   and   eight

English.  As none of the entries

was of sufficient merit, no award was

received by any of the contestants.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate that the object in raising

this matter is probably that cultural

awards would stimulate the growth of

cultural pursuits. However, from the

example of the U.N.E.S.C.O. competition, which I have just illustrated, it will

be seen that we will be putting the cart

before the horse if, at this juncture,

we decide to give cultural awards before

standards are improved. The immediate

problem, as I see it, is one of generating

the necessary stimuli to our cultural efforts. There are, however, certain



drawbacks. For example, a person may

have a flair for writing or composing

music, but he is precluded by economic

realities from pursuing his preference.

It is not surprising, therefore, that those

who would otherwise be able to contribute to the enrichment of cultural

activities find refuge in some other more

remunerative employment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way of overcoming this difficulty

would be for those interested in different

areas of culture to organise themselves

into working groups or associations with

the object of co-ordinating their activities

and improving standards. The Ministry

will, as far as possible, assist them in

setting up such an association. Let us

take the case of writers who unfortunately have not been able to come

together because of factionalism and

unprincipled vituperation. If they avoided this, they could create an atmosphere

conducive to the development of literary

work, and mass media like newspapers,

television and radio could be utilised

to publicise their vvorks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ways and means can also be found

to stimulate reading habits among our

people. Wherever possible, educational

institutions could be encouraged to use

suitable works as reading material for

students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all the assistance

in the world will not help if the local

people do not dedicate themselves to the

development of cultural pursuits in

different areas. If this is done, then

Singapore could, with the co-operation

of all concerned, enhance her cultural

prestige.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am trying to put across is not

that we do not want to encourage culture.

We want to encourage and build our own

culture. Here I must say once again that

this is not the job of the Government

alone, but is the work of everyone,

especially the artistes, the writers and

those who are involved in cultural work.

Apart from these people who are directly

concerned with cultural work, others

could also help in the development of

culture. Take the Member for Crawford,

for instance. If he is really sincere in

wanting to assist in the development of

our culture, he could, in his capacity

as adviser to his community centre, the

Citizens' Consultative Committee and

other committees, assist cultural development in a practical way. For instance,

we have encouraged many local talents,

such as Mr Lee Kum Sing, a well-known pianist, to put up shows and

recitals. When Mr Lee Kum Sing is

performing abroad, he is very well



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>



received. People have to pay exorbitantly  to  hear

his recitals. However, when he comes back here and,

with  our encouragement, stages a recital  at  very

cheap  admission fees so that the people are  given

an   opportunity  to  appreciate  his  music,   the

attendance,  much  to  my disappointment,  is  very

poor. This is where the Member for Crawford, as  an

advocate of the promotion of culture, can help, if

he has any function in his community centre, either

in   commemoration  of  an  anniversary  or   other

ceremonies, I would suggest to him that, instead of

wasting  his  time and money on organising  dinners

and  variety shows, he could hold, say, exhibitions

of  paintings  and stage serious music performances

and  the  like. This would be a direct contribution

to the development of our culture, because the fact

is that -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Wee, would you like to give way

to Mr Low Yong Nguan?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> With due respect to the

Minister,  firstly, I hope he is  not  doubting  my

sincerity as a Member of Parliament, because, if he

does,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I will  of  course  take

strong  objection to it. Secondly, I hope  he  will

refrain  from  making a closer  examination  of  my

activities  in  the  Crawford Community  Centre  of

which I am very proud.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the fact is

this.  Everyone  has agreed that we should  develop

and  promote healthy culture so that our people and

the younger generation can be properly brought up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, because of our political struggle

and other circumstances, the development of culture

was neglected. Chinese pop music from Hong Kong and

Taiwan  has a bad influence on our people here.  If

all Members in this House really want to develop  a

healthy culture, such as an appreciation of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>



classical music and the like, I would urge them

first to assist the Ministry of Culture in cutting

down the influence of pop music. Eventually, the

healthy type of culture will be on the way up and

the yellow type of culture will dwindle day by day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I just want to know the criteria by which

part-time  announcers and artistes  are  auditioned

and  selected  for the Department of  Broadcasting.

Can  the Department not recruit new talents so that

we  can  see new faces and hear new voices, instead

of  the same part-time people year in and year  out

for the last ten years or so? I do not mind if they

are permanent employees.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I will be

very brief in my reply, because I want to give  the

Member for Geylang Serai a chance to move the  next

amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, part-time employees are required by the

Department  of  Broadcasting  whenever   they   are

required, and also because of the inability of  the

Department to fill the vacancies. In certain cases,

talents are required to put up a show.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as part-time news-readers are concerned,

they  have  to  go  through an  audition  before  a

committee  which comprises members  of  the  Public

Service Commission and the Department. Artistes who

are  taken  on a part-time basis also  have  to  go

through an audition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah also wants to know

why these people are not frequently changed.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> They are not changed at all!



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Department is continuously testing and auditioning

new  talents and news-readers. Unless they  are  of

the standard required, we are unable to put on more

new faces to appease the Member for Telok Blangah.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1101 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1101 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Madam Chan Choy Siong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this amendment, I would like to raise

this point and I hope the Minister will pay careful

attention  to  it.  I have previously  raised  this

matter  twice  in this House, but it has  not  been

resolved.  Therefore,  I  hope  the  Minister  will

seriously consider it. This concerns the setting up

of a fire station in Jurong. I am sure the Minister

must  be aware that the development of Jurong  Town

has  been  very rapid. At present, there  are  more

than  200 factories in Jurong and more than  20,000

residents.  Many factories are engaged in  chemical

work, and inflammable materials are used. Jurong is

a big town and yet there is no fire station at all.

This is ridiculous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that in 1968, there were 25 fire

calls  in Jurong, four of which were false  alarms.

In  1969,  there were 21 fire calls, four of  which

were  false alarms. There were at least  two  fires

which razed part of the factories to the ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past, in answering my question, the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  Social

Affairs  said that there are already fire  stations

in  Alexandra  and  Bukit Timah  and  there  is  no

necessity of having another fire station in  Jurong

Town.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, the Fire Brigade comes

under Head 1103.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes, Sir. But as I

have given the reason for moving this amendment

under this head at the beginning of my speech, may

I be allowed to proceed?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right, Mr Ho.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you, Sir.

As  I  was  saying,  there  are  fire  stations  at

Alexandra  and  Bukit Timah but they  are  quite  a

distance  from Jurong Town. It takes  at  least  15

minutes  to  reach Jurong Town from  Alexandra  and

Bukit  Timah if there is no traffic along the  way.

Sir,  the road to Jurong is very busy nowadays.  It

is  not like before. During peak hours, the traffic

is  heavy along this road. If a fire were to  break

out  at  a  factory during peak hours, the  factory

would  be completely burnt down before the  arrival

of a fire engine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge the Minister to consider seriously

the setting up of a fire station in Jurong Town  so

that  the  factories and the residents  there  will

feel secure.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a provision for a Jurong

fire  station  was  made in  the  1968  Development

Estimates, as the Member for Jurong has  said.  But

it   was  subsequently  deleted  from  the  1969-70

Development  Estimates because, at  that  time,  we

were  thinking of the proximity of the Bukit  Timah

and   Alexandra  Fire  Stations  to  Jurong   Town.

However,    Sir,   my   Ministry    is    seriously

reconsidering this matter and will ask the Ministry

of Finance for funds to construct a fire station in

Jurong.  Until  funds  are provided,  I  am  afraid

construction cannot be proceeded with.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I have heard

this  explanation  more  than  once.  I  hope   the

Minister  will  consider this matter seriously  and

ask the Minister for Finance for the necessary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>



funds to set up a fire station in Jurong Town.

Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1101 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1051*



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(*The same amendment also stood in the name of Madam Chan Choy

Siong).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in recent years, our sports and athletic

activities   have  been  carried   out   with   the

encouragement of our Government. And with the joint

efforts  of  sports organisations, they  have  been

lively. In this respect, the Sports Division  under

the  Ministry  of Social Affairs has  made  a  good

contribution. Undoubtedly, the Government has tried

its   best   to  promote  sports  activities.   For

instance,  every  year  the  Government  has   been

holding  sports  festivals in order  to  raise  the

standard  of  our sports. What is more laudable  is

that  the Government has allocated a large  sum  of

money  to  set  up  a  grand  National  Stadium  at

Kallang.  The foundation stone was laid in  January

this  year  by  the Minister for Finance.  On  this

occasion, the Minister said that the Government had

laid down its policies on defence, sports and other

activities.  As  regards sports,  the  Government's

policy is to encourage more and more people to take

part  in  it. The second objective is to raise  the

standard  of sports and athletics in order  to  win

more  international  awards and  prizes.  When  the

National Stadium is completed, we will be  able  to

organise international and regional competitions to

promote sports and athletics.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me talk about how to raise the standard

of  sports.  First  of all. I  would  like  to  ask

whether  the Sports Promotion Division is  able  to

engage national coaches. We must engage them if  we

are to raise the standard of sports. Of course,  we

do have coaches for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>



basket-ball, football and volley-ball, but they are

mostly  amateur coaches whose knowledge and methods

are  too  limited to be really effective.  I  would

like  to  ask  whether the Ministry is prepared  to

engage full-time national coaches for athletics and

other  sports, for example, badminton, volley-ball,

and table-tennis, in order to raise the standard of

the participants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have achieved a high standard in swimming. Our

swimmers   have   won   awards   in   international

competitions. I hope they will continue to maintain

this  record.  I  would like to  ask  the  Minister

whether  he  has any plans to develop  further  our

potential in swimming.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, can the Minister inform the House whether

there  are  any  plans  to  inculcate  a  sense  of

patriotism in our athletes and sportsmen? It is not

enough  for  sportsmen  to excel  in  sports.  They

should have a sense of patriotism so that they  are

prepared  to  work  hard  to  attain  the   highest

possible  standard and win honour for our  country.

If  they lack a sense of patriotism, then they will

tend  to  take  things easy. They will  think  that

winning  or  losing in competition  means  nothing.

This will nullify our efforts to raise the standard

of  sports. That is why I wish to know whether  the

Minister  has  any plans to inculcate  a  sense  of

patriotism   and   civic   consciousness   in   our

sportsmen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should send more teams abroad to take part in

tournaments. Only in this way can we hope to  raise

our  standards.  For  instance,  in  the  case   of

badminton,  there  is  only one  open  championship

tournament  in Singapore a year. There are  only  a

few  occasions when our badminton players go abroad

to  take part in international tournaments. Thus we

find  it difficult to raise our badminton standard.

In  order  to do so, we should send our players  to

countries like Malaysia and Indonesia and take part

in  international meets. At present  the  badminton

standard  of Malaysia and Indonesia is higher  than

that of Singapore. If we can have badminton matches

with them, we can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>



perhaps  learn  something from  them  and  in  this

manner raise our badminton standard. May I ask  the

Minister   whether  he  has  any  plans   in   this

connection?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, can he tell us when the National Sports

Stadium   will  be  completed  and  what  are   the

facilities  that will be provided? I  believe  that

this stadium with all its facilities will go a long

way towards promoting sports in our country.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will first

answer  the  last  question  from  the  Member  for

Sembawang. The National Stadium is scheduled to  be

completed  on  1st June, 1972. This  is  the  first

phase  of  the National Sports Complex. The  second

phase  will  commence in 1972 with the building  of

two  indoor  stadium, nine tennis  courts  and  one

Olympic-sized  swimming pool.  It  is  an  open-air

pool.  It  is hoped to commence the third phase  in

1975  with  the  construction of  a  rapid  transit

transportation system, a multi-storey car park,  an

entertainment centre, an exhibition centre, a first-class hotel and a floating restaurant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry is aware of the importance of

instilling a feeling of national pride, or what the

Member has said a sense of patriotism, not only  in

our   sportsmen  but  also  in  every  citizen   of

Singapore.  The higher the achievement  in  sports,

the  more  will our sportsmen be proud to represent

our  country.  In spite of its limited  staff,  the

Sports  Promotion Division is doing all it  can  to

promote sports in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the means to improve the standard of

sports  is by encouraging and holding international

and  local competitions. For example, in the annual

Pesta  Sukan last year, 19 countries took part  and

about    1,027    local   and   foreign    athletes

participated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way of improving standards is by

arranging  for foreign coaches to come to Singapore

to  coach our sportsmen and sportswomen. The Member

has asked whether the Ministry is thinking



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>



of  engaging national coaches. In the past  we

did  engage  three coaches. One was a  professional

football  coach. He has gone back  to  his  country

now. We still have professional coaches for basket-ball  and  rugger.  Both  of  them  are  still   in

Singapore.  The engagement of professional  coaches

is  a  very  expensive business. However,  we  have

managed  to  arrange for them to come to Singapore.

We have also been able to find sponsors to meet the

cost  of  engaging  these  coaches.  Part  of   the

expenses have come from the Sports Promotion Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the Sports Promotion Division also

gives financial grants to our teams to go abroad to

compete  in  international  tournaments,   and   to

associations to invite foreign teams to compete  in

Singapore.  Here  again  it  is  a  very  expensive

business.  We  would  like to send  more  teams  to

compete  in international competitions abroad,  but

there  is always the question of finance.  We  hope

that  our  sportsmen and sportswomen  will  improve

their standard by all these means.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the Minister's

satisfactory  reply,  I beg leave  to  withdraw  my

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood in the name of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the sum to be allocated for Head 1101 be

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan Choy Siong is not here. Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap, amendment (5).



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1101 be

reduced  by  the  whole sum in respect  of  subhead

1141.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with the establishment of the

Majlis  Ugama  Islam in Singapore, Muslims  in  the

Republic hope that it will be able to safeguard and

administer all matters connected with the  Muslims.

In  general,  they expect the Majlis  to  safeguard

their  interests and to protect the laws of  Islam.

They  are grateful that, with the establishment  of

the  Majlis, the  collection of  tithes  has  been

centralised.  All collections of tithes  have  been

distributed  to those Muslims who are  entitled  to

them under the laws of Islam.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Majlis can play its role not only by way of

enforcing  the  laws of Islam but also  by  helping

those  Muslims  who are in need of assistance.  For

example, it can increase the number of scholarships

now  being  given to Muslim students whose  parents

are   poor  and  are  not  able  to  support  their

children's education. If we study their  cases,  we

will find that many Muslim students are not able to

carry on with their education because their parents

are  not able to support them even though they  can

study. This is where the Majlis can help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that the Majlis is not yet in a

position  to take on the responsibility of  looking

after pilgrimages. As a pilgrimage to Mecca is  one

of  the five tenets of Islam, it is hoped that  the

Majlis  will consider this matter. A pilgrimage  to

Mecca  requires a lot of money by way of  fares  to

and  fro, and I, therefore, suggest that the Majlis

establish  a Pilgrimage Fund to assist  Muslims  in

the  lower  income  group. They can  deposit  their

money  in  this  fund, and in this  way  many  more

Muslims  will  be  able to go on a pilgrimage  from

time to time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the Minister for Social Affairs

give  guidance and assistance to the Majlis so that

it  can  discharge  its duties and responsibilities

for  the well-being of the Muslims in Singapore and

also the Muslim religion.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a total of 41

scholarships were offered by the Majlis Ugama Islam

last year - 21 of them at university level



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>



and 20 at Higher School Certificate level. A sum of

$3l,000 was spent out of the $49,000 set aside for

education  by the Majlis. This year the Majlis  has

approved  an expenditure of $58,000 from  the  1969

Fitrah  collections  for  scholarships  and   other

purposes related to education. There is, therefore,

an  increase in the amount, and as such there  will

be  an  increase  in  the  number  of  scholarships

offered to Muslim students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Majlis will, I am sure, welcome the Member's

suggestion to increase the number of awards. It  is

very  keen  to  help children of poor parents,  but

poverty alone is not a sufficient qualification for

a  scholarship. Applicants must convince the Majlis

of  their  diligence and intelligence so  that  the

award may not go to waste.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually there are more applicants for

scholarships   than  the  number  of   scholarships

available,  and  some applicants are  bound  to  be

disappointed. The Member for Geylang Serai can rest

assured  that, other things being equal, preference

will be given to the poor students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Pilgrimage Fund, Sir, the Majlis Ugama

Islam is now considering introducing what is called

the  Tabong Haji Scheme, or Pilgrimage Fund Scheme.

This scheme will enable Muslims who wish to make  a

pilgrimage  to  Mecca to make regular contributions

of  whatever sums they can afford to a fund set  up

by  the  Majlis. Once the accumulated  savings  are

considered  sufficient to enable a  contributor  to

proceed on his pilgrimage, he will be allowed to do

so,   and   all  necessary  arrangements  for   his

departure and return will be taken care of  by  the

Majlis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I would like to thank the Member for

Geylang Serai for his confidence in the Minister in

asking  him  to  take  over the  responsibility  of

looking after the Majlis Ugama Islam. As the  House

knows,  Sir, the Majlis is a responsible  statutory

body with a President appointed by the President of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>



Singapore.  It  has  at  the  moment  18   members,

including  the President of the Majlis.  Since  its

inception  on 1st July 1968, it has done very  good

work, and I do not think there is any reason at all

for the Minister to take over the responsibility of

looking after the Majlis.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I am

satisfied  with the Minister's explanation,  and  I

beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1101 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

1261.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise a question on fishing

and  farming co-operatives. According to statistics

produced by the Primary Production Department,  the

number  of  farmers  and  their  families  now   in

Singapore is 170,000. Their annual produce is worth

$250  million.  This shows that they  play  a  very

important  part  in  the economy  of  our  country.

Therefore, they should receive proper treatment and

protection from the Government. But if  we  take  a

close look at their life, we will find that it  is,

unfortunately, a hard one. They get up  very  early

in  the  morning to work in the fields  and  return

very   late  at  sunset.  Their  income   is   just

sufficient to cover their basic necessities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the main reason for their hard

life  is  that they are exploited by the middlemen.

They put in a lot of effort to produce a crop,  but

the  profits are taken by the middlemen. The prices

we  pay in the market for their produce are two  or

three  times  higher than the prices  paid  by  the

middlemen. We should pay attention to this fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The characteristic of our farming industry is the

smallness  of the farm. If a farmer transports  his

produce to a market which is a great distance away,

it  will not be worth his while as there are  other

factors  involved. The best solution, I  think,  is

for the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>



to help the farmers set up farming co-operatives. I

do  not know what the Government has done for  them

in  the past, but if I understand it correctly, the

Registrar  of Co-operatives is adopting  a  passive

attitude  towards  the farmers  in  regard  to  the

setting up of co-operatives for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members will agree with me that our

farmers generally have a low education. They  would

like  to  set up co-operatives, but they  lack  the

experience. Therefore, Government should help  them

by   organising   and   administering   these   co-operatives.  Perhaps the Registrar of Co-operatives

could  take the initiative to set up these  farming

co-operatives,  and  in  the  initial  stages  have

complete  charge of their administration. Then  the

farmers   could  gradually  take  over  these   co-operatives  in  stages. This arrangement  will,  of

course,   impose  an  additional  burden   on   the

Registrar of Co-operatives, but as it will directly

benefit  the  farming community,  I  am  sure  this

socialist   Government   will   not   neglect   its

responsibility in this field.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been

found  that  co-operatives formed by fishermen  and

farmers  have  not been functioning as successfully

as other co-operatives. Many of these co-operatives

have  been  dormant for a number of years.  Perhaps

this  may  be  due to the fact that  generally  the

small  fishermen or farmers lack capital, and  this

makes  it difficult for them to compete with  other

business  enterprises which have  strong  financial

resources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, it is difficult to find suitable,

capable  and  efficient personnel from amongst  the

fishermen  and  farmers with the necessary  minimum

standard  of education to run co-operatives.  As  a

result,   Sir,   these   co-operatives   experience

difficulty in keeping proper records of minutes  of

meetings   and   maintenance   of   accounts.   The

individualistic attitude amongst some fishermen and

farmers  is also another reason for the failure  of

fishing and farming co-operatives.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to mention these to the Member because it

is  very  difficult for the Registrar to make  the

first move if there is no reciprocal move from the

other  side. However, in spite of his small staff,

the  Registrar  will  try his  best  to  help  the

fishermen  and  farmers form new co-operatives  if

they wish. I can assure the Member of that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I am not quite satisfied with the Minister's

reply.  He  has  admitted  that  the  farmers  and

fishermen  are  rather poor in organisational  and

administrative ability. That is exactly why I have

suggested  that  the initial stages  of  operating

these co-operatives should be looked after by  the

Registrar of Co-operatives. He can gradually train

the  farmers and fishermen so that later  on  they

themselves can take over the functions. We  should

not  take  the attitude of just sitting down  here

and waiting for the farmers to come forward before

extending our help.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, I have already said that we will do

our best. We are not sitting down!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am not

quite satisfied with the Minister's reply. He says

that  he  will do his best. Can he tell the  House

what efforts have been made by the Registrar of Co-operatives in this direction?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> There are co-operatives now in

existence  for farmers and fishermen. I have  said

that they are dormant because they do not have the

personnel to run them. We are looking into  this,

which  means that we are helping them. Anyway,  we

will still help them if they want to form new  co-operatives.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am still not quite satisfied

with  the  Minister's reply, and I am not prepared

to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Madam Chan Choy Siong:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) That the total sum to be allocated for Head 1101 be reduced by $100.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan is not here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $2,147,280 for Head 1101 ordered to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1102 -



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1102 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Selvadurai.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Department of Social Welfare administers

a  number of institutions whose residents  produce

goods  of  a quality that compare, in my  opinion.

favourably   with   similar  goods   produced   by

commercial  concerns.  For  example,  the  various

social  welfare  institutions  produce  furniture,

home  ornaments, toys, haberdashery, cakes, garden

items, and so on. I believe that if there could be

co-ordination in the sale of these goods  produced

by  social welfare institutions through some  sort

of  a  central  agency,  it  might  contribute  to

greater success in the sale of these goods.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My experience is that these goods are put on

sale perhaps once a year in some sale of work.  It

was  through this sale of work that I came to know

that  these goods are available and of quite  good

quality.  So  if  there  is  a  central  marketing

agency,  so to speak, the lesson could  be  driven

home  clearly  to  the residents of  these  social

welfare  homes  that their work  has  indeed  some

useful  end. In other words, they have contributed

towards  their own support in the institutions  in

which they reside.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a

particularly acute problem that keeps cropping  up

over  and  over again to which we do not  seem  to

have found an answer. This, Sir, is the problem of

the  deserted wife who also holds a blue  identity

card.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Singapore? Mr Selvadurai: A Singapore blue

identity card, yes. This means that she is a permanent resident in

Singapore, and married to a Singapore citizen who holds a red

Singapore identity card. Quite often, the husband belongs to the

low income bracket. He deserts her, runs away with somebody else,

does not maintain her, and saddles her invariably with three or

four children.

<br><br>6.15 p.m.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She presents herself at the Social Welfare Department in the

Ministry of

Social Affairs and is told that as she is not a Singapore

citizen, she is not

entitled to public assistance. I have had occasion to refer cases

like this to the officials of the Ministry of Social Affairs, but

they do not seem to be able to get over the difficulties of her

not being a Singapore citizen. I wonder if we could do something

about this because this woman has children who are Singapore

citizens. She herself is a resident of Singapore and there is no

way whereby she is able to find a living.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will answer the Member for Bukit

Panjang's

question first. Holders of blue identity cards are foreign

citizens, although they are permanent residents in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> They are permanent residents but cannot prove

that they

are born in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Yes, they are permanent residents but not

born in

Singapore. There is a case of a deserted wife who is the holder of

a blue identity card. The Ministry is considering cases of this

nature. In fact, some of the cases are being processed and are

being given

favourable consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Are you sure?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that

is heartening news!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> As to the first question asked by the

Member for Katong, I would like to give him the figures of the profits made by

the Social Welfare Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1969, we made a profit of $18,800. Of this sum, $5,000 was

derived from

the sale of noodles produced by the Gimson School for Boys to the

other

Social Welfare Department homes, and $5,000 from the laundry

services undertaken by the Mount Emily Girls' Home. The balance of

approximately $8,800

profit was earned from the sale of handicraft articles, carpentry

products, embroidery and sewing work by the girls and the food catering

service. From the

above, it will be noted that the two main profit-making

activities are noodle-making and laundry services. Both of these do not require the

formation of

a private company, or what the Member for Katong has suggested, a

central marketing agency, to boost sales, as the production capacity is

quite limited. As

for the other products sold, it is unlikely that the Social

Welfare Department

homes will be in a position to mass produce such articles. This is

partly

because of the lack of machinery equipment and partly because a

large percentage of the residents are delinquents and wayward children.

Some of the residents in the girls' homes will help produce children's wear and

woollen knit-wear on a piece rate basis for a commercial firm. The giris will

not have much

time left to engage in other activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of Members, I would like to say that the

residents are

paid for the work they do, and the profits are credited to the

Social Welfare

(Homes) Fund which is used for the benefit of the residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal of the Singapore Council of Social Service to set

aside one

whole floor of the new building for the display and sale of Social

Welfare products, both from the Social Welfare Department homes and voluntary

organisations, will provide an additional sales outlet for Social

Welfare Department products. Therefore, there is no necessity at

this stage to form a cooperative or private company to push



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>



the sales of Social Welfare Department

products and services.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr J. F. Conceicao -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 1102 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 1007.

respect of subhead 1101*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Madam Chan Choy Siong).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Toa Payoh is a fast expanding satellite town

and more and more people are moving in to stay in the estate. The bulk of the

population in this estate are workers. Most of them cannot afford to employ

servants or baby-sitters to look after their own children while they are at

work. Many of these young children are left alone to look after themselves.

In some cases, these young children are locked inside their homes without any

adult to look after them. There is therefore a need to provide amenities such as

a children's centre or a creche for the residents in Toa Payoh. May I know

from the Minister whether any provision has been made to provide the residents

of Toa Payoh with these amenities?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> The Ramah Street Creche will be affected by

urban renewal and an approach has been made to the Housing and

Development Board to build a creche similar to the Park Road Creche as a replacement for the Ramah Street Creche when it is demolished. Subject to the terms of agreement with the Housing and Development Board, this new creche will be located on the roof deck of the proposed new emporium building in the shopping centre of Toa Payoh New Town.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in case we cannot have

the creche located on the roof deck of the emporium building, the Ministry will look for   another site.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood in the name of Madam Chan Choy Siong -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That the sum to be allocated for Head 1102 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 1151.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) That the sum to be allocated for Head 1102 be reduced by

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan is not here. Mr Ng Kah Ting, amendment (6).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1102 be reduced by $10

in respect of subhead 2081.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this subhead 2081 concerns two topics under the heading

"Fostering-Out Allowances". I seek the Minister for Social Affairs

elucidation on these two topics separately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Boarding Out Scheme for Infants and Children, I would be glad if the

Minister concerned could enlighten this House on whose infants and children they are and whether they are from the homes maintained by the Social Welfare Department. What is this Boarding Out Scheme for Infants  and Children like, and how many cases  of such boarding out have we

got to the latest convenient date?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second item concems Fostering and Maintenance of

Mentally Deficient Children. Similar to the questions I have posed just now.

I hope the Minister will enlighten this House on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>



type  of  fostering and maintenance scheme we  have

for  mentally  deficient  children  and  who  these

mentally  deficient  children are.  Are  they  from

homes  organised  or  run  by  the  Social  Welfare

Department?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, may

I   inform   the   House  that  the   Fostering-Out

Allowances are to be used as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) $65,000 for the Boarding Out Scheme for normal

children  administered by the  Children  and  Young

Persons Section of the Social Welfare Department;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) $42,000 for the fostering and maintenance of

mentally  defective  children administered  by  the

Senior Almoner's Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Boarding Out Scheme was introduced in 1956 to

provide for the fostering of infants under the  age

of  two years. In 1962, the scheme was extended  to

include  the fostering of children up to ten  years

old.  In  1963, the scheme was further extended  to

cater  for  the  fostering  of  mentally  defective

children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of fostering is to provide an alternative

to  institutional  care for  orphans  and  children

whose  mothers or guardians are temporarily  unable

to  care  for  them.  Foster  care  can  give  such

children a substitute home approximating closely to

their  own  homes. An institution is not  the  best

substitute for a home as it cannot give  the  child

individual  care and affection. Nor can it  provide

the  security  and  warmth of a normal  home  life,

which  are  important influencing  factors  in  the

proper development of a child's personality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to place a child in foster care may

arise  from  circumstances such as illness  of  the

mother, overcrowded conditions, breakdown of family

life through death, desertion, neglect, destitution

and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1969, a total of 218 children (160 infants

under  the  age of two years and 58 children)  were

fostered out under the scheme. The number of cases



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>



fostered  out during the first quarter of  1970  is

133.  The total expenditure for fostering of normal

children in 1969 was $64,242.05 and the expenditure

from   January   1970  to  17th  March,   1970   is

$16,908.45.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 27 children were fostered out under

the  Mentally  Defective Children Scheme  in  1969.

Each  foster mother is paid $60 per month  for  the

care of one mentally defective child, plus $10  per

year for clothing allowance for the child.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expenditure on the Fostering Out Scheme

remained  approximately the same  over  the  period

1965  to  1969.  On the Fostering  Out  Scheme  for

Infants  and  Children,  the  expenditure  remained

approximately  the  same over the  period  1965  to

1969,   i.e.,   $61,000  to  $66,000,   while   the

expenditure   for  Fostering  and  Maintenance   of

Mentally  Deficient Children has remained at  about

$33,000 to the $41,000 level over the same period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the categories of children who may be

fostered  out, the main categories of children  who

qualify for fostering care are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Category I - Unwanted or illegitimate babies

whose  custody has been vested in the Protector  of

Children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Category II - Babies who are abandoned,

destitute,  and  deserted  orphans  without   legal

guardians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Category III - Babies who need care and

protection  because of neglect,  ill  treatment  or

rejection by parents or guardians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Category IV - Babies who have to be fostered out

on  medical  grounds and because their parents  are

incapable  of  giving them the  special  care  they

need,   being   either  on  public  assistance   or

unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Category V - Babies of parents who have to be

hospitalised or who are medically unfit to care for

the children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any child below the age of ten who comes within

one of the above-mentioned categories and either of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>



whose  parents  is  a  Singapore  citizen  may   be

fostered  out  under the Boarding Out  Scheme.  The

approval  of  the Director of Social  Welfare  will

have  to  be  obtained  for the  fostering  of  any

children  who  do  not come within  the  categories

listed above.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for mentally defective children, the scheme

for  the  fostering of mentally defective  children

aims  at  solving  the problems  of  the  following

categories of mentally defective children:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Children who have been abandoned by parents

and,  because  of their condition,  cannot  be

admitted to ordinary Social Welfare homes;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Children who require a great deal of care.

e.g.,  they are either completely helpless  or

destructive;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Children who require more care than their

families  can provide because of their  social

circumstances,  e.g, mother  has   died   and

father  has  to  work;  mother  is  sickly  in

hospital; mother has deserted family, or is  a

widow   and   has  to  work  to  support   her

children;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Children who seem to be a constant source of

great  emotional and physical  strain  on  the

parents   causing  attempts  at   suicide   or

causing  a disharmonious relationship  between

them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I wish to thank the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  Social

Affairs  for painting such a vivid picture of  what

the Fostering Out Scheme is like. But may I ask one

last question in connection with payment? Just  now

the  Parliamentary Secretary has mentioned  that  a

person  who takes care of such a child is paid  $60

per month, plus $10 per year for clothing allowance

for  the child. I want to know whether the  sum  of

$730 per year includes expenses for food and drinks

for  the  child, or whether it is an allowance  for

the  foster mother? What about the child's needs?

<div align="center"><b>I</b></div>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>



I shall  be  grateful if the Parliamentary  Secretary

can enlighten this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, an approved

foster mother is paid a monthly fostering allowance

at the following rates:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) for caring of babies up to the age of four

years - $50 per month;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) between four years and six years old - $60

per month;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) between six years and ten years old - also $60 per month;



<br><br>plus  $120  yearly  for school-going  children  for

school  expenses.  With this  allowance,  a  foster

mother  is  expected  to clothe  and  maintain  the

foster  child  under her care as well  as  to  meet

other  incidental expenses. Those mothers who  take

care  of babies under one year also receive a  free

supply  of  vitamins and two pounds of milk  powder

monthly from the Maternal and Infant Welfare Clinic

which the child attends. Although foster mothers do

not  gain  materially, they do get  great  personal

satisfaction in participating in the scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents are encouraged to make contributions

towards  the maintenance of their children who  are

fostered  out  to  ensure  that  they  maintain   a

continuing  interest  and  responsibility   towards

their  children. The amount of contribution  varies

with  the  financial circumstances of the  parents.

Their  contributions  are utilised  to  offset  the

allowance payable by the Department.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, in view of the not

unsatisfactory  reply  given by  the  Parliamentary

Secretary, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I wish to seek

enlightenment from the Minister for Social  Affairs

on the item "tell-tale clock" used in the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>



This  item  was  not in the 1969-70 Estimates,  but

there  is a provision of $160 for it in the 1970-71

Estimates. I would like the Minister to tell a tale

as to what a "tell-tale clock" is!



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a tell-tale

clock is a clock which tells tales!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, what tales does a tell-tale

clock tell?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, a tell-tale clock is a

special watchman's clock which consists of a  clock

housed in a leather sling carrying case with a  key

for  opening the clock case, a key for  winding  up

the  clock, and twelve station keys with individual

chains  attached  for punching the  time,  and  one

year's    supply   of   charts   with   twelve-hour

graduations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of a tell-tale clock will ensure regular

patrols  by  the night watchman on  duty  and  thus

minimise  the risk of unauthorised persons entering

any premises in the Ministry at night. With a tell-tale  clock,  the  night watchman cannot  sleep  or

ponteng  throughout  the whole  night  when  he  is

supposed  to  be on duty. Sir, I think  some  M.P.s

also need this clock!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, in this connection, can the

Minister say whether tell-tale clocks will also  be

provided for other Ministries and departments where

night  watchmen are engaged, because it is apparent

that without them, night watchmen may go to sleep?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, it is a very good

suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, since the Minister has

accepted my suggestion, I hope he will bring it  to

the  attention  of his Ministerial  colleagues.  In

view  of the very satisfactory explanation  of  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr Hwang Soo Jin and Mr Lim Soo Peng)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this item is in connection with the Chief

Fire  Officer.  There  were several  fires  lately,

particularly  during the Chinese New  Year  period.

According to statistics, there were 1,300 cases  of

fire  last  year  and the loss ran to  hundreds  of

thousands of dollars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to speak on the measures the Fire

Brigade can take in order to prevent any occurrence

of  fires  and to teach the people how  to  prevent

fires.   For  instance,  perhaps  we  can  set   up

volunteer fire-fighting teams in various  parts  of

Singapore.  If a fire were to occur  in  a  certain

area,  a fire-fighting team could deal with  it  at

the  initial stage without waiting for the  arrival

of  the  Fire  Brigade.  In the  past,  there  were

several  fire-fighting teams in  various  parts  of

Singapore, and they provided a useful service. I do

not  know whether they are still in existence,  and

if  they  are,  whether drills  and  exercises  are

conducted for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our island is well developed. There are

many, many blocks of flats. In the past, there were

kampongs  with attap and plank houses which  caught

fire. At present, we still have kampongs with attap

and  plank  houses.  Can  the  Fire  Brigade  teach

kampong folks the art of fire-fighting and get them

organised into fire-fighting teams?







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have also received complaints about the

delayed arrival of fire engines at the scene  of  a

fire.  In  future,  I hope that  fire  engines  can

arrive at a fire site as fast as possible.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some complaints that about half an

hour  would elapse before a fire engine could reach

the  fire  site,  and when it finally  arrived  the

building  had already been razed to the  ground.  I

hope   the   Minister  will  supervise   the   Fire

Department and keep it efficient so that  a  better

fire-fighting service will be provided.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

first  of  all,  I would like to draw  the  House's

attention  to  Command Paper No. 36 of  1969.  This

little   book  of  16  pages  contains   the   Fire

Department's  Annual  Report  for  1967.  The  Fire

Department  has  apparently  taken  two  years   to

prepare  it.  What was the reason  for  the  delay?

Could  it  be  that  the department  was  too  busy

fighting fires?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the past few years have

witnessed  tremendous changes in the  landscape  of

Singapore  brought about by rapid industrialisation

and  intensive urban renewal schemes. In  place  of

the  small backyard type of workshops, we now  have

factories involving capital investments of millions

of dollars. The traditional terrace-type of two- to

three-storey shophouses are also giving way to high-rise  buildings of 20, 30 and even 50 storeys. With

all  these changes, I feel that it is time the Fire

Brigade   adopted  a  rather  more  realistic   and

enlightened  approach  to  the  subject   of   fire

prevention and fire fighting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as fire prevention in the context of

legislative control is concerned, I do not know when

last  we reviewed our rules and regulations. But  I

do  know  that the existing regulations  are  based

largely  upon  a  set of rules  applicable  in  the

United Kingdom. I do not know to what extent  these

foreign  rules  are  relevant to local  conditions.

However,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>



I  feel that there is some urgency for us to take a

good look at them, not only to ensure that they are

adequate  for our purposes, but also  to  see  that

they   do   not  involve  the  private  sector   in

unnecessary  waste  of money on some  fanciful  and

expensive equipment which may be totally unsuitable

for use in tropical countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now turn to fire-fighting. Going through

the   latest   available  Annual  Report   of   the

department for the year 1967 to which I  have  just

referred,  I see that apart from a 65-foot  Snorkel

and  two  Turntable Ladders of 100 feet  each,  our

Fire  Brigade  does not appear to  be  particularly

well  equipped  either to fight a  fire  which  may

occur  beyond the fifth or sixth floor of a  multi-storey  building  or  to save  people  who  may  be

trapped on the higher floors of such a building  in

the event of a fire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps the Minister will

inform the House what plans he has in hand to bring

our Fire Brigade up to date in keeping with present

changes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

share the sentiments expressed by my colleague, the

Member  for  Jalan Kayu. It does  not  appear  that

there  has been any revision of our fire prevention

rules and regulations fast enough to keep pace with

modern   industry.  Every  year  new   construction

methods  are  evolved and new materials  are  used.

However,  we  seem  to apply  the  same  rules  and

regulations  on  fire  prevention  which,  in  many

instances,  seem  to  have  caused  annoyances  and

frustration to industrialists who have set  up  new

factories or plants here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not advocating a reduction in the

standard of our fire-prevention requirements.  What

I  am  quarrelling with is that the civil  servants

concerned will just go on saying that certain rules

and  regulations must be complied with. Sir,  these

must   not   only   be  complied  with   but   also

intelligently    complied    with.    The     rapid

industrialisation,  the  various  forms  that   our

factories  may take, as well as the enormous  range

of products



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>







now  being  manufactured, make  it  impossible  for

comprehensive rules to be drawn up for  every  type

of factory and every type of product, let alone our

present   set   of   fire-prevention   rules    and

regulations. Sir, I would request the  Minister  to

give this matter his constant attention.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me deal

first  with the Member for Havelock and the  Member

for  Jalan Kayu on the question of using  the  same

old  rules on fire prevention for new factories and

plants.  Sir, it should be noted that  it  is  only

fairly    recently   that   we   have   large-scale

industries,   high-rise   buildings,   hotels   and

shopping  complexes in Singapore. Therefore,  there

are no rules and regulations for these premises. It

is  necessary then to refer to the various building

codes,  fire codes and codes of practice  of  other

countries that are industrially advanced and  whose

industries are heavily built up. However, I wish to

emphasise  that any information derived from  these

sources is used only as a guide. It is not strictly

adhered  to.  Some  of  the  by-laws  of  the  Fire

Department  are  out of date. Of course,  they  are

being revised to bring them into line with accepted

standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to inform both Members that the

Ministry  has  set  up  an Ad Hoc  Fire  Prevention

Requirements Appeals Committee which hears  appeals

from members of the public who are aggrieved at the

fire-prevention   requirements    of    the    Fire

Department.  We have considered quite a  number  of

appeals. Sir, and in some cases we have allowed the

appeals,  as  long  as there  is  a  minimum  guard

against fire risk for these factories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Singapore Fire Brigade Annual

Report  for  1967. I regret very much that  it  has

come out two years late. I suppose this was due  to

pressure of work in the Fire Brigade, but this will

be remedied immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the query from the Member for

Sembawang, I would like to assure him that from the

time of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>



receiving  a fire call to the time of turn-out,  it

usually takes the fire-engine crew between  45  and

60  seconds  to  be ready to go to  the  fire.  The

Member  complains that in some instances  the  fire

engines  were late in arriving at the site  of  the

fire. It takes 45 to 60 seconds for the crew to  be

ready  and dash off to the fire. However, the  time

the  fire  engine takes to reach the scene  of  the

fire  depends  on  various  factors,  such  as  the

distance of the fire from the fire station, whether

there  is heavy or light traffic on the road,  one-way    routes, weather   conditions   and    road

obstructions. Even fire engines have  to  obey  the

traffic rules! However, every effort is made by the

fire  engine to arrive at the scene of  a  fire  as

quickly as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the question of giving lectures to

fire-fighting teams. There are still in  existence,

fire-fighting teams in some villages in  Singapore.

Officers  of  the Fire Brigade do give lectures  on

fire  fighting  and  fire prevention  not  only  to

kampung  fire-fighting squads  but  also  to  youth

organisations,    schools,    hospitals,    factory

employees, Government employees, the Armed  Forces,

and  the  Vigilante Corps. If Members of Parliament

are  interested, these officers can also give talks

on  fire  prevention to them. The  Department  also

participated in a Home Safety Exhibition  sponsored

by  the  National Safety First Council in 1969  and

will  also  take part in another one  in  May  this

year. Any individual or organisation which requests

advice  on matters of this nature is given all  the

assistance the Fire Department can offer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have raised

the question of fire fighting and rescue equipment,

but it has not been answered.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, the equipment of the Fire

Department  is  reviewed  constantly  to  suit  the

conditions in our country. I will take note of  the

suggestion made by the Member for Jalan Kayu.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, can the Minister say what is the fastest time

a fire engine takes to reach a fire site?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, if the fire site is next

door,  it takes the fire engine only one second  to

reach  it. If it is in Sembawang, it may take  some

time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1103 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2005.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a provision of $255,600 is being asked for

the  rental  of  fire  hydrants  in  our  Republic.

Surely,   Sir,  with  this  large  sum   of   money

available,  we  expect  the  fire  hydrants  to  be

maintained  in tip-top condition. On 28th  February

this year, there was a fire in Changi Village.  The

only  fire  hydrant was located at one end  of  the

village and had water lasting only four minutes  to

fight  the  fire.  This was an  alarming  fact  and

should  be noted by the Minister. While the firemen

were  looking  frantically for  another  source  of

water supply, the fury of the fire was such that it

licked  through  nine  shop buildings  and  damaged

property  valued  at  more  than  half  a   million

dollars.  As  a  result,  tremendous  distress  was

caused  to the victims. I gather that if there  had

been enough water pressure in the fire hydrant, The

Royal Air Force Fire Service which was on the scene

of  the fire within minutes, could have put out the

fire  in  the particular shop from which it started

and  it would not have damaged the other shops.  It

would have been confined to that shop alone.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, will the Minister for Social Affairs take

immediate  measures to see that  the  fire-fighting

facilities required by the Republic's Fire  Brigade

are adequate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>



and  efficient enough to prevent any tragic mishaps

of the above magnitude in future?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, I have said just now, in

answer  to the Member for Jalan Kayu that the  Fire

Department   always   reviews   its   fire-fighting

equipment  and brings it up to date to ensure  that

it is effective in fighting any fires in the state.

Similarly I want to assure the Member for Changi of

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the fire at Changi, there is one

double  pillar  hydrant opposite the premises  that

caught  fire. On being tested, after the  fire,  it

was   found  that  the  hydrant  had  a   flow   of

approximately  370  gallons of  water  per  minute,

which is quite good but insufficient to deal with a

fire   of  that  intensity.  In  order  to   obtain

additional supplies, a pump was set into the  river

about  a quarter of a mile away to draw water.  The

R.A.F. also  came to help with large  water  tanks

from Changi Airfield.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be understood that if a water main

produces a pressure of 370 gallons per minute,  any

additional hydrants fed by the same main will  only

result  in a decrease of pressure. So in  order  to

provide  more  pressure, it will  be  necessary  to

provide a larger main or to lay an



additional water main.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to inform Members that all fire

hydrants  are  installed by  the  Public  Utilities

Board, and they maintain the hydrants.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> On a point of clarification,

Sir. Since the Minister has mentioned that all fire

hydrants  are  maintained by the  Public  Utilities

Board,  may I ask whether he will raise this matter

with  them  -  that  all fire hydrants,  especially

those  in  the  rural areas, do have  enough  water

pressure   to   meet  any  situation,  particularly

outbreaks of fires?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> As far as I know, Sir,

generally  the water pressure from the  water  main

and  hydrants  throughout the island  is  adequate,

although it varies from place to place. However, we

are  in close liaison with the P.U.B., and we  will

bring this matter up.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, will the Minister also

bring   up   with  the  P.U.B. the  question   of

installing bigger water mains not only  in  Changi

but also in all parts of Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Especially in the rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Yes, especially in the rural

areas, so that fire disasters can be minimised.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, bigger water mains mean

more  money. At the moment, there are  4,269  fire

hydrants, and we have to pay a rental of  $60  per

annum per hydrant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I think the money that we

pay  for the maintenance of fire hydrants is  well

worth it. Is it not so?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> It is a matter of opinion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> It is not a matter of opinion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Perhaps this matter of chasing

out squatters by fire can be easily done! However,

be that as it may, we have got to tolerate them. I

beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1003 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2053.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, judging from the provision of $32,000 asked

for this subhead, it does not appear to me that we

are going to get more ambulances. In the light  of

the  increased incidence in industrial as well  as

road  accidents, I am just wondering  whether  the

Minister  has  any plans to expand  our  ambulance

fleet.  I  would also like to find  out  from  him

whether all our ambulances are equipped with radio

telephones,  so that they can be more  effectively

deployed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, the number of ambulances

for  the year 1970-71 is not being reduced. We are

maintaining  the  same number.  It  is  not  being

reduced because the number of casualties that  the

ambulance  service  carries remains  approximately

the  same,  that is, in the region of  20,000,  of

which  about 85 to 90 per cent are accident cases,

the  rest  being medical cases. At the moment  the

Singapore Fire Brigade maintains 10 ambulances for

this service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All ambulances as well as fire engines are

equipped  with  a V.H.F., or Very High  Frequency,

radio system, and are in contact at all times with

the control room at the Central Fire Station.

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendment reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated Head 1104 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1051.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Very well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Thank you, Sir. These two

subheads  concern English Language  Allowance  and

Good Conduct Allowance. Sir, I hope I am wrong  in

assuming that we are paying the Prisons staff  the

sum  of $7,200 for English Language Allowance  and

$12,000  for  Good  Conduct  Allowance.  Can   the

Minister  please  clarify  the  nature  of   these

payments?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

English language allowance is

a non-pensionable allowance of $10 a month paid to

the  warder  grades  in  the  Prison  service,  as

recommended  by the Prisons Inquiry Commission  of

1948.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>



Only  those  who are in possession of a Standard  V

English Language Certificate, or those who sat  and

passed this examination whilst in the service,  may

draw this allowance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1964 this practice of paying the English

language allowance was stopped. However, those  who

have  been  paid  this  allowance  are  allowed  to

continue  drawing this allowance until they  retire

from  the  service. At the moment, 53  warders  are

still  drawing  this allowance. No  other  language

allowances are paid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Good Conduct allowance may be awarded by the

Superintendent of Prisons, in accordance  with  the

rules of good conduct, to warders, corporal warders

and wardresses. This allowance of $2 a month may be

given  to any officer of the above grades of  three

years'  service  or over, who has  served  for  two

years continuously without being punished for being

asleep  on  duty  or being under the  influence  of

alcohol  or  drugs while on duty, or without  being

punished  for a serious offence against discipline,

or for an offence for which he has been punished by

forfeiture of three or more days' pay, or fined  an

equivalent  sum in a court of law,  or  reduced  in

rank,  class  or  grade.  This  allowance  may   be

withdrawn  if an officer is convicted  for  two  or

more offences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further allowance of $2 per month may be given

to an officer who has been drawing one good conduct

allowance  for  three  years,  and  has  not   been

punished  for any of the serious offences mentioned

above.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further allowance of $2 per month may be given

to an officer who has been drawing two good conduct

allowances  for  three  years,  and  has  not  been

punished  for any of the serious offences mentioned

above.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I am happy to note that the

practice  of paying the English language  allowance

to Prison warders was stopped in 1964.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am surprised to hear, however, that the Good

Conduct  allowance is still being  paid  to  Prison

warders.  I would have thought that Prison  warders

should   maintain  good  conduct  at   all   times!

Therefore, in this respect, I urge the Minister  to

do  away  with this allowance, and instead increase

the  pay  of these warders. If at any time they  do

not  show  good  conduct, then proper  disciplinary

action  could  be taken. Why should  we  give  good

conduct allowance as a form of inducement?  I  hope

the Minister will clarify this.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my

colleague, the Member for Punggol, was surprised to

hear of this situation, but as for me I am shocked!

This business of Good Conduct allowance crops up in

every Ministry that employs uniformed staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the people who are in prison are normally

people  of bad conduct. I cannot see the  logic  in

paying  good  conduct allowances to the  staff  who

look  after  them. And if I heard the Parliamentary

Secretary  correctly,  we  pay  this  Good  Conduct

allowance  to  those officers who do not  sleep  on

duty,  or those who are not drunk. My God! I  agree

with  the  Member  for  Punggol  that  disciplinary

action  should be taken against offences committed,

instead  of  paying Good Conduct  allowance  as  an

inducement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember reading an article in yesterday's

newspaper  that the Corrupt Practices Investigation

Bureau  is probing into the activities of  warders.

As  I understood from the report, it was the public

outcry  against  the  Prison  administration   that

brought  about  the investigation by  the  C.P.I.B.

Will the Minister care to explain to the House  now

the reasons for the probe by the C.P.I.B. and if he

will  consider  doing away with this  Good  Conduct

allowance?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister, or his Parliamentary

Secretary, will reply on the matter of Good Conduct

allowance, and nothing else.

<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, payment of

the  Good  Conduct allowance is something like  the

payment of the English Language allowance.  It  has

been  the  practice  for a long  time.  Partly  the

provision  is  to  encourage  initiative  and  good

conduct. Is the Member for Punggol suggesting  that

we should cancel the Good Conduct allowance?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Yes!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, that is exactly what I

mean.  Prison  warders are expected  to  show  good

conduct at all times, and therefore the payment  of

Good  Conduct allowance does not arise. The  Member

for  Telok  Blangah was shocked and I was surprised

at  this allowance, but now I am more shocked  than

surprised!  Therefore, I would  urge  that  if  the

warders deserve any salary increases to induce them

to  put up better performances and show initiative,

then  put up a different salary scale for  them  so

that  they  can go on to this salary scale  on  the

basis of merit and performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not very happy with the reply given by

the  Parliamentary Secretary. I  would  urge  Back-benchers  to  say  "Aye" when the  Question  on  my

amendment is put, so that this provision  is  voted

out of the Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, if I may help the Minister and the Members.  I

believe  that Good Conduct allowance is similar  to

the  one  that we have heard from the Minister  for

Communications.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Just now the Parliamentary

Secretary has said that the practice of paying  the

English language allowance was stopped in 1964.  If

that  is  the case, why cannot the payment  of  the

Good Conduct allowance be stopped also?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> This is a good suggestion and

we will take note of it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Since the Minister has said that

it  is a good suggestion and that he will take note

of it, I ask that a vote be taken on this amendment

which I do not intend to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1104 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2014.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I just wish to

seek  elucidation  from  the  Minister  for  Social

Affairs  in  regard to deportation  expenses.  Last

year  there was a provision of $1,880 and this year

it is only $10. I would be grateful if the Minister

could  inform this House of the number  of  persons

deported  last year and whether there will  be  any

case  or  cases that will warrant only a $10  token

provision for 1970-71.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Since 1965 the Prisons

Department has paid for only one deportation  which

was in respect of an air passage to Amsterdam for a

banishee, amounting to $1,548.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As no expenditure has been incurred since 1966, a

token  vote of $10 only is provided in the Ordinary

Estimates  for 1970-71 should there be a  need  for

such   expenses.  Persons  are  deported  to  their

country  of  origin as directed by  the  Police  or

immigration authorities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> In view of the Parliamentary

Secretary's  reply,  I  beg leave  to  withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $5,437,440 for Head 1104 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>







<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1201 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, since the Minister is not here,

can I wait till tomorrow to move my amendment?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No, you are not allowed to do so.

Will you please carry on with your amendment?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In that case, Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1201 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Madam Chan Choy Siong and Mr Lim Cheng Lock)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 19th of this month, Backbenchers in this

House  rose  to speak on the fact that there  were

certain  civil  servants  who  were  arrogant  and

discourteous in their treatment of members of  the

public,  and  the Minister for Finance  agreed  to

look  into the matter. This is very pleasing news,

and  we can say that it is one of the achievements

of this sitting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I would like to speak on certain other

matters.  Although the Minister concerned  is  not

here,  what  I would like to say is this.  Besides

their   arrogance  and  discourtesy,  some   civil

servants have also other defects and deficiencies.

For  example, showing a lack of co-ordination  and

liaison  among the various Government departments.

When  a  matter involves more than one department,

each  department tries to shift the responsibility

to  another  department. In the  end,  it  is  the

members of the public who suffer. This is indeed a

very sad state of affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me cite a few examples to

support  my complaint. When farmers want to  build

pigsties  and  chicken pens, they have  to  obtain

permission  from various departments such  as  the

Land  Office, the Chief Building Surveyor's Office

and  the  Primary Production Department. The  past

regulations  stated  that  the  height  of   these

structures  should not exceed 6� feet. If  chicken

pens   were  built  according  to  the  prescribed

height, chickens could not be reared because  the

height  was  too  low. After representations  were

made by the farmers, it was agreed that the height

would  be  increased  to  eight  feet.  This   new

regulation came into force more than a year ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently some farmers made applications to build

their chicken pens.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>



Their  application  forms went round  the  various

departments,  and finally ended up in  the  Chief

Building Surveyor's Department. Their applications

were  not  approved  because  the  height  of  the

chicken  pens was more than six feet three inches.

From  this  we  can see that there is  no  liaison

among  the various departments although they  come

under  one Ministry. What has been agreed  by  one

department has not been communicated to the  other

departments. The farmers are at a loss as to  what

should  be done. They have wasted a great deal  of

time making inquiries in various departments. This

lack  of  co-ordination  and  liaison  among   the

various  departments has caused a  great  deal  of

inconvenience to the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another case involved me. In 1967 I was a member

of  the  Urban and Rural Services Committee  which

was responsible for the Punggol, Sembawang and Nee

Soon areas. I have gone to these areas many times.

After  a term of one year, I was not appointed  to

the  Committee  again.  However,  the  Electricity

Department  of  the Public Utilities  Board  still

regards  me  as a Committee member  and  sends  me

notices of completion of projects. Is this  not  a

joke? I am no longer a member of the Committee but

they still send me these notices!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year before last, the exercise of removal of

stand-pipes was initiated in order to economise on

the  consumption of water. This was a  good  move,

but their removal should have been done in stages.

That  is  to say, the department concerned  should

have  made  a careful investigation into  how  the

removal  of  the  stand-pipes  would  affect   the

people.  If  the  stand-pipes  were  found  to  be

redundant I have no objection that they should  be

removed.  But  the removal of stand-pipes  without

justification had caused a great deal of  hardship

to  those  who used them. I know that the question

of removing these stand-pipes was dealt with by an

Ad Hoc Committee. This Committee consisted of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>



members  from  the  Property  Tax  Department,  the

Public Utilities Board and other departments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when it was notified that 89

stand-pipes were going to be removed in the  Jurong

area,  the  people  through  the  Jurong  Citizens'

Consultative   Committee,  after  considering   the

effect  it  would  have on them,  advanced  several

reasons  to the Ad Hoc Committee requesting  it  to

delay the removal of ten stand-pipes. But I do  not

know  why  the  Ad Hoc Committee did  not  consider

their request at all.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Citizens Consultative Committee's request

was  not  even considered by this Ad Hoc Committee,

and  it  removed the stand-pipes. I  say  that  the

members  of  this committee did not  do  their  job

carefully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall give a few reasons why it was a mistake

for the Ad Hoc Committee to have removed the stand-pipes. The first stand-pipe was situated at the end

of  Gek  Poh Road. It was the only source of  water

supply  for the residents in the village of  Lorong

Kabong  which was opposite to Gek Poh Road. Perhaps

the  Committee saw that there were water  mains  in

Gek  Poh  Road  and so they removed the  stand-pipe

from  this  area. Recently there was a drought  and

the  wells  in this area dried up. The  authorities

had  to  use  water wagons to supply water  to  the

villagers.  This goes to show that the  removal  of

this stand-pipe was a wrong move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another instance - a pipe had been installed at

the  13�  m.s.  Jurong Road,  near  a  hawkers'

centre. The hawkers here used to get water from the

stand-pipe  to  clean their stalls at  the  end  of

their  business. I do not know why this  stand-pipe

was  also removed. Our Government started the "Keep

Singapore  Clean" Campaign and we should  therefore

encourage hawkers to clean their stalls at the  end

of  their  business. Can we say that this  was  the

right thing to do to remove this stand-pipe?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further example - a stand-pipe numbered 998 had

been installed at Joo Koon Road. About 100 families

depended on this stand-pipe for their water supply.

When  it  was removed, the people appealed  to  the

authorities to have it reconnected, but the request

was   not  acceded  to.  The  people  pooled  their

resources  and  tried to install water  mains,  but

that  also  did  not receive the  approval  of  the

authorities. Recently, there was a drought and  the

wells dried up; there was not a drop of water.  The

Ministry of Health investigated and confirmed  that

the  people suffered from a shortage of  water  and

that  the  Government should reconnect  the  stand-pipe.   This  goes  to  show  that,  in  the  first

instance, the removal of this stand-pipe was wrong.

So  I  hope the Minister will see that this mistake

is  not repeated. He should rectify the mistakes of

civil  servants  and, for the good of  the  people,

reconnect  all  the stand-pipes that  were  wrongly

removed.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I have forgotten to bring my notes that I have

prepared.  Sir, can I speak on matters  which  come

under the Ministry of Law?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, you may.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I want to

raise  two points. The first point is in connection

with  Magistrates and Judges. The term  in  Chinese

for  them is Fah Kuan. But if we use this  term  in

Chinese, it loses the democratic meaning. The  term

kuan  means a bureaucrat or an official. This  term

is   in   strong   contrast  to   our   system   of

parliamentary democracy, because it is used only in

imperialist  countries or colonies. In our  Courts,

the  Magistrates and Judges should  not  be  called

kuan  in  Chinese.  We  do not  call  jurors  kuan.

Although we have abolished the jury system, we call

them  jurors as in Chinese, and we do not  use  the

term  kuan.  But Magistrates and Judges are  called

kuan. They are all in charge of trial cases. If  we

can use the term yuan for jurors, I think we should

use another Chinese term for Magistrates and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>



Judges  such as sern pang yuan or sern  pang  chan,

that  is,  a person who is in charge of trying  the

case. For example, we should call the Chief Justice

kau  chi sern pang chan, that is, a senior official

who  tries a case. Therefore, we should revise  the

Chinese term for Magistrates and Judges, so that we

can  differentiate between their ranks.  If  we  do

this,  it  will  be  more appropriate  because  our

country  practises democracy. We  should  not  give

people the feeling that there are other people  who

are  head  and shoulders above them. If Magistrates

and  Judges  are  called kuan, it means  that  they

control  the  people.  I know  many  offenders  and

accused persons are tried in Court, and because  of

the  solemnity and sternness therein,  the  accused

persons  who are innocent are not able  to  express

their  views.  They  are not  able  to  declare  or

explain  their  innocence. Quite  often,  they  are

inhibited by the stern and solemn atmosphere of the

courts. I hope we can revise the term kuan and that

there will be an improvement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point that I want to speak on is in

connection   with  the  Ministry   of   Law.   When

Parliament passes Bills, many of them are  directly

concerned with the welfare and political rights  of

our  people. But after the passage of these  Bills,

they  are just published in a book and put  in  the

Library  of Parliament and in the National Library.

The book looks like an article for exhibition. This

is  not  the  way  to  give  the  public  a  better

understanding of the contents and meanings  of  our

laws.   The  people  of  Singapore  are   not   all

specialists  in  law.  Their  knowledge  of  it  is

limited.  Only lawyers are well versed in the  law.

The  majority of our people do not know much  about

it.  Even in a small matter involving the law, they

are  often  at a loss as to what to do. Very  often

they  have  to consult a lawyer on points  of  law.

Every  time  they consult one, they have  to  spend

some  money.  Sometimes it is a simple  matter  and

there is no need to consult a lawyer because it  is

a waste of money. Therefore, I suggest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>



that  the  Ministry  of  Law should  publicise  the

contents  of  our  new  laws  over  radio  and   on

television  in the four languages. The meanings  of

the  various sections should also be explained  so

that the people will understand our laws better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when the Abortion Bill was passed,

the  Minister said that it was a valuable piece  of

legislation.  But the general public  do  not  know

where  the  value of the Bill lies, especially  the

women  folk who are interested to know the  meaning

and  the contents of the Abortion Act. The Minister

said  that  the  Abortion Act  would  liberate  our

women.  But  they do not know how it will  liberate

them.  If the Ministry of Law can liaise with Radio

and  Television Singapore to publicise the contents

of  Bills that have been passed, then they will  be

made  known  to the people of Singapore in  greater

and clearer detail. The business of the lawyers  in

Singapore will not, however, be seriously  affected

if this is done.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, lawyers know the law. But we believe

in  the  maintenance  of law and  order  and  hence

everybody  should know something  about  it.  Quite

often  people  have  to consult  lawyers.  However,

their  business will not be seriously  affected  if

greater publicity is given to the contents  of  the

Bills  that  have been passed. I hope consideration

will be given to this suggestion so that our people

will understand our laws better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would now like to speak on

the   following  matters  in  connection  with  the

Ministry  of  Law and National Development.  First,

our  Government  is in the process of  implementing

the   urban   renewal  schemes.  These  are   being

undertaken by the Government as well as by  private

enterprise.   Where  the  efforts   made   by   the

Government  or by private enterprise  are  for  the

good  of  our country, we should support  them.  We

should  assist the Government in its  objective  of

pulling down old buildings and building new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>



ones.   By  giving  support  to  this  policy,   we

facilitate the task of nation building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we cannot deny that it is only from

the  ruins that we can build something new.  It  is

necessary  to destroy the old buildings  before  we

can  reconstruct new ones. People who are  affected

by  the  urban  renewal schemes  should  understand

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people have been affected by the urban

renewal schemes ever since they were implemented by

the  Ministry of National Development. From what  I

know, the people affected are dissatisfied with the

urban  renewal schemes because the Government  does

not    give   them   adequate   compensation    for

resettlement.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member has two minutes more.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Because they

have  to vacate their shops and accommodation, they

are  entitled  to  compensation. But  the  rate  of

compensation  is not adequate. For  instance,  very

few  shopkeepers in Chinatown have a large  sum  of

money  to  enable them to move from  one  place  to

another.  Very often they live from hand to  mouth.

They  are  beset with worries. When the  Government

allots a shop to them, the rent for it will come to

a  few  hundred dollars. In addition, they have  to

incur   expenditure   for   renovation   and    the

installation of various appliances and equipment on

the  premises.  The amount of money  they  have  to

spend   is  beyond  the  capacity  of  the  average

businessman. My suggestion is that, in addition  to

the usual amount of compensation, Government should

allow  them a choice of two alternatives. We either

give them a sum of $10,000 or $20,000 or --



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The time is up. Mr Lim Cheng Lock.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in speaking

on  this  amendment,  I am drawing  the  Minister's

attention, through his Parliamentary Secretary, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>



the  subject  of  the maximum total  family  income

qualification  for  renting or  purchasing  Housing

Board flats. The present regulations are such  that

people  who wish to rent or purchase Housing  Board

flats must not have a total income exceeding $1,200

per  month. I am aware that this qualification  has

been  revised recently to allow more people to take

advantage  of  this revision to  rent  or  purchase

their  own  house. It is quite right  that  in  the

beginning when the Housing Board commenced to build

houses  for  the  people it  had  to  restrict  the

allocation  of houses to those in the lower  income

group so that they could enjoy this facility first.

But  over  the  years, our standard of  living  has

risen  and  the incomes of people have also  risen.

Recently  we have introduced legislation increasing

contributions to the Central Provident  Fund.  Will

the   Minister   consider  revising  this   maximum

further,  so that the total family income is  fixed

at  a  higher  figure to enable the middle  of  the

middle income group to enjoy this facility also? At

the  present moment, I would say that, with over  a

hundred thousand flats built by the Housing  Board,

the  needs  of the lower income group are  more  or

less satisfied. I think the people in the middle of

the  middle income group who are at present  denied

this facility should also be given a chance to rent

or own houses under the Housing Board scheme.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Are there any other Members who

wish to speak on this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b> rose -



<br><br>7.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right, the Member may speak.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you very much. I was saying just now that the

compensation  given to those who are evicted  under

the  urban  renewal schemes should be reviewed.  At

the moment, the compensation given is not adequate.

Those  evicted  should have a choice  in  accepting

compensation. In addition to the scheme of granting

alternative shopping



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>



premises  to those who are evicted, there  should

be  another scheme whereby those evicted may  opt

to  receive  cash compensation to  the  value  of

$10,000,  $20,000 or $30,000. In this way, those

who   are   evicted   have  a   choice   of   two

alternatives. This is a better way to  compensate

those  evicted. Not every one of  them  is  rich.

They do not have a big amount of ready cash at  a

moment's notice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my constituency, many small merchants have

been  evicted  from their premises following  the

implementation of the urban renewal schemes. They

have  been resettled in Toa Payoh and Queenstown.

Since  they  have no cash in hand, they  have  to

borrow  money at high interest rates. It  is  not

possible  for them to get an overdraft  from  the

banks.  Very often they have to close down  their

shops  soon after they opened business  in  their

new  place. That is why the banks are not willing

to  give  them  an overdraft. As a result,  these

people  have  to borrow money at a high  rate  of

interest.  Sometimes  they  avail  themselves  of

loans  provided  by  the  new  finance  companies

called   "Chit  fund"  companies.  The   interest

charged  by  these companies is of  course,  very

high.   The  time  for  repaying  the   loan   by

instalments comes very quickly. Before  they  can

make  any  profit  from the loan  capital,  these

people  will have to pay several hundred  dollars

in  part  settlement of the loan. They  are  even

forced to commit suicide!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My suggestion is that these evicted people

should  be  given  the choice of  receiving  cash

compensation to help



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>



them  resettle in other areas. It is not  just  a

simple  matter of providing them with alternative

shopping premises. Everything is different  in  a

new  environment. They may not be able to  pursue

their  old way of life. They may not be  able  to

earn their living as before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board is building

more  high-rise  flats  and  is  earning  a  good

reputation  in this respect. On the  other  hand,

this  is  having an adverse effect on the people.

As regards private development --



<br><br>8.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Moment of interruption.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> I suppose I can continue

Committee and took the Chair of the House.
