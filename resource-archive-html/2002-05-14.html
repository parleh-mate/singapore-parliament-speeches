<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>ACTIVITIES TO CLOSE RELIGIOUS AND RACIAL DIVIDE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Monitoring progress)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon</b> asked the Acting Minister for

Community Development and Sports in view of the importance of

closing the religious and racial divide with activities  such

as  the  Inter-Racial  Confidence Circles  and  more  diverse

ethnic  representation  at grassroots  activities  and  youth

groups,  (a) whether his Ministry is monitoring the  progress

of  these  activities and (b) what are the criteria  used  to

monitor them.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim (Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports (Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am happy

to  note  that the Government, schools, grassroots, and  non-governmental  organisations have taken  pro-active  steps  to

build  bridges and promote understanding between the  various

communities.   For  example, MOE has formed  a  committee  to

promote   broader   and   deeper  inter-racial   mixing   and

understanding  in  schools.   The  Muslim  Religious  Council

(MUIS) will foster greater understanding about Islam and  the

Muslim  community  through  goodwill  visits,  dialogues  and

activities with grassroots and other organisations.  A strong

network of informal links between the respective agencies and

community organisations enable efforts to be coordinated  and

experiences to be shared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the establishment of the Inter-Racial Confidence

Circles (IRCCs) and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>



the  Harmony  Circles, these would be important  vehicles  to

catalyse  action  on  the ground and  to  contribute  to  the

building  of  trust and confidence.  To guide and  coordinate

these  efforts, we have set up a National Steering  Committee

for  the IRCCs.  The National Steering Committee can  play  a

useful  role to monitor and integrate the efforts of  various

organisations, both through the formal committee  process  as

well as dialogues and sharing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo asked about the criteria for monitoring

progress in fostering racial harmony.  The building of  trust

and  confidence among the different races and religions is  a

continuous  process.   Organisations  such  as  the  People's

Association  do  monitor the participation  rate  of  various

communities.  This  serves  as  a  broad  indicator  of   our

integration efforts.  However, what is important in fostering

racial  harmony  is  not  to  set rigid  success  indicators.

Rather,  we  must  see  constant  conscientious  efforts   to

strengthen our social cohesion.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>SEXUAL ABUSE CASES INVOLVING WOMEN AND CHILDREN</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mdm Halimah Yacob</b> asked the Acting Minister for

Community  Development and Sports (a) what is  the  trend  of

sexual abuse cases involving women and children and (b)  what

measures  are being put in place to deal with and deter  such

abuse.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, the number of sexual

abuse  cases  involving children and women in  Singapore  has

been  constant  for the past 3 years.  There were  about  400

cases  investigated by the Police per year for the  last  two

years  for girls below 16 years.  There was a slight decrease

among  those aged 16 years and above from 805 in 2000 to  711

in 2001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victims are given professional help and support to

minimise the traumatic impact so that they are able  to  lead

meaningful   lives.   In  the  event  that  the  victim   and

perpetrator  are  staying in the same household,  the  victim

will be removed to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>



a  place of safety.  The National Standards on the Protection

of  Children  launched by my Ministry in February  this  year

ensures  that  the management of child protection,  including

sexual  abuse,  will be prompt and handled with  the  child's

interest  as a priority.  The courts also mete out  deterrent

sentences on perpetrators of child abuse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the preventive level, key professionals, including

medical social workers, doctors, police, social workers, pre-school  and  child  care  teachers are  trained  to  identify

symptoms   of   abuse  and  reach  out  to   victims   early.

Furthermore,  the Police preventive measures of sexual  abuse

run  at  two  levels.   For  the general  population,  Police

conducts  school  talks for students  on  the  prevention  of

sexual  abuse, for example, how not to fall prey to molesters

and  avert  sex predators on the prowl in the Internet  Relay

Chat.   Students are also advised on what to do if one  is  a

victim.   A total of 243 such school talks were conducted  in

2001.   In  addition,  Police  disseminates  advice  on   the

prevention  of  sexual  abuse through brochures  and  posters

displayed  at  service  counters  of  police  establishments,

schools  and family service centres.  'Crimewatch' is another

medium which Police uses to educate the public on such  crime

prevention messages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For specific target groups, the Criminal Investigations

Department  (CID)  conducts  training  sessions  on  the  law

governing  various  types of sexual offences  and  on  police

procedures  to  deal with them.  These target groups  include

MOE school teachers and members of the Parents Advisory Group

for  the Internet (PAGi).   As these individuals have regular

contact  with  children and adolescents in  their  respective

vocations, the training provided by CID creates awareness  on

how  to prevent, detect and report instances of sexual abuse.

With greater awareness, caregivers and victims alike can take

necessary steps to prevent sexual abuse.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, can the Minister give

us  a  profile of the families at risk, ie, the families that

are involved in such cases?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, from the data we

have,  we  see no significant trend in terms of the types  of

families which are involved.  Some cases do not get reported.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD FLATS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Deferment and loan restructuring of mortgage instalments)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development (a) what is the number of  applications

received  by the Housing and Development Board for  deferment

and  loan  restructuring  of  the  mortgage  loan  instalment

payment  since  2001  by size of flats;   (b)  how  have  the

numbers  changed  over  time;  and (c)  the  number  of  such

outstanding cases also by size of flats.



<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, HDB's existing financial

assistance  measures  for mortgagors  in  financial  hardship

include: (i) conversion to a reduced repayment scheme,  under

which a mortgagor can pay 75% of his normal instalment for  a

period  of five years,  (ii) deferment of instalments  for  a

period  of  6  months, and (iii) extension of loan  repayment

period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between January 2001 and March 2002, HDB received 18,200

applications for assistance under these measures.  Of  these,

only  14 were rejected because these households were  not  in

genuine  financial  hardship.  3,  4  and  5-room  mortgagors

accounted for 29%, 41% and 29% respectively of the successful

applications during this period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14,200 of these new cases were assisted in 2001. This

compares  against 15,000 new cases in 1999,  and  10,000  new

cases in 2000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 31st March 2002, 15,300 of the cases assisted

since   January   2001  remained  active.   The   flat   type

distribution  among these cases is similar  to  that  of  new

cases assisted during this period, ie,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>



with  3, 4 and 5-room mortgagors accounting for 28%, 42%  and

30% respectively of these cases.



<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> It was reported in

the  Business Times yesterday that there were 19,400 mortgage

loan  deferment cases.  I would like to ask the  Minister  of

State if the 19,400 cases refer to the arrears and if some of

the  loan  deferment cases are also included  in  the  19,400

cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question I would like to ask the Minister is

whether  there  are many applications for  extension  of  the

deferment  cases after the expiry of the initial  six  months

allowed.   And if so, how would such deferment  be  given  or

extended?



<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Sir, the report carried in the

Business  Times  yesterday referred to cases  which  were  in

arrears  in excess of three months.  These are quite distinct

figures  from  the  figures which I have given,  which  cover

cases which have approached the Board for assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key point here is that there is actually no need to

go  into  arrears.  The take-home message is that  if  people

were  to  approach  the Housing and Development  Board  early

enough    when   they   anticipate   that   their   financial

circumstances  have  changed, there are  more  than  adequate

measures in place to assist these people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's next question was on people who still

continue  to  experience financial hardship  beyond  the  six

months.   There  are measures which are  in  place.   We  can

reschedule the loans.  We can add more names to the co-owners

of  the  flat  and  take any other measures  which  were  not

utilised earlier to assist these people as well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, would

the  Minister of State kindly reconsider relaxing  the  rules

regarding  the requirement that a person who wants to  resell

his  flat must own the flat for five years, in the case of  a

new  flat, or three years, in the case of a resale  flat,  in

order to downgrade, in the event that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>



there is genuine hardship on the part of the owner?



<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> In cases of severe financial

hardship,  the  HDB  does,  on a  case-by-case  basis,  allow

families  in  these circumstances to sell their flats  before

the minimum occupation period has expired.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>PROMOTING AND NURTURING CREATIVITY IN SCHOOL</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon</b> asked the Minister for

Education  (a) what proportion of the time in the  curriculum

and  the student's time in school is devoted to promoting and

nurturing  creativity and (b) will his Ministry be conducting

a  study to evaluate the success of this effort and,  if  so,

what kind of performance indicator will be used.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the approach adopted to nurturing creativity in

students   is  not  through  teaching  specific  modules   on

creativity  or  teaching  it  as  a  separate  subject.   Our

approach  to  promoting and nurturing creativity  is  through

infusion  across  the  curriculum and through  project  work,

teaching  methodologies  and the  assessment  system  itself.

Lessons  in  any  subject that arouse a lively  curiosity  in

students  foster  creative  thinking  and  imagination.   Our

Science   and  Mathematics  programmes,  for  example,   help

students to develop this curiosity by encouraging enquiry and

getting  them  to  provide their own solutions  to  problems.

Activities with open-ended investigations such as  the  Maths

trail,  which is an activity conducted outside the classroom,

require  students to use varied strategies to solve  problems

or seek alternative solutions to problems.  Teachers are also

conducting   activities  to  make  science  an   experiential

learning  for  students, especially  at  the  primary  school

level.    One  activity  in  primary  schools,  for  example,

involves having the students learn more about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>



themselves through taking their finger prints.  In  addition,

an  activity  like project work, which is now  required  from

primary  school upwards, provides opportunities for  students

to  look  at events with fresh perspectives, to come up  with

their   own   responses  to  problems  and  issues   and   to

investigate,  explore and try out new ways of  doing  things.

Project work also encourages students to break away from  the

compartmentalisation of the different subject disciplines and

explore  the inter-relationships between different  areas  of

knowledge when applied to real life situations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no single indicator that can give a reliable

measure  of the success of our efforts to promote creativity.

However,  we  are  changing  the  assessment  system  in  the

individual subjects so that problem solving, inference skills

and  creative  thinking  are given greater  emphasis  in  the

assessments.    For  example,  in  English  Literature,   the

introduction of unseen material - material that the  students

have  not previously seen - in the assessment system develops

students'  quality  of  thinking  and  their  application  of

principles  of  critical reading to the  unseen  passages  of

prose or poetry.  Such critical appreciation enables students

to   demonstrate  their  individual  insights  and   original

thinking beyond text knowledge.  In history, questions  based

on original sources - source-based questions, as they call it

-  have  been  introduced  to assess students'  thinking  and

analytical  skills  in the interpretation and  evaluation  of

issues  in  their original historical context.   And  in  the

sciences, we are introducing a new way of assessing practical

skills  over a period of time instead of a one-off  practical

examination, to promote a broader understanding of scientific

process skills associated with scientific inquiry and problem-solving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project work will be required for entry to university in

future,  and  this  is project work that  is  in  most  cases

interdisciplinary.   How our students respond  to  these  new

assessment  items will give some indication of how successful

we  have been.  Beyond the schools, in our higher and further

education institutions,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>



curriculum and teaching methodology has also been changed  to

encourage  more creativity.  It will take a number  of  years

for the effects of these changes to be fully felt.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> May I know if

Confucianism, as a subject, or as part of the civic  lessons,

or in any way, still taught in our schools?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, I do not have the

particulars   of  the  syllabus.   I  do  not  know   whether

Confucianism  in  some form is still part of the  curriculum.

But  I would not be surprised if all the Asian traditions are

still present in our curriculum in one form or another.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> The Minister of State, in

his  answer,  says that project work will be introduced.   My

concern  is  whether the teachers are adequately prepared  to

guide the students in the project work because it is a fairly

new  component  being introduced.  My experience  shows  that

sometimes  students are a bit confused as  to  what  are  the

requirements and the guidelines.  So my question  is  whether

teachers  are sufficiently prepared beforehand and  what  are

the preparations that teachers have gone through.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, our project work at

junior  colleges  -  I  think this  is  what  the  Member  is

referring to - is currently at the pilot stage.  It is  still

early  days.  We have put considerable effort into  preparing

the  teachers.  So far, the pilot stage has  been  proceeding

well.   Teachers are learning as they go along.  When we  are

confident  that  the junior colleges are  able  to  implement

project work to realise the intent of the scheme, we will  be

implementing it as a requirement for university admission.



<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

received   some  feedback  about  this  project  work   that,

especially  in primary schools, it ends up that  the  parents

actually  end  up doing the project work on behalf  of  their

children.   While I can see that good things are  being  said

about  having project work in later years in school, I wonder

whether the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>



Ministry has some measures to put in place to make sure  that

the  project  work in primary school really  comes  from  the

students, and not from the parents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, I would not be

surprised  if  what  the Member described  is  not  at  least

partially  true.  That is a social rather than an educational

phenomenon.   Project work at primary school,  however,  does

not  count  in the overall assessment system.  At the  junior

colleges  where it is going to count, the safeguards  are  in

place.  The project work is done by a team of students in the

school under the supervision of a teacher.



<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> I would like to ask the Minister

of  State, in the case of project work in primary school,  if

the  Ministry  has studied whether enough time  is  allocated

within  school hours to do the project work because, although

it  is  a  social  rather  than  an  educational  issue,  the

temptation  would be that when the project  work  is  brought

home, the parents will come into the picture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question relates to Mathematics problem sums in

primary  school.   My understanding is that,  presently,  the

teachers  require  the students to tackle the  problem  in  a

certain manner.  They have to have models, and it seems  that

if  the students can get the answer without the models, marks

are deducted.  I would like to ask the Minister if this could

be   studied  carefully,  because  if  you  want  to   foster

creativity, then it should be a matter of getting  the  right

answers   based  on  the  child's  manner  of  thinking   and

rationalising,  instead  of  a  fixed  mode  of  solving  the

problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, on the first question

of  whether adequate time is provided during school hours for

project work to be done, I do not think we would want to have

a  situation  where  all project work is done  during  school

hours  in  the primary schools.  It would crowd out something

else.   We  have a heavy enough curriculum.  We want  project

work  to  enrich the curriculum.  If we try  and  do  it  all

during  the same number of hours, then something else has  to

fall off, and that is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>



typically  something else that is valuable.   I  see  nothing

wrong in project work at the primary school level being  done

partially outside school hours, at home.  I do not  think  we

should  worry  too  much  if the  mother  or  the  father  is

providing  some guidance.  It is the spirit of  project  work

that  is  important at the end of the day and  teachers  will

have  to assess whether the child is actually capable of  the

project work he does.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question of Mathematics problems, I take

the  Member's  point  that we would like  Mathematics  to  be

taught and assessed in primary schools, or at any level, in a

way  which recognises that there are different methods to the

right answer.  This is not a matter of the curriculum or  the

syllabus  as  much  as teaching methodologies  in  individual

schools.   I  have  come across anecdotal examples  that  are

raised where there might have been too rigid treatment  of  a

particular   problem  and  teachers  are   not   sufficiently

forgiving  of different methods.  These are problems  on  the

ground that are to be expected.  On the whole, I do not think

we have a severe problem.  Our teachers, by and large, try to

encourage  children to understand the principles  behind  the

Mathematics  problem.  But I would not deny  that  there  are

instances that we come across.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Would the Minister

elaborate  how would project work be assessed as an admission

criterion for going to university in the future?  Is it  done

by  the university concerned, the faculty concerned, or would

there  be  a  central  examination board  in  assessing  this

project work?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Details of the assessment

methodology are being finalised.  Assessment is not  done  by

the  universities.   It  will be  done  within  the  existing

framework  of  our  'A'  level examinations,  the  Singapore-Cambridge   'A'  level  examinations.   It  is   a   rigorous

procedure, with care taken to ensure that there is no bias in

the assessment of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>



students' projects.  So I do not think we need to worry about

the integrity of the process.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, if I may ask the Minister whether the emphasis

on  project work has helped to reduce the emphasis on  grade,

if any?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> If the Member's question is

on  how  project  work  is reducing the emphasis  on  written

examinations,  if  that is what he meant, I  think  it  will.

Project  work looks at process skills, and is a  very  useful

supplement  to  the existing system of written  examinations.

Like  I  said, it is early days.  We are still improving  the

process  but  the Ministry of Education does  feel  that  the

project  work  is  going  to  be  an  integral  component  of

assessment system in the future.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to  seek the Minister of State's clarification.   Since

project  work  is a supplement or additional to the  existing

curriculum,  will  it  not  be an additional  stress  on  the

students  now  that,  as  he stated correctly,  the  students

already  have quite a heavy curriculum?  The other issue  is:

what  are the steps that the Ministry will take to make  sure

that  project work will not become another examination  where

the students will prepare for it and that they have to get  a

good grade to get into the university?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> On the Member's first

question, Sir, it is not the intent that project work  should

create a new source of stress, nor do we think that that will

be  the  outcome.   We are monitoring this carefully  at  the

pilot  stage.  We want to make sure that project work is  not

an add-on to the existing assessment system, but is really  a

complement   to   the  existing  assessment  system.    Taken

together,  we want to make sure that the overall workload  of

junior  college  students does not  increase.   I  think  the

Member's  fear  is  a natural one.  It is not  without  basis

because we know how things work out in practice quite easily.

So we have to watch this carefully and make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>



sure  that work pressure does not go up and stress levels  do

not  go up unnecessarily.  It is not the intention that  they

should.  What is the Member's next question?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> What are the steps that the Ministry

will take to make sure that it will not deteriorate into just

another form of examination?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> I have no doubt that our

junior  college  students will take any  form  of  assessment

seriously.  I do not think we can help that.  But if  we  did

not   assess   this  and  we  did  not  attempt  to   measure

performance, then given the same culture of taking  seriously

only  what is assessed, people will simply not pay  too  much

attention to project work and will not pay too much attention

to the process skills that we are trying to cultivate.  So we

have  to  assess  this and that provides  the  incentive  for

students  to take project work and process skills  seriously.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Minister of State's answer is

that  we  know  how the ground works here on education.   How

sure  is  he that the project work will not become  an  added

pressure  on the students which is contrary to the  objective

of the Ministry of Education?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Minister of State's answer

is that we know how the ground works here on education.    How

sure is he that that the project work will not become an added

pressure on the students which is contrary to the objective of

the Ministry of Education?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, to take a couple of

steps  back,  why  have  we  introduced  project  work?    We

introduced it because we are trying to reduce the  extent  of

the emphasis on written examinations.  And I am sure everyone

agrees that that is a good thing.  How we go about putting it

into  practice  is  important.  We are going  to  put  it  to

practice  in a sensible fashion where we are going to  accord

it the weight it deserves, not too much weight.  We are going

to  make  sure that how teachers guide students, how students

actually go about the process, is going to reflect the spirit

of  this whole exercise which is not just to accumulate marks

as  easily as possible, but to really use the exercises as an

opportunity    to   gain   new   skills   of   enquiry    and

experimentation.   There is no guarantee  that  any  form  of

assessment is not going to lead to stress or pressure.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>



There can be no guarantee.  But it is not our intention  that

it be the case.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, from what I gather from the

answer  given  to  my last question, the  schools  are  still

teaching  Confucianism.    If Confucianism  is  taught  in  a

significant way, may I ask the Minister whether it  will  not

be  in conflict with the attempt of schools trying to nurture

creativity?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, as I mentioned earlier,

I  really do not have the specifics with me on the details of

what  elements of Confucianism are in our curriculum.  But  I

would  not be surprised if Confucianism, like the other Asian

traditions,  remains in our curriculum and for  good  reason.

There  is Confucianism and there is Confucianism.   It  is  a

broad subject.  You are able to pick elements out of it which

you feel are important for children to understand, appreciate

and imbibe and which remain as relevant to our future as they

have  been  in  our  past.  I do not have  the  specifics  on

exactly  which elements remain in our curriculum.  But  I  do

not  think  the Ministry needs to be defensive  about  having

elements  of a very important Asian philosophy and  tradition

remaining in our curriculum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may ask

the  Minister how much time is given for the project work and

project presentation, whether it is done during class time or

outside  class  time, and whether a reduction in  class  size

will  actually help to give the students more time  for  more

project work presentation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Project work, when it is

fully  implemented, will be part of the curriculum.  In other

words,  it  is  not  an  enrichment activity  taken  entirely

outside of regular hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to class size, project work is not conducted in a

full-class fashion.  It is conducted by teams of students  in

small  groups,  as has to be the case, given  the  nature  of

project work.  It is an applied exercise.  So it is conducted

in small groups.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Senior

Minister of State whether he agrees with the hon. Member  for

Potong  Pasir that teaching of Asian cultures and  traditions

such as Confucianism in schools will stifle creativity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, this subject is worth

several  dissertations.   I am not capable  of  even  half  a

dissertation on the subject but, from the very little I  know

about  the way we have sought to incorporate these traditions

or  Asian  cultures in our curriculum, I have  no  reason  to

think  that  it will stifle creativity.  There has  to  be  a

certain  tension between retaining ballast and the desire  to

explore  something  new, and the desire to explore  something

new is given strength by how much ballast we have.  If it  is

all  exploring the new, the future or the next big  thing,  I

think  we can easily fall flat.  We have to retain a  certain

core  of  what represents eternal truths, eternal principles,

in  order to explore what is new.  So I do not think we  need

feel  defensive about learning about tradition, understanding

it well, understanding what is weak in our past traditions as

well as understanding what is strong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, can I clarify that this

new  smaller  class  size, as what the  Minister  said,  will

actually  help  to  improve the current emphasis  on  project

work?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> To clarify, Sir, I was not

talking  about smaller class size as such, but I was  talking

about  the  way  in  which project work is implemented,  that

project work is not a whole class activity but is an activity

pursued by groups of students within any particular class.

<div align="center"><b>(Counselling/support services)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Gan Kim Yong</b> asked the Minister for Education

what  counselling  or support services are available  in  the

schools  or  in his Ministry to help students in the  primary

and  secondary  schools cope with the psychological  pressure

they may face from time to time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Minister for Education):</b> The Ministry of Education adopts a comprehensive

approach  towards  addressing the social emotional  needs  of

pupils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a comprehensive pastoral care system in all

schools.   All  pupils  are  taught lifeskills,  which  cover

topics  relating to personal and interpersonal effectiveness.

All  teachers  in  schools are trained in  basic  counselling

skills  and emergency behavioural management skills to  equip

them  to be first-line caregivers.  Support within the school

is  given  by  two Teacher Counsellors in every  school,  and

Emergency  Behaviour Management Officers  who  have  received

advanced  training  in  counselling and crisis  intervention.

Since  last year, at the school cluster level, we  have  also

introduced  a  system,  what we call  the  School  Counsellor

Scheme.   We  have  trained  retired  education  officers  in

counselling, and they provide an additional layer of  support

to  the schools.  Further, schools may refer serious problems

to  the  Ministry  of  Education's  Guidance  Specialists  or

Educational Psychologists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While schools provide support for the pupils, the

support  from  the home is of paramount importance.   Parents

can  help  their  children to set realistic expectations  for

themselves and to develop strength of character in them which

will enable them to cope with life's challenges.  Schools and

parents need to work together to achieve this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, can I ask

the Senior Minister of State whether there are any programmes

or   any  efforts  made  in  identifying  students  who   are

potentially  at  risk and, if such a programme  exists,  what

follow-up programmes are there to help these students cope?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, yes, the programme

exists.   This is in fact what our teachers are  trained  for

and,  in  particular, the specialists within the schools  and

within  the  clusters  are trained to monitor  behaviour,  to

detect problems early, where we can, and to follow up case by

case with the students concerned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Sir, could the Senior Minister of

State explain whether there are any programmes that will help

to  counsel the parents in managing their expectation of  the

students?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, when problems arise,

the  Counsellors and Emergency Behaviour Management  Officers

do   work   closely  with  the  parents.   They  are  trained

principally to deal with the students, but they look  at  the

case  in its totality and they operate in close dialogue with

the parents as well.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, may I ask the Senior

Minister  of  State  whether it  is  possible  to  equip  the

teachers in the classes to be able to pick up psychologically

abnormal children as our children spend a large part of their

time in schools?  This is to be able to refer these kids  for

further check-ups so as to prevent the unwanted consequences,

the extreme of which is suicide.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, as I mentioned,

teachers  are  trained  to detect  problems.   They  are  not

experts.   They may not be able to detect all problems  early

enough.  I do not think we would want to burden teachers with

too  many duties of this nature.  Their principal task is  to

teach  their classes well, to attend to their charges, to  be

able to spot problems when they arise, and to deal with them.

But we should not put the responsibility on them to engage in

too much diagnostics.  When problems present themselves, they

will  have  to react sensibly and in a fashion that  provides

care for the students.  But we should not increase the duties

of    the    teachers   too   far   beyond   their   existing

responsibilities.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I was referring not so much to the

diagnostic  type of capability but more on the teaching  part

where  a  teacher is able to pick up abnormal  behaviours  or

characters  in  the  students and  to  refer  them  for  more

assessments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, if I understand it

correctly, that is indeed part and parcel of being a teacher.

If they spot problems, they will follow up on it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Sir, in

relation  to dealing with more difficult cases, I  understand

that  independent  schools have used the model  of  employing

full-time social workers and school counsellors to deal  with

more  difficult  cases.  Will the Ministry consider  allowing

Government  schools to employ professional social workers  or

school  counsellors to be based in schools to deal  with  the

cases directly and more immediately?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, there is certainly no

restraint  on schools employing further resources but,  as  I

mentioned, every school has two Teacher Counsellors who  have

been  specially trained for this purpose.  This is on top  of

the  basic training which every teacher receives.  So we have

several  layers of support beyond every teacher.  First,  the

specialised  Teacher  Counsellors in every  school,  two  per

school;  second, what we started last year,  at  the  cluster

level  we  are training retired education officers, providing

them advanced training in counselling skills; and, third,  at

the  level of the Ministry itself, where our specialists will

be able to help schools when problems arise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Sir, can I ask the Senior Minister of

State  whether he will consider allowing schools  to  partner

with   professional   voluntary   organisations   which   are

professionals  in counselling as this, to a  certain  extent,

will  also  alleviate  the workload on  the  teachers?   And,

bearing  in  mind that some of these problems  are  not  just

within the school, it could involve the family as well as the

parents and the siblings.  So, would it not be more efficient

and   productive  to  allow  professional  organisations   to

collaborate   with  the  schools  in  providing   counselling

support?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, that is indeed the

methodology.   When  schools  refer  serious  cases  to   the

Ministry  of  Education, we will often, in fact,  assist  the

school  by referring the case to appropriate agencies,  which

include the Child Guidance Clinic, Family Service Centres and

various voluntary organisations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask

the  Senior  Minister  of State whether  the  Ministry  would

consider  actually  doing  more work  on  primary  prevention

rather  than  on  secondary and tertiary prevention,  when  a

problem  happens.  Many of these emotional and  psychological

problems  could  be alleviated or reduced  if  the  students,

family  and teachers are properly trained to deal with  their

stress and emotional problems, and so on and so forth.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, the answer has to be,

in  principle, yes, we should try to detect problems as early

as  possible.   The question is how much of a teacher's  time

and  energies can be focused on detecting problems  that  are

not already apparent.  There has to be a limit to what we can

expect a teacher to do.  Their principal task is to teach the

curriculum  well  and to bring up their charges  well.   They

will  not  be able to detect all problems early enough.   The

principal  responsibility  has to  remain  with  the  family.

Teachers and schools will work closely with parents  in  that

regard, but the principal responsibility is with the family.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to ask the Senior Minister of State what is the success

rate of such counselling programmes that have been instituted

in schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, I do not have figures

on  the success rate.  But the impression that I have is that

the  programme has been quite effective so far.  Schools have

been  able to deal with the problems that they see, work with

parents  and help turn around a child.  In general, that  has

been the experience, but I do not have figures with me.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Ng Eng Hen) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Medical

Faculty  of  the  National University of Singapore  currently

incurs  a  cost of $80,000 a year for every medical  student.

Each   student  pays  $16,000.   The  Ministry  of  Education

subsidises,  per capita, to the tune of about $64,000.   This

cost  includes operating expenditure and manpower.   It  does

not  include  developmental costs, neither  does  it  include

specific  research  grants given to the  institutions  to  do

their research.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister of State did he

mean per year's cost of $80,000?  How much would it add up to

in the end?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Yes, if it is per capita per year, the

total cost would be around $400,000.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister of State why is

there  such a big difference in the fees charged for  medical

education  in  Singapore  as compared  to  those  in  Sydney,

Cambridge  and Oxford?  The total unsubsidised  tuition  fees

for  the  full  course in Sydney, Oxford  and  Cambridge  are

between  $170,000 and $250,000, as compared to  about  almost

double here.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, I am no expert on the way the other

schools  account, and I am not sure whether what  the  Member

says   is   completely  true,  in  the  sense  that   it   is

unsubsidised.  We have just come back from a tour of a number

of  medical schools in the United States.  I have  asked  the

same  questions to the deans of those faculties.  In Cornell,

the full course is US$400,000.  So, dollar for dollar, it  is

equivalent.   And they said that even then, they  think  that

the cost is higher, that they are not fully funding all their

teachers.   The   same  is  true  in  UPenn  (University   of

Pennsylvania).  Lord Oxburg, the Chairman of our  IAP  report

did  state  that  there were differences in  accounting  with

different schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the point is this: it is very expensive to train

medical  students.   I am not quite sure  that  the  Member's

point is true that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>



it  is  more expensive to train medical students here,  as  I

understand  that  most medical faculties  do  subsidise  even

foreign students.

whether,  in  the computation of the $80,000 per  annum,  the

salary  component  of  the teachers  concerned  includes  the

amount computed for direct service to patients or whether  it

is actually just computed as the teaching component.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, the breakdown of the $80,000 is

roughly  6:3:1,  60% in terms of academic  teaching;  30%  in

terms of research; and 10% in terms of clinical practice.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister of State how

different  is our method of costing compared to other  world-leading medical schools?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, I am no accountant. The high cost

of  medical education is of equal concern to the Ministry  as

it  is to Members, and indeed the public.  This is taxpayers'

money  and  we want to make sure that what we are paying,  we

are  getting our money's worth.  We do ask the same  question

to  academics when we visit other universities and the  first

retort  is  yes, it is really expensive business.   Two,  the

accounting is complex.  Why?  Because your teachers are  also

practitioners.  They practise, they do research.  Whatever it

is,  we have to ask ourselves:  one, are we getting value for

our  money?   Do  we produce good doctors?  Secondly,  is  it

money  well-spent?  MOE subsidises NUS, as I said, to a  tune

of  $64,000 a year per student.  My own sense is that this is

justified because we have good schools, we have good  doctors

and we have a reputation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> The Minister of State said earlier about

getting good money for our medical education.  Am I right  to

say  that  the medical faculty is the only one that  requires

its graduates to fulfill a five-year bond? Therefore, are  we

not already ensuring taxpayers' money is well-spent?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> The answer would be yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister of State whether he

concurs  with  the Minister for Health when he said  recently

that  the five-year medical bond could become a non-issue  if

medical students pay the full tuition fee?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> In an economic sense, it is completely

sensible.   If  you  have  paid for it,  you  have  no  moral

obligation.  On a social point of view, one can argue whether

despite  that,  you  could  say  that  this  does  not  cover

developmental cost.  The amount I quoted was $80,000 a  year.

It does not quite include developmental cost.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> On that note, could I then ask the

Minister  of State whether would it not be too much a  burden

for  medical students to bear a huge sum of $400,000 for  the

medical  education?   Would  it  be  right  to  commercialise

medical  studies  in this way?  Would it  not  lead  to  high

medical  cost  in the future as young doctors  aim  to  clear

their  huge loans?  Would it be right to set a precedent  for

unsubsidised tertiary education in the future?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, the Member has asked a number of

questions and I would try to understand the gist of it.   Her

main  point  was, if we move on to a completely  unsubsidised

track,  would it create a burden for the undergraduate?   The

answer must be yes.  A large proportion of US students  -  as

we  know, a lot of US students going to universities, and  at

the end of their education, they have huge loans.  We have  a

peculiar system.  In fact, in Asian countries the culture  is

such  that  the  State bears the cost, the parents  bear  the

cost.   And  I  hope that our younger generation  understands

this.

<div align="center"><b>NEIGHBOURHOOD LIBRARY IN POTONG PASIR ESTATE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Acting Minister for

Information,  Communications  and  the  Arts  whether  he  is

willing to open a neigbourhood library in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>



Potong  Pasir  Estate this year and, if not,  whether  he  is

willing  to assist the Potong Pasir Town Council to secure  a

void deck space to start a library there.



<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim (Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Mr David T. E. Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I assume the

neighbourhood  library which Mr Chiam is  asking  for  Potong

Pasir is a community children's library, or CCL.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCLs form the third-tier of libraries under the network

of  libraries  managed by the National Library  Board  (NLB).

The  first  tier is our regional libraries, the second  tier,

community libraries and in the third tier, community children

libraries.   Compared  to the larger regional  and  community

libraries,  the  CCLs are not the most cost-effective.   They

help  to bring the books closer to the children, but they  do

so at a higher cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NLB must therefore be satisfied that there is both a

sufficient level of demand and sustainable support  from  the

community  before deciding to build a CCL.  To be assured  of

the  support  from the community, the NLB would build  a  CCL

only  if  there  is a broad based community  organisation  to

share  both the building and the running costs.  If Mr  Chiam

can  present a case to show that there is demand for  such  a

facility,  and that he can ensure the support and  long  term

commitment  from  his community, then NLB will  consider  his

proposal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> This time, I am happy to note that

the  Ministry  is willing to give support to the  application

for  CCL.   First of all, may I know what sort of  readership

and  what level of readership would the Ministry allow for  a

CCL to be built?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, CCLs cater for young readers. The

rationale here is that for young readers, that with an  added

convenience of having a library in the neighbourhood makes it

easier  for the parents to bring their children down  to  the

library.  So it caters primarily for young readers, up  until

about Primary 4 or 5.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> If we want to apply for facilities

to build a CCL, we have to take a survey to see the number of

children  in  that  estate.  How many children  are  required

before we can apply?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, I think how Mr Chiam makes his case

is  really  up  to him, whether he wants to do  a  survey  or

whether  he has got some other means to do so.  I think  what

NLB  would want to be satisfied with is that there is  demand

to  support  a CCL.  And that there is not just  demand,  but

also  a  broad-based community organisation that  can  ensure

that they would provide the on-going support for the CCL.  It

takes quite a lot of money to run a CCL.  From our experience

with  other  CCLs,  there  is a contribution  of  a  start-up

capital cost. Then, there is also a contribution of an annual

operating cost.  So if you can satisfy these conditions, then

NLB would consider.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The second part of the question is

whether  or  not the Ministry is willing to persuade  HDB  to

wall  up  an area at the void deck.  If they wall  it  up,  I

think we will try to get the finances and if the town council

and the residents there are willing to do it themselves, will

the Ministry be willing to let us do it.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, we have got to take this issue one

step  at  a  time.  I think first, you have got to  establish

that  there  is a case to build a CCL before you  talk  about

walling  up  the space.  Walling up the space in a  HDB  void

deck,  well,  that will entail a whole host of other  issues,

which  is  whether  you have a suitable  space,  whether  the

residents  would have adequate space for other uses  in  void

decks.   That  is a separate issue.  The first  issue  is  to

establish  whether  there  is demand  and  whether  there  is

support.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> What the town council at Potong

Pasir is just asking is only a walled-up space by the HDB and

after   that,   I   think   the  Ministry   of   Information,

Communications and the Arts will leave the rest  to  us.   If

the residents there, with the cooperation of the town council

are willing to do it, why is the Ministry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>



putting  up all kinds of reasons and barriers to make  it  so

difficult to start up a library?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Chiam has changed his

question  somewhat.  I thought he asked me  whether  I  would

consider a neighbourhood library or CCL in his precinct,  and

for  that,  I have answered his question by saying that  yes,

you  can do so if you can make a case for demand and support,

and that we can make that to the NLB.  And if you want to  be

part of the NLB network of library systems, the NLB must have

a  say in this.  It costs quite a lot of money to run a  good

library  and  I  do not think that NLB would be  prepared  to

invest  that  sum of money unless they could be assured  that

they have got a partner that is able to assure them that they

would  deliver benefits and is able to bear that part of  the

burden.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether you want to wall up the space, that is an

HDB  matter - it has nothing to do with my Ministry.  You can

take it up with HDB.

May, 2002],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the

Government  for the financial year 1st April,  2002  to  31st

March, 2003."  -  [Minister for Finance].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br>1.30 pm



<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, yesterday, many of my parliamentary colleagues

had  spoken in support of the motion standing in the name  of

the Finance Minister.  I also support the motion, but I would

like to raise two points here today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, since our independence more than 30 years ago we

have  continuously improved the standard  of  living  of  our

people and improved our competitiveness in the world.  Today,

I  would like to say that even with this economic downturn we

should not lose our confidence.  So, my emphasis here is that

we  must  maintain our confidence and we must  not  lose  it.

Secondly, what brand has Singapore created?  To me, the  name

"Singapore" itself is a well-renowned brand name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to commend the DPM and

Finance  Minister for this very forward-looking and  balanced

Budget.   Mainly, this Budget aims to restructure our economy

and  to  bring to our people better lives and better days  to

come.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>



When  the Finance Minister introduced the tax reform, he  has

also  introduced  various measures to help Singaporeans  tide

over the difficult time



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we review our CPF scheme, we have to be very

careful. Many people feel that the Government's restructuring

plan  is not going to be confined to those changes which have

been  announced  only.  On May Day, DPM Lee called  upon  the

people and the workers to change their work attitudes and  to

look  at  this economic downturn more positively.   And  most

importantly,  he  said that the Government  will  review  and

introduce  reforms  to counter these challenges.   So,  these

changes  are  not  solely targeted  at  the  people  or   the

workers. I am very comforted by his statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that when we are conducting this economic

review,  we  have  to  look  at the  various  industries  and

sectors,  not just the financial sector or the sectors  which

are directly related to the economy.   I think that we should

also review the service industry, manufacturing industry  and

other  industries  relating to the quality  of  life  of  our

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that this Economic Review Committee would also

conduct some sectoral and regional review.  Why do I  say  we

must  have  sectoral review?  I remember that many years  ago

when  I  was  still  in the NTUC, we said that  the  maritime

industry  was a sunset industry.  Many people in the maritime

industry  were very pessimistic and very negative.   But  two

weeks  ago when I visited the shipyards, I regained a lot  of

confidence  and I am more optimistic about our  economy  now.

When  we  visited Keppel, I learnt that the oil rigs designed

by  our  local  engineers had already attained  international

patent, and they command 60% of the world's market.   We  are

now servicing some 20% of the world's ocean-going vessels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as we know, our wafer fab industry is in the

process  of  recovery.  For example, SSMC (System on  Silicon

Manufacturing Company) has already started



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>



a  new factory in Singapore and UMCI (United Microelectronics

Corporation) will also start a new plant here next year.  Our

Creative  Technology commands 60% of the world's  sound  card

market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am citing all these examples because yesterday my

parliamentary  colleagues mentioned about the  difficulty  of

getting  a job nowadays.  In my constituency, the reliefs  we

are handing out are among the highest in Singapore. Maybe  it

is  because many of our workers are staying in the south-west

part  of Singapore.  We registered the retrenched workers  in

our  constituency and introduced many of them to jobs in  the

factories.   I  told  the shipyards that the  Government  was

providing training programmes for those who employ workers 40

years  old  and above, and we would pay half the  salary.   I

told them that the workers I send them would be able to work,

people  who  would have no language problem. As soon  as  the

shipyard  employs them, the Government will pay 50% of  their

wages straight away.  The company said, "All right".  We sent

a  few  hundred workers there when the company had more  than

1,000 vacancies. Yet, only 150 workers were recruited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, I sent applicants to a hotel for jobs.

I  telephoned the Manager and asked what was the result.   He

told me only one woman applicant accepted the job offered  to

her.   What is the problem?  Are the employers prejudiced  or

are  there some problems with our workers?  So here  I  would

like  to  urge  the workers to make adjustment to  their  own

attitudes and expectations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Mayor in the south-west part of Singapore, I will

step up efforts to help our workers secure a job.  But I hope

that these applicants who are recommended for work would,  as

far  as  possible, accept the job offered to them because  we

have   actually   looked   into   their   background,   their

qualifications  and their skills level before  matching  them

for  the jobs.  We do not just send anyone to them.  In fact,

all  these  people  were interviewed, their backgrounds  were

looked  into, and companies have also agreed that they  would

try their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>



best  to  accept these applicants recommended by  us  because

they  know that we had actually screened them before we  send

them over.  So I feel that these workers should just take the

job  for  the  time being and when the economy has  recovered

they could perhaps look for better jobs later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, I said that we had to review the various

industries  because  we  should not have  bias  or  prejudice

towards  any  particular industry.  So long as this  industry

has  some  leading edge I think that we could still  be  very

competitive  in the world market.  We should not just  single

out  our talents in the financial sector, we should also give

credit  to  our  engineers who have created or  invented  new

products and who have obtained international patents for  the

inventions.  I think that we should give more credit to  them

and   let  them  have  a  sense  of  satisfaction  for  their

achievement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that I want to raise is the informal

sector.   Many  people may  not be very  interested  in  this

sector  because we call them "informal", and hence  they  are

not  in  the  mainstream.  Hence, they cannot  fit  into  the

financial sector or the service industry.  When we talk about

structural unemployment, normally the people involved are the

elderly workers.  It is not that they do not want to look for

a  job  but they just have this difficulty in matching.   For

example,  the telephone operators.  Nowadays, many  companies

are  looking for telephone operators.  I have introduced some

women, 40 years and above, to a company.  The company told me

that  age did not matter, so long as their voices are  decent

and  presentable to the ears. But eventually  they  were  not

accepted  because  their  standard of  English  is  not  good

enough.   Perhaps the company could provide  them  with  some

training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Review Committee should also look into the

needs of this informal sector. We should be more tolerant and

give  more allowance to all these people who are not able  to

fit  into the formal sector.  In our South-West CDC, we  have

started a course for the caring



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>



of  new-born babies.  In Australia, all these new-born babies

are  being  looked after by nannies at home.  The  Government

would  also  subsidize for the employment of  these  nannies.

With our ageing population, we should also train some workers

in  the 40s or 50s to look after all the senior citizens  who

need  their  care  and  concern.  In   some  industries,  for

example,  in the bakery or food catering industry,  there  is

also space for development.  I am sure that we have all heard

of the Bengawan Solo Cake Shop.  Bengawan Solo started off as

a  family  business where the owner baked cakes at  home  and

sold  them  to  her friends and regular customers.  When  the

cakes  became popular and well-known, she commercialised  her

operation, and now Begawan Solo has become a household brand.

Perhaps,  HDB  should consider relaxing its  rules  to  allow

housewives  to bake cakes and pastries at home for  sale,  so

long  as  they  comply  with  the  health  and  environmental

regulations. I believe that during the festive seasons, quite

a lot of housewives are already doing so, albeit illegally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the schools, there used be some people from the not

so  well-to-do  families  setting up  stalls  in  the  school

canteens  to sell local delicacies, such as mee siam,  kuehs,

tid-bits  to the school children.  Nowadays, because  of  the

hygiene requirement, only the major suppliers are allowed  to

supply  to the school canteen operators, and all these "small

hawkers"  would not be allowed to sell their goodies  in  the

school canteens.  So I feel that in this informal sector, for

those  people who are not in the mainstream industries,  some

form  of  help could be provided to  help them   improve  the

standard of living. I think we should look into their needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing I want to mention is about our brand-name.

Whenever  I  go overseas, I feel very proud when  the  people

there  express  signs of admiration for our country.  On  one

occasion  I  went to Harbin, a remote city in the  north-east

part  of  China.  At the night market, there was  an  elderly

gentleman who asked me where I came from.  I told him that  I

came  from  Singapore, and he exclaimed, "Oh Singapore!   Lee

Kuan Yew."  Even in a small



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>



night market in far-away Harbin, people know about Singapore.

The  name  "Singapore" by itself is a brand.  It is  a  brand

name.    I feel that as a small nation, the question  is  not

who  has a bigger piece of the pie.  The most important thing

is we want to create a bigger pie for more people to share.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the well-established Government-linked

companies  need not be restructured. If they have made  their

name  internationally, let them retain the goodwill  and  the

advantages  that  come  with it.   If  the  Government-linked

companies  are  doing well, we should not  downsize  them  or

divest  them  completely.  I think the Government  should  be

more  magnanimous  and  invite some successful  companies  to

become  partners  of  these Government-linked  companies  and

these  smaller  Government  companies.   Of  course,  in  the

sensitive     and    strategic    industries,     such     as

telecommunications, aviation, and defence-related industries,

where the small companies cannot take the lead, then let them

be led by the GLCs.  But, we can invite more SMEs, successful

entrepreneurs or local entrepreneurs to take up shares in the

big  GLCs,  or  take over the smaller sized  ones  like,  for

example,  companies  in  the  food  industry  or  electronics

companies.  I think most SMEs have these skills.   We  should

be  more magnanimous and invite some successful companies  to

merge  or  even to take over the management of these  smaller

Government companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how we look at it, we have to stand united.

We  should make use of the strength of the GLCs and the local

companies  to  fight for a bigger space in the  international

market.   My  visit to the maritime industry has  boosted  my

confidence.  In the past, for safety consideration, a lot  of

works  in  the maritime industry were  carried  out  on  land

rather  than  on  board  on the vessels.  When  I  asked  the

shipyards  why   people shied away from this  industry,  they

told  me that safety in this industry was a great concern  to

the  potential  workers.  I think if  we  can  enlighten  our

workers more on this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>



aspect,  we should be able to boost their confidence in  this

industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to raise here is that the

Economic  Review  Committee  should  look  not  only  at  the

economic matters, but also on our living environment and  our

quality  of  life.   Yesterday, some  MPs  talked  about  the

problem of having children and the desire for a better living

environment.  I feel that perhaps the south-western  part  of

Singapore has been neglected in our national development   We

have Punggol 21.  We have good old Katong, etc.  Jurong seems

to be neglected nowadays. In the past, Jurong was a show-case

to   the  developing  countries  on  how  we  developed   our

industries,  and  the  bed  of our industrialisation  in  the

1960s.  It was an industrial estate which we were very  proud

of. But now, it has lost its glamour.  I would be touching on

Remaking  Jurong  initiative under MTI in  the  Committee  of

Supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also have a review on the various regions.

Many  regions  have  lost  their  glamorous  characteristics.

Jurong  used to be a very famous place in Singapore.  I  feel

that  Jurong can be more beautiful than the Suzhou Industrial

Park  in  China.  I hope that this Economic Review  Committee

would  also  conduct some regional review,  and  this  review

would be able to help improve our quality of life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is on social and welfare services. The

Deputy Prime Minister has provided for double tax rebates for

donations  to  charity.  I think it is a very  good  measure.

But we should also look into how we could help the charitable

organisations  to look after the needy people,  for  example,

the  handicapped people.  We should change the mindset of the

people,  because  in this industry, it is  not  just  welfare

work.  In fact, in this aspect, Singapore has done well.   Dr

Amy  Khor  mentioned about autistic children  yesterday.   We

have  done  a lot.  We have many experts in this  field.   We

should  look  at  it as a service industry.   We  could  even

export  this  expertise.  It could tun out to be a  lucrative

industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I hope that the Economic Review Committee

will look not only at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>



the direct economic fields but also on the living environment

of the people and the needs of the various sectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore

is  a  city  state.  Unlike other big cities, like New  York,

London and Shanghai, we do not have a natural hinterland that

can  act as a buttress or conduit for our city.  The cost  of

living in a city can be very high compared to the more  rural

areas.   But many still want to come into the city  to  live,

work and seek their riches and fortune.  And those who cannot

make  it  in the city and find it too expensive to  live  in,

will move out to other areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a natural process of rejuvenation. Take New

York,  for  example.  Garments used to  be  one  of  its  key

industries  but  when  it became too  expensive  for  textile

companies  to remain in Manhattan, they moved out  and  other

industries,  such  as financial services, took  their  place.

Those  who  cannot make it have moved out and new industries,

new  players,  have moved in to continue to  make  the  place

buzzing.  The city rejuvenates itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the years, Singapore has been able to

restructure  its  economy.   We  have  transformed  from   an

entrepot trading centre to an international business hub  and

diversified from labour intensive manufacturing to wafer  fab

plants and other hi-tech industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this has resulted in some segments of our

population  finding it difficult to make the  adjustments  to

upgrade.  And, in our case, we are uniformly expensive.  Over

the  years,  we  have relentlessly upgraded our  environment,

infrastructure and services to make life more comfortable for

our   people.    Our  bus  companies  have  introduced   air-conditioned  buses;  road-side stalls  are  done  away  with;

hawker  centres  have  been replaced by air-conditioned  food

courts;  wet  markets  replaced by  supermarkets,  like  NTUC

Fairprice and Cold Storage.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has not only led to an increase in the cost of

living  but also left behind few low-cost alternatives.   And

this  has  also led to the problems of high land  prices  and

high  cost  of doing business in Singapore that  Mr  Inderjit

Singh spoke about yesterday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strategy worked well in good times when people were

earning  decent  incomes and enjoying  increasingly  affluent

lifestyles.  But when they lose their jobs or have to  suffer

a  drastic pay cut, they find it very difficult to make  ends

meet  on a household budget of a few hundred dollars a month.

The  basic  costs are still there.  They still need  to  feed

themselves and their children, repay their housing loans, pay

for  their  utilities  and service and  conservancy  charges.

There are no low-cost alternatives to many of the things that

we  need  today.  There are very limited ways  to  bring  our

costs  down  to a really low level.  Even if one retreats  to

Sembawang, Lim Chu Kang or Pulau Ubin, one cannot lower one's

costs substantially.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take another example of Raffles Place. Cheap hawker

stalls are now a thing of the past.  Lau Pa Sat and Boat Quay

have  gone  up-market.  People who work there are  left  with

little  choice  but  to accept the higher cost  alternatives,

although  they  may  still enjoy the  improved  ambience  and

surroundings.   In  other  major cities,  including  big  and

infamously  expensive  ones like  Tokyo,  I  find  there  are

alternatives  to  meet varying levels  of  affordability.   I

remember  visiting  Tokyo some years back  on  a  shoe-string

budget   and   was  able  to  find  very  local,   relatively

inexpensive  food  stalls in the alleys  just  off  the  main

thoroughfares of expensive precincts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unlike Mr Inderjit Singh who called for a general

reduction in prices and adjustment in asset values, I believe

we  have  to create an environment that allows for a  natural

rejuvenation and offers alternatives for varying  needs.   We

still   have   successful  companies  that   require   modern

infrastructure, facilities and services and  are  willing  to

pay for them, and others who require a lower cost environment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>



to  operate  in.  To cater to these differing  demands  would

require a relaxation of rules, less centralised control, more

privatisation  and devolution of ownership and responsibility

to private hands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, we have a pretty rigid model for the

progression of our young.  According to the model,  they  are

to  study  hard, get good grades, go to university,  if  not,

then to polytechnic, and if not, then ITE, and it is not  the

end.   After graduation, they are expected to get a good job,

get  married, buy a new HDB flat from the Government and have

babies.   After some years, property prices rise,  they  sell

the flat and use the capital appreciation as down-payment for

a  larger  flat,  and  so on and so on.   But  what  if  this

beautiful order gets shaken and goes out of sync?  Is there a

fall-back position?  Sir, we must create some flexibility  in

the system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In times like these, when jobs are in shortage and

acquiring the right skill set is a problem for some, we  have

to  step  in  to help those who are caught in a bind  by  the

sudden  change  in economic climate.  They  have  suffered  a

massive  cut in income and have no alternatives to  turn  to.

They  look  forward  to some help, some  breathing  space  to

regain  their  strides and start life anew.   Many  of  those

affected  are in their middle age, too old to start from  the

bottom, too young to retire and too weighed down by financial

commitments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are therefore disappointed with the Budget which

they  see as one that focuses on the problems of the  rich  - their tax bills and car prices.  With the 2% increase in  GST

and  income  tax reduction, the common grouse  is  that  this

Budget  is for the higher income group.  While the change  in

fiscal policy is for the good of the economy structurally and

in  the  longer run, how are we meeting the short and  medium

term problems the average wage earners face?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise three specific issues about this

Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Electronic Road Pricing. The sudden change in

car ownership cost



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>



places existing vehicle owners at a disadvantage.  The change

in  scheme benefits those who are buying new cars.   Existing

owners  with cars that are more than five years old suffer  a

drop  in the resale value of their cars because the price  of

COE  is  expected to drop with the increase in the number  of

COEs  and the drop in new car prices.  The expansion  of  the

ERP  scheme  will  hit  all vehicle drivers  alike,  but  the

existing  owners would not have the benefit  of  the  upfront

savings.   An expanded ERP will also place a heavy burden  on

the small time businessmen and the salesmen who have to be on

the road a lot of the time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the GST increase. The 2% increase in GST is

seen  as helping to balance the Budget after giving the  rich

taxpayers  their  tax savings.  While in absolute  terms  the

higher  income  group will pay more in GST  as  they  consume

more,  in  relative  terms, the indirect tax  is  regressive.

This  will widen the economic gap between the top and  bottom

tiers of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High tax rates can be a disincentive for people to work

hard.  But low tax rates can also give the higher end of  the

labour  supply  curve more disposable income,  and  this  may

result  in  people not wanting to work so hard.   After  all,

their needs are met and they might rather use their time  for

leisure pursuits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax cuts are important. But I share Dr Tan Cheng Bock's

concerns   that  we  should  also  focus  on   creating   the

opportunities  that encourage the rich to  invest  their  tax

savings  in  Singapore.   In the early  1980s  when  Margaret

Thatcher  cut  British personal tax drastically,  instead  of

investing  in local enterprises, high income British  earners

used their tax savings to buy their second home in Spain  and

south of France.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, dividends. Prudent companies generally only

distribute  10% to 20% of their annual profits as  dividends.

But  they pay tax at the corporate tax rate on 100% of  their

profits.  I therefore wonder why we should want to tax  those

who receive dividends, which represent only a small



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>



percentage  of total profit.  Can we make some  allowance  by

granting  tax credits for certain categories of people,  like

retirees  whose source of income is the dividends from  their

investments?   The returns on the investment  will  encourage

the  retirees  to  hold on to their investments  and  not  to

speculate by trading in stocks.  This will also encourage CPF

account  holders not to put all their money  in  housing  but

keep  some  for investment in equities.  Taxing dividends  at

the  corporate tax rate may also convince more  companies  to

have their domicile outside Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, favourable income tax alone is not sufficient to

attract  expatriates to relocate here.  Similarly,  tax  cuts

are  only  one of the measures to attract local  and  foreign

investments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must, first of all, have the conducive business

environment  and  opportunities  for  people  to  invest  in.

Security  and  stability are key considerations  for  foreign

investors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front page headlines of The Sunday Times of 28th

April  2002  stated: "Al-Qaeda `may set up base in South-east

Asia'".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I went to a constituency function that morning,

some residents were concerned that such headlines would cause

alarm  to prospective foreign investors.  They asked  whether

foreign  investors would be deterred from investing  in  this

region.  One of my grassroots leaders told me that he knew of

a  number  of  American MNCs who had decided to divert  their

investment  elsewhere  and others  who  had  decided  not  to

proceed  with  subsequent phases of their  planned  expansion

here because of perceived regional security issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope in the course of this debate and the Committee of

Supply,  we  would  have an update on how  we  are  doing  in

attracting  foreign  direct  investments  and  whether  those

foreign  investors  who  had committed  to  invest  here  had

deferred their investment plans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Singaporeans, both professional investment

analysts and ordinary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>



man-in-the-street, are disheartened that we  are  losing  out

while  Malaysians generally feel upbeat about their  economic

performance and prospects because they had scored a number of

successes against us recently.  We need success stories.   We

need  more of the likes of Creative Technology and  Sim  Wong

Hoo.   We  need  inspiring stories to boost  the  morale  and

spirit of Singaporeans that it is not all doom and gloom, and

that there are gems among us and we can do it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of months ago, I was introduced to an unknown

local  company that can be a real gem.  First of all, let  me

declare that I have no pecuniary interest whatsoever in  this

company.  This company, Stikfas, creates and makes toys.  And

this is "Alpha Male" - created, designed and manufactured  in

Singapore.  Within one month of launching their sales on  the

Internet,  that  was about four months ago, they  caught  the

attention of a major US toy multinational.  Even George Lucas

of  the  Star Wars series got to know about this toy and  its

Singaporean  creators because it is a system or  platform  of

toys  that would see no end in its potential line-ups.   What

makes it so special and creative is the ball and cavity joint

that  allows  for  many degrees of movement  that  would  see

endless  possibilities  in  terms  of  poseability.   The  US

experts  think this toy system can become a legend comparable

to Lego.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This toy was created in a typical garage-type start-up - in a shophouse in Katong off Mountbatten Road. The ground

floor is used as an animal shelter.  There were four dogs and

nine  cats  when  I last went there.  Take a  step  into  the

shophouse  and  the  smell of dog food and  animal  pooh  was

unmistakeable.  But when I ventured up the stairs, the  whole

of the second floor was a different world.  Stacked from wall

to  wall was a multitude of toys.  Thousands of them  of  all

varieties.  This is a four-person Singapore start-up, set  up

with the vision to create toys.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the "Alpha Male" and its potential, the US toy

multinational and toy fanatics all over the world were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>



astonished  to find a creative toy company in Singapore.   To

them,  the  toy universe comprised only of North America  and

Japan.   The  American  top executives  did  not  know  where

Singapore  was.  Singapore was not on their  map.   Yet,  the

creation  was so good and so enticing that they were prepared

to fly half way round the world to come here to meet and work

with our local chaps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Americans even offered to buy the Singaporean start-up. But the founders are staunch Singaporeans. Despite the

lure  of  millions  of dollars to sell their  company  and  a

golden  opportunity to move to the US to work  with  the  big

boys  and  their  hi-tech equipment,  these  Singaporean  toy

makers  firmly refused.  Relocation out of Singapore was  not

negotiable.  They are firmly rooted in Singapore for now.  Mr

Ban,  the founder, told me he would miss his laksa, char kway

teow and his friends too much.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this US multinational has secured a licence from

our  local start-up to jointly develop and market the toy and

its  derivatives worldwide.  This is something quite  unheard

of   -  that  a  Singapore  company  could  license  its  toy

technology  to  a  US MNC.  I guess we will  be  hearing  and

seeing  more  of  this  little guy.   But  more  importantly,

whether   through   remaking   Singapore,   whether   through

restructuring  our  economy, changes to  our  tax  system  or

financial  incentives,  we must create  a  society  that  can

produce, support and nurture winners like this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still many who believe in Singapore.

Adversity will drive us to seek out new frontiers.  We  still

have many gems, and there will be success stories coming from

among us.  We must not lose heart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the Budget Statement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

distinguishing  feature of this Budget is to  shift  the  tax

burden from the corporate profits and the higher



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>



income  people  to the ordinary citizens in  the  medium  and

lower  income groups.  Originally, the principle of  taxation

is   to  tax  according  to  the  company's  profit  and  the

individual's  income,  and  the  Government's  role   is   to

redistribute  the wealth through taxation.  If  reduction  in

corporate  tax  can  serve  to attract  foreign  investments,

thereby creating more jobs for Singaporeans or bringing  them

higher income, it is well and good.  But the question is when

the  investors decide whether or not to invest in a  country,

will the sole consideration be on the tax rate alone?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the Government says that because of a

reduction  in  corporate and personal income tax  rates,  the

Government  will run into deficit and therefore  we  have  to

shift  the  burden to the ordinary citizens.  This is  indeed

inconceivable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest beneficiary of this round of tax reduction

is   the  small  group  of   high  income  earners  and   the

consequence  is  that all Singaporeans will have  to  bear  a

heavier tax burden.  So is the Government looking after  this

small  group  of  rich high earners, or the interest  of  the

ordinary Singapore citizens?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, before this announcement, the maximum rate

in  personal  income  tax  has already  been  reduced  to  an

effective  rate  of  22.1% after  tax  rebate.   Why  is  the

Government  saying that the reduction in personal income  tax

will result in substantial loss to the Government and that it

has to raise the GST?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this Budget, it is apparent that there is no

necessity  for the Government to raise the GST in 2003.   The

Government  says  that  by  raising  the  GST  to  5%,  their

estimated  revenue  loss  will  be  $1.3  billion.   But  the

Economic  Restructuring  Shares (ERS)  alone  will  cost  the

Government  $1.2  billion.   The  difference  is  only   $100

million.  Will the Government run into financial deficit just

because it collects $100 million less in tax?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister also said that by reducing the

personal income tax and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>



corporate tax to 22%, the Government will lose $1.32  billion

in  revenue.  In 2004, when it is further reduced by 2%, what

would  be  the  estimated loss?  And if we  reduce  only  the

corporate  tax by 2%, and not the personal income  tax,  what

would the Government's financial situation be?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government's Net Investment Income (NII) is

pushed up to the ceiling provided for under the Constitution,

and  if  our economy has improved, coupled with the increased

revenue  from  other  indirect  taxes,  would  it  still   be

necessary to raise the GST?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget Statement, the Finance Minister stated

that by reducing the ceiling of personal and corporate income

tax to 20%, the Government would lose some revenue, amounting

to  some 9% of its annual tax revenue.  What is the basis  on

which the decision is made that the GST must be adjusted  now

for  the  2004 Budget year?  Please tell us, if the corporate

tax is reduced to 20% in 2004, what would be the Government's

revenue loss? If the personal income tax is reduced to 20% in

2004, what would be the Government's loss in revenue?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, this reduction of corporate tax and income tax

to  20% is something that will happen only in the year  2004.

Why  are  we  starting to increase our GST in the year  2003?

Has the Government considered other means to obtain a balance

in  our  Budget or because the increase of GST  is  the  most

convenient and easiest method for the Government to  fill  up

its coffers immediately?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should review certain items of the Main

and Development Estimates, and explain to the people that  if

GST  is  not increased, the Government would not be  able  to

provide  these  services,  so that the  people  will  clearly

understand  why  it  is necessary for  the  GST  rate  to  be

increased.  For  example, this Budget decides  to  lower  the

vehicle  tax and road tax.  Is it really necessary  to  lower

these  taxes, causing revenue loss and thereby warranting  an

increase in GST?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Budget, the Government is giving double tax

reliefs to donations to charity.  Philanthropists who have  a

heart  to donate to charity will not withdraw their donations

just  because the Government is not giving them tax  reliefs.

If  by  not giving them the reliefs, the Government can avoid

raising  the  GST, then the philanthropists will surely  feel

that  their  donations  are  more  meaningful,  because  such

donations  will  benefit not only certain organisations,  but

all the people of Singapore.  They will be very happy indeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the upgrading of HDB flats, the Government has set

aside  some $300 million for this upgrading programme.  Since

the  Government says that there will be a budget deficit  and

therefore  it  needs to raise the GST, does it mean  that  by

carrying  on with the upgrading programme, it will  make  the

increase   in   GST  inevitable?   Hitherto,  the   impending

upgrading  projects  would cost some $5.8  billion.  Can  the

people  have  a choice as to whether they want  upgrading  or

GST?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Finance Minister announced the GST increase, he

also  announced  an  offset package.  The  media  immediately

followed  up and publicised vigorously how this package  will

benefit  the  people.  But the feedback I received  from  the

people is that the Government is giving you a piece of candy,

and  in return it is going to cut a piece of flesh from  your

body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also announced the establishment of a

Committee to Combat Profiteering. Let me tell the Government,

at  the  moment, the small-time businessmen and  hawkers  are

faced   with   the   predicament  of  bad  business,   strong

competition  and  high operating cost. They  should  consider

themselves  lucky if they can just survive.  How  would  they

dare  to  raise  their prices and profiteer  in  the  present

circumstances?    I think most of them would probably  absorb

the  additional cost after the GST increase, and swallow  all

their miseries in silence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is most ridiculous to blame the small-time

businessmen  and hawkers for raising the prices!  Is  it  not

because the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>



Government  has raised the GST first? If you say  the  small-time  businessmen and hawkers are profiteers,  then  the  PAP

Government, which raises the GST, must surely be the  biggest

profiteer - the main culprit!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the revenue for the financial year 2001, we can see

that  even without reducing our corporate and personal income

tax  rates,  the  Government's tax revenue had  already  been

reduced  by $2 billion. As for the GST, even if the tax  rate

is  not increased, the Government's tax revenue could only be

$550  million  less.   Apparently, at the  time  of  economic

downturn, the corporate and personal income tax would greatly

affect  the  Government's revenue. On  the  other  hand,  the

Government's revenue from GST will not necessarily be slashed

substantially because of the economic downturn.  GST  is  the

Government's  magic  wand  to  generate  financial   surplus.

Whether  the economy is good or bad, you have to pay GST  for

your  food,  clothing, transportation, accommodation  and  so

forth. The Government could just sit idle and enjoy the fruit

of  other  people's labour, with a guaranteed stable revenue.

This  is indeed the real reason for the Government's decision

to increase the GST!



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you for allowing me to take part in the debate on the Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the very beginning, I had the same concern as Mr Low

Thia  Khiang  in  thinking that the Budget was  diverting  or

shifting the burden of tax from a small group of companies to

the general public.  But after further analysis and study  of

the  Budget, I am convinced that this is not the case. If  we

do  not  want the general public to bear the cost of GST  and

make  the necessary changes to our economy, then we will  not

be  able  to  attract  foreign investors to  Singapore.  That

means,  no  additional jobs will be created for  our  people.

Many  people  will stay unemployed and have no income.   They

will have no money to spend, and hence no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>



GST  to pay. That being the case, 3%, 5% or 0% GST will  make

no difference to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang's farfetched thinking that the higher

cost  of  living is the result of GST is far too  simplistic.

Many people like to say, "Look, 30 years ago,  I paid only 30

cents  for  a  plate of char kuay teow."  But now,  the  same

plate of char kuay teow costs $3.  You may say that the price

has gone up ten-fold. But, is that the whole truth?  The fact

is,  it  is not so simple.  Thirty years ago, when I  was  10

years  old,  my father's monthly income was only $100.   Now,

the average family income, if you take the median income,  is

about $3,600.  So the standard of living has gone up, so have

prices of goods.  This is a general phenomenon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as we restructure to face the

challenges  of globalisation and  a knowledge-based  economy,

we have to make a lot of adjustments and restructuring.  Many

times,  we  have  to  make bold changes  in  many  areas,  in

taxation, in employment practice, CPF scheme, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, changes always bring uncertainties. Uncertainties

cause  anxiety,  and  there will be resistance.  As  a  small

country  with  many limitations, we have to  be  resolute  in

making  and accepting tough decisions and move on if we  want

to  survive  and  be successful.  We need to  anticipate  and

prepare  ourselves  for  any possible  social  and  political

consequences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digital divide would bring about the economic divide

between those who make it in the new economy and those who do

not. Consequently, the income gap would also be enhanced.  If

the Government is unable to effectively redistribute some  of

the wealth to cater for the needs of those who could not make

it,  there  is  this  possibility that a social  divide  will

appear.  Eventually, we may face political  divide  when  the

socially  disadvantaged begin to harbour the impression  that

they  are  not  being taken care of.  I am sure nobody  would

want to see this happening in Singapore. .



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the threat of widening wealth

inequality is real. I recently read



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>



this  article in the Harvard Business Review which  explained

the  Network  Model of economies. I am no economist.   But  I

understand that this is a mathematical model proposed by Jean-Philippe  Bouchaud  and Marc Mezard from  the  University  of

Paris. The model can track the degree of inequality of wealth

distribution   and   shows  how  the  distribution   can   be

influenced. Specifically, the two researchers found that  the

greater  the volume of money flowing through the economy  and

the more often it changes hands, the greater the equality  of

wealth distribution. Conversely, the more volatile investment

returns are, the richer the rich tend to get.  The example of

the  United  States was quoted in the article. In the  United

States,  the  1980s and 1990s were dominated by  free  market

ideology and government deregulation, much of it defended  by

the  idea  that  wealth  would  trickle  down  to  the  poor.

Everything was done to encourage investment activity  of  all

kinds,  regardless of risks involved.  Did the wealth trickle

down?  No, wealth distribution in the United States today  is

significantly  less  equitable than  it  was  30  years  ago.

Wealth  is  more  concentrated than it  is  in  the  European

nations.  The  article explains this phenomenon  stating,  "A

dramatic  increase  in  investment  activity,  unmatched   by

measures to boost the flow of funds between people, ought  to

lead to an increase in wealth inequality."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article also mentions the effects of income tax,

capital  gains tax and sales tax. According to  the  article,

both  income tax and capital gains tax reduce differences  in

wealth   by   redistribution  and  discouraging   speculation

respectively.  On  the  other hand,  sales  tax,  even  those

targetted  at  luxury goods, might exaggerate differences  in

wealth  by dampening purchasing power and encouraging  people

to invest more of their money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in this Budget, the proposal to give double tax

reliefs   to   donations  to   charitable  organisations   is

commendable. I must declare my interest as I am working for a

charitable  organisation. I would suggest that the Government

should take a bolder step to give double tax reliefs even  to

those who donated with-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>



out  naming opportunities. We should welcome individuals  and

organisations who want buildings/rooms/facilities to be named

after them. We could publicise these donations and make  good

examples  of  all those buildings and facilities to  showcase

how  many  people  benefit from such good deeds.  This  would

promote  the  value system and culture that  would  hopefully

produce more philanthropists like the late Mr Tan Kah Kee and

the late Mr Lee Kong Chian.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For donations enjoying double tax relief, the Government

actually bears about 40 cents of every dollar donated because

of   the   tax   incentives.   However,   voluntary   welfare

organisations  (VWOs)  also receive  substantial  amounts  of

donations  from  members of the public  who  are  not  paying

taxes.  The  Government  should consider  providing  matching

grants to VWOs on every dollar they raise from these non-tax-payers, in the spirit of double tax relief.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we cannot create a more caring society just

depending  on  tax  relief  alone.   We  should  continue  to

cultivate  the  public-spiritedness  and  community   bonding

through   education  and  involvement  of  people.  Community

involvement  programmes  (CIPs)  in  the  schools  are   good

starting   points.  However,  CIPs  should   be   made   more

interesting and motivating. Students should not  be  made  to

feel "compelled" into doing these good deeds. CIP initiatives

should  come  from  students  and  not  pre-arranged  by  the

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we can also encourage the charitable

organisations and  grassroots organisations to jointly launch

community  services  and  voluntary work.  For  example,  our

hospitals  and  the Northwest CDC jointly run  a  domiciliary

service  that provides medical and nursing care to the  home-bound  patients. This programme has a special  feature,  that

is,  we  are  able to make use of the network  of  grassroots

organisations to help those families which are  genuinely  in

need.   At  the  same  time,   we are able  to  recruit  more

volunteers, give them the training and allow them to go  back

to their own community to serve.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has provided certain

reliefs as a means of redistribution of wealth.  Just now, Mr

Low  Thia  Khiang  said that while giving away  the  Economic

Restructuring Shares, it gives away more than $1 billion with

one hand and takes back the money through GST with the other.

But,  by this kind of relief to redistribute wealth to  those

who  are  in need, these families would  have the  money   to

spend  on  things  they  need, and the  money  would  be  re-channelled into the economic system to stimulate the economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, in order to meet the

challenges,  we  must take bold steps to propel  our  economy

into  new  heights.  However, we should always be mindful  of

our fellow citizens who may fall out along the way and extend

a  helping  hand to them. Let us build up our social  capital

while we accumulate the economic wealth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I support the Budget.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Budget tabled by Deputy Prime Minister  Lee

is  a Budget that has taken cognizance of the world situation

and  is in keeping with it.  The world situation is different

now,  therefore we have to restructure our economy to  create

more  jobs.  This statement seems to be simple when one hears

it.   The  trouble is that the Government is forward-looking,

and  the  people  look but cannot see.  Many  people  do  not

understand.   After hearing the whole Budget  Statement,  the

immediate  thing that strikes them is that the  GST  rate  is

going  to be increased.  They would also like to know whether

the  relief package would be adequate to cope with the rising

cost  of  living.   The  review  on  CPF  will  affect  their

financial  commitment.   They  are  also  afraid   that   the

unscrupulous businessmen would jack up their prices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, undue worries coupled with suspicions will lead

to  divisiveness.   As  the Member for Hougang  alleged,  the

Government is giving you a piece of candy and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>



then  cut  out a piece of flesh from your body.   People  are

shocked  to  hear  that the GST will be  increased.   So  the

Government has to give them some kind of tranquiliser to calm

them  down.   The extra 2% in GST may pain you.  The  Teochew

people would say, ba tia (meaning pain in the flesh). But the

Opposition  Member  has  exaggerated  by  saying   that   the

Government will cut a piece of flesh from you.  You may  feel

some pain on your flesh, but no flesh will be cut out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the world is indeed changing and

changing very fast.  But for people who are preoccupied  with

earning  a  living, they have heard a lot  but  they  do  not

understand.  If a Member of Parliament like Mr Low  does  not

understand,  how  do  we  expect  the  ordinary   people   to

understand?  They may be confused by what they have heard and

misunderstood  it.  The  world  is  changing  very  fast  and

becoming  very  sophisticated.  It is  too  complex  for  the

people  to  understand.   Therefore,  we  should  avail  this

opportunity to explain to the Singapore people why we need to

adapt to the changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for people who have lost their jobs or

people  who  are likely to lose their jobs in the process  of

economic restructuring, they know that they are facing a  new

world. What worries them is that they will not be able to get

an  alternative job.  For the older Singaporeans,  they  feel

that  they have become useless.  In the past, people used  to

say, "having an old person at home is like having a piece  of

treasure".  Now with an old person in a family seems to imply

having  more  worries and trouble. Why?  Because  you  cannot

find a job.  When you go home, nobody bothers to greet you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An arduous statement made by the Government is that we

must   change  our  mindset.   This  statement  is  easy   to

understand  but  how are we going to do  that?   How  can  we

change our mindset?  Changing one's mindset takes time and it

cannot  be done in a hurry.  And it has to involve a  lot  of

people  -  individuals  have  to change,  employers  have  to

change,  Members  of Parliament have to change.   The  change

will bring a lot of impact.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>



Every MP has a responsibility to explain to the people.  I am

pleased to see DPM Lee at the TV forum last night, explaining

the  need for economic restructuring.  What is noteworthy  is

that he even invited a taxi-driver to take part in the forum.

DPM  Lee saw it fit to invite ordinary people to a TV  forum.

This  is an indication that the Government is pro-people  and

is  reaching  out  to  the  people.  Other  Ministers  should

emulate  this and try their best to explain the rationale  of

the Government's policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When times are good, we like to compare. We try to

compare  our  houses, our cars, our children.  But  when  the

economy   plummets,  people  become  calculative.   At   this

juncture, we are surfing troubled waters in the same boat. We

should  help  each  other.    We should  be  united  to  face

external  threats.  This is what we call the  "big  picture".

We  have become a nation where everyone is calculative, worry

about  petty  issues and we suspect that all businessmen  are

trying  to  make profits. If a hawker reduces the  number  of

fish-balls  in a bowl of noodle from four to three,  or  from

four  big  fish-balls to four small fish-balls, can  that  be

said to be profiteering?  If there are such hawkers, the best

thing  to  do is not to patronise them.  Boycott them.  There

are many other stalls where we can go to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Singaporeans are too straightforward. They do

not  know how to negotiate a bend.  They do not know  how  to

adjust themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, our colleague talked about the high cost of

living  and escalating business cost.  When NTUC set  up  the

Fairprice  supermarkets, one of the objectives  is  to  bring

down  commodity prices.  Give the people more  choices.   For

example,  you  want to buy a bottle of soft drink,  go  to  a

provision shop, you pay 50 cents for it. If you go to an air-conditioned  supermarket, you pay 60 cents. If you  go  to  a

convenience  shop  at the corner of your block,  you  pay  80

cents  for it. If you go to a coffeeshop, you pay $1 (with  a

glass  of ice).  If you go to a coffeehouse, you pay  $3  for

the  same  bottle of drink.  But, if you go to a hotel  or  a

high-class cafe, you pay $5 or more. You put your neck on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>



chopping  board!  The point is that you have  a  choice,  you

have  the freedom to choose.  You can go to a provision  shop

or  go to a cafe to have your drink. And, if you really  want

to  save money, then go home and drink a glass of plain water

-  and  it is probably more healthy too!  The only thing  is,

can we continue to have a continuous water supply?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about water supply, this is a crucial issue. We

all  know  that  we  are faced with the difficulty  of  water

supply and we have suffered all kinds of humiliations.  So we

should go all the way to set up desalination plants and  work

on  this NEWater project. We should make sure that the nation

has  water.  The Government has been trying very hard to  get

water supply for us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, a Member mentioned that when he went to a

shop, he saw a few dogs and cats there.  I keep a rooster and

a  hen  in  my  house.   In  the morning,  the  rooster  will

faithfully cry, "koo-kair".  When the hen lays egg, it  would

cry,  "kok-kay, koo-kay".  This egg will hatch into a  chick.

"Koo-kay,  koo-kay" means nation in Teochew or  Hokkien.   My

mother commented that this hen is very intelligent. She knows

that  there must first be a kok (nation) before you can  have

the  kay  (family). Sir, at this present time of  difficulty,

what worries us most is not catching those merchants who  try

to  profiteer, but how to ensure that we have a nation and  a

family.



<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamed Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamed Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank  you  for allowing me to participate in this debate  on

the Budget Statement 2002.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the adjectives that has been used to

describe  the Budget is "bold". This reminds me of the  title

of a popular soap opera - "the bold and the beautiful".  I am

very  sure that the Budget also aims to beautify the economic

and social landscapes of Singapore - making it attractive for

foreign  investors  to set up their operations  here  and  to

ensure that Singaporeans have and keep their jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the main aspects of the Budget that has

attracted the attention of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans  is  the  increase  in  the  GST.   The  Finance

Minister,  in  his  Budget Statement,  has  assured  that  no

Singaporean will be worse off when the GST is increased.  The

package  of  goodies has been presented to  ensure  that  the

attempts  at beautifying our economic landscape will  not  be

marred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the Budget and its related cushions of

goodies  are aimed at preparing Singaporeans for a "different

world",  I  am not sure if Singaporeans are aware that  their

world  will be different, perhaps different from a  different

perspective.  The harsh realities of the economic crisis have

left many Singaporeans gasping for breath to stay alive, like

fish  out of water.  I am sure many Members of the House have

met  Singaporeans  coming  to see  them  to  appeal  for  one

instalment plan after another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not uncommon to see a family come to an MPS

session with a stack of bills that have not been paid,  often

over a period of at least three months, if not more, some  up

to a year.  They come to see us because they have either been

threatened with legal action or that their electricity, water

supplies  or  even  telephone lines may be disconnected.   To

many  average  Singaporeans,  going  to  court  is  indeed  a

frightful  thought, although I am sure many of my  colleagues

in  the legal profession will say that it is just in a  day's

work.   Worse  still,  the thought of having  their  supplies

disconnected is even more frightening to many of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the Budget aims to beautify our economic

complexion, I am afraid we have pockets of problems that will

continue to mar our complexion if we do not pay attention  to

them.  We need immediate attention.  The problem is here  and

now.   No amount of facelift in the future will help if their

current problems are not addressed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am speaking of a growing number of Singaporeans

who I have come across that are trapped in the current crisis

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>



will  continue to remain trapped unless something is done  to

assist  them.  These Singaporeans are facing severe financial

hardships. They are in arrears with Power Supply, SingTel and

other phone companies, HDB, Town Councils.  I do not have the

figures but I am sure that the relevant agencies will  concur

that  the  numbers are increasing.  They also  owe  financial

institutions  for unpaid renovation loans.   Some  also  have

arrears with schools for their children's school fees. It  is

also not uncommon for them to have arrears with hire purchase

companies.  Who are they?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been a social worker for the past 12 years.

The  above  used  to be the typical low-income  families  who

reside  in  rental  flats.  But we have  put  in  place  good

programmes to assist such families in rental flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the families that I am describing above are not

rental  flat dwellers. Indeed, there are no rental  flats  in

Admiralty division where I am responsible for. Sir, they  are

the  purchase flat dwellers who are slowly developing a sense

of  helplessness  as  they  attempt  to  overcome  what  they

perceive perhaps as insurmountable challenges.  Many  of  the

heads  of  households are victims of structural unemployment.

They  have  low education and limited skills.  Their  spouses

also  have  limited education and skills.  Some have  several

young  children,  often the reason given for  their  spouses'

inability to seek employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the world may indeed be different for them. It is

getting  bleaker and darker as the days go by  and  as  their

arrears  continue to accumulate and as they continue to  feel

drowned  by  the  mountain  of  unpaid  bills.   The   Budget

addresses  the  problem  that they  will  face  if  they  are

affected  by  the increase in GST and other  taxes.   Indeed,

they  will  be  affected.  But I am not sure  if  the  Budget

addresses the problems that they are facing today.  While  it

is  promised that they will not be worse off, can  we  ensure

that they can be better off at the same time?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Budget promises jobs and more jobs for

Singaporeans as we make our tax



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>



system  attractive  for foreign investors  to  set  up  their

operations here and to stay here.  But we have also been told

by  some  that  these jobs will not come until three  to  six

months  later, if not more.  In the meantime, the arrears  of

these  families  described above will  continue  to  increase

along with the interests and the threats of legal action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how have they been coping so far? Whatever they

earn  from  their part-time jobs or from financial assistance

are often used to pay one bill at a time.  Often they pay the

Town Council this month, the Power Supply the next month, and

telephone  bill  the following month.  In the  meantime,  the

arrears  accumulate when they do not settle  that  particular

month's  bill.   They  have to play this juggling  act  month

after month.  How else could they manage? Sir, the Budget may

be  bold but perhaps may not be as beautiful to the group  of

Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can be quick to point our fingers back at these

families.  We may say, "They have themselves to blame."  They

should  be  held  responsible  for  their  own  actions,  for

spending  beyond their means.  Now they have  to  accept  the

consequences of their actions.  Yes, what they did may not be

right.    Perhaps   they  were  merely  succumbing   to   the

aspirations  of urban modern living. Whatever  it  is,  their

problem  is  real and will continue to be a  problem  in  our

economic and social complexion if we do not address them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not advocating for more handouts for these

families.  Indeed they need to be held responsible.   Indeed,

I  think they want to be responsible.  But Sir, I think  they

are  at  their wits' end.  They probably feel trapped to  the

corner, gasping for air, perhaps hyperventilating. We can try

to  create  space  for  them to breathe  and  organise  their

thoughts. We can stop the creditors from harassing  them  and

giving  them  space  and  peace  of  mind  to  manage   their

challenges in a more systematic manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am recommending that the Government explore a

system  that  can  help these families negotiate  with  their

creditors the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>



settlement  of their accumulated arrears. We do not  have  to

give them handouts.  We merely need to assist in making their

problems more manageable for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I am proposing is the setting up of a system

that  is  akin  to the "debt consolidation" service  that  is

beginning  to gain prominence in the US.  This is  a  service

provided  by  a non-profit consumer counselling agency  which

will  consolidate the debts, contact the creditors and assist

in  negotiating  for  a  reduced interest  rate  and  monthly

payments.   The  person pays the monthly instalment  to  this

agency who will then settle the payments with the creditor on

his  behalf.   The  person  is  relieved  of  the  hassle  of

creditors  breathing down his neck and having  to  deal  with

potential  legal  actions.   Creditors  are  keen   on   this

programme  as  it ensures that they will at least  get  their

principal  sum  back rather than losing it  if  the  indebted

person files for bankruptcy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar agency of this nature can be set up here to

assist this group of individuals and families. The agency can

negotiate with the creditor to stop legal action against  the

indebted  person.  This is critical as often times the  legal

costs  are borne by the indebted person, making them perceive

the  problem  as even more insurmountable.  In light  of  the

current  emphasis to encourage philanthropy, these  creditors

could  also  be encouraged to lower their interest  rates  to

motivate and facilitate these individuals' ability to  settle

the debts.  We can prevent more bankruptcies from being filed

and we can help ensure mental health for these individuals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this scheme will create a sense of competence on

the  part  of  the  individuals as they try to  settle  their

problems  themselves.   They are merely  facilitated  by  the

assistance   of  the  debt  consolidators.  Indeed   we   are

empowering  them  to manage and be responsible,  albeit  some

level  of  supporting.  It  will  eliminate  their  sense  of

helplessness,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, financial problems have been found to create

strains  on marital and familial relationships. Many families

have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>



broken  due  to financial hardships. We need to  continue  to

strengthen  our  families  through  whatever  means  we  can.

Strong  families  produce strong and  productive  members  of

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we continue to promote strong families, we need

to acknowledge the significant roles that our women folk have

and  continue  to  play in and out of the families.   Here  I

would  like to lend my support to the call made by our  women

colleagues  yesterday  to  extend  medical  benefits  to  the

dependants of our female civil servants. Sir, the men,  often

known  as  the heads of households in our society, are  never

retrenchment-free or recession-proof.  Many have  lost  their

jobs  and  rely  on  their wives' income to  survive.   Their

dependants  should  not  be  deprived  of  medical  coverage.

Indeed,  extending  the  medical benefits  to  dependants  of

female   civil  servants  reflects  a  recognition   of   the

increasing shared roles and responsibilities between men  and

women  in  our  families.   On the  same  note,  may  I  also

recommend  that the child sick leave enjoyed by female  civil

servants be then extended to male civil servants too.   I  am

sure  these are good ingredients for more babies to be  born,

apart from the natural order of things, but I shall elaborate

more on it during the debate in the Committee of Supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the above proportion assumes that the person has an

income  to make the monthly payment to the debt consolidator.

The  challenge  is for him to also ensure  that  he  has  the

necessary  skills  and  knowledge that  will  assist  him  in

securing a job.  I am pleased to note that emphasis has  been

placed  on the development of human resources.  Sir, part  of

this  development  is  the  need to  shift  the  mindsets  of

Singaporeans,   as   mentioned   by   several   parliamentary

colleagues - to survive in a different world, we need  to  be

nimble, adaptive, determined, and most of all, resilient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the change in mindset needed is more critical for

the  Malay/Muslim community.  It has been reported  that  the

Malay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>



workers   were  hardest  hit  during  the  recent  spate   of

retrenchments as many have low level skills and are not quite

enough  to  re-skill themselves. For the Muslim community  to

ensure  that it succeeds in the new and different  world,  we

must  embrace the vision of a community of excellence charted

by the new Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two meanings to the verb "to excel".

One,  to  excel is to be exceptionally good.  Two,  to  excel

oneself  is  to  do  better  than  ever  before.   The  first

definition is abstract and not easily measurable.  The second

definition suggest something that is more operationable.   To

do  better  than  before allows us to use a  more  measurable

indicator  of what it means to excel.  Using this  definition

then  means  that to strive towards excellence is an  ongoing

process and we excel each time we perform better than all the

previous  attempts  we  have  undertaken.   In  this   sense,

excellence  is  an  infinite point  in  that  process.   This

definition is indeed useful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to build a community of excellence, each member of

the  community must recognise that he or she plays a critical

role.   The  most  micro of the role is to do  your  best  in

whatever  you  do.  I am reminded of the motto of  my  former

secondary  school  -  "From  each  his  best"  and  for   the

Malay/Muslim  community, I would want  to  add  "and  nothing

less".   A community of excellence is one that comprises  not

only  of  individuals  but  of  families,  organisations  and

businesses  of  excellence.  Each  of  these  levels  of  the

community  must espouse a similar set of values -  importance

of    seeking   and  creating  knowledge,   hard   work   and

determination, and commitment to do one's best.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has prided itself with being number one in

many areas, the best airport, the best sea port, etc.  I urge

the  Malay/Muslim community to work together with  the  Malay

political   leadership  and  the  Government  to   make   the

Malay/Muslim community the best one in the region and in  the

world. We should focus our energies on the education of our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>



young to ensure a new generation of educated individuals  who

will  excel in the new world.  We need to help those who  are

disadvantaged and give their children a headstart.  Our young

must  have  an  excellent grasp of English,  Mathematics  and

Science  as  early as possible, to ensure a strong foundation

for  them  to excel.  The Budget is set to invest heavily  on

such social and human capital.  The community must capitalise

on this opportunity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to ensure that our workers can fit well into the

jobs  of the new economy.  We need to send a message that  it

is never too late to learn.  It is never too late to succeed.

It is never too late to excel.  Indeed access and acquisition

of  knowledge  are  key ingredients for success  in  the  new

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malay/Muslim community as well as the other

communities  have their respective roles in  contributing  to

the efforts of beautifying the economic and social complexion

of  Singapore.  The ingredients for a lasting face-lift  have

been  gathered.  We need to blend these ingredients  well  to

ensure  that  our  complexion  remains  smooth  and  radiant,

thereby  attracting potential suitors from all over.   Indeed

we  have  been bold in the measures introduced in the Budget.

Let us ensure that we are also beautiful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, do I have your permission to

clarify  the  point on my speech referred to by Mr  Seng  Han

Thong, Member for Ang Mo Kio?



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in

my  speech  I  talked  about the small-time  businessmen  and

hawkers  who  are  struggling for  survival.   Who  dares  to

profiteer  at  this  moment?  I think all  these  small  time

businessmen will have to swallow their misery in silence.   I

do  not know whether Mr Seng could not understand me or  that

he  is  distorting the meaning of my speech.  If you want  to

catch the culprit for price hike, I think the biggest culprit

is the Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  would  like  to thank you first for  giving  me  the

opportunity to take part in the debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance

announced that the important change in Budget 2002 is to  cut

down on corporate tax and personal income tax so as to create

more  job  opportunities for Singapore, and for Singapore  to

continue to prosper.  To balance the Budget, he accepted  the

Economic Review Committee's recommendation to raise the Goods

and Services Tax (GST) by 2%.  At the same time, in order  to

cushion the impact of GST increase there is an offset package

to help the low income families to lighten their burden.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at a time when the economic prospects

of the world are not certain, the Government has accepted the

recommendations   of   the  ERC  to  make   a   comprehensive

restructuring of our tax system to help the poor families  or

lower income families to offset the effect of the increase in

GST.   This  shows  that the Government  and  the  people  of

Singapore  are also cooperating in recreating Singapore.   So

it  also  lays  emphasis  to say that  in  time  of  economic

difficulty  the  people and the Government will  continue  to

cooperate and make the necessary preparations for our  future

take-off and prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that this year' Budget is generally

supported  by  the people.  The people here  appreciate  that

this  is necessary.  The Government has done its best to  lay

down the foundation and measures to rebuild our economy.   In

this  year's  Budget,  there are  only  three  types  of  tax

increases.  First, GST to be raised from 3% to 5%,  secondly,

the  tobacco  and liquor taxes will go up, and  thirdly,  the

parking  fees  would be increased.  In order  to  offset  the

impact of all these increases, there will be certain measures

to  help  the  people to ensure that most families  will  not

suffer under the increase of the GST.  These packages include

(1)  lowering  personal  income tax and  corporate  tax,  (2)

giving SC&CC rebate for HDB dwellers for five years, and  (3)

cutting down road



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>



tax  and  vehicle  registration fees.  In addition,  parents'

relief  will be more generous.  Rebates for foreign  workers'

levy will be extended and Economic Restructuring Shares (ERS)

will be distributed to all adult citizens of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when we look through the entire Budget,

we  all feel very relieved because the 2% increase in GST has

also   been  offset  by  other  measures  and  the   Economic

Restructuring Shares given to us could be used to offset  the

increase  in  GST, if necessary.  But the people  in  general

also   fear   that  the  increase  in  GST  will    cause   a

consequential  increase  in the prices  of  goods.   This  is

possible.    Soon  after  the  proposed  GST   increase   was

announced, the television station interviewed some   ordinary

citizens.  A hawker who was interviewed was asked whether  he

would  sell his wares at higher prices.  He promptly  replied

"Yes, of course!"  "By how much would you increase?"  "I used

to  sell  a bowl of noodle for $2.50. Now it will be  $3.00".

So  there is an increase of 50 cents.  The increase  is  20%,

and not 2%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government knows the problem. A Committee under the

chairmanship  of  Mr Chan Soo Sen has been formed  to  combat

profiteering  to  ensure that prices will  not  be  increased

without  a  good reason.  So if anyone is to come across  any

instance of such profiteering, he should feedback to Mr  Chan

Soo  Sen or to any Member of Parliament.  Let Mr Chan be  the

Justice  Bao of the new economy.  All you need to  do  is  to

fill  up a simple form and send it to Mr Chan Soo Sen.  I  am

very glad to see that Mr Chiam See Tong has been invited, and

he has accepted, to  join the Committee. Perhaps, Mr Low Thia

Khiang should also volunteer his services to the Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these measures are preventive in nature. We hope

that  the  hawkers  and merchants would  not  increase  their

prices  without  good reasons.  But we must  take  preventive

measures.    Prevention  is  better  than  cure.    So   this

prevention  by  appointing  the  Committee  to  act   against

profiteering   is  far-sightedness  on  the   part   of   the

Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another emphasis of the Budget is to be

pro-business, to lower income tax for the companies  and  the

individuals, to increase our competitiveness and  to  attract

foreign talents so as to create more jobs for Singaporeans. I

hope that this good news will turn into good opportunity.  In

the   21st  century,  competition  is  becoming  increasingly

intense.  With  the  opening up of the  China  market  better

opportunities are provided for investors to go to China.   So

in  attracting foreign investments to Singapore,  we  face  a

greater challenge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to overcome this difficulty, the Government has

made  a  lot  of  tax  restructuring to  provide  impetus  to

stimulate  the Singapore economy, to reshape Singapore  as  a

place  which  is  more attractive to foreign investors  whose

investment  would help to generate more jobs for our  people.

The people are now very concerned as to whether they are able

to  keep  their  jobs.  About 100,000 people  are   presently

unemployed,  and they are having difficulty getting   another

job.  I wonder if the Economic Review Committee (ERC) is able

to  come  up with some kind of  indicator as to how  many  of

these 100,000 people are being given job offers and what kind

of jobs are being offered to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 12th May 2002, a factory placed a job vacancy

advertisement in a morning newspaper.  Within 25  minutes  of

the  opening of its gates, some 400 people turned up to apply

for  the  200 vacancies. This is the report in Lianhe Zaobao.

From  this newspaper report, we can see that many people  are

unemployed.  There were only 200 jobs, and within 25  minutes

they  attracted  more  than  400 applicants.   That  is,  two

applicants  to  one job.  Those who are eventually  recruited

are like having struck a lottery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few months, the various CDCs and the

Ministry of Manpower have conducted a number of job fairs  to

help  the people look for jobs.  But the success rate is  not

encouraging.  Many who attended the fairs, particularly those

who are above the age of 40, would find that the jobs offered

at the fairs are not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>



suitable  for them.  Because at the job fairs, most employers

were  looking  at younger people or people who  are  computer

savvy.  These fairs do not seem to cater to the needs of  the

older job seekers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to understand the situation of unemployment,

the  CDCs  have  conducted a random  survey  of  about  1,200

interviewees  to  understand what kind of problems  they  are

facing,  what  kind of attempts they have made,  before  they

approach  the  CDC or MOM for assistance.  The  survey  shows

that  21.5%  of  the  job  seekers went  by  the  recruitment

advertisements   in  the  newspapers,  and   some   went   to

employment agencies, while some browsed the Internet.   About

13.7%  attended  job fairs.  Only 11% went to  MOM,  and  10%

approached   their  friends  for  help,  and  a  very   small

percentage  of 7% went to the CDCs. According to  the  survey

results,  we  feel that the CDCs and MOM can work  harder  to

provide better services to the unemployed people to help them

look for jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in this Budget for a changing world, I

would like to raise five points: One, the most important,  is

how can we help the 100,000 unemployed people  look for jobs.

I  suggest that we have a one-stop employment agency service.

We  must  first  have a national registration  of  unemployed

people.   Through more than 100 community clubs and community

centres  of the People's Association, we could  register  the

unemployed  people together with information  concerning  the

kind  of job  they want or desire to have.  Through this data

centre,  we  can re-channel the information to the  CDCs  for

reclassification.  For example, if a person wants to work  as

a  cleaner, he can go to the CDC and be matched up  with  the

cleaning  contractors  on  the  list,  and  arrange  for  the

relevant  training  to be provided.  Once  the  applicant  is

familiar with the job, I believe it will be easier for him to

secure  a  job.  Likewise, if a job seeker wants to become  a

driver,  arrangement can be made for him  to  be  trained  at

Comfort Taxi or SBS, or undergo some form of training through

the  relevant trade unions. In this way, he will acquire  the

necessary skills to prepare him for the job.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM can also seek the cooperation of all the factories,

companies and enterprises to report to the Ministry  any  job

vacancies available.   With this kind of information from the

CDCs  and MOM, we will be able to provide better job-matching

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second suggestion is that the Government provides

some  form  of   incentives for employment.  In  helping  the

unemployed  people  financially, the  Government  gives  $200

relief  a month.  For a period of three months, the total  is

about  $600.   This  kind  of financial  assistance  is  only

temporary  in  nature to help the unemployed people  maintain

their family.  Over the long term, the Government can set  up

some  kind  of  unemployment  incentives  for  companies   or

businesses to  employ the older workers, say, those  who  are

40-50 years old.  For example, give $100 a month to every 40-year-old  worker employed for a period of six  months.   With

this kind of incentive, companies will be attracted to employ

the older workers.  This will help to reduce our unemployment

rate.   It  will also help our workers to get  jobs  to  look

after  their  families.  Then they will  not  face  financial

hardship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third suggestion I would like to make is for some

kind  of rental rebates to be given to the JTC and HDB shops.

This  was also the suggestion of Mr Inderjit Singh.   At  the

moment, they can be given about 20% rental rebates, so as  to

lower  their  operating cost, and they will be  in  a  better

position  to  carry  out their business  and  tide  over  the

difficult  period.  They can even afford to lower the  prices

of  their merchandises and our people will not have to go all

the way across the Causeway to do their shopping.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point is that with effect from 1st September,

the monthly parking fees in the HDB estates will be increased

from $75 to $90, an increase of $15 per month.  The open  car

park  fees  will  be  increased by $15.   I  am  afraid  that

residents affected by the SERS projects, these residents  who

used  to  park their cars in the surface car park and  paying

$55  per month will now have to park their cars in the multi-storey



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>



covered car park and will now be asked to pay $90 per  month,

an  increase of 35% per month, or $420 more per year. This is

a  very huge increase.  I hope the Government will give  them

special consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal income tax will be adjusted downwards over a

period  of  three years.  Similarly, the increase in  parking

fees should also be spread over three years.  Then there will

be a balanced way of treating two different groups of people.

This  will  be one good way to help our people, so that  they

will  not  suddenly be faced with a huge increase in  parking

fees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the rebates for public utilities, there is no mention

on  this  issue.  I have been asked by many residents whether

the  Minister for Finance has forgotten about the rebates for

utilities.   Over the past few years, there is some  kind  of

utilities  rebates announced every year.   It  will  be  very

helpful to the poor and low-income families.  They hope  that

the  Government will consider re-introducing the rebates  for

public utilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I seek

clarification on Mr Low Thia Khiang's speech?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand every word

of Mr Low Thia Khiang in Mandarin.  I know the meaning.  What

I  was  saying  is that when the Government was restructuring

the  economy,  the  Government is forward-looking,  but  many

people  cannot  see it.  So, when he said the  Government  is

cutting  one  big  piece  of flesh from  the  people  and  is

therefore  the biggest profiteer, I sought clarification  and

expressed concern that in the end, you would start suspecting

also among the hawkers who among them are profiteering.   So,

I  hope he also understands my Mandarin.  What I said is that

during these difficult times, we should not start pointing at

people and say that he is profiteering.  What we should do is

to understand the long term objectives of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>



the Budget and place nation (Koa) before family (Kia).

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir,

for allowing me to join in this debate.  I would like to take

this  opportunity to congratulate the Deputy  Prime  Minister

and  Finance Minister for his maiden Budget Statement.  There

are  several  proposals that I support.  However,  there  are

also some concerns that I would like to take this opportunity

to raise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, like several other MPs yesterday, I want to talk

about  the  impact  of  the GST on the poor  and  the  ageing

Singaporean workers.  Second, I disagree with cuts in the top

marginal  personal  income  tax  as  a  means  for  promoting

business.  Third, the corporate tax cut is not bold enough to

increase  Singapore's competitiveness.  Fourth, as  Singapore

moves  towards  greater  indirect taxation,  the  anticipated

impact  of  future GST increases should warrant exemption  of

essential  goods and services from this tax.   Last  but  not

least,  I support Prof. Chin's call on the Government to  use

the  funds  collected from the additional COEs  to  help  HDB

cover its car park building cost.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I study the impact in detail, I become more and more

convinced  that  these Budget changes and the recommendations

of the ERC are from the rich, by the rich and for the rich  - to  make  the  rich even richer.  The income gap between  the

talented and the workers is going to widen drastically.  More

has  to  be  done  to  help the poor, the unskilled  and  the

untalented  to cope with this rising wealth gap.   Otherwise,

in our effort to rebuild our economy, the social cohesion and

fabric  of our society will risk being threatened and crumble

in the long run, leading to detrimental results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite certain that after the five years of offset

measures, the lower income and the ageing workers will become

poorer, especially for the ageing workers who had been paying

taxes  in  their  younger days.  Over the last  30  years  of

nation  building, they had contributed in their own  ways  to

help build Singapore into this developed society.  They,  the

older  workers,  are  retiring soon, or  some  of  them  have

already  retired.   But they are going to  continue  to  face

paying  GST  right up to their deathbeds and even into  their

coffins.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not right. The Government should look into how

it  can  waive the GST completely for the retirees and senior

citizens.   They have done their share of duty to  serve  the

country.   We should recognise their contribution and  exempt

them  from  this  tax  burden in their twilight  years.   The

Government may have recognised this problem and adjusted  the

pension allowance for retired civil servants.  But how  about

many  other retirees and blue collar workers from the private

sector?  I believe the Government can do a lot more for  this

generation  of nation building senior citizens not  from  the

civil service too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, coming to cuts in top-end personal income tax to

20%, I do not think that this is a useful move.  The Minister

had  argued for a significant reduction as a means to attract

international  talents to work in Singapore and  help  create

more  jobs.  Is that equation really that simple?  I  do  not

think so.  I believe that talented



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>



high-income earners will not just flock to Singapore  because

of  the  lower individual tax rate.  In any way, 20%  is  not

attractive enough compared to other countries like Hong Kong.

They  will  consider  the total package.   Factors  like  pay

compensations, a more conducive living environment,  cultural

adaptations  and other examples of cost of living,  like  car

ownerships, will play a bigger consideration than simple  tax

cuts.  If they have to spend more of what they earn by paying

more  indirect  taxes,  like higher liquor  charges  and  car

costs,  then they will not be interested to come to Singapore

in  the first place.  These talents are not stupid.  It  does

not  make  sense  for them to save on direct personal  income

taxes but pay a bomb to own a branded car or a pigeon hole in

the sky.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxes are taxes, direct or indirect, it is cash outflow

from  the  individual to the Government - be it  income  tax,

GST,  ERP,  COEs  or fees, it still adds to the  Government's

coffers.   Therefore, we need more than personal  income  tax

cuts  to  encourage  talents here to help spur  our  economic

activity and entrepreneurship.  If the Government is  genuine

in   wanting   to  encourage  entrepreneurship  through   tax

reductions, then it should consider waiving the tax liability

of  start-up business persons in the initial few years  until

their  business  is  more stable and  profitable.   A  larger

"entrepreneurship  income tax relief" can  be  introduced  to

help  start-up  smaller businessmen.  It will  definitely  be

more   helpful  than  the  top-end  cut  of  6%  for  already

successful  high income earners.  Any tax waivers or  rebates

given to a new start-up business person will definitely  help

to plough back to help their business grow more and survive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many entrepreneurs just starting out can make

disposable income of more than $320,000 a year to qualify for

the  6%  cut in personal income tax?  Not many!  I personally

do  not  know of any.  Maybe the Government can give us  some

examples of which entrepreneur has achieved this.  This  will

help    more   Singaporeans   to   emulate   their   success.

Incidentally, not all high income earners are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>



entrepreneurs.  Many in Singapore happen to be working in the

Government service.  It is clear that they will be one of the

greatest beneficiaries of this tax cut.  They earn very  high

income with zero risk of business failure attached.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the private sector, I wholly support the cut in

the  corporate  income tax.  However, I feel  that  this  ERC

proposal  is not bold enough.  If countries like Germany,  as

cited, can reduce its corporate income tax from 40% to 25% in

one  year, we can do better than the miserable 4.5% cut  over

two  years.   We  can  be a lot bolder in  cutting  corporate

income  tax  to  keep  us ahead of the competition.   When  a

company  has  more  retained profits, it will  be  bolder  in

employing more people, thus helping to create more  jobs  and

helping  the  economy. If foreign companies  intend  to  take

advantage   of  this  lower  tax  benefit  and  relocate   to

Singapore,  their employees will have no choice but  to  move

here  too  or they will face retrenchment back home in  their

country.   There  is no need for us to cut the  top  marginal

personal  income tax rate just to attract these companies  to

come over here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should save on cutting top marginal

personal  income  tax  for  the  rich.   By  doing  so,   the

Government  will save $620 million every year.   This  saving

can  be  used  to  offset  a bigger and  bolder  cut  in  the

corporate tax rate than the 2.5% recommended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now move on to talk about GST.

Many  speakers  here  have talked about the  effects  of  the

increase  in  the  GST  rate and  have  asked  to  delay  its

implementation.   There  is also a  suggestion  that  certain

items  be  exempted from GST.  The Government  has  said  no.

Like   many  Singaporeans,  I  do  not  understand  why   the

Government  is so unwilling to exempt essential staples  from

GST.   If  the Minister finds it so difficult to decide  what

items to exempt from GST, be it sushi, fish or rice, then may

I suggest that the Ministry of Finance send an investigative



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>



delegation  to other developed countries with GST  exemptions

on  these  essential goods and services and study  how  these

countries do it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these countries and some states like California in

the  USA can have a system where certain essential goods like

rice,  oil,  sugar,  salt, meat, vegetables,  fish,  etc,  or

services  can be exempted from GST, I do not see what  is  so

difficult about implementing it in Singapore.  Where there is

a  will,  there  is  sure  to be a  way,  unless  it  is  the

Government's intention to raise as much revenue  as  possible

from GST.  If so, I have nothing to say.  If not, I will give

one  very  good reason why these essential goods and services

should be exempted from GST.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the GST rate stands at 3%. Come January, it

will  be increased to 5%.  Five years later, maybe after  the

next general election, it may again be raised, perhaps to 7%,

9% or even 12%.  I do not know how much higher it can go, but

I  am very certain that every percentage increase is going to

affect everyone, but more so for the lower income, the  poor,

the unemployed and the retired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When GST is all-encompassing and raised even higher, it

is  going  to  make  living in Singapore more  miserable  and

create greater social inequality, resulting in resentment  to

Government institutions.  Citizens need to eat and  drink  to

live  and survive.  It will become unbearable for less  well-off  citizens  just continuing to eke out an existence  here.

Their  lives  will become more miserable as  they  have  less

purchasing power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the trend, I am quite certain that there are

going  to  be more cuts in the personal income and  corporate

tax  rates in the future.  To make up for this revenue  loss,

it  is certain that the Government is going to raise GST even

higher.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So before this GST is increased to 5%, 7%, 9% or even

higher  in  future, I hope the Government can plan ahead  and

institute  a system to exempt certain essential staple  items

from GST.  Do not wait until there is great social discontent

to do it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once such a system is institutionalised, any future

increase  in  GST to a very high level will not cause  severe

hardship  and political ramifications.  Those who  find  that

the  tax on sushi is too high can still opt to buy plain rice

and fish, with the option of not going hungry just to save on

GST.   The  freedom  of  choice is there  and  this  is  very

important.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as we progress into this developed

world,  let us work together towards a kinder and more caring

society.   Let  us  not subject our lower and  middle  income

citizens  and  our aging community to more stress,  hardships

and taxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At my Party constituency walkabout in Jurong West two

Sundays  ago,  I spoke to a senior citizen who  said  to  me,

"Given a choice, I would rather return all the ERS shares and

rebates to the Government if I have the option to be exempted

from  GST.  These rebates and grants are short-term  measures

to  ease our pain, but GST is going to stay with me till I go

to  my grave.  I would rather not have it.  I paid taxes when

I  was  young  and  working.  Now I am  old,  unemployed  and

waiting  to  die,  and I still have to pay  taxes.   This  is

unfair."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the Deputy Prime Minister and

Finance Minister can take the words of this old man into  due

consideration and look into how retired senior  citizens  and

the lower income can be exempted from the effects of GST.   I

believe  that  the  most efficient and equitable  way  is  to

identify a list of these essential items and exclude it  from

tax.   If it is so easy for NTUC Fairprice to produce a  list

of  such  staple items and absorb the GST increase, I believe

the  Ministry of Finance can do a lot better than  a  blanket

no.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I want to talk about car usage and car

parking.   If we want to allow more Singaporeans to own  cars

but  encourage them to use it less often, then we  must  have

incentives to encourage them to keep it stationary,  ie,  not

to  drive  it.  Increasing car parking charges is  definitely

not an incentive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the car owners, whether it is money paid to HDB, URA,

LTA or the Ministry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>



of  Finance, it is still money going to the Government.   The

Government should consider the total revenue it collects from

cars  and  look  into subsidising some of  these  loss-making

departments  within  the  Ministry that  help  to  solve  and

regulate car usage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot expect every department in the Ministry to be

always  profitable.   There will always be  some  departments

that  cannot.   If every department in the Ministry  must  be

profitable,  if  HDB  has to build car parks  and  make  them

profitable or at least break even while other ministries make

a  lot  from  COE, then it can only mean one thing,  ie,  our

citizens  will  become poorer and poorer  through  all  these

taxes.   I  hope  the Government will not insist  that  every

Government service must be able to recover cost.



<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I do not have the fortune of Mr Seng Han Thong, who  can

keep  "kok kay" at home, but I do have eggs at home.  My fear

is  that  our economic restructuring package is like an  egg.

My  concern is that the Opposition Members of this House  are

trying  to have an omelette while the rest in the House  here

are  trying  to hatch a chicken so that, hopefully,  we  will

have more eggs for the days to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to share with you that there are

probably three types of people in this world.  The first type

of  people  make things happen, the second type watch  things

happen,  and  the  last type do not know what  is  happening.

And, Sir, I would like to suggest that perhaps today there is

a   fourth  type  of  people,  and  they  are  sitting  there

criticising everything that happens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to respond to

several comments made by our Opposition colleague, Mr Low, as

well  as  Mr  Steve Chia.  Mr Low has denied and  refused  to

acknowledge the compensation package that the Government  has

put in place.  He has criticised the Government's efforts  to

restructure  the economy.  He even criticised the  Government

for giving recognition to encourage philanthropy.  He



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>



also  said  that  we  should  not  reduce  the  cost  of  car

ownership.   I wonder whether Mr Low is therefore  suggesting

that we should restore the cost of car ownership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, restructuring is not without pain. There is a

Chinese saying, "liang yao ku kou li yu bing, zhong yan ni er

li  yu  xing".   I  wonder whether Mr Low  prefers  morphine,

painkillers, rather than cure for our economic ills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to turn to Mr Steve Chia. Mr Chia

has  mentioned five points in his speech:  GST for the  poor,

cut  in personal income tax, corporate tax cuts are not  bold

enough, GST increases should warrant certain exemptions,  and

that we should continue to subsidise car parks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to impact of GST on the poor, Mr Chia

has suggested that we should perhaps give special waivers for

retirees,  the lower income groups and for those  who  suffer

most, those who are poorer.  But Mr Chia, again like Mr  Low,

has  forgotten that we have a compensation package.  Mr  Chia

keeps  repeating that tax is tax, it is money from the people

to  the Government.  I would like to say that a package is  a

package, it is still money from the Government to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Chia also mentioned that cuts in personal

income   tax   are   not  effective  in  attracting   foreign

investments.  Granted that I do agree that cuts  in  personal

tax  alone  are  probably not enough to  attract  talents  to

Singapore,  but if we do not cut personal income tax  at  the

highest  end, Sir, no matter what we do, those higher  income

earners will think that Singapore is trying to cream off what

they have contributed and, therefore, it may not be enough on

its own, but it is still necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Mr Chia mentioned that our corporate tax is not

bold   enough,  suggesting  that  perhaps  we  should  reduce

corporate tax even further.  Yes, probably a further cut  may

be  even  more  effective in bringing in foreign  investments

but, if we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>



do so, we need to then increase GST.  So I wonder again if Mr

Chia  is  suggesting that we should review whether we  should

increase the GST even further in order to finance the further

cuts in corporate taxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, Mr Chia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Can I clarify something, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Are you giving way, Mr Gan?



<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Yes, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I said that

it  is not necessary to cut personal income tax.  This saving

could be used to cut corporate tax further, which would  give

us  an equal balance.  So I am not saying that we should  cut

more  of the corporate income tax and then increase the  GST.

The hon. Member will have to hear me more clearly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do hear Mr Chia

clearly, but I just said earlier that cutting personal income

tax  is  a  must,  if we are to attract foreign  talents  and

foreign high income earners and entrepreneurs to come to  our

country   and   to   retain  them  here.   Even   our   local

entrepreneurs will benefit from this.  Given this  point,  my

next  point will therefore be valid, that if we have  to  cut

personal  income tax and we still want to cut  corporate  tax

further,  then  there is no other choice but to  raise  taxes

from elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point that Mr Chia mentioned is that GST

increases  in  future  should  maybe  warrant  some  kind  of

exemption.   That  perhaps is an item for  the  Minister  for

Finance to consider, but my personal view is that there is  a

very  high  cost of policing exempt items.  Coming with  this

high cost would mean more resources would have to be put  in.

It  would  mean, again, more taxes to be collected.   At  the

same  time, giving exempt items would mean the collection  of

GST  overall must come down and, therefore, again, it implies

higher GST rates.  So again I am



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>



not sure whether Mr Chia is suggesting higher GST rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it would be far better for us to come

out  with  a  package to target at those in need rather  than

general  exempt items, because if we exempt sushi,  the  poor

eat  sushi; the rich also would eat sushi.  Similarly, if  we

exempt rice, the poor eat rice; so do the rich.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Chia said that we should continue to

subsidise car parks.  This is not an issue, whether we buy  a

car  to keep and not to drive it.  Mr Chia is entitled to buy

a  car  and keep it and not drive it, although we will wonder

why  he  would  bother to buy a car.  But, nevertheless,  the

issue on car parks is a matter of cost recovery.  If we  have

travelled to other parts of the world, we would realise  that

Singapore,  comparatively speaking, has one of  the  cheapest

car  park charges in the world.  And most of the cosmopolitan

cities  have very expensive car parks, and it is  often  that

you  find  that it is a lot cheaper to take a taxi, take  the

underground or take a bus, or most likely, just walk to where

you want to go.  Therefore, for this car park issue, it is  a

matter  of cost recovery, rather than compensation for  those

who  want  to buy cars and keep them at home without  driving

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having spent so much time addressing the issues of

our  Opposition Members, I have very little time left for  my

own speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I clarify?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I did not forget the offset package but I

would  like to state that the offset package is not  forever.

It  is a smokescreen that makes you feel good but eventually,

you  have to pay GST, but without the offset package.  I  did

not forget that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan talked about my objection to philanthropy and car

ownership.   I  did  not.  I have given this  and  others  as

examples  to  ask  whether or not we  should  consider  other

options  rather  than just raising GST as an  easy  way  out.

Raising GST would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>



affect  the majority of the people, especially the lower  and

middle-lower income.  When a Government decides to increase a

tax,  which is so broad-based, affecting everybody, including

the  business at this point in time, should we not  ask:   is

there any other option, or do we just accept whatever it is?



<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not say that Mr

Low  does not support philanthropy.  What I said was  he  was

suggesting that we should not give tax rebates for those  who

have  donated,  for those philanthropists.  Sir,  may  I  now

continue with my speech?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our economy has undergone tremendous fundamental

and structural changes over the last few years.  The external

environment has definitely changed.  Our market has  changed,

our  competitors have changed and we too must change in order

to survive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of this year's Budget is in response to

those changes to keep Singapore competitive.  These measures,

the  tax  cuts, are much welcomed by our business  community.

However,  Sir,  there is undoubtedly  a  price  to  pay.   To

balance the budget, the GST rate has to be raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget does provide for a comprehensive compensation

package  to cushion the impact of the GST hike.  However,  it

is  not  without  pain.  I agree.  I have no doubt  that  our

people  are fully aware of the challenges that we are  facing

today  and I am confident that they are all prepared to  make

short-term  sacrifices  to achieve  long-term  stability  and

prosperity.   But  it is crucial for us to  ensure  that  our

efforts  to restructure our economy succeed so that  we  keep

faith with our people, and so that their sacrifices will  not

be in vain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to succeed in restructuring and

repositioning  our economy, I would like to  suggest  to  the

Government, in addition to the change in the tax  regime,  to

consider   three  aspects  -  the  Government   itself,   the

businesses and the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Government. True, taxation is only one of

the many components of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>



business  cost.  Reduction in corporate and individual  taxes

is  helpful, but tax cuts alone are not sufficient to  ensure

Singapore's overall competitiveness.  It is important for the

Government   to   be   conscious  of  the  overall   business

environment and take steps to further reduce operating  costs

here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me share with you my experience. My company,

Natsteel,  is  in  a highly competitive industry.   It  is  a

wonder  that we are still alive today.  We have to constantly

battle  cheaper  imports  from low cost  overseas  suppliers.

Margins  erode as competition intensifies.  The only way  for

us  to  stay  afloat is to make sure that we are always  more

cost-effective  and provide better quality and  service  than

our competitors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, review and restructuring happen every day in my

company.  It is a way of life where I work.  In the same way,

the  Government  must not let up its efforts on  streamlining

its bureaucracy and to oil its machinery, so as to provide an

ever  more  cost-effective business environment.  I  am  glad

that  the Minister for Transport announced yesterday  that  a

sum  of  $18 million would be put aside to upgrade our ports.

Yes, indeed, our port must continue to upgrade its facilities

and  improve  its  operational efficiency to  stay  ahead  of

competition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, our banking sector must be reformed to

provide   world-class  services.   So  too  our  bureaucratic

processes   must   be  streamlined  to  facilitate   business

transactions.  Our regulatory systems and our  laws  must  be

reviewed  regularly  to  ensure  greater  flexibility   while

preserving  the  integrity of the system.   Sir,  this  is  a

continuous   process  and  will  become   increasingly   more

important as the world becomes increasingly more competitive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Review Committee seeks to reposition our

economy for the new era, but we must not stop here.  I  would

like  to  urge  the  Government  to  consider  setting  up  a

permanent high level



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>



Inter-Ministerial Committee with the objective of ensuring  a

competitive business environment.  This Committee  will  then

help  to  coordinate among the various Ministries and provide

inputs  and  feedback  on the implications  of  the  policies

implemented  by  the  various  Ministries  on  the   business

environment,  as  well as recommend measures to  continuously

improve our competitiveness.  In this way, we can ensure that

the efforts to strengthen our economy's fundamentals will  be

sustained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the business community. The tax cuts and various

incentives  mentioned in the Budget will,  undoubtedly,  give

our   businesses  a  much  needed  boost  and  attract   more

investments  here.  However, we will need  to  supplement  it

with  more refined tools, such as the pioneer incentives,  to

attract the right types of businesses here and not just those

that  are  primarily  motivated by  the  low  tax  regime  in

Singapore.  The incentives for the financial industry and the

shipping industry are moves in the right direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our local businesses, on the other hand, must not just

sit  back and enjoy the ride of lower tax regime because they

must  know  that  their seats do not have safety  belts  and,

instead, they are fitted with ejection buttons.  If  they  do

nothing,  it  will  not be very long before competitors  will

catch  up  and  they will be promptly ejected.  Instead,  our

business  community must take this opportunity  for  them  to

restructure  their  business.  They must  not  lose  time  in

upgrading  themselves  and in seeking new  opportunities.   I

would   like  to  urge  the  Government  to  consider  taking

proactive  initiatives  to help local companies  upgrade  and

venture abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said about China. I would not go into the

details  of China.  A lot has been said already.  But  China,

undoubtedly, is a challenge as well as an opportunity.  It is

important for us to look at China, but it is not easy  to  do

business  in  China.   Venturing  overseas,  especially  into

places like China, has inherent risks and difficulties.  Many

of  us  do not have the resources nor the know-how to venture

abroad.  It is also difficult and at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>



times,  costly to recruit or persuade senior managers  to  go

overseas  and  work  there.   These  are  perhaps  where  the

Government  can  play a significant role.  For  example,  the

Government   could   consider   providing   incentives    for

Singaporeans working overseas, either to the individual or to

the  employer  to  help  reduce the  high  cost  of  overseas

postings, and encourage our companies to venture abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the people. Sir, we must prepare our people for

the  challenges  ahead.  As economic restructuring  picks  up

momentum,  changes are going to take place at a  much  faster

pace.  Certain sectors of activities in the economy will find

themselves becoming obsolete very quickly. They will need  to

innovate  and  change to stay relevant.   Employees  who  are

unable  to  keep  up with the pace of change will  soon  find

themselves being phased out.  It is, therefore, critical that

we  step  up our training and retraining programmes  to  help

these workers adapt to the new economy.  More importantly, we

need  to  inculcate  in them the spirit  of  flexibility  and

adaptability.  They need to change their mindsets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a saying, "give the man a fish and you feed

him  for  a meal; teach him how to fish and you feed him  for

life".   This is a very well-known saying, but unfortunately,

I think it might not be true today.  In this fast paced world

today, very soon, I am afraid, you will find that there is no

more  fish in the water and, therefore, teaching him to  fish

is  still  not  enough.  We have to teach him basic  survival

skills.   If  there is no fish, he must learn  to  hunt.   If

there  are  no  animals left, he might have  to  go  back  to

farming.   Just  like  the mice in the  book  "Who  moved  my

cheese?",  he  needs  to look for new cheese  all  the  time.

Therefore, we need to look at our education system, not  just

to  impart  knowledge  and  skills,  but  also  the  survival

instinct that is so crucial in the world today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our people must also have realistic expectations. Many

of  us  are used to the fast economic growth in the  80s  and

90s.    Many  of  us  are  used  to  see  significant  annual

increments and promotions and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>



with the tight labour market in the past, employers used  all

kinds of ways and means to retain staff.  This may not be the

case in future and we need to get used to the new environment

and  be  realistic  in our expectations.   We  need  to  make

serious efforts to reform the seniority-based wage system  to

one  that  is  based on productivity and contributions.   And

perhaps, we could start with the civil service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, we must still recognise that there

would  be  invariably people who are unable to cope with  the

changes, or those who might need a bit more time to adapt  to

changes.   We have to put in place an adequate social  safety

net  to help these people.  We must ensure our cost of living

remains affordable in general.  Healthcare and education,  in

particular, are of the greatest concern.  For this reason,  I

am  glad  that  the  Government will  be  absorbing  the  GST

increases in both these areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also set up this Committee to Combat

Profiteering chaired by Mr Chan Soo Sen.  I think  there  may

be  a need for an agency to monitor the general trend of cost

of  living,  to provide feedback and make recommendations  to

the  Government from time to time.  Perhaps, the role  of  Mr

Chan's  Committee  can be expanded for this  purpose,  rather

than just looking at the GST impact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it is important for us to give Singaporeans a

vision,  a  dream that they can strive for, a realistic  goal

that  we  can hope to achieve.  This common vision and  dream

will serve as a platform to unite all Singaporeans as we sail

through the restructuring process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking forward, Sir, the task ahead of us is a

challenging one.  The recession last year might have  been  a

crisis,  but  I  think  it  might have  been  a  blessing  in

disguise.   It  reminded all of us that  we  are  vulnerable,

despite  our past successes.  Our competitors are  no  longer

the  store  next  door; our competitors  are  no  longer  our

neighbouring countries.  We are competing against  China  and

the whole world.  We need to quickly reposition our economy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>



on a stronger footing to meet these challenges.  Sir, we have

the  mandate of the people to lead them out of the  recession

and  to provide them with better prospects and opportunities.

They  have  trusted us.  They are willing to make  short-term

sacrifices.   We must keep faith with the people and  deliver

results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial policies outlined by Deputy Prime Minister

Lee  is  the  first  step  towards  restoring  and  enhancing

Singapore's  competitiveness.   To  eventually   succeed   in

repositioning our economy and fulfill the task  entrusted  to

us  by  our  people we need a strong tripartite collaboration

among  the Government, the business community and the people.

While   the   Government  provides  a  conducive  competitive

environment,  the business community must take  the  lead  in

spearheading  our economic expansion and our people  must  be

nimble  and  be prepared to be flexible and adaptable.   This

way,  Sir,  we will be able to stay ahead of our competitors,

attain economic excellence and realise our Singapore dream.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.



<br>4.18 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of

the advantages of speaking on the second day of a debate like

this  is  that you get the chance to go home after the  first

day to make changes to the text so as to avoid repetition.  I

know it is hard for you to believe this, but I found that the

deletions I had to make were all the nice things I wanted  to

say  about the Government and the Budget.  So I am left  with

the parts which are, well, not so nice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the jury is still out as to whether there will be

economic  recovery this year.  The signals  from  the  United

States for the first quarter are mixed and it is still  early

days  as  to whether our economy would turn around.   MTI  is

optimistic, revising its prediction of economic growth for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>



Singapore from between 1% and 3% to between 2% and  4%.   But

then  MTI has been wrong before, predicting growth when there

was recession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has always maintained that at 3%, our GST

rate is one of the lowest in the world and we lag behind  the

GST rates of other countries.  Sir, this is one race where  I

do  not  think  we are in a hurry to be number  one.   It  is

therefore a bitter pill for Singaporeans to swallow when they

heard that the Goods and Services Tax would be increased from

3%  to  5%, coming as it was just two weeks after the  Deputy

Prime Minister had assured the House that the GST would  only

be raised when the economy is on a firmer footing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put it in another perspective, it is just not two

little  percentage  points more that we  are  talking  about.

What  it  means is that for every $100 that you spend,  where

you  now pay $3 in GST, you will in future be paying $5,  and

that is a 66% increase in your tax bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government argues that it needs to lower income

taxes  in order that we can attract investments and business.

The  DPM  has lamented that companies and foreigners are  not

coming to Singapore because the first thing they want to know

is what is your tax rate.  Is it not too high?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much one has to pay in taxes in a country is a

consideration, but that is not the starting point.  I do  not

intend  to  dwell on why people find Singapore  unattractive,

but  as Mr Inderjit Singh has said yesterday, there is a slew

of  other  indirect taxes and levies that one has to  pay  in

Singapore.   Therefore, while we can appreciate the  lowering

of income taxes, it has been pointed out that that is not the

raison d'etre for going into business.  If that was so,  many

Singaporeans,  including myself, would  not  have  gone  into

business when the corporate tax was 40% for a long time.   We

would  not  have become the nation of shopkeepers,  merchants

and manufacturers that we are today.  People go into business

because there is business to be done and profits to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>



be made.  Likewise too with foreigners who come here, or with

Singaporeans who venture abroad.  They go to where  there  is

business to be done and where there is money to be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do businessmen queue up to go to China even though

China  has high taxes?  Because goods can be produced cheaply

there  and because there is a potential market of 1.2 billion

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely, tax havens would be places of bustling

business  and  economic activity but you do not  find  people

making  a beeline to the likes of Brunei, the Cayman Islands,

the British Virgin Islands or Liechtenstein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while everyone is happy with lower taxes does it

necessarily  mean Government ends up collecting less  if  the

tax  rates  are  lowered?   I  will  now  ask  the  Clerk  to

distribute  two  tables  to  Members.   [Copies   of   Tables

distributed to hon. Members.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two tables here, but let us take a look

first at Table No 1.  Column 1 in Table 1 shows the amount of

corporate  and income taxes collected from FY93  -  the  year

before we introduced GST, when the corporate tax rate and the

top  personal income tax rate were 27% and 30%, respectively.

And  it shows through the years when we progressively reduced

the rates to 24.5% and 26%, respectively.  Column 2 shows the

income tax as a percentage of all taxes, which includes  your

estate  duties, property taxes, stamp duties,  lotteries  and

betting  duties,  and the GST collected by  IRAS.   Column  3

shows the amount collected from GST.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the then Finance Minister Dr Richard Hu introduced

the concept of GST in his House in his Budget Speech in 1993,

he told us that GST collection per year would be $921 million

per  annum.   The total revenue loss to the Government  as  a

result  of  the reduction in income taxes, property  rebates,

more   public  assistance,  more  subsidy  for   health   and

education,  S&C  offsets,  plus  the  transitional  measures,

(which were the rebates for S&C, rental rebates and grants to

the  CCCs, and these would only be for five years)  would  be

$1.1  billion.   This would mean a loss  of  revenue  to  the

Government of $183 million per year, for at least the first 5

years, after which he said the position would then be revenue

neutral.  Well, it all sounded very well-packaged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us take a look at Column 1 again. It shows

that  over  the  years since income tax rates  were  reduced,

income  tax collection actually grew from $7.31 billion  that

year, the year before we lowered the rates, to $12.35 billion

in  FY2000.   I  must say that there are some missing  spaces

because  these are the years 2001 and 2002-end.  We have  not

got the Annual Report of the IRAS yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a look at Column 2. As a percentage, income

tax  has  always  contributed to around  50-plus  to  60-plus

percent of all taxes collected by Government.  By FY2000,  it

already  contributed to 65.6%, more or less the same  portion

as in 1993, in spite of the reduction in corporate and income

tax rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Column 3 shows the revenue that has been collected from

GST.   In  the  first year that GST was implemented,  ie,  in

1994, Government collected $1.52 billion, much more than  the

$921  million  that was estimated.  There  was  certainly  no

shortfall  of  the  $183 million that Dr Hu had  anticipated.

GST  collection has increased steadily over the years, except

for two years, 1998 and 2002, when recession resulted in less

consumption  spending.  But every year,  GST  collection  far

exceeded what Government gave away.  By FY2000 it had already

exceeded  the  $2  billion mark, double  the  amount  it  had

originally  anticipated  it would collect.   And  this  year,

Government expects to take in another $2 billion in GST.  All

this is based on the present GST rate of 3%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So income tax rates were reduced, GST was implemented,

there  were  a  lot  of giveaways, but the position  was  not

revenue neutral.  Far from it, the Government collected  more

income taxes and more GST.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any more GST will just increase the burden on the

people,  especially  the poor.  The Government  may  disagree

with  me  but GST is regressive.  That is why the  underlying

principle  of  the  income tax collection  system  is  called

"progressive".  It means the more you earn the more  you  pay

in  taxes.   The  rich who have made the  most  from  all  of

society  pay more to Government so that money can be used  to

help  those  who  are less well off.  How do  you  justify  a

system  that now says the rich, with their big fat  salaries,

pay  less, and they are probably the ones who do not feel the

pinch,  and the other 70%, who could not afford to do so  all

along,  have  to start coughing up?  Sure, you can  give  the

goodies, or the offsets, but I want to ask:  why do you  want

to  break  a man's legs and then give him crutches to  wobble

on?   Is not that adding to the crutch mentality that we were

trying so hard to avoid in Singaporeans?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My conclusion after seeing all these figures is that the

Government has realised what a goldmine the GST  is.   It  is

like  the  COE.  When it was first introduced, no  one  could

foresee  that  the COE would be a billion-dollar money-raking

machine  for  the Government.  I am prepared to predict  that

within  a  few  years, GST collections  will  exceed  the  $3

billion  mark, and it would not be at the expense  of  income

tax  collections  because the economic pie will  expand.   So

when  we  are  told that GST must be raised to  make  up  for

losses  in  the collection of income taxes, I must  ask  what

losses is the Government talking about?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government also puts forth the argument that GST

must  go  up so that we do not run into a structural deficit.

I would be the first to query in this House if the Government

were  to try and run a less than prudent Budget.  But let  us

look at the Government's budgetary record from 1994.  Let  us

look  at  the  second  Table.  Column 1 shows  the  estimated

surplus or deficit each year when the Budget is presented  to

Parliament.   Column 2 shows the revised figure  towards  the

end of each



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>



financial year.  But it is not the final figure as  all  data

would  not  have been fully compiled by then.   So  Column  3

shows  the  actual figure which is available only  two  years

after the end of the financial year for which it is reported.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The record of the Government in this respect is good.

It has never incurred a deficit in any year, except possibly,

it is going to have one in 2001.  In 1998, when we had the $2

billion off-Budget measures to fight the recession, that  was

when the then Finance Minister estimated that we would run up

a  deficit  of $800 million, the Government ended up  with  a

surplus  of  $930  million.  That is  $1.7  billion  off  its

prediction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in 1999, when Government estimated a deficit of $5

billion, it walked away with a cool $4.9 billion at  the  end

of that year.  That is $10 billion off the mark.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, we had two off-Budget packages, $2.2 billion in

July  and $11.3 billion in October.  We were told that  these

two packages would result in budget deficits of $4 billion in

FY2001 and $1 billion in FY2002.  But we see from the revised

figures for FY2001 our deficit is estimated at $1.43 billion,

far below the high $4 billion anticipated deficit.  And as  I

explained  earlier, the actual figure will not be known  till

another  year's time.  So maybe there is some  hope  that  it

might be a plus, but it is still, at this point of time,  off

the mark by $2.57 billion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For FY 2002, the estimated deficit of $1 billion that

had  been  forecast when the off-Budget package was announced

is  now turning out to be a surplus of $900 million.  That is

before the new giveaways are computed inside, but it is still

$1.9 billion off the mark.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am more than happy if our forecast deficits are

reduced,  better  still, if they turn  into  surpluses.   The

Government  should therefore not be waving the red  flag  all

the  time,  otherwise it will end up like the boy  who  cried

wolf, and nobody is going to believe you after a while.   The

fiscal record of the Government is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>



the  envy of many other governments.  Between 1997 and  2001,

based on what we know - as of now - the Government netted  in

$15 billion.  It is not a bad record, in fact, it is great, I

will  say, considering that we lowered income taxes and  gave

away  so  many  goodies.  It is a feather in the Government's

cap  but,  Sir,  it does not need to pluck any more  feathers

from the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, revenue is just one part of the

equation.   I  agree with the Deputy Prime Minister  when  he

says  that  Government  departments have  to  spend  only  on

essentials and eschew frills and extravagance.  I  wish  that

that  message  had been sent earlier.  It seems  to  me  that

every  Ministry and many statutory boards today want to  have

their own headquarters or corporate building.  But if you see

many of them, you wonder if they are looking more like 5-star

hotels.    Singaporeans  refer  to  the  Seven   Wonders   of

Singapore:  MOE,  JTC, IRAS, the new Supreme  Court,  Foreign

Affairs sitting on a choice district 10 land, the twin towers

of  Home Affairs in Thomson and the upcoming HDB headquarters

in  Toa  Payoh.   It  seems  that twin  towers  are  becoming

fashionable  in Singapore.  In fact, I cannot understand  why

HDB,  which is downsizing as the building programme is  being

cut  back  drastically, cannot stay where it is.  It  has  to

build  twin  towers.  I remember not too long  ago  too  that

Government offices had that spartan look.  Of course, we  now

can afford to look better.  But if you see the furnishing and

fittings in many of these buildings, I think there must be  a

competition  amongst them to outdo one another to  see  which

one can look better than the Four Seasons Hotel.  Needless to

add,  posh buildings mean large sums of money every year just

to upkeep them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must, of course, give credit to MITA. MITA has

seen it fit to take over an old police station, refurbish  it

-  I have not been inside, so I cannot say what it looks like

inside - but I understand that the people there might not  be

too  comfortable, considering the fact that they are  working

in former jail cells.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many departments also publish their own newsletters,

which  contain news which are quite outdated, or  PR  flyers.

Very often I am inundated with glossy brochures and colourful

charts  like  this one [indicating].  It is a  data  sheet  - Statistics of Singapore.  I think I am expected to hang  this

up  somewhere.   But  all these do cost a  lot  of  money  to

produce and print, and I really question the purpose of  many

of  these things which are sent out.  I wonder again how many

of   these  items  that  are  circulated  actually  go   into

wastepaper baskets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take again the recent renaming of statutory boards under

the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Some people may feel  it

is  hip  to change the Standards, Productivity and Innovation

Board  to  Spring Singapore, the Trade Development  Board  to

International Enterprise or IE, and the National Science  and

Technology  Board  to  Agency  for  Science,  Technology  and

Research or A*STAR, but at least the old names, to me,  meant

what each of these organisations stood for.  Can you see  how

foreigners,  or  for that matter even Singaporeans,  have  to

scratch  their  heads  to look for something  called  the  IE

(International  Enterprise)  when  they  just  want  to  make

inquiries  about  trade?   Spring  Singapore  sounds  like  a

nightclub.   And  if  a lot of money has been  paid  to  some

consultant  to  dream  up A*STAR, let me  say  that  it  also

reminds  me  of a certain singer from Taiwan who  writes  her

name  in the same way with the (*) sign after the letter "A".

So much for creativity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Ah Mei.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Yes, Ah Mei, that is her name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is in a name, you might ask? Well, for one

thing, changing the name means you probably have to pay  some

slick design consultant to think up your new name, re-do your

logo,  all your signboards, letterheads, envelopes and  other

stationery, not to mention spending lots of money to tell the

whole  world that you now have a new name, and at the end  of

it all, you are still doing the same old things,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>



but  nobody is any wiser what you actually do or how to  look

for you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am disappointed that this Budget has not done

enough to solve many of the difficulties that ordinary  folks

and  businessmen have been faced with for a long  time.   Two

recessions  in less than five years have still not  sent  the

signal  that  there  are many issues that  are  fundamentally

wrong in Singapore.  Like others before me, I am prepared  to

wait for the Economic Review Committee to present its report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I want to say something and, that is, it is not

enough  to  bring out off-Budget measures every time  we  run

into  difficulties.  Off-Budget measures are ad hoc, they  do

not  provide  the  kind of certainty  that  we  all  want  as

solutions to our problems.  The only bold thing I find  about

this  year's  Budget is the unshamed hurry  to  increase  tax

revenue   under   the   guise  of  preparing   for   changing

circumstances  at a time when Singaporeans  are  reeling  and

recoiling   from   the   effects  of  the   recession,   when

unemployment is now hovering around a six-digit  figure,  and

when new entrants into the job market cannot even smell a job

interview.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, more than half the MPs who have spoken so far have

expressed  their reservations about the increase in  GST.   I

want to beseech the Government that this is a genuine concern

that  strikes  at  the  heartstrings of almost  every  single

Singaporean.  And I know it might be futile to say this,  but

I hope the Government would rethink this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

like  many of the hon. Members in this Chamber who have risen

and  spoken  on the Budget Statement delivered by the  Deputy

Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance, I would like  to

join in the debate and will try not to belabour on everything

but tread on issues that are of immediate concern.  I hope to

give  my perspectives and views on the matter and at the same

time give feedback on views I got from the ground.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br>4.38 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I recall correctly, more than six months ago, we

made  some  commitments.  Six months ago, we  had  asked  the

people to trust us.  Six months ago, we had assured them that

we  would take care of them.  The concerns then and now  have

not  changed much.  We all know that our citizens are worried

for  their livelihood, the future of their children  and  the

future of Singapore.  The people knew then and understood the

difficulties  that  lie  ahead.   By  giving   the   PAP   an

overwhelming  victory,  they  have  put  the  trust  in   the

Government  whom  they know is a no-nonsense,  realistic  and

pragmatic   Government  who  can  deliver  and   has   always

delivered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we are more than six months later. I believe we

have  arrived  at  the juncture where  we  are  expected   to

deliver  something.  In moving forward to revive the economy;

thus  creating  more jobs and businesses, we  must  not  lose

track  of  the  very reason we are doing all  this,  ie,  the

people.   Let  us  give  them back the  self-confidence,  the

morale  and  the  self-esteem.   It  is  our  duty  in   this

Parliament  to  ask whether this Budget can  do  the  job  of

creating jobs and businesses.  Let us face it, Sir, no single

Budget can satisfy all the sectors of the economy.  With  the

present    scenario   of   stiff   competition   and    rapid

globalisation, we have to put our priorities right, that  is,

to   implement   measures   to   ensure   Singapore   remains

competitive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the feedback that I have received, people are quite

comfortable with the proposed tax reforms and some, like what

Mr  Inderjit Singh had suggested, are even asking  for  more.

Naturally, the expected hike in the GST, parking charges  and

ERP  are  of  concern.  Let us not deny also that the  offset

measures  are quite balanced.  On the other hand, the  people

are  aware  that these offset measures are not permanent  but

the  GST, HDB parking charges and ERP are here to stay.  Sir,

their argument is simple.  They say that the Government gives

them some in the right



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>



pocket  and takes them out from the left pocket.   And  worse

still,  the  Government takes out more than what  they  give!

This is the feeling and it is quite prevalent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timing is of another concern. Many are asking: why now?

Can  it be done later when the positive signs are clearer and

the economy is growing?  The experts from the ERC and MOF may

prescribe  the  bitter pills and expect  people  to  swallow.

Majority  may do it but some may react differently.  Already,

we are hearing more who consider migrating and hope to find a

less  stressful  place  in the sun for themselves  and  their

family.   These are generally those who are talented,  mobile

and  can  afford to uproot and move.  Can we, as  a  country,

afford  these losses?  As it is, we are struggling to attract

talents to our country.  Similarly, are we taking care of the

underdogs  and  the underprivileged of our  society  to  face

these  challenges?  Some argue that the GST is going  to  put

them  in deeper trouble than before.  How then, Sir,  can  we

allay their worries?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, time and again, has encouraged the

people to be brave, enterprising and to take risk so that  we

can  have more successful local companies and this, in  turn,

could be the other wing of growth for our country.  I am  not

going  to  repeat some of the salient points  raised  by  the

other Members but I would like to stress that more should  be

done  to help the SMEs to grow.  One suggestion that I  would

like  to  put forward is that the bankruptcy laws  should  be

further reviewed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to tell a story of someone I know whose

father was a successful businessman.  When he was in his mid-forties, in the prime of his life, his business went bust and

he  was declared a bankrupt.  As I understood, there are many

restrictions and rulings being applied to a bankrupt; to  put

it  simply, his freedom was limited.  He wanted to revive his

business  and explore new areas and had tried many  times  to

get discharged but failed.  Now, 15 years later, he is in his

sixties,  a  broken  man  who has  practically  given  up  on

business  and  retired with many regrets and pains  of  those

lost years.  By the way, he was only discharged last year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with every success story that we

hear  and  read  about in the media, there are hundreds,  and

possibly  thousands,  that  failed.   But  these  people  are

resilient and they will come back and will try again.   I  am

not  advocating  for  handouts but we must  provide  for  the

environment and support that will not deter but spur them  to

try again and again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I would like to urge the Minister for

Finance to revisit the financing schemes for SMEs and  start-ups  and consider setting up a special bank that would  cater

for their needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very glad that the Ministry of Education is

getting  more  funds this year.  We know the importance  that

the  Government  puts  in education  by  the  sheer  size  of

resources  that have been poured into education.   We  cannot

afford  not  to  invest in our people.  As we move  into  the

knowledge  economy, we need to have more "knowledge  workers"

that are multi-disciplined and can handle multi-tasks at  the

same  time.   The education system should prepare the  future

generations  for  the  rapid  changes  and  produce   nimble,

creative and innovative minds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents are very concerned about their children's

future.  Thus, education is of utmost importance to them.  We

can  be comforted by the fact that we have a Government  that

emphasises on quality and standards for our education.   Many

people  around  the  world and locally recognise  Singapore's

quality in its education system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I believe, Sir, we can still fine-tune it to make it

even  better.  I would like to reiterate the call that I made

in  my maiden speech, that is, we should have a more holistic

approach  towards education.  Academic excellence should  not

be  the only thrust of education.  A child should be nurtured

on  values  such  as  national education,  community  spirit,

social services, voluntarism and sports.  This will nurture a

well-rounded   individual   with   strong   community   ties.

Ultimately, our education system should aim to develop



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>



citizens  who are able to put Singapore and community  before

self.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose to the Ministry of Education to

seriously  consider  bringing the early  childhood  education

into the formal education system.  Put it directly under  the

purview  of  MOE.  This portion of our education  system  has

mostly  been  left  out  to the community  organisations  and

private  sector.  We know that the Ministry of Education  has

some  initiatives  and  programmes in  this  area.   Is  this

enough?  Can we do more in this area?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I honestly believe we can and we should do more in the

area  of  pre-school education.  As the pressure for economic

excellence  continues, we will see more dual  income  earning

families.   Parents  need support to cope with  this  growing

trend and phenomenon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many developed countries that have

incorporated  the  pre-school education  into  their  primary

education.   More  recently, when PM  Goh  visited  Europe  I

believe  the  delegation  had  visited  countries  that  have

espoused this method.  As we progress and more of our  female

citizens  go  out  to join the workforce,  we  are  going  to

encounter  more demands for better and structured  pre-school

system existing under the mainstream education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should consider a system that takes in children from

three  to  five  years  old  in  the  ecole  maternelle   and

kindergarten.  We could make these pre-schools as part of the

primary  schools.   The  compulsory education  law  that  was

passed  in  Parliament is a clear indication of  Government's

commitment  to educating our future generation.  This  augurs

well for us.  Let us take this a step further and incorporate

the  foundation years into the mainstream education  provided

by MOE.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education can ensure the quality and

standards   of   the  early  childhood  education   and   the

kindergartens.  This is to ensure that a strong foundation is

in  place when they continue to primary education.  I believe

the more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>



senior  Members  of this Chamber would probably  be  able  to

recall  that  in 1979, the pre-primary system was implemented

in  some  schools.  The purpose was for bilingual  education,

ie,  to give students more or equal exposure to both Mandarin

and  English.  It was a worthwhile exercise and the  Ministry

then  had the motivation, the vision and boldness to  see  it

implemented.    But   sad  to  say,  subsequently,   it   was

discontinued in 1989.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education has an

impeccable record locally and internationally and  I  see  no

reason why they cannot take up this challenge and develop  an

excellent  early  childhood education  system  and  programme

suited for our needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to touch on education focus for the Malay

community.  Sir, the Minister in charge of Muslim Affairs has

recently  presented the vision of a progressive  and  dynamic

Malay  community.   In  the  present  economic  climate,  the

community  is  faced  with more daunting  challenges  and  it

should strive to do better.  It has made significant progress

in  the  area of education over the past 10 years.  We should

keep  up  the  pace  and  explore  new  areas  and  try  non-traditional  fields of education.  In this  aspect,  I  would

like  to  encourage the community to continue to emulate  the

culture of academic excellence into the Malay community.   We

must  aim  to achieve high standards in education and  attain

world-class recognition in whatever we do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education, Sir, is a great social leveller. Through

education and training, the community will be able  to  stand

tall,  participate and be part of the mainstream.  We  should

imbibe lifelong learning and make it our second nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our workers are constantly grappling with rapid

changes  and  the need to acquire new skills  and  knowledge.

Many  are struggling and some are resisting the change.   How

then,  Sir, can we assist them to manage the change?  I  have

again repeated this.  I would like to commend the Ministry of

Manpower, NTUC and CDCs for their effort.  But I believe more

can be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>



done  to  make these changes less painful and more meaningful

for our workers.  The burden of change should not fall on the

employees  but employers should also ensure that the  workers

are  regularly upgraded and retrained even during good times.

Employers  should  consciously  make  provisions  for   their

employees to upgrade and pick up new skills.  Measures should

be put in place to ensure that employers play their role as a

responsible corporate citizen vis-a-vis their workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the requests for assistance, the numbers given by

the  Minister  for  Manpower  on  the  success  rate  of  job

matching,  I just have this lingering pessimism that  we  are

just not good at this service.  Are we then not giving people

the  false hope by offering them assistance that resulted  in

near  total  failure?   5%  to 10% success  rate?   Is  there

anything  more  that  can be done to improve  this?   Are  we

exploring all the possible avenues and alternatives?  I  look

forward  to  the  Committee of Supply for  answers  to  these

questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

the  recession we are going through is the result of existing

factors as well as some long-term trends.  The primary short-term   factor  is  the  collapse  in  external   demand   for

electronics  which is starting to recover.  We are  beginning

to  see  signs of the turnaround in our manufacturing sector.

In  the  long term, manufacturers continue to relocate  their

facilities  to  low  cost  countries  leading  to  structural

unemployment.  It is clear that the era where  we  depend  on

export-oriented  MNCs to provide large  scale  employment  is

coming  to an end.  Thus, the Government has stated  that  it

would  encourage  the  formation  of  more  small  and  local

companies in the next phase of our development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask what are the pressing problems

businesses  are  facing  today.  In  simple  terms,  existing

businesses  are  facing  declining  profit  or  chalking   up

mounting  losses.   New  start-ups are  being  clobbered  and

strangled.  In this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>



environment, our people are looking forward to the Government

to   provide   leadership  in  restructuring   the   business

environment  to  address these issues: how to  make  existing

companies  more profitable and how to create the  environment

for new start-ups to prosper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response, this Budget aims to position Singapore for

a different world through cuts in company and personal income

tax.   This is based on the assumption that, doing  so,  will

attract  more company formation, greater personal strife  and

thereby  creating  more  jobs in future.   In  adopting  this

strategy, the Government has accepted the recommendations  of

the  Economic Review Committee.  Sir, if these changes indeed

were  to succeed in attracting more companies and talents  to

Singapore, the impact would still be felt only in the mid  or

long term.  There is not much in this Budget in the immediate

term that will give the economy a fillip in.  Nonetheless, it

is  heartening that the Government has gone through a lengthy

consultation process, tapping the views and opinions of  many

professionals  and  lay persons.  It is a reflection  of  the

willingness  of the Government to listen and to  further  the

pre-policy consultation process.  However, as a strategy, the

Budget lacks the comprehensiveness of a total response as  it

addresses only part of the issues facing Singapore.  It  uses

old  tools,  that is, tax changes to address  problems  in  a

changing world.  Thus, the Government has left untouched many

opportunities for truly remaking Singapore.  Like  the  other

MPs  speaking before me, perhaps these are being left in  the

next  phase  after  the  Remaking  Singapore  Committee   has

completed   its   work.   I  too  look   forward   to   their

recommendations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, being tax measures, the company tax and the

personal income tax cuts, while effective in certain aspects,

have  their limitations.  Let me give some examples.   As  we

all  know, the profit of a company equals revenue minus cost.

And  of  course, what is really important to the business  is

profit  after tax.  There are only two ways one  can  have  a

higher after tax profit if we cannot increase



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>



the revenue, being in a stagnation or recession, and that is,

to cut cost or reduce tax rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your indulgence, I would like to give a

comparison of the effectiveness of tax cut and cost reduction

in  increasing  after  tax profit.  To  yield  an  after  tax

benefit  of  $1,000 for a company, the Government could  have

cut  cost by $1,324.50  based on the 24.5% company tax.   And

doing  so,  it would apply to all companies, large or  small,

profitable  or not.  On the other hand, when we  cut  company

tax  from 24.5% to 22%, the Government forgoes 2.5 cents  per

dollar  of profit.  To yield an equivalent benefit of  $1,000

to   the  company,  that  company  would  have  already  been

profitable  and must be making $40,000 profit in  that  year.

For  a  company that makes $1 million profit, of  course  the

saving of $25,000 is significant.  On the other hand,  for  a

company  that  is only making $10,000 profit this  year,  the

benefit  is only $250.  For a company that is breaking  even,

or  is not making any money at all, the tax cut has no impact

whatsoever.   Thus,  the company tax reduction  is  good  for

large and profitable companies, such as MNCs and GLCs, but is

of  little  help  for  struggling  SMEs.   Hence,  for  SMEs,

reducing  cost  is  of greater benefit than reducing  company

tax.   Therefore, it is not surprising that many of the  CEOs

and   businessmen  who  participated  in  the  Feedback  Unit

dialogue  sessions commented that they are  not  too  worried

about  paying  tax at all so long as they are  making  money.

Many  participants lamented that this Budget does not address

the  root  cause  of  the  high cost  of  doing  business  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what are these main cost contributors? We know

they   are  wage  costs,  land  costs  and  other  Government

administrative fees and levies.  Wage costs have been  pushed

up  over the years by the tight labour market in Singapore as

well  as  by  the  Government's policy  regarding  the  civil

service  pay.  Land cost permeates through the infrastructure

to contribute to higher cost all round.  For instance, higher

land cost resulted in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>



higher  rental.  And I also recall that the asset enhancement

policy  pursued  by this Government about 10 years  ago  also

helps  in playing its part in increasing land cost.   Neither

wage cost nor land cost could be unwound that quickly without

causing major dislocation in our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that leaves the Government administrative fees as

the   remaining  major  cost  contributors.   And  it  is   a

disappointment to many that the Minister did  not  take  this

opportunity to further cut these costs.  On the contrary, the

Minister  decided to increase parking fees  as  part  of  the

measures  to  control vehicle usage.  This begs the  question

whether this Government administrative fees have been cut  to

the bone.  Perhaps, the Government is waiting to evaluate the

impact  of the slew of cost-cutting measures introduced  last

year before taking any further steps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in his speech, the Minister spent some time on the

Government's position on GLCs.  The gist of his  comments  is

that the Government will divest those GLCs that are no longer

of  strategic  importance to the  nation.   Sir,  GLC  is  an

emotive  topic  in  most of the dialogue  sessions  that  are

organised  by the Feedback Unit.  For many of these sessions,

the  issue always come up.  And needless to say, most of  the

comments are unfavourable ones.  Basically, the contention is

that  GLCs  crowd  out the SMEs.  Like an ecological  system,

every niche in the system is occupied by a species.  And when

an exotic species without a natural predator is introduced to

the  eco-system,  they would displace the  existing  species.

Once  established,  no new species could  emerge  unless  the

existing  species become extinct or the environment undergoes

dramatic changes creating new niches in the process.   So  it

is the case with our economic system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, to encourage greater entrepreneurship

and risk-taking, we need to review the fundamental reason for

the existence of GLCs.  Merely divesting GLCs by itself might

not  address the issue.  The fact is that the Government  has

made  use  of  the  GLCs  as part of its  talent  development

programme for the civil service.  Senior officials have  been

transferred



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>



regularly  to  these  GLCs to make way for  younger  officers

moving through the system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, Sir, I believe that it will be very difficult to

get  the  whole system to accept the need to revamp the  GLCs

for  an inconclusive objective of promoting entrepreneurship.

Perhaps,  the  more pragmatic solution is how  to  level  the

playing  field  and  to leave niches in  the  eco-system  for

budding young enterprises.  A favourite example quoted in the

dialogue  sessions I talked about is that of  PWD  Consultant

with its 5-year moratorium.  You will say that as a result of

its monopoly of Government projects at a time when Government

projects are the only ones available, this company has  grown

substantially, so much so that it has to subcontract out  its

jobs  while  the  independent firms  competing  with  it  are

starved of projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to GST. Once the Government has

decided  to  cut  company  and  personal  income  taxes,  the

increase  in  GST  becomes inevitable.   The  Government  has

announced   a   relief   package,  including   the   Economic

Restructuring Shares for lower income families to offset  the

increased  burden  of  the tax.  I would  like,  firstly,  to

comment on the philosophy of the ERS and then touch on  three

elements of the GST.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of course, it is not the first time the Government

is  handing  out  cash  disbursements using  the  concept  of

shares.   Last year, the Government issued the New  Singapore

Shares.   Now the Economic Restructuring Shares.  It  is  all

about a mindset change.  As a Government and as a people,  we

have  decided  that it is the right thing to do  distributing

public  funds to alleviate economic burdens as  a  result  of

Government restructuring policies.  The ER shares will be  in

place  for  five  years, long enough to become  part  of  our

national  psyche.   I  think it would be  very  difficult  to

change  our people's expectations in the future in this  area

when we encounter economic recessions then.  At that time, we

would be handing out more ER shares.  In this respect,  I  am

concerned about creating a dependency mentality in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>



our  people.  When we look back 20 years from now, it is very

likely  that this Budget will be remembered as the  one  that

changed   our  social  compact  for  a  different  Singapore.

Whether it is good or bad, only time could tell.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to specific comments on the GST. When

the  GST was first introduced in 1993, it was presented as  a

tax  reform  aiming  to be revenue neutral.   The  Government

reviewed all the existing taxes then to ensure that  GST  did

not increase the tax burden.  Two examples come to mind.  The

first  is the tax on petrol.  The Government changed the  tax

regime  so  that the total tax collected per litre of  petrol

remained  the same.  The second is cess.  It remained  at  4%

after  GST, with 1% going to the Singapore Tourist Board  and

3%  earmarked for GST.  This time round, there is no  mention

of  the words "tax reform", even though the tax reduction and

the additional GST collections nearly balance each other out.

Hence, we could conclude that there is no attempt to mitigate

the  increase  like  before.  Thus, it would  be  logical  to

expect to pay more for petrol, cess and everything else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, it seems that the GST relief, such as the

ER  shares,  will be distributed based on HDB housing  types,

just like before.  The feedback received by the Feedback Unit

is  that  a  fair  number  of Singaporeans  found  that  this

classification is not entirely equitable.  For example,  some

households living in 5-room flats have dependent aged parents

living  in those households.  Had the parents been living  by

themselves, they would have qualified for more payoffs.   So,

by  living  together, these Singaporeans feel that  they  are

being  penalised.  Some have suggested that it would be  more

equitable to use household income together with the household

size as a measure to determine the disbursement.  I hope  the

Government would consider these suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to what the other MPs have said, the general

sentiment  amongst our population is that with  lower  income

tax  and  higher GST, the rich get richer and  the  poor  get

poorer.  Well, with the GST relief



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>



package,  it is not as simple as that, at least for the  next

five  years.   It is clear that for the higher income  group,

they  would enjoy some tax savings as the reduction of income

tax  is  far greater than the increase in GST.  We know  that

the  lower income groups are covered by the GST package  and,

therefore,  would  not be worse off.  So who  are  worse  off

under  this regime?  Some groups must be, because  they  must

bear  the  increase  in  GST over the reduction  of  personal

income  tax  so  that the Government could  have  a  balanced

budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind, Sir, the concern expressed by many MPs

regarding   the  lower  income  group  might  be  overstated.

Perhaps those groups that truly feel the burden of GST in the

next  five years should be identified, and this group feeling

the  squeeze could be the middle income group.  I do not have

the  data  to  determine what is this  middle  income  group.

Perhaps  the  Minister would be kind enough to  identify  the

income bracket where the net GST increase is greater than the

reduction  in  personal income tax.  This  group  will  truly

experience  an  increase  in  tax  burden.   This  group   of

taxpayers will feel it sooner or later, so we might  as  well

be as transparent as possible in identifying them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, the tax changes in this Budget could

only be part of a strategy to remake Singapore.  Judging from

the  ongoing  work of the Remaking Singapore  Committee,  one

would  expect  more is yet to come.  We look forward  to  the

recommendations    that    will   bring    about    long-term

transformation for a better Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  I  would like to begin with a businessman who flies  in

from  Hong Kong to Singapore for his company's board meeting,

hopefully  on  Singapore Airlines.  His plane  gets  a  slot,

touches  down  as  scheduled, and he  enjoys  air-conditioned

comfort  right  from the aerobridge.  He  has  no  hand-carry

baggage,  so  he whizzes through immigration and  customs  at

Changi International Airport Terminal 2, and breezes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>



into  the  CBD  in a limousine, all in a record  time  of  35

minutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we may ask: is this good enough? Perhaps, not

quite  enough  from our perspective, if we  are  thinking  of

being  excellent, being number one.  Since  traffic  flow  is

hard  to  control, we focus on reducing the time required  to

clear him at Changi Airport.  We study the challenge and then

decide that in order for the time to be reduced by, say, five

minutes,  the  plane must always be served by  an  aerobridge

whenever  it  arrives.  To ensure this, we must  have  enough

aerobridges  and  other airport terminal services.   We  then

aggregate  all  such demands and conclude  that  we  need  to

increase  capacity because in the words of the Civil Aviation

Authority of Singapore, "our philosophy is providing capacity

ahead of time".  Sir, what about the passenger's perspective?

He may not even notice the five minutes' improvement or, even

if  he  did, it may not matter to him at all.  After all,  in

the other major cities, he takes a good 60 minutes at least.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am of course oversimplifying the situation here

and  may  have  even been unfair to the very well-run  Changi

Airport.  I do understand that we are building Terminal 3  at

a cost of $1.54 billion to handle the new generation of large

aircraft.  But my point here is: how do we guard against  the

danger of over investing in infrastructure and in hardware?

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a country, foresight and forward planning have served

us  very,  very well, and I am not for one moment  suggesting

that we live our lives right on the edge.  But, Sir, there is

a  fine line between allowing some bursting at the seams,  to

induce productivity improvements, and over-providing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I understand, the new Terminal 3 can handle

another 20 million passengers while Terminal 1 and Terminal 2

currently handle an aggregate of 28.6 million passengers.  It

could  therefore  take a while before we  fill  up.   In  the

meantime, there will be gross under-utilisation.  That is not

all.   There  is  a real massive cost to be depreciated,  and

this will find its way into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>



the  economics  of landing charges, ground and other  related

services, thereby affecting our cost competitiveness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the expenditure relating to the

schools  development  programme  and  to  the  buildings  for

Ministries, their agencies and statutory boards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our schools are generally already of a very high

standard,  and  I  wonder how we can guard against  the  over

building of features and facilities.  Every school strives to

have  the  full  works, but is the expense really  justified,

relative  to  the benefits and utilisation?  Until  recently,

because schools have fought so hard for such features, raised

funds  for  them, they have guarded them very jealously,  and

sharing  with, say, the community is rare, if at  all.   Many

foreign  visitors to our schools have nothing but praise  for

the  modern and extremely high-tech facilities that we  have.

But  they  themselves have produced excellent  students  from

their  own older premises.  So when will it be sufficient  or

do  we  always  have to be top-notch in hardware?   Excellent

hardware can sometimes be value-destroying.  We seem to focus

more  on the hardware than software.  How about spending more

for,  say, administrative support or teacher counselling than

on a theatrette?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to another illustration, that of

Government buildings, which my honourable colleague,  Mr  Tan

Soo Khoon, has so eloquently spoken on a while ago.  It would

appear that it is not only local businessmen who love to have

their  own  piece of real estate and their very own building.

Over  the past decade, virtually every Ministry and statutory

board  has  constructed its own building, and some  on  prime

land, no less.  It is not quite clear to the public why  this

is  necessary.   Ownership of buildings and land,  accounting

issues  aside,  is very capital-intensive, and  can  distract

Government  agencies from pursuing their  primary  objectives

and roles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue goes really beyond the size of the

development expenditure to one of balancing the Budget.  Many

Singaporeans accept that in order to have jobs,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>



we  need  to have a conducive business environment  and  that

reducing  corporate and income taxes was  a  necessary  step.

They  also  accept  that this could mean a revenue  shortfall

unless economic activity and, therefore tax collections  pick

up  and  compensate for the rate reduction, such as  what  we

have  seen  previously.  As many of my honourable  colleagues

have  raised  in  this  debate,  the  attendant  question  is

therefore one of the quality of the Budget estimates  or  the

possibility   of   reducing  Government   expenditure,   both

operating and development, against having to raise  the  GST.

I  shall not belabour the point as many of my colleagues have

already  spoken on the concerns over the increase in the  GST

rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the public can be convinced that Government

expenditure  is well justified and that raising GST  revenues

was  inevitable, then the transition will be  acceptable  and

the offset package appreciated in its entirety.  If, however,

the  public  sees  what  it  considers  to  be  excesses   in

infrastructural  building  or in  Government  expenditure  in

general,  then the GST increase will be resisted.   I  would,

therefore,  like  the  Minister  to  explain  the  underlying

principles  for undertaking massive infrastructural  projects

and the accountability thereafter.  I would also like to urge

the Minister to, firstly, review anew and scrutinise all real

estate  propositions  by  Ministries  and  statutory  boards;

secondly,  urge  all Ministries to be especially  mindful  of

such  expenditure; and, thirdly, to educate the public  fully

on the merits of such infrastructural projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, notwithstanding the need to explain the balancing

of  the fiscal Budget, I agree with the underlying intent  of

the  Budget  which, I believe, will help put Singapore  on  a

firmer path.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Budget.



<br>5.15 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, Mr Tan Soo Khoon is a good friend of mine.  Whenever  he

speaks, he catches my attention and I enjoy listening to him.

I am impressed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>



with   the   well-researched  figures  he  produced  earlier.

However, he told only half the story.  I would be happier  if

he  had juxtaposed his tables with another table showing  the

income,  education  and quality of life of Singaporeans  over

the  same  period.  The point we should consider is  not  how

much surpluses we generate but whether at the end of the  day

Singaporeans'  lives have improved.  And this  is  what  this

Budget and the GRC work are all about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to commend the Deputy Prime Minister on a

very  good  Budget  in Singapore in what is very  challenging

times.   The  restructuring of our fiscal system to  make  us

nationally  more  competitive is critical  to  our  long-term

economic   survival,   as  we  face   new   challenges   from

globalisation and from newly developing countries like China.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to propose four points for the Deputy Prime

Minister  to consider and, if he thinks fit, take  them  into

account in the final Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the market size in Singapore is limited. To

survive  globalisation, companies must expand regionally  and

internationally.    In   fact,  the   Government   has   been

encouraging  them  to do so.  However, when  these  companies

make  losses  in  their overseas investments,  they  are  not

allowed to offset these losses from their taxable profits  in

Singapore.  To be fair to these companies that heed the  call

by our Government, the group tax offset for loss making local

subsidiaries  should  also  apply to  overseas  subsidiaries.

This  will provide additional incentive for our companies  to

risk their dream abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent abuses, certain limits could be

placed.   Perhaps a registration system could be  implemented

and administered by a Government agency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to touch on is on the single

tier  system for company taxation.  The reduction of  company

taxes  to  22%,  with an eventual target  of  20%,  has  been

coupled with a single tier system



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>



for  company  taxation.  This will result in  the  individual

investor paying more taxes on the dividends he receives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retirees who have saved their money in the form of

share investments pay little or no tax.  It is this group  of

people who are the hardest hit by this measure and they are a

group of people who can ill afford the additional burden.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the economy matures, growth rates of companies

will be slow, and a greater proportion of their profits would

be  returned  to  the investor as dividends.   An  investment

strategy  based  on yield now becomes increasingly  plausible

compared to a growth strategy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the professional fund managers and corporate

investors, there are many individuals who invest long term to

build  up  a retirement fund.  The Special Retirement  Scheme

(SRS)  has  recently  been introduced by  the  Government  to

encourage this group of people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dividend payout and the taxation it attracts affects

the  motivation  of these long-term individual  shareholders.

The Government should not put them at a disadvantage compared

to the pre-Budget situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment holding companies which make losses at the

company level also suffer from the single tier proposal.  Due

to  their nature, investment holding companies' only  revenue

source  is from the dividends paid by their subsidiaries  and

associate companies.  Since no tax credit can be claimed from

the  subsidiary's dividend, they cannot offset their  running

cost against their subsidiary's income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the DPM to reconsider the move to a single tier

scheme  for company taxation.  The old scheme of franked  tax

credits  for  dividend paid has served us well and  could  be

retained or dividends can be paid untaxed, ie, companies need

not  pay tax on the portion of profits paid out as dividends.

In  the  latter  scheme, individual taxpayers must  then  pay

taxes on the dividend earned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we are in the age of computers, there should not

be  much  difficulty  in administering  either  scheme.   All

listed companies are already reporting to the tax authorities

the  list  of  shareholders and their  dividend  distribution

amounts via CDP computers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next point I want to touch on is on taxation of

bank  interest.   Interest paid on  deposits  is  a  form  of

compensation for the opportunity cost of using the money  and

inflation.   Many  individuals in Singapore,  especially  the

more  risk averse, save their money in savings, deposits  and

fixed  deposit  accounts.   Like the  long-term  investors  I

mentioned earlier, they are saving for their retirement.  The

Government ought to encourage this activity by not taxing the

fruits of such savings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage the Government to bring forward the plan to

waive  taxation on interest as recommended by  the  ERC  sub-committee.   I  am  speaking especially for  the  man-in-the-street, who should not be penalised for saving his money in a

deposit account by having his interest taxed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last point I want to make is on CPF review. It

has  been  noted  by Mr Lim Boon Heng that our  older,  lower

income  workers  would  face increasing  uncertainty  as  our

economy transforms. The world is entering into a new economic

era and the impending restructuring of our economy cannot  be

avoided.   However,  we must remember our  workers  from  the

previous  generation who have made Singapore the success  she

is today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has already done much for the lower-income group, through the various rebates, asset enhancement

schemes  and  the  New Singapore Shares, etc.   It  helps  to

narrow the disparity between our high income earners and  the

less  fortunate.  Mr Lim also mentioned, and  I  agree,  that

workers  over 40 would find it difficult to find a  new  job.

This  could be either because their skill set is now less  in

demand  due  to  economic  and industrial  restructuring,  or

because employers simply prefer to employ younger workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>



Mr  Lim  floated  the  idea of lowering  the  CPF  for  these

workers,  ie, those over 40 to make them more competitive  in

the job market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I agree that lowering the

employer's  CPF contribution for older workers would  enhance

the employment opportunities of these workers.  However, I do

not  think that we should lower the total monthly CPF savings

of  these workers.  Lowering the CPF rates is not without its

associated  problems.   Firstly, it  effectively  lowers  the

worker's actual income although his take-home pay may  remain

the  same.  This may lead to a second problem of having  less

or  insufficient  funds  for  his retirement  and  healthcare

needs.   Workers  with existing housing loan  commitment  may

also be adversely affected by a lower CPF saving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose an alternative. My alternative

is for the Government to subsidise or pay for part of the CPF

for  older  workers below certain income levels to help  them

remain  employed.  This is a better way to help  lower-income

Singaporeans, compared to our previous schemes of CPF top-up.

It  not  only provides sufficient incentive for employers  to

consider  hiring older workers, it also sends a clear  signal

to  them  that  older workers ought to be  considered  on  an

equal, if not favourable footing because of their experience,

when  deciding  on suitable persons for job vacancies.   Most

importantly, this is a meaningful and effective programme  to

ensure   our  social  stability  and  cohesion  as  we   face

globalisation  head  on  and the spectre  of  greater  income

disparity.  I am sure the ERC can work out the details.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope DPM could respond to these suggestions. On

that note, I support the Budget.



<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): This

year's Budget has shifted Singapore further into the path  of

indirect  taxes.   This is a very important  and  wise  move.

Over  time, it should bring a lot of good, especially in  our

effort to be a more competitive business hub as well as to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>



retain  and attract talent and to generate investment and  to

create  more  jobs for our citizens, in the hope  that  these

jobs would be better and bring higher wages for Singaporeans.

Directly and indirectly, the reduced tax rates that had  been

announced  would result in a saving of $900  million  to  our

taxpayers  in  our  country.  I hope  over  the  years,  such

savings  would be put to good use, especially in the form  of

more investments by companies and individuals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new GST rate of 5% as announced is still among the

lowest in the world although we agree that it could have some

impact on the prices of goods.  However, I believe the effect

will  not be too difficult for us to cope with.  We need  not

be  overly concerned about the effects on Singaporeans. I  am

sure  that  the  rebates announced should take  care  of  the

people who need help.  It is very important for us to look at

the  issues that we are facing now and these issues  are  not

whether  the  GST  should be at 3% or 5%.  But  to  encourage

investments  and increase job opportunities,  and  should  we

fail  in  this  area,  we would be facing  a  bigger  problem

because  without  jobs, without income  that  is  stable  and

permanent, even if we do not impose a GST, Singaporeans would

be facing a big problem to survive, so the actual issue is to

increase job opportunities for Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity

to  assess the impact for us to help workers and Singaporeans

in  general from the income that they receive.  Firstly,  how

can  we  help them to increase their savings and investments.

Usually  a  person with income, his money would be  spent  on

three  areas:  first, expenses; second, savings  and  perhaps

some  on  investments.  Every individual should make his  own

decision  as to how and how much they should spend,  save  or

invest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to suggest that our tax

system  be  structured to encourage more people to work  hard

and  save  and also to invest some of their earnings  and  we

should make this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>



advantageous  and  profitable  for  our  workers.   This   is

necessary  because  generally many  people  feel  that  their

purchasing value will be levelled out by inflation,  ie,  the

purchasing  value of cash would be eroded over time.   So  in

this  way  we  should give them a strong enough incentive  to

feel that saving and investing is a wise move.  Otherwise, it

is  possible that many would end up with the idea that it  is

better to spend all now and worry about all else later.  This

is  not  a good situation for Singaporeans.  As all forms  of

expenditure would involve GST, I wonder whether a person will

get more benefit if he works hard to increase his savings and

investments.   At  present, I think,  based  on  our  present

taxation  system,  the answer is "Yes"  and  "No".   I  would

explain why.  One example is that should a person save  every

source  of his income in a bank, the money escapes  the  GST,

but the saver would have to pay a bank charge.  The bank will

pay an interest on the savings.  However, at present, we find

that  the  interest given by the banks in the form  of  fixed

deposits or ordinary savings is still taxable.  The amount of

tax  would  depend on the individual's tax bracket.   If  the

person  belongs to a tax bracket of higher than  the  5%  GST

rate,  the  interest earned would be taxed at a higher  rate.

The  question is whether our taxation system is strong enough

to  attract Singaporeans to save.  For the present,  we  find

that  the interest paid by the banks is very low.  It is  not

attractive.  Secondly, for a person who pays tax at the  rate

of  10%,  I think the effect on his savings will not be  much

for him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, should he spend the interest from his

savings  in the future, it will still be subject to GST.   So

will the Minister consider enabling all forms of earnings  to

be  exempted from tax because finally if the money  is  spent

later, it would still include a portion for the GST?  I think

the same should be considered for personal investments.  Like

all   investments,  there  are  risks  involved.    Not   all

investments can bring in profit and since the Government  has

also  encouraged the people to invest in shares, I would like

to  ask  whether  GST  should be  charged  for  the  services

provided to purchase shares.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not extending this argument to

other  forms of investments but only for investment of shares

in  listed  companies in Singapore because  for  most  people

investment  in shares of well-run companies may be  the  best

way  for them in using some of their savings for investments.

And  this  process, I think, is still a learning process  for

most  Singaporeans.   I also feel that  finally,  when  their

investments are profitable, and Singaporeans who keep some of

their  earnings can still contribute by way of GST when  they

spend the money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to refer to the

statement of the Minister for Finance when he said  that  the

Budget  this  year  is  for  a world  that  has  changed  and

considering  that the world has changed and  it  has  brought

uncertainties,  we as a nation will have  to  take  steps  to

adjust  to  it.   I am sure that his words are relevant,  not

only  for the Budget but also for all Singaporeans.  We  need

to  make a fundamental shift in the way we see and do  things

so that together, we could help in the remaking of Singapore.

For  workers in particular, there is a need for us to respond

to  the challenge to upgrade our skills, adjust ourselves and

we  should do this seriously so that we can continue to  make

ourselves  relevant  with the changing job  profiles  in  the

marketplace.    Our  investors  should  also  stabilise   and

strengthen their position.  Looking at the region, we  should

all  work  hard and grow the Asian economy that is developing

and will continue to develop in the years to come.  I am sure

if  all  of  us  play our role, we can change  the  world  at

present now into a world where we can all be comfortable  and

improve our lives as individuals and as a nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Budget this year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

feeling of gloom and doom by many Singaporeans following  the

recent  Address by our President at the Opening of Parliament

is  to  some extent mitigated by the assurance of growth  and

employment that our Deputy Prime Minister gave on the  Budget

Statement which I rise in support of.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget is constructed on the basis that we would

restructure  the economy of Singapore in order  that  we  may

stay  competitive  and in the process  help  to  bring  about

sustainable  growth  and  employment  in  the  longer   term.

Towards  this end, we have what many would consider to  be  a

pro-business   Budget  that  sets  about   introducing   many

incentives  to induce businesses and even talents  here;  the

key  instrument  in  this statement being  the  reduction  of

corporate  and  personal income taxes.  To  ensure  that  the

economy  is  sustainable in the long run, the Budget  had  to

balance and we achieve this by raising indirect taxes in  the

form  of  five  percentage points for the GST  amongst  other

things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In marginally shifting the centre of gravity from direct

to  indirect taxation, we are once again faced with the  age-old  issue  of taxation and distributive justice in  society.

At  the risk of over-simplifying matters, the question is: do

we  or should we continue to tax the rich highly, so that the

benefits  can be enjoyed more by the poor, or do we make  the

poor  pay  more indirectly, since many do not pay  taxes,  so

that  we can encourage the rich to remain or even come to  us

to help us grow the economy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the announcement of the increase of the GST rate

from 3% to 5%, there has been an understandable concern among

Singaporeans about coping with the rising cost of living.  As

it  is,  even before the announcement of the increase in  the

GST, there have been constant complaints and grumbling on the

ground  about  the rising cost of living in  Singapore.   The

announcement of the increase therefore could not have, in the

minds  of many, come at a worse time, when many Singaporeans,

especially  the middle aged and unemployed Singaporeans,  are

in  a predicament because of the recessionary climate of  the

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address these concerns, a comprehensive relief and

offset  package was announced at the same time.  The  package

of GST offsets and reliefs are intended to help those who are

in the lower income bands, and the announcements provide



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>



some  comfort  and cheer to many Singaporeans.   The  reliefs

notwithstanding, there are however some issues  and  concerns

that  have  since  surfaced.  Sir, if  I  may,  I  will  just

elaborate on some of these.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, GST offsets and relief packages together with

economic  restructuring  shares  are  temporary,  while   the

increases in GST are permanent.  Our Government has given the

assurance that the present round of assistance should  ensure

that  those in the lower income group would not be worse  off

than  before  the  increase.  While this is  reassuring,  the

people  would  like to know whether the Government  would  be

prepared  to  continue  giving similar assistance  after  the

initial five-year period is over and there are no signs of  a

long term recovery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, and this relates to the earlier point and

echoes the sentiments of many of my colleagues in this House,

the  Government had previously given utility rebates to lower

income households to help defray the likely increases in  the

cost of living when the GST was first introduced.  Why cannot

the  Government now introduce a similar rebate since for many

of  the  lower  income  households,  utilities  constitute  a

substantial part of the household expenditure?  I  understand

that  utilities  are a precious resource  in  Singapore,  and

giving  utilities rebates may send the wrong signals  to  the

public  on consumption habits.  While I can understand  where

the  concern is coming from, I wonder whether this  suspicion

or concern was borne out the last time when such rebates were

given.   In  other words, did the Government  look  into  the

consumption pattern when such rebates were given?  My view is

that  rebates of this nature provide relief and I doubt  very

much  if  the  majority  of households would  consciously  or

unconsciously  increase spending on utilities simply  because

of  the rebates.  On the other hand, for the majority of  the

lower  income  households, such rebates  and  relief  by  the

Government would be a welcome assistance indeed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Government has also given the assurance

that  increases in the GST would result in business operators

taking  advantage by profiteering.  In this  regard,  we  are

told that a Committee has been set up under the leadership of

my  honourable  colleague to deal with such  problems.   Sir,

there are some reservations to this approach.  To begin with,

the  Committee lacks teeth in the sense that it has no  power

to  bring  those guilty of profiteering to court  and  charge

them  with such excesses.  All that the Committee can do  for

now  is  to work with the merchants to persuade them  not  to

take  advantage.  This approach is what others would consider

as  moral suasion.  In the worst-case scenario, the Committee

may  just  shame the profiteers publicly through  the  media.

While  this  may  work  in the case of blatant  and  outright

shameless  overpricing, it would be difficult to  monitor  in

situations  where price increases have been  incremental  and

progressive  over a period of time.  How will  the  Committee

deal with such a situation?  It may be better perhaps if  the

Government  could consider providing enabling legislation  to

allow  the  Committee  the ability to  deal  with  profiteers

during this period of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, many Singaporeans do not understand why it is

necessary  for the Government, on the one hand, to  give  out

Singapore  Shares  and, on the other  hand,  take  back  such

handouts  through  increases in  the  GST.   There  are  many

Singaporeans,  especially those whose annual  property  value

exceeds  $10,000 who feel that they do not need  such  shares

and  it  may  be  better if such resources are channelled  to

those Singaporeans who are in need of assistance during  this

period.  This can take the form of a gradual increase in  GST

or  that a fund can be set up to be given to the really  poor

through  the  grassroots organisations like the CCCs  or  the

CDCs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and above the concerns over the GST, there are many

who  feel  that  more should be done for the SMEs  and  these

sentiments  have  been reflected early in  this  House.   The

reduction in income tax and the provision of group relief may

give businesses much encouragement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>



and  incentive.   However, there is  some  disappointment  as

nothing  was  specifically targeted at the  SMEs.   To  begin

with,  there are many SMEs who are not GST registered.   Sir,

we  know  that the operating principle of GST is to pass  tax

down  the value chain so that the goods and services  do  not

technically  end  up  having  a compounded  payment  of  GST.

However,  with  the increases in GST and in  the  climate  of

extreme competition, the manufacturer or the service provider

may well absorb increases in GST.  If the party concerned  is

profitable, the reduction in income tax payment could well be

offset, or used to offset the absorption.  On the other hand,

if  the  business of the manufacturer or the service provider

is poor, the increases in GST may well add to his woes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we accept and recognise that SMEs play a pivotal

role   in   reshaping  our  economy.   SMEs  are  essentially

homegrown  industries and are largely owned by  Singaporeans.

While  we  would in the longer term have to rely on the  GLCs

with their resources to provide the charge in creating world-class companies, that charge alone would not be sufficient if

it  were not supported by the SMEs.  Indeed, many of the SMEs

have the potential to become world leaders in their own field

if  only  they  were properly funded and supported.   And  it

would  not be asking too much of the Government at this  time

to  constantly  remember them when looking  at  the  slew  of

incentives  to improve the business environment here;  and  I

would say that we should constantly be looking at finding out

who  the  promising SMEs are that we can nurture into  world-class companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Singaporeans have asked whether by going along

with the increase in the GST, there is any assurance that the

economy will turn around.  I started my speech by saying that

this  Budget serves to mitigate the climate of doom and gloom

that  has brought about a climate of pessimism all round.   I

must  reiterate  that I am confident that it will.   However,

much has to be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the earlier debate on the Presidential Address,

I had advocated a central



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>



tenet  that we should continue to use our reserves to explore

acquisitions in world class companies or companies with world

class potential and then leverage on these companies to  help

bring  our people up to speed on the demands of international

business.  With a successful external economy, we could  then

afford to have a little slack or inefficiency in our domestic

economy in order to keep our people employed.  We are a  very

small  economy  and  for us to compete effectively,  we  must

learn to think of the world as our hunting ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, while there is some measure of hollowing out, I do

not  think that there will be a complete hollowing out of our

manufacturing  industries.   It  has  often  been  said  that

Singapore is a country that runs like a well-oiled machinery.

Everything  here  works.   And  this  will  surely   be   our

advantage.  I have often said that while Singapore  may  lack

the  critical mass to produce world-class talents,  but  when

you  take  everything in its totality, Singapore can  present

quite a formidable challenge even to China.  Yes, we may  not

have  the most brilliant surgeon compared to China.  However,

I  know that if a Singapore surgeon operates on me, the blood

that  the  hospital here supplies me is safe,  the  operating

theatre  is  clinical and I will not get secondary infections

in  the  process.  I also know that the intensive  care  unit

will be well run and their staff will be competent.  In other

words,  it is not the surgeon's skill alone that will  ensure

my  survival,  but  rather the entire system  that  works  to

support  him.   I am sure that many foreigners see  this  and

share the confidence that we have in our system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, while China is powering ahead with its economic

boom,  there  are  on-going reports of its systemic  weakness

that  may  well  in  the long run hinder  its  growth.   Much

concern  has been raised about the weakness of its  financial

institutions, the state-owned enterprises, and the extent  of

corruption within the system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have to continue to find new niches that enable

us  to  take  our  place in the world economy.   Our  present

strategy is right.  While industries may continue to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>



hollow  out, there will be other industries that will replace

it.  New activities such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, wafer

fabs and high-end electronic manufacturing should continue to

be  encouraged  to  move  here.  There  will  be  some  pains

initially  in  the  process as we move higher  up  the  value

chain; however, this is a necessary step.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is unfortunate that our service sector has been

dealt a major blow with the departure of two large customers,

we  should not lose heart, as we firmly believe that with new

pricing and other strategies, we will be able to compete even

more  effectively.   Indeed, the recent liberalisation  moves

have  sparked off growth in several service industries.  Many

segments of financial services, telecommunications and  media

have  picked up as a result.  I am certain that the new moves

to reduce income taxes will continue to make us attractive to

foreign investment capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the final analysis, will we survive in the

middle  term?   I am under no illusion that we will  have  no

difficulty  surviving  for the next  five  years.   In  fact,

generating  annual growth rates of between 2% and  3%  should

not  be a problem for us.  For the longer term, I believe  we

should have a new social compact with our people; we need  to

get everyone to pull the gravy train in the same direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

thank  you  for  giving me this opportunity to  join  in  the

debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance's

Budget  Statement, he painted the scenario  of  a  harsh  and

turbulent world that Singapore is in now.  I would not  dwell

on  the fiscal measures of the Budget but would like to  urge

the  Government to review its impact on the human and  social

capital.   I  would address three concerns of the Budget  and

highlight one observation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are in the 40s, we are the baby boomers of

the 50s.  This is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>



significant  age mentioned in the recent debate  on  the  CPF

rates.  I would like to take this opportunity to highlight to

the Economic Review Sub-committee, tasked to make a review of

the  CPF  rates, to take into consideration that at this  age

group of 40, we have the old and the young with us [you  lao,

you  shao].  Our expenses are the heaviest at this age group.

Most  of  us  were married in our late 20s, and at  40s,  our

children are only either in the teens or in the tertiary  age

group, and we still need to support our active parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first concern. With the description of the turbulent

times,  harsh  volatile  economy,  fierce  competition,  fast

changes and disruption, not only the working adults, but  the

whole  family, are subject to this stress and strain in  this

kind  of  environment.  While the Government is steering  and

urging  the  people to prepare and adapt to change,  in  this

Budget I would like to urge the Ministries to be bold in  the

provision  of  support services to our people  at  the  local

community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the 1990s, we have seen many Ministries becoming

very   specialised  in  the  provision  of  various   support

facilities at the local community, together with the  various

voluntary  welfare  organisations.  We have  social  services

provided  by  the CDCs and various VWOs, through  the  Family

Service  Centres (FSCs), the Senior Activity  Centres  (SACs)

and  now,  I  understand, that there are  the  Neighbourhood-linked  Centres.   I  just  realise the  existence  of  these

Neighbourhood-linked Centres when I wanted to set up a Senior

Activity  Centre.  Very confusing indeed!   This  is  exactly

what  happened at the local community level.  When one family

is  in  need  of  help,  whether it  is  a  child  who  needs

counselling  or  getting home-based  services  to  bring  the

handicapped  or the sick regularly for medical  services,  or

seeking for financial assistance and advice, the family  must

know which "C", or centre, to go for assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am urging the Government to consider and allocate

additional  resources  for  an  integrated  centre  for   the

provision of social and community services to our families at

the local community.  There is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>



need for a one-stop service centre for families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second concern. Many of my colleagues have spoken on

this  issue  of unemployment and job-matching services.   The

rate of successful job-matching is dismally low for the above-40s,  as  highlighted by Dr Lee yesterday.  It  is  half  the

success rate of that of the younger unemployed, which  is  at

8%.   I  urge a budget be allocated not just for simple  job-matching  services but bold and innovative measures for  job-matching  agencies,  such  as NTUC,  MOM,  CDCs,  to  have  a

collaborative  joint  effort  with  employers'  associations,

unions  and career development and training professionals  to

help  chart  the  career  path for  targeted  groups  of  the

unemployed.   This is to enable them to acquire the  required

skill sets that will make them employable.  This is similarly

done  by  most forward-looking companies for their employees,

so  as  to  make  them more efficient and able  to  meet  the

demands of the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the meet-the-people sessions and house-to-house

visits, we could identify two main unemployed groups of above

40s  -  the  professionals and executives as one  group,  and

women  who are formerly working in the factories as the other

group.   The  GST  package would not be able  to  help  these

groups  if they cannot find alternative employment.   With  a

clear  and  identified career charted out and a  planned  and

identified programme for training for these distinct  groups,

effective changes and results can then be achieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge for more focus on the success rate of the

matching  services rather than the front-end  application  of

job-matching services by our various Government agencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third issue. Ms Indranee has spoken of the

encouragement of procreation.  The rate of 1.4 is  below  the

replacement  rate,  the lowest in history,  and  knowing  the

seriousness  and impact this has on our economy  in  time  to

come, I would like to encourage and convince the third group,

that is, married couples who have the first child and decided

to stop at one or two,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>



to  have  more children.  I would like to share  my  personal

experience.  I was very concerned of two things at that  time

-  commitment and expenses.  However, I was wrong.  I  really

enjoyed  motherhood  with  this  third  child  that  I  have.

Although  I  have  less time with him, his  two  other  elder

siblings keep him occupied and entertained and actively  help

me  to  bring up their little brother.  He is a most cheerful

boy,  always smiling, and is most alert as he would disappear

when  his elder siblings have a situation with me.  The power

of  play  and  learn  among  the siblings  cannot  be  under-estimated within a family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Government to re-broach the

issue  of  encouraging more children through sibling support,

as  the joy and benefits of the older children who gain  from

the experience are much more beneficial and long lasting.  As

this  is  a  Budget debate, I would like also  to  take  this

opportunity  to  urge  for  more direct  incentives  for  the

children,  to help families with young children  and  working

mothers,  ie,  increase the amount for the second  and  third

childcare  subsidies  and  adding the before-and-after-school

care subsidy.  I too would like to support Mdm Halimah's call

for  review  of  medical benefits for the children  of  women

civil servants.  This would definitely help in the course  of

bringing up the children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To end, I would like again to urge the Government

agencies and Ministries to think out-of-the-box to review and

realign the resources to provide closer and direct assistance

support  services to our families at the local  community  in

this period of change.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget.



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, I would like to propose the following measures

for the Finance Minister to consider.



<br><br><i>Economic Restructuring Shares for all Singaporeans</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many adult Singaporeans welcome the issue of the

Economic Restructuring



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>



Shares.  But some queried why the shares are issued to  adult

Singaporeans only.  Babies, children and teenagers  are  also

affected  by  the  GST increase.  In fact,  some  babies  are

bigger  consumers  than  the  elderly.   In  line  with   the

Government's  push to encourage families who  can  afford  to

have more children, we should recognise and reward those with

two or more children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, lower income families under the Small

Families  Improvement  Scheme should  also  be  rewarded  for

keeping  their families small so that more resources  can  be

channelled to their children.  Thus, I would urge the Finance

Minister  to  consider issuing Economic Restructuring  shares

for  children  and teenagers.  In this way, all  Singaporeans

will  understand  that  the  economic  restructuring  process

involves everyone.



<br><br><i>Pre-school programme subsidy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the 7.4% increase in budget for the

Ministry  of Education.  The expenditure is mainly attributed

to   general  education,  university,  polytechnic,  and  ITE

programmes.  But there is no support for pre-school education

programme.   The Government has always considered  pre-school

education  as the private sector's responsibility,  and  thus

has not provided much guidance and support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in recent years, feedback from many primary

schools   has   highlighted  that  the   different   teaching

approaches and standards of private pre-school operators have

produced  pupils  with  differing standards  of  reading  and

writing  skills.  This has posed difficulty and affected  the

pace of teaching in primary schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the importance of pre-school education in preparing

our  children  for  primary  school  education  must  not  be

overlooked.   While  the  Government  provides  subsidy   for

childcare and formal education, there is no subsidy for  pre-school programmes.  As education has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>



always  been a priority for our Government, I would urge  the

Finance Minister to consider providing pre-school fee subsidy

to  pre-school  pupils.   Presently,  pre-school  pupils  pay

between  $25 and $800 per month for their school fees.   This

poses  much  financial burden, especially for the middle  and

lower-income families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would urge the Government to consider

providing  subsidy  on  a  per capita  basis  for  pre-school

operators.   This will facilitate the recruitment  of  better

quality  pre-school teachers and the acquisition of essential

resources  to  improve the standard of pre-school  education.

The Education Ministry can also play a leading role to ensure

quality in pre-school education.  By working closely with pre-school operators, we will be able to provide good quality and

affordable pre-school programmes for our children.  This will

provide  a  strong  foundation for children entering  primary

schools.



<br><br><i>Property tax</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the implementation of GST has changed the taxation

philosophy  of  Singapore.  It is a  broad-based  consumption

tax, which provides the necessary revenue for the Government.

Therefore, we should review and gradually remove other taxes,

especially real estate and asset ownership taxes.  The  asset

enhancement  push  by  the  Government  has  encouraged  many

Singaporeans to be home owners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property tax is part of ownership cost, especially for

owner-occupied properties.  In order to continue to encourage

Singaporeans  to  own  their homes,  I  propose  that  owner-occupied  properties  be exempted from  property  tax.   Many

associations  and non-profit organisations have  also  voiced

their  concerns on the property tax of their premises.   Many

felt  that  the Government should show philanthropy  and  not

impose  property  tax on these non-profit and community-based

organisations.  I would urge the Finance Minister to  promote

philanthropy by taking the lead in removing the property  tax

for all associations and non-profit organisations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Season car parking charges</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in car parking charges has raised concerns,

especially among car owners in HDB estates.  Many  felt  that

season  car parking fee is part of car ownership cost,  which

HDB  car owners must pay monthly.  It is not related  to  car

usage  per  se  and  thus should be differentiated  from  the

URA/HDB  hourly  parking charges.  Many HDB  car  owners  are

delivery drivers or work in sales-related jobs.  The increase

in  season car parking charges will pose additional burden or

increase the business cost of their companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at present, HDB pays town councils $4.80 per car

park lot per month to maintain the car park, while collecting

a  monthly  season parking fee of $75 and daily  car  parking

charges for a lot.  Car parks are relatively maintenance free

if  properly  constructed.  To avoid  the  situation  of  HDB

having a deficit, HDB should build no-frills multi-storey car

parks   so  as  to  reduce  the  cost  of  construction   and

maintenance.   This  will  indirectly  help  to  reduce   car

ownership cost in the long run.



<br><br><i>Employment assistance scheme</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite efforts by the Ministry of Manpower and the

Community   Development   Councils,   many   retrenched   and

unemployed  Singaporeans  are  still  unable  to  find  jobs.

Skills,  age  and  attitude of these job  seekers  have  been

identified  as the main hurdles for them to be employed.   We

need to provide more employment assistance to help these hard-to-employ Singaporeans back to work.  One effective  approach

to  upgrade workers' skills and change their mindsets  is  to

promote  employer-led  initiatives under  which  the  workers

learn  key skills in their workplace.  But we must be focused

and strategic in identifying future industries for this group

of  Singaporeans.   For example, the service  industry  is  a

potential  and  attractive sector to provide  employment  and

skills upgrading for these Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to propose a two-pronged approach to

help these hard-to-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>



employ Singaporeans to join the service industry.  First,  we

need  to  attract more tourists to Singapore so as to  create

more  job  opportunities.  We must adopt  more  creative  and

innovative  strategies to expand our  tourism  industry.   We

have  to  carve out new niches and have new tourism  features

that would attract repeat visits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Government can, in the meantime, be the

surrogate  employer  for on-the-job training  and  employment

schemes   initiated   by  employers.    Many   hard-to-employ

Singaporeans  do not have money to enrol in training  courses

and  are  not  convinced that they will get employment  after

attending  these  courses.  As a result, the  present  skills

upgrading  and  traineeship schemes achieve limited  success.

We  must provide more support for employment-related training

schemes where workers learn skills while in employment.



<br><br><i>HDB lift upgrading programme</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of $325 million has been allocated for the

upgrading  of  HDB precincts.  But only $43 million  will  be

used  for lift upgrading.  The upgrading of lifts to  provide

for  easy  access at every floor is crucial in  view  of  our

ageing  population.   Besides the elderly,  the  handicapped,

disabled,  injured,  sick, bedridden and pregnant  women  are

also affected.  Many HDB flats that were built in the 80s  do

not have lifts stopping at every floor level.  If HDB were to

adopt the present pace of lift upgrading, these residents may

have to wait many years before realising the benefits.  Thus,

I  would  urge the Government to expedite the lift  upgrading

programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.



<br>6.08 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank all the

MPs  who  have  spoken and the many who  have  supported  the

Government's financial policy for this financial year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These tax changes are a vital part of our economic

restructuring efforts to secure economic growth and to create

new  jobs  for Singaporeans.  I stated the rationale  in  the

Budget   speech.   To  create  jobs,  we  need   to   attract

investments  and talent to Singapore.  To attract investments

and  talent,  we must bring down our taxes and, particularly,

we have to bring down our direct taxes - the corporate income

tax and the personal income tax.  That is the only way we can

be  competitive in attracting companies and talent here.  But

if  we  bring down our direct taxes, we are going to  have  a

shortfall in revenue and to make up the shortfall in revenue,

we  have to raise the GST.  This is not a quick fix for  this

year,  or for next year, but it is a strategic shift for  the

medium and long term for Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy that the growth this year is turning out

well.   But  that  is not the measure of  our  success.   Our

measure  is that the economy continues to grow 4-6% per  year

for   the   next   decade,  and  to  deliver  prosperity   to

Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much difference will this shift in taxes make? It

is  hard to quantify.  But it is quite clear that if you look

back  over  the last 17 years since 1985, had we not  made  a

strategic shift from corporate and personal taxes at  40%  in

1985,  progressively down to 33% after the recession in 1985,

then  down  to 28% when we introduced the GST, then gradually

down  to  around 25% today, we would not have  had  the  high

growth which we enjoyed, nearly 10% per year after 1997,  and

even  in the last five years, nearly 5% per year.  If we  had

stayed where we were, 40% in 1985, you can say you are  happy

to  pay tax, and maybe Mr Tan Soo Khoon will be happy to  pay

tax truly, but I do not know how many others would be, and we

would not be sitting pretty today.  So, in the same way as we

go  forward,  we have to bring our direct tax  rates  further

down, and we have to bring our GST up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some MPs, Mr Ong Kian Min and also Mr Low Thia Khiang,

have described this as a tax change which will only benefit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>



the  rich.  One of them put it colourfully, although not very

originally, by the rich, for the rich, of the rich.  But,  in

fact, this is a tax change to benefit the whole economy.  The

way   to  help  Singaporeans,  and  especially  lower  income

Singaporeans,  is not to tax the better off  Singaporeans  as

heavily as possible.  If that were the way to prosperity  and

nirvana, it would be quite simple.  I just push the tax rates

up,  40%,  50%,  60%, collect, redistribute.   Happiness  all

round.    But  if  you  try  to  do  that,  the  high  income

individuals  and  certainly  the profitable  companies  would

leave  Singapore together.  We would lose the jobs that  they

created  as  well  as the taxes which they  would  have  been

paying.  As Mr Matthias Yao put it picturesquely, you can rob

the  Sheriff of Nottingham, but the Sheriff has gone  off  to

Hong  Kong,  and  he  is on his way to Shanghai.   When  that

happens, all Singaporeans would be the worse off for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low income Singaporeans do not pay personal income tax.

So they will not benefit directly from the cuts in the income

tax,  but  they  will benefit.  They will  benefit  from  the

increased   growth,   they  will   benefit   from   the   job

opportunities that the tax cuts will foster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Soo Khoon says that GST is regressive. Yes, it

is.   But  we have to look at the whole tax system  which  is

very  progressive, and the whole tax system includes personal

income  tax, corporate income tax, property tax, which  is  a

wealth tax, and includes taxes on cars, which is a very heavy

wealth tax even after these changes, and it includes the GST.

After we have done these restructuring, after we have brought

the  corporate and personal taxes down to 20% and pushed  the

GST up to the horrendous figure of 5%, we will still only  be

collecting  $4  billion in GST, compared to  $12  billion  of

revenues from corporate and personal income taxes.  In  other

words,  direct  taxes will still account for three  times  as

much   revenue  as  our  GST,  and  two  thirds  of   working

Singaporeans do not pay personal income tax.  So if  we  take

the tax system as a whole even after this change, it will  be

a  very  progressive tax system, not just looking  at  it  in

itself, but looking at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>



it  compared  to  other tax systems in other countries.   For

example, in Britain, you pay tax almost from the first  pound

you  earn,  20  cents  per  pound, or  thereabouts.   But  in

Singapore, we say the first $20,000 is yours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let us not get carried away by rhetoric added in the

middle  of  the night.  If we account not just  for  the  tax

system  but  also  for the expenditure, the spending  of  the

Government, then you will see that, in fact, we have an  even

more  progressive system than that.  Because the Government's

social  spending is very heavily focused on the lower  income

groups,  our  housing  subsidies, our HDB  flats,  subsidised

rents,  free  education, almost free or very  cheap  tertiary

education, subsidised basic medical care.  If you  take  this

whole  package  together, in fact, for the vast  majority  of

Singaporeans,  the amount which you receive in benefits  very

far  outweigh the amount which you pay in tax, and  adjusting

the GST is just a small correction to this overall balance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did a calculation once that, for a household around

the  median,  $50,000  annual income, 4-room  HDB  flat,  tax

burden  overall,  all things considered, would  be  $7,500  a

year; benefits in kind, $18,600 a year, more than double.  So

I think we can stand up honourably and proudly and say we are

doing the right thing for Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs have asked me in this debate: will it work? Mr

Yeo  Guat Kwang raised this, Dr Chong Weng Chiew raised this,

and Mr Low Thia Khiang asked this too.  Will it work?  If you

cut  CIT, PIT, if you raise the GST, will business come?   We

cannot  be  sure.  As many MPs have pointed  out,  there  are

other factors at work, there is a pull of China, there  is  a

concern over the region, there is the smallness of our market

and  the  image  of Southeast Asia as being not  an  exciting

place  to be.  In fact, there is no image because it  is  off

the  radar  screen  for many investors.  But  all  the  more,

because of these negative factors, we must get our tax  rates

right  and register that if you do come to Singapore and  you

do make money, then it is worth your while to be here.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct taxes are the primary fiscal tool that the

Government can use to attract investments and talent.  It  is

not  everything, but it makes a difference.  Once we read the

Budget  speech,  EDB,  always fast off  the  mark,  went  and

knocked on doors in America to try and get new business,  and

they have reported that American companies have fed back that

they  have taken note of our Budget package.  They have noted

that we have made the right fiscal moves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Economist Intelligence Unit rankings have

placed  us  first in Asia, ahead of Hong Kong, and mainly  in

recognition  of  our planned tax cuts and  our  avoidance  of

budget  deficits.  And, recently, over the weekend, I  had  a

visitor from America who runs a think-tank.  He spent  a  few

weeks   in   the   region,  including   Singapore,   and   he

congratulated  me  on our Budget.  He said,  "You  are  doing

absolutely  the right thing, bringing down the direct  taxes,

shifting over to consumption tax, encouraging enterprise  and

investments."   If  he  thinks that, and  if  his  think-tank

reflects those views, I think other Americans will also  know

and it will make a difference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not do this, of course, then the chances of our

maintaining  4%-6%  growth  in  the  medium  term   will   be

considerably dimmed.  Granted that we have to do this, is the

timing  right?  Mr Iswaran and Mr Inderjit Singh  and  others

have  questioned the necessity of raising GST in  2003.   Why

not put it off?  After all, we have an offset package, so  it

is  not going to raise much revenue next year, so why not  do

it  later  on,  five years from now?  I think  we  are  at  a

turning  point.  Let us take all the measures we have  to  do

and  do them now, take our medicine and, if we can have a bit

of  sugar to go with it, let us have the sugar to go with it,

but the medicine is in place.  You say push it off - maybe  I

do  not have a deficit, can push it off; maybe the deficit is

not  permanent, push it off; maybe it is not a big  permanent

deficit,  push it off further; maybe I can afford a permanent

deficit because I have reserves.  Eventually, we will be in a

chronic position, unable to salvage our situation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason we are sitting pretty today is because we

have  not allowed this procrastination to happen and  allowed

ourselves  to drift into a weak fiscal position.  And  if  we

put  it  off  until  we  are really in difficulty,  and  then

implement a goods and services tax, will we be able to do  it

as  now,  with  a  comprehensive package to  make  sure  that

everybody can accept it and ease it in so that in five years'

time,  after  the package is over, the tax is in  place,  the

economy  has grown and everybody is all right?  If  I  do  it

five  years  from now, will Mr Low or even Mr Inderjit  Singh

stand  up and tell me, "Well, now we are in straitened times,

let  us  proceed, we will take it cold turkey,  no  need  for

offset  package."  I cannot see that.  So I think  we  better

take  it  now.   We have an offset package that  looks  after

nearly  every Singaporean.  Let us get over this  hurdle  and

then a new vista will open, and we have new possibilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some MPs, of course, have asked whether we need to raise

GST at all - Mr Low Thia Khiang, followed by Mr Tan Soo Khoon

and  a few others.  I would say that raising GST to 5% is the

anchor  move  in  this tax restructuring  strategy.   We  are

bringing down our direct taxes, we are bringing up GST.   The

key  parameter, the key shift, is to move the GST from 3%  to

5%.   We  fix that, then we will adjust the other parameters,

depending on what we can afford and how the economy turns out

and what the external circumstances are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have calculated that if we go from 3% to 5% with the

GST,  we  can  afford to bring down direct taxes  to  20%  by

FY2004  and, at the same time, we can afford to fund all  the

programmes we need.  It is going to cost us about $1  billion

in  revenue lost but, if we do our sums carefully and we  are

careful  with  our expenditures, I think we can afford  that.

If  it turns out that things are better than we expected  and

we collect more revenue than we estimate, I would say that is

a  happy problem.  But the solution to that problem is not to

reduce the GST.  I say keep it at 5%.  If I have surpluses, I

can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>



share  the surpluses.  If the economy does well, I  can  have

New Singapore Shares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, if my revenues are strong but it is a

competitive   environment  which   has   become   even   more

competitive, I have the flexibility to bring my direct  taxes

down further, below 20%, to 19% or 18%, depending on what  we

need  and how soon we need to move.  But it gives us options,

cards,  which  we can play in a game where we do  not  really

know  what  the rules are and every card we have,  we  better

keep in our pocket and save for a difficult moment.  This  is

not yet a difficult moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This increase in GST, we expect, will raise $1.3 billion

extra  of  tax revenue per year.  This is assuming growth  is

about  4%.   If  growth  is more, then  there  will  be  more

revenue.  If we forgo this increase in GST, that means we are

giving up $1.3 billion of revenue a year.  In other words, we

will have to reduce Government development expenditure by 15%

in  order to balance the Budget.  And $1.3 billion is roughly

equal  to  one  year  of  HDB upgrading  and  public  housing

subsidies.   It  is  not  a  small  sum.   We  will  save  on

buildings, we will save on renaming, we will make  sure  that

all our little expenditures are well justified and, where MPs

have questions, whether it is A*STAR, SPRING Singapore or the

furnishings in some buildings, raise them in the Committee of

Supply  and argue about them.  The Ministers will defend  and

justify what they have done.  And I fully sympathise with the

sentiment that we should be very careful when we spend public

funds.   Whether  it  is $1, $100 or $100  million,  that  is

Government money.  Do not spend it unless you absolutely have

to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when we built this Parliament House, we had a

special  committee to make sure that it did not  end  up  too

plush,  and  Mr Tan Soo Khoon will know.  He was Chairman  of

the committee.  If you go around and you find the furnishings

somewhat  spartan, you will know it is the good work  of  the

former  Speaker.  And that is what we should do with all  our

buildings.   But  even if I turn all our  buildings  back  to

Central Supplies Office



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>



furniture and put MPs on Government issued benches,  it  will

not come to $1.3 billion.  So we have to do this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Soo Khoon raised several basic points about the

package.   First, he questioned whether the 1994  package  of

GST, plus direct tax reductions, was in fact revenue-neutral.

He  showed us a table, he raised some questions but, if I may

refer Members to the table, I think it does not show that the

package  was  not  revenue-neutral.  What we  said,  when  we

introduced GST in 1994, was that for the first five years  we

will  be  revenue-negative, because there are offsets,  there

are expenditures to ease it in.  After five years, we hope to

be  revenue-neutral.  If we look at his Table  2,  column  3,

Actual Surplus, we started off with an actual surplus of $8.5

billion  in  1994,  it  went down  in  1995  to  $6  billion,

thereafter it fluctuated: $2 billion, $5 billion, $1 billion,

$5  billion and $4 billion.  So it shows that the surplus has

gone  down.   Our  expenditure has  varied  some  too.   But,

overall, it does not show that our surplus has gone up.   So,

on  this  basis,  there is no reason to believe  it  was  not

revenue-neutral.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table 1 shows that the revenue from GST was more than we

expected.  Yes, that is true.  It is true because the economy

grew  more than we expected.  We did not plan for 10%  growth

per  year.  We were lucky we enjoyed it.  We did not plan for

5%  in  the  middle of the crisis, but we  enjoyed  it.   So,

revenue  from GST was higher than we expected.  But so,  too,

the  discounts on the personal and the corporate income taxes

were higher than expected.  Because revenues were buoyant, so

the percentage discount was correspondingly bigger.  There is

no  column for the discount there because it was not  in  the

IRAS  annual report.  But if you had computed them, you would

have  seen that they too would have grown and, overall,  they

would,  more  or  less, have broken even.   So,  the  figures

sounded  good, the table looked interesting, but I think  the

conclusion was mistaken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: going forward, will we be lucky to have

a table looking like this again?  Since 1994, we have enjoyed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>



high  growth.   Therefore, revenue was buoyant.  Furthermore,

expenditures  could  be  capped - the population  was  young,

social  spending  was  not  high,  we  did  not  worry  about

structural  unemployment,  many  pressing  demands   on   our

exchequer.  The question is: do we believe that we are  at  a

turning  point,  that  the  world  has  changed,  that  going

forward, what was will not again be?  If we believe that  the

world  has changed, then can we really not increase  the  GST

and  raise the extra $1.3 billion?  On the other hand, if  we

believe,  as Mr Tan says, the economic pie will expand,  then

we  have no problem.  If he is right and I am wrong, then the

Government  will  be in a happy position of sharing  out  the

surpluses.  If he is wrong and, unfortunately, we are  right,

this  is a turning point and we did not take the bend and  we

went  off  the  road, then our problems will  be  very,  very

serious.  So, if we want to ponder the alternatives, even  if

we are not sure, I think we make this fundamental move now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong wants the Government to promise not to

increase the GST for five years.  In 1994, we promised  this.

When  we  introduced  the GST, we said  3%,  five  years,  no

change.   This  time, I can honestly say that a GST  increase

within the next five years is not in my plans, and not in the

Government's plans.  But I cannot promise this because,  this

time,  it  is a different situation from 1994.  In  1994,  we

were  going  swimmingly, the region looked good, we  did  not

expect  10% but we expected steady growth, we calculated  our

sums, we felt safe for five years.  Now you can have the most

massive  super computer, you cannot predict what is going  to

happen in the next five years.  Will there be a war in  Iraq?

What  will  happen on the West Bank between the Israelis  and

the  Palestinians?   What will happen with  Laskar  Jihad  in

Indonesia?  If you could tell me that all those would  be  no

problem,  I  could give you a promise.  You  cannot,  and  we

cannot promise, but it is not our plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have calculated our offset package based on 5% GST

and  a  certain amount of ERS and other items, and  we  think

that it will offset more than five years.  So, that is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>



the   basis  on  which  we  are  calculating.   But,  if  the

kaleidoscope turns, that is a new ball game, and it  is  only

fair that we warn everybody.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raising the GST to 5% will be sufficient for us to cut

our  corporate and personal income taxes to 20% and  we  will

not  need  to raise the GST again just to move the  corporate

and  personal  income taxes down to 20%.  We have  calculated

that it is enough.  We are prepared to take the loss, and  we

will be able just to keep our noses above water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the GST increase raise prices and cut consumption?

Several  MPs,  such as Mr Heng Chee How and Mr Iswaran,  have

raised  this question.  I would say that if we did not offset

the  GST  increase, we would have a problem.  It happened  in

Japan.   They  went  from 3% to 5% at an inopportune  moment,

people  held  back  on  spending, the  economy  went  into  a

tailspin.   But  we have an offset package  which  more  than

offsets  the  GST for five years and, in fact, it  is  front-loaded.  So, we are giving the ERS over three years to offset

spending for five years.  The offset package will restore the

households' purchasing power and may even cause some  of  the

households  to bring forward their spending because,  on  1st

January  2003,  if  you  have the  offset  package,  you  can

withdraw $300 and spend it.  I would not recommend it because

then you would not get the bonus shares but, if you want  to,

you can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the GST raise prices? Some, but I do not think it

will  be  a  big impact.  As Mr Low Thia Khiang pointed  out,

hawkers  are  not doing that well and will  not  be  able  to

increase  prices that much.  I think he understands what  the

real market balance is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we introduced the GST in 1994, there was a little

bit  of  a  blip  in inflation but it was hardly  noticeable.

Inflation  was about 2%, it went up to 3% for one year,  came

back down to around 2% and stayed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>



there  for a long time.  This time, we are expecting zero  or

negative inflation in 2002, and the GST increase is only  2%,

compared to 3% in 1994.  So, the impact should be less and it

should  not trigger inflation.  But, if it does, or if  there

are  some shops, hawkers or unscrupulous profiteers who  want

to   take   advantage  of  this,  we  have  a  committee   on

profiteering  who should name them, shame them and  highlight

alternatives  where people can go to.  Mr  Chan  Soo  Sen  is

chairing  this committee.  I am happy to learn  that  he  has

invited  Mr  Chiam  See Tong who has agreed  to  sit  on  the

committee.   Mr Steve Chia has also agreed to  serve  on  the

committee.  So, it is all entirely aboveboard.  We will  show

you  the  statistics.  We sample, we go  and  measure  prices

across the board, and you will see the statistics.  If it  is

up,  it  is up.  If it is not up, I hope you will be able  to

vouch for it that this is what the real situation was.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on GST, there are many misperceptions. Mr

Leong  Horn  Kee pointed out some of them and Mr Hawazi  too,

and  encourage  us to do more to dispel misconceptions  about

the  GST,  and especially the misconception that GST involves

tax  on  tax, and because it is on many stages of production,

although  you  say it is 5%, at the end of the day,  the  GST

adds up to more than 5%.  I have prepared a chart (Cols. 1089-92)  which  tries to explain this. I would like  to  ask  the

Clerk  to  distribute this to Members and I  would  take  you

through it briefly.  [Chart distributed to hon. Members.]

<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20020514/20020514-HA-0741091.gif">Table - How the GST works: an illustration of how 5% GST is collected from sale of a TV set (Cols. 1091-1092)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us just look at the left side of the chart. There

are  two  examples.   On the left, there are  two  scenarios:

one,  where  the retailer is GST-registered;  one  where  the

retailer  is  not  registered.  Let us, just for  simplicity,

look  at  scenario  A.  You are buying a television  set,  it

costs  $300, without GST.  You pay the retailer $300, GST  of

$15,  so it is $315.  The retailer paid the manufacturer $200

for  the  set.  His mark-up was $100.  The manufacturer  paid

the parts supplier $100 for the set.  The manufacturer's mark-up was $100.  Now, how much GST was paid?  The parts supplier

paid $5 of GST to IRAS, because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>



his price was $100, he paid $5.  The manufacturer paid $10 of

GST  to  IRAS because his price was $200, 5% of $200 is  $10.

But  because the manufacturer paid the supplier $100 plus $5,

so  he  claimed from IRAS a refund of $5, so the manufacturer

paid  $5.   The retailer pays $15 of GST, which he  collected

from  a consumer, to IRAS.  But the retailer had already paid

$10  of  the GST to the manufacturer, so he gets a refund  of

$10  from IRAS.  So the total amount of GST collected by IRAS

on the television set, from the start of the process, when it

was  components all the way to the end when it was  delivered

to  the consumer is $5 plus $5 plus $5, it is $15.  In  other

words, there is no tax on tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if the retailer was not GST-registered, he has a

small  shop, then we look at the right-hand side of the page.

In  that case, he does not collect GST, but he has to pay $10

of  GST  to  the manufacturer.  And having paid  $10  to  the

manufacturer, he marks up his product, and sells it for $310.

He  did  not  have to deal with IRAS.  The consumer  got  the

television for $310, instead of $315, and the SME still  gets

the  same mark-up as before.  In other words, whether the SME

is  registered or not, you only pay GST once on the  product.

Furthermore,  if  the  SME is not registered,  he  is  at  an

advantage, compared to the registered company.  And when  the

tax went up from 3% to 5%, his advantage grew bigger, because

now  he  can  sell  for $5 less.  Previously,  it  was  a  $3

difference.  This explains why it is not a tax on tax.  It is

fair, it is efficient, it taxes just once.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address another basic issue which Mr Chiam

raised:   why is this Government obsessed with surpluses  and

reserves?  I am not sure that I would say we are obsessed but

I  think we are highly preoccupied with it.  We have a reason

to be highly preoccupied because, unlike other countries they

can  always fall back on timber, oil, gas.  Somebody said oil

wells but, alas, it was only a slip of the tongue.  The  only

resources  we have are our people and our financial reserves.

That  is  all. The stability of our Singapore dollar  and  of

your savings and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>



your  CPF  money depends on our maintaining healthy financial

reserves and fiscal surpluses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strong financial position instills investor

confidence,  it  instills confidence in  the  Government,  it

instills  confidence  in  the  Singapore  economy,  it  gives

Singaporeans  confidence in their country.  That  is  why  we

must maintain the reserves, gradually build them up, and  not

lightly draw upon them.  But we never say never.  There  will

be occasions when we need to tap on the reserves in extremis.

It  could  be  an  emergency.  It could be  a  dire  economic

situation.  It could be a security emergency, and you have to

expand Government's spending and you cannot raise taxes,  and

you have to draw on the reserves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You never know how long the bad times will last and you

should be slow to squeeze the trigger because once you  spend

them, it will take you very long to build them back up again.

With the reserves, we have the flexibility and the capability

to respond to the needs of Singaporeans in difficult times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had an off-Budget package last year. We said $11.3

billion.   Nobody blinked an eyelid in Singapore.   No  other

government  can make an offset package of 7%  of  GDP,  $11.3

billion,  and  you do not need to worry where the  money  has

come from.  We could do it last year because we had reserves,

and  even then, only because we had been lucky.  Since  1997,

despite  the economic difficulties, we were able to build  up

surpluses  and we had something put aside which we could  use

when we needed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we did not have that, we would not be able to have

that flexibility to help Singaporeans.  In any case, I really

ought  to point out that Mr Chiam got his sums wrong  on  the

FY2002  Budget surplus, because we are not expecting a  small

surplus,  as he has said. After we have made the tax  changes

and  made  the  offset  package, we  are  expecting  a  small

deficit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me deal with the offset package. Mr Iswaran

and Mdm Ho Geok



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>



Choo  said  that one's housing type was not a good  criterion

for  distributing the ERS.  I agree.  It is not ideal. We had

considered  the  alternative, which is to  use  income.   But

income  also is not ideal and raises other problems.  Let  me

just go through them briefly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, if you had no earned income, it does not

mean  you  are poor.  Your husband may be looking after  you,

your wife may be looking after you, you might be living in  a

big  house,  you may have wealth.  So, to go  on  a  person's

income is not quite a reliable measure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, we have to use the household income. You cannot

look  at the income of the person, but you have to look on  a

household basis, which means that I have to check who are all

the  members  of the household, how much do they individually

earn,  tally  it all up, add it together, all of which  means

using IRAS numbers, and then informing the household that, "I

have  added up all your incomes and it adds up to this amount

of  money, and this is what you are entitled to".  I think it

would   be  very  complex  and  rather  intrusive  and   many

households would prefer us not to add their incomes  together

and tell us how much it adds up to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having considered that, we decided it is easier for us

to go back to housing, but we will not make fine distinctions

between  5-room, 4-room and 3-room in our main  component  of

our  offset  package, which is the ERS.  Let us  give  nearly

everybody  $1,200.  But at the top, if you are  living  in  a

fairly  large  private property, which is  what  the  $10,000

annual  value  means, then we will give  you  $600  worth  of

shares, instead of $1,200 worth of shares.  It is a rough and

ready measure, but it is approximate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did we even give $600, some people asked, maybe they

do  not deserve.  Well, because I cannot be sure that if  you

are living in a condominium that you have a high income.   As

many MPs have pointed out, you may be living in a condominium

and you may be a retiree and you may need the money.  So,  as

a rough



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>



and  ready  measure, we said, "$1,200, and at the  top,  $600

worth", not perfect but reasonable and practical.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our fall-back solution, in case anybody says, "It is not

fair  to  me" is that if any household is not fairly  treated

because  of  your  circumstances - for  example,  you  are  a

retiree  living in a terrace house - then you should approach

your CCC.  Your CCC will study your case and help you through

the CCC assistance scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if you are a low-income Government civil

servant,  retired, then we are going to revise the  Singapore

Allowance.  We have not decided how much yet, but if you just

do some rough sum, even if it is $10-$20 worth of a revision,

that  is  worth a lot, in terms of extra GST payable, because

that is $10-$20 per month.  Therefore, we can promise that if

you  are the lower-income, lower half of the population,  the

offset  package will look after you for at least five  years.

If  you feel that it has not, see your CCC and they will sort

it  out.   I  can  say  this  with some  confidence  because,

actually, the people who are the lowest income should have no

problem.  Once we have ERS, it should be sorted out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will just do one more sum. Let us say you are earning

$2,000  a month.  2% extra of GST means $40 extra of GST  per

month.   For  a year, it is $480 extra of GST per year;  five

years, $2,400 of extra GST.  Husband and wife, ERS is $2,400.

Even  not counting any service and conservancy rebates,  even

not  counting any rental rebates or any Singapore  Allowance,

the  ERS alone will cover the entire GST increase for you for

five years, if your household income is less than $2,000, and

there  are  two  adults in the household.  So the  low-income

Singaporeans  will already be all right, just  based  on  the

ERS.  The people who might not be all right are the ones  who

are not quite such low-income, but earning between $2,000 and

$3,600  and  they  may fall between if  they  are  living  in

private  property, in which case, come to the  CCC,  we  will

help you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are earning more than $3,600 - just now, Dr Wang

Kai Yuen said who is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>



the group who suffer - he will look in vain, because even  if

you  are  earning more than $3,600, even if you  are  in  the

middle-income  group, the package has been  constructed  such

that for nearly everybody, you also have at least five years'

worth  of  offsets.  If you add in the savings on  your  road

tax,  in  fact,  it will be more than five  years'  worth  of

offsets if you own a car.  Of course, if you smoke and drink,

that is a different arithmetic, but I advise you not to smoke

and to drink less.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net effect is that we have looked after nearly

everybody.  We  have not done utilities rebates  deliberately

because, instead of giving household utilities rebates, which

means they have to spend it on utilities, we have given  them

Economic  Restructuring Shares.  It is cash.   It  is  better

than cash because it earns good interest.  If you want to use

this  to pay your utilities bill, that is fine.  If you  want

to save this, that is fine.  If you want to use this for some

other  urgent  requirement,  your  children's  school  needs,

uniforms,  your  parents' hospitalisation expenses,  that  is

fine too.  So what we have given actually is something better

than an utilities rebate.  And the total amount we have given

you,  I  think, is eminently reasonable for a long transition

period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Irene Ng asked why we did not give a higher

weighting  for the poor.  Our answer is that this package  is

meant  to offset the net increases in the taxes, particularly

the  GST.  It is not meant as a wealth-sharing exercise.   It

is  not  meant to address income inequality.  We  have  other

schemes  to  do that.  At the right moment, under  the  right

circumstances,  we  will do - whether  it  is  New  Singapore

Shares, whether it is HDB upgrading programmes, whether it is

lift  upgrading.  We have other schemes to help lower  income

groups,  specifically.  But this one is specifically designed

to  offset the GST package and to make sure that everybody is

covered during the transition period.  Even then, because  of

the  rental  and service and conservancy rebates,  the  lower

income  groups, in terms of the number of years of additional

tax offset, are somewhat better off than the middle and upper

income



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>



groups.   If  you look at the table which I distributed  with

the  Budget  Statement, for the rental flats  you  have  8-10

years'  worth of offset, whereas for the lower middle income,

you   are  talking  about  6-8  years  depending  on   family

circumstances.  So I think that we have been fair, given  the

objective of the exercise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very popular subject for many MPs has been small and

medium  enterprises.  The complaint has been that this Budget

has done nothing for the SMEs and they have not benefited  at

all.   In fact, they do benefit, because the decrease in  the

corporate income tax also benefits SMEs.  Furthermore, we had

a  big  package last year with a significant component  which

was focused on SMEs, the offset package in October, which was

really a mini-Budget.  Members may have forgotten because  it

was  six  months ago, and some were not here.  So I ought  to

remind you that there were rental rebates, which went  up  to

30%  of rentals.  There was lower foreign worker levy,  which

will  be reviewed at the end of the year.  There was property

tax rebate, $8,000 worth of property tax, the result of which

is that many HDB shop-owners pay no property tax at all.  And

there was a 2-tier corporate tax system, which was introduced

in  the  last  Budget, the effect of which is to  reduce  the

corporate tax payable by small and medium enterprises by half

or  even three-quarters.  So while this Budget does not  have

additional specific items, significant steps have been taken,

which are still in effect, helping the SMEs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should distinguish between two categories of

SMEs,  which  may get confused together.  One,  the  existing

SMEs  in  the  retail sector, which are hurting  for  various

reasons.  And, two, the newer SMEs in the technology line who

are looking for venture capital, angels, risk money, who want

enterprise, a suitable environment and so on.  Their problems

are  different.   The  existing SME  retail  sector  faces  a

structural  problem,  because there is an  excess  supply  of

shops  and  not enough business.  It is a legacy of  history.

In older housing estates, MPs know we have often one shop per

70 flats, because we built the shops in order to resettle the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>



shopkeepers.  Now, the population has thinned, aged or  moved

out  and there is no business.  Whereas in the newer estates,

you  are talking about one shop for 120 flats.  So it is more

flats   per  shop  and  easier  to  do  business.   So   some

rationalisation  is unavoidable and HDB has schemes  to  help

shop tenants who want to exit their business to exit and they

get  some ex gratia payment, and then we can restructure  and

redevelop  the neighbourhood centres and do something  better

of it.  We have done a few and if they are successful we will

do some more.  We cannot solve this problem overnight, but  I

hope,  over  time,  we  will  be  able  to  improve  business

conditions for the SMEs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new SMEs, the start-ups, they are different. They

are facing difficulties securing funding, especially the tech

start-ups,  and they want the Government to step forward  and

produce the money.  Well, the Government is not good at being

venture capitalist.  We are not good businessmen, as  we  are

regularly  reminded  in Parliament, and therefore  we  should

really stay out of it.  There is truth in the criticism.   We

are  not  good  businessmen.  We have to  let  companies  run

commercially and where we have to put our money in,  I  think

we should be very careful not to be left with lemons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can, at best, kick start the process on a small

scale.  EDB has a venture capital outfit.  Temasek also has a

small  venture capital outfit.  They want to expand,  I  say,

"Be careful.  You do not have the skills."  Seed the process,

yes.   Kick  start  it.   But as soon as  possible,  let  the

private  sector take over.  Let them do it.  They know,  they

can judge.  It is not just a matter of thumping up the money.

It  is also a matter of knowing whom to back, which are  good

risks, who will be promising, how to guide the project as  it

grows  along the way so that it does not go wrong and you  go

bust.   These are all very specialised skills.  You need  the

touch, you need the experience.  The Government is not in it.

But  even  if  you  had  venture capital  in  Singapore,  not

everybody will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>



get  funding.  In Silicon Valley, only one project out of  20

gets  funding.  That is why the projects which do get funding

are   promising,  because  there  is  ruthless   competition,

survival of the fittest.  Only the best get funding, and even

then after being funded, many of them fail.  So if we try  to

short-circuit this Darwinian process and say I will give more

generously,  let us hope a hundred flowers will  bloom.   Are

you  sure?   You may have thrown your money away and  planted

weeds.   So you have to be very careful talking about venture

capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have to be very careful in favouring small and

medium enterprises for Government contracts.  It sounds good,

it  is  very popular, but it can result in inefficiency.   If

you  want to cut back on Government spending, this is not the

way to do it.  Tender, best bidder, best qualified to provide

the service, most efficient, best quality, wins contract,  he

supplies  the  Government.  Countries  which  have  tried  to

favour SMEs have found that it leads to great inefficiencies.

The  Japanese  have  tried,  the Germans  have  tried,  other

countries have tried.  It is better to have schemes  to  help

the  SMEs  get  started, help them improve their productivity

and  capability, and then they have to compete and hold their

own.   And  if  they cannot hold their own,  if  they  cannot

compete,  then the market has to sort it out.  We  hope  that

many will succeed, but we cannot expect none of them to fail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the future of our economy does not just depend on

the SMEs.  We will rationalise the traditional SMEs.  We will

promote new SMEs to start, but we also need new growth areas.

We  also need MNCs.  We also need major companies, to  create

new jobs to replace jobs which are being lost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GLCs are part of the solution, not part of the

problem.   Many  MPs have asked whether the  GLCs  have  been

stifling  entrepreneurship, crowding out local  players.   Dr

Amy  Khor  asked this.  Mr Inderjit Singh says, why  not  the

Government simply divest GLCs.  I would if it were so simple.

It  is not the mission of Temasek or of the GLCs to crowd out

small and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>



medium  enterprises.   We  gain  nothing.   Our  job,  as   I

explained,  is to have companies which are strategic  to  our

economy, or which have regional potential to grow and  become

international players.  Other companies not relevant, Temasek

will progressively divest when the conditions are right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the borders, some overlap is inevitable, and it is

especially troublesome with statutory board companies in  the

process  of  being completely privatised but not quite  there

yet.   Members mentioned PWD Consultants.  There are a couple

of others which are in the process of being privatised, where

moratoriums were given, and there is some feeling  that  this

is  not  quite at an arm's length relationship yet.  But  our

policy  is  that we should maintain a strictly  arm's  length

relationship  between  such  companies  and  their  statutory

boards.  In fact, we should cut the umbilical cord as soon as

possible and separate them, either divest them off completely

or  they  should go and be put under Temasek  or  under  some

other  Government agency.  So it is not directly held by  the

statutory  board  and  there  is no  incentive  for  transfer

pricing  or  some  non-transparent arrangements,  which  will

cause  problems  and inefficiencies and difficulties  to  the

private sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not post senior civil servants to the GLCs. Dr

Wang  Kai Yuen says we do it for talent development.  I think

he  was  being  polite.  We do not do it.  Mr Inderjit  Singh

also  said  we  have senior civil servants posted  there  for

career  rotations.  We do not do that.  The GLCs  have  their

own  staff.   They recruit their own.  They  recruit  on  the

market.   They find the best they can get and if  the  people

are  not  good  enough,  they  have  to  go.   They  are  run

commercially by their managements.  They are not run  by  the

civil servants.  The civil servants have enough to do without

going into other business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh cited vigorously problems of GLCs

stifling   entrepreneurship,  crowding  out  local  companies

through   unfair  practices,  or  dominating  and   predatory

practices,  compelling foreign companies to work  with  GLCs.

It sounded



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>



awful  but,  unfortunately, he did not give any  particulars.

So  I would encourage him, if he has any specific information

of actual cases, to let me have the evidence.  I will expunge

his  name  and  pass  the  evidence  along,  investigate   it

personally and put it right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us be quite honest and adult about this.

Competition  is  a fact of life.  Even if we  privatised  the

GLCs and the Government washed its hands altogether and found

a  good private owner to own and manage it, they would  still

be  formidable  competitors  to  the  SMEs.   They  are  well

organised.   They  are  bigger.   They  have  the  depth   of

management expertise and they are able to deliver  a  service

or  a  good and get the job done.  So whoever owns the  GLCs,

the  SMEs  are  still going to face severe competition.   The

broader question for us, as a Government, is not whether  the

GLCs  win  or  the SMEs win.  The question is: are  the  GLCs

competing  fairly?   Is the result that  the  most  efficient

company  succeeds  and  delivers the  best  service  for  the

economy   and   the   best  value-added   and   the   highest

productivity?   Or is the GLC winning because there  is  some

inside   track,   some   unfair  advantage,   some   improper

information which they are taking advantage of and  therefore

clobbering the SMEs and the private companies?  If there  is,

they  are harming the economy and we must put a stop  to  it.

If  there  is  not, and they are competing fairly,  I  say  a

certain amount of robust competition is unavoidable.  But  it

is  not  their job to go and look for small business.   Their

mission is what we have defined for Temasek and Temasek  will

have a charter which will be published soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, CPF. Mr Inderjit Singh argued for lower

contribution  rates in the longer term.  It was  one  of  his

wish-list items.  Mr Othman Haron voiced concern that workers

might face difficulties with their housing commitments if CPF

contribution  rates  were lowered.  I agree  with  Mr  Othman

Haron.    I  also  agree  with  Mr  Matthias  Yao  that   the

fundamental objectives of the CPF should not be diluted.   He

put it in a very neat and succinct form yesterday and I would

like to quote him in toto because this is something which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>



bears  repeating and which I think Singaporeans  need  to  be

reassured of.  We are not going to muck around with the  CPF.

CPF,  as  Matthias  said,  is  for  retirement,  housing  and

healthcare.   Everything  else should  be  secondary  and  we

should  not  use CPF as a macro-economic tool  to  alter  the

money  supply  or  disposable  income.   Workers  should   be

receptive to changes that might be necessary if they are  not

to  be priced out of a job.  So it may be necessary for us to

adjust the CPF scheme but any changes made will be phased  in

carefully  and  we  will give as much time  as  possible  for

Singaporeans  to  adjust.  And I may add  what  I  have  said

before,  that  we  promise to restore it  to  40%,  and  that

stands.  It may take us some time, but we will do it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like to address a few points briefly. On

medical benefits, Members made their sentiments unambiguously

known,  many  lady MPs and a few men too.  I  should  explain

that  under the new Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient  (MSO)

scheme,  in  fact,  we  have essentially  equalised,  because

whether you are a male or a female officer, what you  get  is

one  extra  percent on your CPF in Medisave.  You  have  $350

worth  of  outpatient  allowance,  which  you  can  use   for

yourself.  At the end of the year, if you do not use  it,  it

goes  into  your  Medisave.  The men can  use  it  for  their

children, the women, cannot.  But at the end of the  year  it

goes  to  the women anyway.  So essentially, it is the  same.

For the older schemes, we have not changed it yet.  There  is

still  a distinction.  I am sure we will discuss that in  the

Committee of Supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On HDB parking charges, this point will be dealt with

amply,  I  am quite confident, when the Committee  of  Supply

discusses Mr Mah Bow Tan's budget for MND.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On older workers, this is a separate problem, not

addressed  by our tax restructuring package.  The problem  is

not  funding.  It is not availability of training programmes.

It  is  a  matching of workers with vacancies.  We  have  the

People-for-Jobs Traineeship Programme.  It has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>



trained about 2,000 unemployed workers and executives.   Some

workers  are still not taking advantage of it.   But  let  us

pursue  these  programmes.  Let us try and get them  to  work

before introducing or thinking about more permanent measures,

like subsidies and rebates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Dr Amy Khor and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked the

Government to take care of Singaporeans who are struggling to

cope  with  economic restructuring.  Yes, I fully agree  that

this is indeed the basis for the generous offset package  for

the  GST,  and we have given special attention to  make  sure

that the lower-income group will not be worse off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have addressed all the major points

raised.  I have not fulfilled all the wish lists, but perhaps

it  is just as well.  Because, for example, Mr Inderjit Singh

asked for a 30% reduction in the price of all properties.   I

would  suggest to him to consider this very carefully because

it  means  that all his residents, who are also my residents,

will  suffer  a 30% reduction in their property  values,  and

that  is  not likely to be considered.  And if we  halve  the

petrol  tax  and  ERP  charges,  foreign  workers'  levy  and

property  tax, what he has not told you is that  Santa  Claus

comes and the bill arrives the next day, and the Government's

bill  to do all this may be a much higher GST than 5%,  maybe

6%,  maybe 7%, maybe 10%.  So before you sign on, better find

out what the deal is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a complete response to the challenges which

face us, as Dr Amy Khor and others have pointed out.  Dr  Amy

Khor  said it is just one piece of a jigsaw puzzle.   She  is

right.   The ERC's recommendations are yet to come.   We  are

working  on  it.  There are sectoral policies  to  deal  with

financial  services, manufacturing, other  services  to  deal

with  SMEs, to deal with helping the older workers cope.   We

have  a  human resources package working on it.  We  have  to

deal with the CPF and wage issues.  It will take time to work

these  out and implement them.  But the first step is  fiscal

reform, and this we have done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our competitive pressures are increasing, but we can

rise up to the challenge,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>



and  I  think we have strong reasons to believe that we  will

succeed.   Our  political and social  stability,  our  market

access   to   major  economies,  our  pro-market   Government

policies, our ability to adapt to changes quickly - these are

traditional  strengths - we have repeatedly cited  them,  but

they  remain  valid and they will help to see us through  the

next period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are still competitive. We are acting now, not

because  we  already have a problem, but because we  see  the

problem ahead.  World-class companies still find Singapore  a

good  place  for  investments.  We have  had  a  big  project

between  AMD  and UMC to build a 15th wafer fab  plant  -  $7

billion.   We  are attracting regional HQs from Dupont,  IBM,

Toyota.   We  are  building capabilities in  emerging  growth

areas,  supporting R&D, investing in higher education, trying

to  anticipate the next wave, but not just on one front.   We

are  doing  the right things - getting growth and investments

and  making  the tax changes to put our economy  on  a  sound

footing, to enjoy economic growth beyond the short term.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with Mrs Yu-Foo that we must take heart,

and  we  must  not  be discouraged.  There is  reason  to  be

confident.  With the economic restructuring package, we  have

made  the  first step, and we can look forward to facing  the

future with hope and confidence.  [Applause.]



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, can I have your permission to

seek clarifications from the Finance Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, first clarification. The

Finance  Minister has said that to put off the  GST  increase

now  will result in a chronic situation.  Can he clarify what

does he mean by chronic situation?  I wish to remind him that

GST  is  not the only way the Government collects taxes.   We

are  not talking about reducing corporate and personal income

taxes to zero.  There is still something to collect.  On  top

of that, we have property tax, customs and excise tax, import

duties,  motor  vehicle taxes and betting taxes.   The  motor

vehicle tax



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>



collection is even more than the GST in fiscal year 2001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, second clarification. The Finance Minister also

said  that  the increase in GST in this Budget  will  provide

options  to  the  Government.  I wonder  whether  it  is  the

Government's financial policy to always budget for a surplus.

If  my estimate is right, I think the Government will end  up

with  quite a huge surplus in 2005.  My question is,  are  we

over-taxing?   Is the Government over-taxing the  people  for

what is needed by the Government?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third clarification, Sir. The Finance Minister also

said  that  the world has changed, and we are  at  a  turning

point.   The turning point, to me, seems that now Robin  Hood

cannot  rob the sheriff of Nottingham.  So he robs  from  the

"Roberts"  on  the street.  I do not quite  understand.   The

turning point, it seems to me, is that, from now, we have  to

accept  that  the  rich will get richer, and  the  Government

would  even have to do more to woo them and to persuade  them

to stay here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Finance Minister to explain why the

Government  does  that and how these rich people  affect  our

economic growth in one way or another.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it has been

a very long debate.  So I will try and keep my answers short.

What  do  I  mean by a "chronic" deficit.  I mean a situation

where you find yourself running a deficit.  You hope it  goes

away the next year.  It does not go away.  The next year,  it

still  does  not go away and you are unable to fix  it.   The

European  countries, most of them, are in a chronic  deficit.

Hong  Kong  now has a deficit which they fear is  structural.

They are hoping it is not, but it has not gone away.  We have

not reached that situation.  In my judgment, if we reduce the

direct and personal taxes and do not offset the GST, we  will

risk a chronic deficit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member thinks that we are in a happy position, and

we will have an enormous surplus in 2005.  I do not know what

are the bases for his econometric



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>



projections.  I hope he is right.  If he will share them with

the Ministry of Finance, maybe we will update our model.  But

our  model does not show any such enormous surplus.  It shows

pressure on the Government budget, because we are needing  to

spend  more  for  healthcare, for education, maybe  even  for

housing;  certainly investments in transport, trains.   These

have  to be funded.  We can either not build them or  we  can

make these adjustments and fund them within our means, and we

have chosen to do the second.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a turning point. The rich are getting richer.

That is happening the world over.  Some of the richest people

in  Asia are in communist China.  In fact, the rich ones  are

now  being invited to join the Communist Party.  Because that

is  the  way the economy is moving.  Where are there no  rich

people?  Well, in North Korea, there are very few.  In  Cuba,

there  are  also very few.  In North Vietnam, there  are  not

many, but in South Vietnam there are quite a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>



number.  So, that is the way the world is going.  How  do  we

assure  a  good  life for the not-so-rich  Singaporeans?   By

making  conditions in Singapore conducive so that  successful

people will come here, start business here, do business, live

here, and provide employment and grow our economy, and enable

many  other  Singaporeans also to enjoy the new  economy  and

live  in this new environment.  That is the turning point  we

are at today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of the

Government  for the financial year 1st April,  2002  to  31st
