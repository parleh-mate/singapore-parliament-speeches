<div align="center"><b>POLICE JUNIOR OFFICERS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(New structure and salary scales)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Home Affairs)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the

Parliamentary  session  in  October,  1971,   the

Minister for Finance informed the House that  the

Lee  Soo Ann Committee's recommendations  on  the

structure  and  salary  scales  for  the   Junior

Officers  and  Constables of the  Regular  Police

Force   had   been  accepted  in   principle   by

Government  and would be implemented in  the  new

fiscal year on 1st April, 1972. He stated that as

soon   as  the  principles  of  conversion   were

resolved,   the  new  salary  scales   would   be

implemented.  The  House was also  informed  that

pending  implementation of the new salary  scales

on  the  1st  of April this year, Government  had

decided  that the Junior Officers and  Constables

should  be  given  with effect from  the  1st  of

November,  1971, an interim allowance of  10  per

cent  of  salary  and  of all  allowances  drawn,

except   Public  Utilities  Board   and   Housing

Allowances.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to announce that Government has

accepted   in   principle  most  of   the   other

recommendations  of  the Lee  Soo  Ann  Committee

Report.  Officials of my Ministry and the Finance

Ministry have been working closely together and a

formula of conversion has now been worked out and

approved  by Government. The new total emoluments

will be computed on the following basis:

<pre>

              Salary as at 1-4-72

                       +

           Allowances to be abolished

                       +

       Interim  allowance of 10  per  cent

       (made up of 10 per cent  of  salary

       and of all allowances drawn, except

       P.U.B, and Housing Allowances)

       Convert to the nearest higher point

       in the new scale

                       +

           Increment credits(if any)

                       +

      Allowances to be retained (if any).

</pre>



The  conversion  will come  into  effect  on  1st

April,  1972, and, as from that date, payment  of

the 10 per cent interim allowance will cease. The

conversion to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>



the  new  salary scales, including the allowances

to  be  retained,  will cost  the  Government  an

additional $3.2 million per annum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 5,220 Junior Officers and Constables in the

Regular  Police Force, excluding members  of  the

Gurkha Contingent and the Guard and Escort  Unit,

will be affected by the conversion. Those holding

the  rank  of Corporal and below will be emplaced

on  the  new  salary scale for Constables.  Staff

Sergeants and Sergeants will be emplaced  on  the

new  scale for Sergeants. Sub-Inspectors will  be

absorbed  as Assistant Inspectors, who will  also

be  known  as  Station  Inspectors.  All  serving

officers will convert to the new salary scales as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) those with the School Certificate or

equivalent  qualifications will  convert  to  the

appropriate  new  scale in  accordance  with  the

conversion formula and progress up the  scale  in

the normal way;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) those with Secondary Il/Ill or equivalent

qualifications  will convert to  the  appropriate

new  scale  in  accordance  with  the  conversion

formula. They will not proceed beyond $425 in the

new  scale  for Constable; $505 in the new  scale

for  Sergeant  and  $690 in  the  new  scale  for

Assistant Inspector (Station Inspector),  as  the

case  may be, until such time as they obtain  the

School Certificate or pass an examination  to  be

conducted by the Ministry of Home Affairs and the

Public  Service  Commission and  accepted  as  an

equivalent to the School Certificate,  when  they

will be allowed to cross the bar at these points;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) those without Secondary II but with

specialist    qualifications,   e.g, bandsmen,

helmsmen  and engine drivers (about 170 of  them)

will convert in the same way as for category  (b)

above;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) those without Secondary II or specialist

qualifications (about 800 in number) will convert

to the appropriate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>



new  scale  in  accordance  with  the  conversion

formula and be dealt with as follows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has accepted the recommendation that

serving   officers  without   Secondary   II   or

equivalent qualifications should be converted  to

the  new  salary  scales and  stagnate  at  their

respective points of conversion. Of the  800  men

who  do  not  have the Secondary II or specialist

qualifications,   340  would  be   eligible   for

retirement in the normal course of events  before

1st July, 1974. These 340 men will convert to the

new  salary scales and remain at their respective

conversion points until they retire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining 460 men will convert to the new

salary  scales  and be retired on enhanced  terms

specifically  provided in Section 9  (1)  of  the

Pensions  Act as recommended by the Lee  Soo  Ann

Committee Report. Retirement under this provision

gives an enhanced pension factor of One over five

hundred   (1/500)   of   an   officer's    annual

pensionable emoluments for each complete month of

pensionable  service, as compared  to  a  pension

factor  of  one over six hundred (1/600)  for  an

officer  who  retires in normal circumstances  on

account of age or for medical reasons. It is  the

intention  of  Government that the retirement  of

these  460 men will be so phased out that  actual

retirement will commence on 1st April, 1973,  and

be  completed by 30th June, 1974. Those  who  are

physically  fit  will be offered employment  with

the  Guard  and Escort Unit, which will  by  then

have been reorganised into a statutory board  and

run   on  commercial  lines,  if  they  take   up

employment with this statutory board,  they  will

be  eligible, in addition to their pensions,  for

the  full salary paid by the board. Efforts  will

also  be  made to assist those in Police quarters

to find alternative accommodation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1401 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I request the Minister for Home Affairs

to  inform  the  House as to  how  many  political

parties  there  are on the Register  of  Societies

today, and whether they are alive and functioning?

If  they  are  not,  will  the  Minister  consider

introducing amending legislation to the  Societies

Act  to  remove  all these dead-wood organisations

from  the Register, thereby protecting the  people

from  the  dupery  of so-called political  parties

which  resuscitate when general elections approach

and  promise the people nirvana-plus? Sir, if this

mischievous  practice  of  political  parties   of

merely  securing their registration is allowed  to

continue unchecked, our City State will in no time

hold such an assortment of rackets that our people

may  turn  politically frigid, and astute visitors

to  our  country leave in bemused bewilderment  at

the  spectacle  we  offer. Sir,  in  the  name  of

rational  freedom,  I call upon  the  Minister  to

avoid turning our beautiful Republic into a museum

of political parties.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Prof. Wong Lin Ken):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as on the 17th of March

this   year,   there  are  15  political   parties

registered on the Register of Societies. They are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Singapore Chinese Party, formerly Malayan

Chinese  Association, Singapore Branch, registered

on the 26th September, 1950;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Persatuan Melayu Singapura, formerly

Persatuan  Melayu Semenanjong, i.e., the Peninsula

Malays  Union,  registered on  the  2nd  February,

1952;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Partai Rakyat, Singapore State Division,

registered on the 3rd December, 1956;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Angkatan Islam, formerly Pan Malayan Islamic

Party,  Singapore, registered on the  6th  August,

1958;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Workers' Party, registered on the 30th

January, 1961;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) People's Action Party, registered on the 18th

February, 1961;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Pertubohan Kebangsaan Melayu, Singapura,

formerly  Pertubohan  Kebangsaan  Melayu  Bersatu,

Singapura,   i.e.,  the  United  Malays   National

Organisation,  Singapore, registered  on  20th  of

February, 1961;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) United People's Party, registered on the 14th

July, 1961;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Barisan Sosialis, registered on the 15th

August, 1961;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) Parti Kesatuan Ra'ayat, i.e., the United

Democratic  Party, registered on  the  18th  June,

1962;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11) Singapore Indian Congress, formerly the

Malaysian  Indian Congress, Singapore,  registered

on the 7th August,. 1962;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(12) Alliance Party Singapura, registered on the

17th February, 1966;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(13) United National Front, registered on the 6th

March, 1970;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(14) National Party of Singapore, registered on

the 26th February, 1971;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(15) People's Front, registered on the 21st May,

1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of these 15 parties, the following parties

have not complied with the Societies Act requiring

their  constitution to be amended to  provide  for

membership  to be confined to Singapore  citizens.

These parties are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Partai Rakyat, Singapore State Division;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Angkatan Islam;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Workers' Party; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also relevant to note that of the 15 listed

parties, Parti Kesatuan Ra'ayat, i.e., the  United

Democratic  Party, has ceased to  function,  while

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>



United  People's  Party and the  Singapore  Indian

Congress are apparently inactive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 6 of the Societies Act, the

Registrar  of  Societies  has  powers  to  declare

societies as deemed to cease to exist should  they

be  unable  to  furnish him with  proof  of  their

existence.  The  Registrar of  Societies  has  not

taken action against dormant political parties and

those  which have not complied with the  Societies

Act.  In  view  of the fact that the Registrar  of

Societies  has sufficient powers to  remove  dead-wood political organisations, there is no need  to

amend  the Societies Act to provide him with  such

power.  In any case, there are politicians outside

this Parliament who do not share the same down-to-earth views about dormant political parties as the

Member for Changi. They believe in flogging a dead

horse  to  life  oblivious  of  past  records   of

undistinguished performance.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Singapore becoming a museum of political

parties,  I am afraid this is part of history.  As

to  the  possibility of confusing  the  people  of

Singapore because of the large number of political

parties,   I   submit,  our   electorate   is   an

intelligent electorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Hear! hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, the Minister has said that

the  Registrar of Societies has got the full power

of deregistering any political parties if they are

defunct  or  inactive. I do not know why  no  such

action has been taken. Can the Minister explain to

the House?



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> The reason is very simple.

We  do  hope that there will be some other  people

who would like to revive dormant political parties

and save them the bother of registration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> In view of the explanation, I

beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1151*.(* The same amendment also stood in the, names of Messrs Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi, J. F. Conceicao  and P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, Sir, I wish to speak on

the  Police Force. You will recall that during the

debate  on last year's Budget, I pointed out  that

some  constables and Police officers were rude  to

members  of  the  public. At that  time  the  then

Minister  expressed concern over  this  issue  and

promised to take appropriate action to rectify the

position.  I  am  glad  to note  that  since  then

members of the Police Force have shown a new style

of  behaviour in carrying out their services.  The

Police have been very active in some campaigns  to

bring  about a better public understanding of  the

Police Force. For example, during Police Week they

have  put  up  road  safety  exhibitions  in   the

community   centres  to  bring  about   a   better

relationship  and an improvement  in  co-operation

between the people and the Police, and to make the

people  understand that the policeman is a  friend

of  the people. These are some achievements  which

are  praiseworthy. Undoubtedly a  rapport  between

the  Police  and  the  people  is  meaningful   in

Singapore,  because  this, will  promote  the  co-operation  between  the  people  and  the  Police,

thereby  enabling  the Police  Force  to  be  more

effective   in  crime  prevention  and  detection.

However, in the interests of the public, I wish to

bring up two points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Police Week should be held annually

in  order  to continue to improve the relationship

between the people and the Police. It is only when

there  is  co-operation between them that  we  can

hope  to  achieve  greater  stability  and  better

social  order  in our country so that  our  people

will be able to live in peace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in recruiting Police officers we must

recruit more citizens. Sir, the Minister has  said

in a Statement earlier



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>



on  that there has been a considerable improvement

in the remuneration of Police officers. Therefore,

I  should think that this new salary structure  is

enough attraction to Singapore youths to join  the

Police  Force. If this should fail to attract  our

own  youths, then we have to make a further review

and  to study the causes. I would also like to ask

the  Minister concerned how many non-citizens have

been recruited into the Police Force.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan) (in Malay):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Government has launched several campaigns, such as

the  Industrial Safety Campaign, Pedestrian Safety

Campaign  and Road Safety Campaign. To ensure  the

safety  of members of the public on the roads  and

to  prevent  them  from accidents  which  are,  of

course,  avoidable, several road  safety  measures

have  been  provided and a lot of money  spent  on

them.  For  example, overhead  bridges  have  been

constructed  and zebra crossing lines  painted  on

the  roads.  All  these  are  for  the  safety  of

pedestrians. But such campaigns and measures  will

be  meaningless if all kinds of road users, either

pedestrians,  motorists or motor  cyclists,  still

meet with accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One contribution to road accidents is that

children  are allowed to fly their kites  anywhere

they like. Sometimes these kite flyers can be seen

by  the  roadsides, running across roads,  and  in

many  other places which are dangerous. This is  a

hazard to motorists and, apart from accidents that

can happen to them, the kite flyers themselves can

be  knocked down by cars. The time has  come  for

the  Commissioner of Police to take firm  measures

against these kite flyers.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, how many

policemen  have resigned from the Force?  Quite  a

number,  I  think;  enough to  create  a  staffing

problem that can be described as critical.  May  I

ask  the  Minister concerned why has this  problem

been allowed to deteriorate to such a state? Is it

because of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>



lack  of  esprit de corps in the Force? Or  is  it

because  of the bullying attitudes of the superior

officers who, in the execution of their duty,  may

tend  to  be highhanded, or is it because  of  the

poor  pay structure? The Minister has announced  a

new pay structure for the Police Force, and it  is

most probable that Police officers will welcome it

very much. Therefore, I hope they will work harder

in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime ago we heard of a few Police officers

who were sacked and then reinstated all because of

a  few missing Playboy magazines, which are banned

in  Singapore. Why was it that no action was taken

against the person who was in possession of  those

bad  magazines?  Can it be said  that  the  action

against these four poor Police officers could have

a  demoralising  effect in the Police  Force,  and

thereby causing some to resign?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is encouraging to note that the Police Force

is  going  to  be  modernised and reorganised  but

those  responsible  for the reorganisation  should

take  the humane values into consideration. I hope

that  in  the computerisation of the Police  Force

the policemen will not exist as mere digits in the

minds of those responsible for the reorganisation.

The  chances of promotion in the Republic's Police

Force  should not only be given to people  holding

requisite qualifications, but equal chances should

also  be given to those with long service and with

good records.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also ask why at present the traffic is in a

chaotic  state?  What  is the  number  of  traffic

policemen at present in the Force, and how many of

them  are on traffic duty at any one time? Why  is

it  a  common sight in Singapore's roads  to  find

traffic  policemen on duty in pairs, in threes  or

in  fours?  It is time that more traffic policemen

were  on  foot  duty at junctions of  busy  roads,

particularly  in narrow lanes where  most  of  the

traffic offences are committed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong) (in Mandarin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, please permit me to ask the Minister

a question. This is in relation to the security



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>



of  the Central Fish Market in Jurong. The Central

Fish  Market in Jurong is the only venue  for  the

auction  of  fresh  fish. Every day  thousands  of

people  do  their  fish business in  this  market.

Because of the great number of people entering and

leaving the market, it is inevitable that some bad

hats mingle themselves with the crowd. As a result

there  have  been cases of fighting, Xamb1ing  and

theft in the market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received complaints from the fish

merchants  in the market to the effect  that  over

the past few months the security of the market has

deteriorated. There has been an increasing  number

of thefts in the market. Fish packed in crates are

simply stolen. For every crate of fish stolen  the

fishmonger loses about $100 to $200. If  it  is  a

crate  of  prawns,  then the loss  will  be  about

$1,000.  Those  fish merchants who  were  affected

have  reported the cases to the Police,  but  were

told  that they could not do anything. I  am  told

that  usually  the  theft  occurs  before  auction

begins. This is the time when the businessmen  are

so  busily occupied with the preparations for  the

auction that the thieves move in. I would like  to

ask   the  Minister  whether  he  can  send   some

policemen  there between the hours of  10.00  p.m.

and  2.00  a.m, to maintain order and security  in

the fish market.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Sir, first let me say how

much  I  appreciate the statement from the  Member

for  Sembawang that the Police Force has  improved

in  its  courtesy to the public. I am very pleased

to  hear  that.  The Member has  also  raised  the

question that we should, in fact, make the  Police

Week  an  annual affair. The Ministry has this  in

mind,  and will certainly give the proposal  every

serious  consideration. I am also very pleased  to

note  that  the  series of 12 Police  Week  shows,

which  began  last year and will continue  in  the

present year, have produced the desired effect  of

establishing  a  better relationship  between  the

Police  and the public. The House can rest assured

that the Police Force will be instructed that good

Police relationship is not just a matter of Police



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>



shows. This   should  be  a   continuing   daily

experience between the Police and the public.



<br><br>3.00p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also raised the question

of  the recruitment of non-citizens. I think  what

he  has  in  mind is the recruitment of Malaysians

into  the  Police Force. The reason  for  this  is

simply  that  under  the previous  salary  scales,

before the present revision recommended by the Lee

Soo Ann Report, it was found impossible to recruit

Singapore  citizens into the Police  Force.  I  do

share his hope that with the improvement in salary

scales  and also the conditions of work,  we  will

have more Singaporeans applying to join the Police

Force in our next recruitment exercise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member has also asked for the

figures  of Malaysians recruited. I am  unable  to

give him the exact figure, but if he wishes he can

ask  an  Oral  Question  later.  If  he  will   be

satisfied with a rough figure, it is in the region

of  600.  I would like to add that the recruitment

of  foreigners is only an interim measure, and  we

hope  that in the future we do not have to recruit

people  from  outside Singapore  to  fill  up  the

Police Force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan raised the

question  of  public  safety,  particularly   with

regard to kite-flying. Under section 14 (e) of the

Minor Offences Act (Chapter 102), it is an offence

for  any  person to fly a kite which obstructs  or

interferes with the traffic in any public road  or

with  the use of telephones wires. The flying  of

kites is a seasonal past-time indulged in by young

and old throughout the Republic. I believe it is a

common feature in the Geylang Serai area. However,

to-date there has been no occasion for the  Police

to  take action against these persons because they

have   not  obstructed  or  interfered  with   the

traffic,  and  there  has  been  no  complaint  of

telephone  wires having been damaged.  The  danger

arising  from this past-time is caused by children

running after kites that have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>



been cut loose. I can assure the Member that  the

Police  will do all it can to prevent  any  hazard

arising out of flying of kites, and I do hope that

the  Member will also urge people who wish to  fly

kites to be more careful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are also a few questions raised by the

Member for Anson. I believe he wanted to know  how

many  policemen have resigned, and I can give  him

the  figures. The number of resignations of junior

officers was 122 for 1969, 246 for 1970,  and  235

for  1971. From the beginning of this year to  the

15th March, 1972, there were only 12 resignations.

For  senior  officers, the number of  resignations

was  12  for 1969, 19 for 1970, and 24  for  1971.

From  the  beginning of this year  till  the  20th

March, 1972, there were only nine resignations.  I

think the House is fully aware of the reasons  for

the  resignations, namely, the salary  scales  and

the  conditions of work. All this has been removed

by  the recommendations of the Lee Soo Ann Report,

which  the  Government has accepted in principle.

It  is  hoped that with the improvements in salary

scales and conditions of work, there will be  less

resignations in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member for Anson is also concerned

with the state of traffic in Singapore. If I heard

him   correctly,  he  described  it  as   chaotic.

Although  traffic  on  our  roads  appears  to  be

apparently chaotic, it is, in fact, not so.  There

are  two  vivid patterns in the flow of traffic  -

into the city in the morning peak, and out of  the

city  in  the evening peak. During these  periods,

the  flow of traffic is congested, and I  have  no

doubt that this congestion must have given rise to

the  impression  that  the  flow  of  traffic   is

chaotic.  With more vehicles on the  roads  during

peak  hours, the journeys to and from work  create

great demands on road space and certain delays are

inevitably   experienced.   This   is   a   common

occurrence not only in Singapore, but in  all  big

cities  in the world. The Government is trying  to

overcome   some   of  the  problems   of   traffic

congestion  by making improvements to the  network

of roads and to traffic management



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>



and  enforcement schemes. It is also relevant  for

me  to  point out that normally we do  not  deploy

three or four traffic policemen on traffic duty in

one  spot, except in places where we have recently

introduced the box junction system. I quite  agree

that we do need more traffic policemen, but I hope

that as all the vacancies in the rank and file are

filled, the position will be improved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong raised the question of

security in the Central Fish Market in Jurong.  As

this  matter has just been pointed out  to  me,  I

will  certainly  look into  it  to  see  that  the

situation is improved.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister  has not replied to my question regarding

the Playboy magazines.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> If the Member is referring

to the particular case of Playboy magazines, which

I  think  he  has  in  mind, that  case  has  been

investigated into and dealt with according to  the

instructions of the Attorney-General's Chambers. I

believe   the   office   concerned   has   already

reinstated the officers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I thank the Minister for his answers, and  I

beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1251.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every family has a law and every nation has

a  statute of laws. A nation enacts laws in  order

to  maintain order in its society. However, if the

enforcement of the law is ineffective,  or  worse,

if  the  law  is abused, there will be  disharmony

among  members  of the family and they  will  lose

confidence  in the enforcers of the law.  If  this

goes on, the law will be flouted and in the end it

will  be very difficult to maintain law and  order

in  the  society. If I may use a colloquial phrase

it is like an entanglement of the strands of jute.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human beings are like social animals. They live

together  but  because of civilisation  they  have

advanced  both socially and materially. Therefore,

with   the  rising  desire  and  expectation   for

progress they have differed in their mental  make-up.  This,  together with the different levels  of

education  that they receive, we find  that  there

are  the capable and the incapable, the stupid and

the  intelligent. Therefore, even in a very simple

society, there is bound to be a certain number  of

people  who are evil-doers. Among them  there  are

those  who  have breached the law once  or  twice,

while   there  are  others  who  are  incorrigible

criminals. They break the law in order to  achieve

their ulterior motives. They try to create trouble

and  cause  chaos. The Government,  in  order  to

safeguard the interests of the people, has to  set

up  police stations, and send policemen and  other

officers  in  plain-clothes for patrol  duties  to

prevent these evil-doers from breaking the law and

to help the people to cope with emergencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, some members of the public in my

constituency  have complained to  me  that  people

have been wrongly arrested and beaten up by plain-clothes    officers.   I    have    carried    out

investigations into such complaints and have found

them  to  be  true.  Hence, I would  like  to  say

something about this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is said that whenever the

Police  arrest a suspect, he will first be  beaten

up to be taught a lesson. Sometimes he has to make

a statement under duress. If this kind of approach

is  used against proven gangsters, I would be  the

last  to object. On the contrary, I feel that more

severe punishment should be meted out against such

bad  elements to stop them from doing bad  things.

However, the indiscriminate beating-up of suspects

can   sometimes   involve  innocent   persons.   I

therefore  feel  that whenever the  Police  arrest

certain    suspects,   they   should   first    be

interrogated and investigations made.  The  Police

should check their identity to find out whether or

not  they  have any previous criminal records.  If

they  have no records, then investigations  should

be carried out at the scene of the crime.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>



And  if  the  suspects  are found  innocent,  they

should be released. If they are found guilty, they

should  be  duly dealt with. Those who are  guilty

will  not  resist  arrest,  and  will  submit   to

punishment.  In  this way, the  innocent  will  be

spared corporal punishment. It is important to see

that  there is justice in the enforcement  of  the

law. Then the country as a whole will be peaceful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, plain-clothes Police officers

are    charged   with   the   responsibility    of

safeguarding the peace of the country. They should

not  only  be  given privilege to  be  armed  with

revolvers  but also the privilege to use  them  in

self-defence. However, the use of firearms  should

only  be  resorted to when they are in very  great

danger.  In  a normal situation the Police  should

not use firearms.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be justice in the enforcement of law

and  order.  This  will promote  a  close  rapport

between  the  Police  and the  people.  We  should

educate the people to be more friendly towards the

Police Force. To accomplish this, I feel that  all

suspects should be thoroughly interrogated  before

any  action is taken against them. If this is  not

done,  there will be a miscarriage of justice  and

there  will  be hostility towards the  Police.  If

suspects  are  taken  to the Police  station,  and

there  are sufficient grounds to find them guilty,

they  should be charged accordingly.  I  hope  the

Minister  will take note of what I  have  said  so

that  a  close rapport can be established  between

the Police and the public.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me

first say that I share the views of the Member for

Paya Lebar that law and order should be maintained

and  that justice should not only be done  but  is

seen to be done. The main thrust of his debate  is

that  some  plain-clothes officers have beaten  up

suspects  and  that he himself  has  conducted  an

investigation  into the matter. I  appreciate  the

Member's good intention. However, I would like  to

say that if there are any complaints, there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>



is  a  proper  procedure to  deal  with  them.  He

himself  has conducted an investigation,  but  the

results  of his investigation cannot be the  basis

for  disciplinary action. If he were  to  lodge  a

complaint, and if it is found that what he says is

true,  then  disciplinary  action  will  be  taken

against  the  officers concerned. Police  officers

are   not   above  the  law.  There  are  specific

provisions  in  the Penal Code which  make  it  an

offence for persons, including Police officers, to

use  force  of  any kind to extract confession  or

information which may lead to the detection  of  a

crime. Any person so aggrieved by such action  can

lodge  complaints against the officers  concerned,

and    every    complaint   will   be   thoroughly

investigated. If the investigation reveals that  a

particular   officer  is  at  fault,  disciplinary

proceedings  will  be  taken  against   him.   Any

instance  of misconduct on the part of any  Police

officer  will not be condoned and will  always  be

viewed  very seriously. Police brutality will  not

be  tolerated  even  if, after investigation,  the

suspect is found to have committed the offence. In

fact,  if  a person is found to have committed  an

offence,  the chances are that he will be  charged

in  court. If the Member for Paya Lebar has lodged

a  specific  complaint, I am sure the Police  will

certainly look into the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am  very  satisfied with the Minister's answer.  I

beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood on the Order

Paper Supplement -

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1601.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this subhead concerns the Vigilante Corps

which  has  a  glorious  record  ever  since   its

inception   in  1964.  The  Vigilante  Corps   was

actively discussed during the Committee of  Supply

last year. I do not propose, therefore, to go over

the  same ground which has been covered by Members

last  year.  I  merely wish to seek  clarification

from  the  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for  Home Affairs: who is really in charge of  the

Vigilante  Corps, and whether there are any  plans

to  re-activate the Volunteer Vigilante Corps  or,

for short, the V.V.C.? At present there are only a

very  few volunteers remaining in service and  the

V.V.C, is, therefore, very inactive. Nowadays  we

seldom  see them patrolling the streets or helping

at  community centre functions or participating in

community     activities    in     the     various

constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, sometime ago, Members of

Parliament were asked to submit their views on the

reorganisation  of the V.V.C, in their  respective

constituencies.  I  wonder what  conclusions  have

been  made  as  a  result of these suggestions  by

Members. Are there any plans to revive the  V.V.C.

and  to make it play a more effective role in  the

interest of the community? In my view, in order to

achieve  this  the V.V.C, members  should  not  be

confined to guard duties only but should  also  be

encouraged   to   participate   in   the   various

activities organised by the Citizens' Consultative

Committees or by the management committees of  the

community  centres in the various  constituencies.

Moreover, the Citizens' Consultative Committees or

the management committees of the community centres

should  have a measure of control over the  V.V.C.

members in their community centres. At present the

community  leaders have first to  seek  permission

before they can obtain the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>



services  of  the V.V.C. This formality  should  be

dispensed with wherever possible, otherwise it will

be  a hindrance to any plan to promote an effective

role of the V.V.C, in community activities.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr L. P. Rodrigo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may  1  thank  the Member for Mountbatten  for  the

praise  he has accorded to the Vigilante Corps, it

is  true  that  the headquarters of  the  Vigilante

Corps has circulated a questionnaire to Members  of

Parliament   for   the  purpose   of   accumulating

information and data to see how the performance  of

the  Volunteer  Vigilante Corps  can  be  improved.

However,  not all the questionnaires circulated  to

Members of Parliament have been returned and, as  a

result,  the  headquarters  is  still  having  some

difficulty  in  working out plans  to  improve  the

organisation  as  well as the  performance  of  the

Volunteer Vigilante Corps. This provides me with an

opportunity  to prevail upon Members of  Parliament

to kindly let me have this data sheet to enable the

headquarters  of the Vigilante Corps  to  plan  out

this  reorganisation. The specific suggestions made

by the Member are, in fact, the subject of various

considerations  in the questionnaire,  all  with  a

view  to  undertaking this proposed reorganisation.

And  let  us hope that with the reorganisation  the

services  of the Volunteer Vigilante Corps  may  be

utilised   without  having  first  to  obtain   the

approval  of  the  headquarters  of  the  Vigilante

Corps.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am quite

satisfied  with the answer given. I  beg  leave  to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker.

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1651*.(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to congratulate the Minister for Home

Affairs in setting up the Central Narcotics Bureau.

It has a corps



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>



of  efficient officers who recently have done  much

to  expose  the  drug-pushers,  and  to  confiscate

quantities of MX pills, heroin and ganja, all in  a

short  space  of  time after its  setting  up.  The

officers have been very efficient in their  efforts

to abolish drug trafficking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I regret to say that the people who were

prosecuted for trafficking or peddling in MX  pills

and   ganja  have  been  given  only  light  prison

sentences. In the Straits Times dated 4th March, it

was  reported  that two persons were convicted  and

fined  $150  each for possession of ganja.  In  the

Straits  Times of 22nd March, a labourer was  fined

$25  for possession of ganja. Mr Speaker, Sir,  the

penalties given to these persons are very light  in

comparison  with the penalties for other  offences.

They  should  be given the maximum  penalty.  If  a

person  is  convicted for causing damage  to  other

people's  property  under the  Vandalism  Act,  the

sentence  can  include the rotan.  Why  cannot  the

punishment  by  the  rotan be extended  to  persons

trafficking  in MX pills and other  drugs?  I  feel

that the Minister for Home Affairs should amend the

laws  so  that these people will be given a heavier

punishment,  such as a longer term of imprisonment,

including caning.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the newly

formed  Central  Narcotics  Bureau  has  been  very

successful in smashing the drug peddling  rings  in

the  notorious  areas. However, the  Bureau  should

expand  its staff by recruiting some young men.  At

present  the Bureau consists of older men who  rely

on  tips  more than anything else. The younger  men

can  penetrate  into these drug rings  and  thereby

expose  them, and perhaps they may catch  the  "big

fish" behind this menace.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, what action has been taken by the

Bureau  to  prevent University boys  from  becoming

addicts?  I  understand that some of our University

boys are taking pills to keep up with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>



"in-crowd". It is time that some of the vermin  was

eliminated before it spreads like a plague  in  the

University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometimes when one takes ganja, it activates

the  mind. Because of this, the University students

take   ganja  in  order  to  concentrate  on  their

studies.  But  this has a bad effect on  the  human

body,  and will finally ruin the body. There is  no

doubt  that  this  is bad and dangerous  for  their

future. Therefore, the Government must take  action

on this serious matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also understand that hippism is associated

with drug-taking and if long hair is characteristic

of  hippism, then it is time that we acted  on  our

youngsters who sport long hair. Even junior doctors

have long hair! We must check this trend because it

affects  the society. We must destroy the poisoning

effects  of  the demoralised Western society  being

accepted  here  by  our local  youths  as  being  a

fashionable thing. These youngsters who  keep  long

hair  must  be pulled up and charged.  Parents  too

should do their part in discouraging their children

from  keeping  long hair. It is very important  for

the Minister to take action on this matter. He must

not  prolong the matter. Otherwise our  youths  and

also  the  citizens of Singapore will be spoilt  in

the future. It is very bad for the State.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, very rarely

do  law  enforcement agencies get praises from  the

public.  And I am quite sure that what the  Members

for  Kampong Kembangan and Anson have stated  about

the  efficiency  of  the officers  of  the  Central

Narcotics  Bureau  will  reach  the  ears  of   the

officers  concerned  and spur  them  on  to  better

performances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the sentences passed on the traffickers

of  ganja  as  administered by the law  courts,  my

Ministry  is  aware of the situation. In  fact,  my

Ministry and the Ministry of Health are at the very

advanced  stage  of making new laws  to  deal  with

traffickers in dangerous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>



drugs, including ganja. It is too early for  me  to

reveal  the details now, as it would not  be  quite

proper.  But I can assure the Member that  the  new

laws  will  provide  for enhanced  punishment  and,

possibly, even flogging. I must say that the matter

is  in  the discussion stage and nothing  has  been

finalised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has raised the question of

effective penetration of drug syndicates.  This  is

being  done. It is not in the nature of  things  to

reveal how we are going about it because this would

jeopardise  all  our  operations.  However,  I  can

assure  the  Member that we are interested  in  all

drug syndicates, big or small.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards long hair and hippism, 1 think the

public is aware that the Singapore Government  does

not   encourage  the  sporting  of  long  hair  and

certainly  not hippism. We are doing  what  we  can

against  the  problem of long hair. The  Member  is

aware that there is no law against long hair.  What

we  can do is to provide various kinds of sanctions

against the sporting of long hair in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, with the

assurance  given by the Minister, I  beg  leave  to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) That the sum to be allocated for Head 1401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1658.

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1701*.

(*The same amendment also stood in the names of Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi and Messrs Sim Boon Woo and P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment refers to the Singapore

Citizenship Registry. The work of the Registry  has

increased  quite  a  lot.  We  all  know  that  the

question  of  citizenship has, over  the  last  few

years, been debated enthusiastically by many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>



Members  in the House on behalf of the  people  in

the  various  constituencies. At  that  time,  the

Minister for Home Affairs was a Backbencher and he

was  speaking  On  behalf of  the  people  in  his

constituency. He asked the Minister for Labour  to

consider more sympathetically the situation  faced

by  the  people in his constituency. Allow  me  to

quote  the  Member for Alexandra, who is  now  the

Minister for Home Affairs, when he spoke  in  this

House.  This is in Hansard, Vol. 29, No. 12,  col.

802, dated 20th March, 1970:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say how much I share the

views  of the Member for Toa Payoh on the question

of eligibility of citizenship and the way by which

citizenship is granted to applicants? Speaking  on

the   basis  of  my  own  experience  in  my   own

constituency, I feel that, perhaps,  there  should

be  some relaxation and more compassionate ways in

which    applications    for    citizenship    are

considered.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason for quoting the Minister for Home

Affairs'  statement  is  to  show  that   he   was

sympathetic towards the people without citizenship

when  he  was a Backbencher. Now that  he  is  the

Minister  for  Home Affairs, I hope that  he  will

consider   the   question  of   citizenship   more

sympathetically.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main reason why we impose a strict

policy  on  citizenship is to reduce the  economic

burden  of our country. Of course, I support  this

argument. But over the last year or so, there  has

been  a  great  improvement in our economy  and  I

think  we  can well afford to relax our policy  on

the  granting  of citizenship. We have,  in  fact,

issued  more  than  60,000 work  permits  to  non-citizens.  Therefore, for those  who  have  waited

many  years for their citizenship - some  of  them

have   their  families,  wives  and  children   in

Singapore and they have long regarded Singapore as

their  permanent residence or home -  I  think  we

should  be  more liberal and grant citizenship  to

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, following the rapid economic expansion

experienced by our economy, the wage level of  our

workers has been increased. A semi-skilled  worker

can  obtain  an average income of around  $200  to

$300 per month. For a shopkeeper, the total income

for a month is more than $400. Sir, these people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>



can  well  afford to support their  families.  For

those  people who are economically independent,  I

think  we should consider granting citizenship  to

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another category of applicants may not

require  our support economically. Some  of  these

applicants are rather old but they have a good and

sound  economic foundation. Some of them are  well

supported by their own children, and they have  no

problem  at all in getting a livelihood.  But  why

are  they applying for citizenship? 1 have  spoken

to  some  of  them  in the past  as  I  wanted  to

understand  them  better and  to  find  out  their

reason for applying for citizenship. According  to

them, they are applying for citizenship because of

the  question of honour. They say that  they  have

been  living in Singapore for many years,  several

decades,  in  fact.  They  have  been  law-abiding

citizens  and in the past they did not  apply  for

citizenship earlier because they did not pay  much

attention to the question of citizenship.  Another

reason  is that they now understand that Singapore

is  better  than many other countries.  They  feel

that  they are in love with our country. They  say

that  living in Singapore allows them  to  have  a

peaceful  life  and, therefore, they  are  eagerly

awaiting   their   citizenship.   Of   course,   I

sympathise with them for the various reasons  they

have given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another category of applicants wants to go

overseas   and  with  citizenship,  it   is   more

convenient to apply for a passport. Of course,  we

have  issued  Certificates  of  Identity  to  non-citizens  but  they  feel  that  this  is   rather

inconvenient. I also hope the Minister  will  give

sympathetic  consideration  to  this  category  of

applicants.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, citizenship

is not a right but only a privilege. I fully agree

with  the statement. But can the Minister say  why

there  are so many stateless persons in Singapore?

They  are  "floating" characters, and are  neither

citizens of any country nor are they likely to  be

granted  Singapore citizenship. Because  of  their

status,  they  cannot apply for flats  and  cannot

even go across the Causeway to visit relatives  or

friends. Surely they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>



deserve  a more humane approach by the Government.

Why  not  issue them with Certificates of Identity

so  that at least they can go across the Causeway?

Furthermore,  there  are  many  people  who   have

applied for citizenship and although they are kept

waiting, they are not told what their chances  are

of  obtaining citizenship. To assist them  can  we

not  give them a specific date when they  will  be

informed whether their application is approved  or

rejected?  They will at least be saved the  misery

of  the long wait and instead can make alternative

arrangements.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, firstly, I

would  like to thank the Member for Sembawang  for

quoting   a  statement  I  made  when  I   was   a

Backbencher  in this House. I have  not  forgotten

that statement. Indeed, I thank him for mentioning

it because I can now say publicly that what I said

then   was,  in  fact,  a  less  than  responsible

criticism of the Minister of Labour, who was  then

in  charge  of  the  very difficult  portfolio  of

citizenship.  I was then moved more  by  my  heart

than  by careful consideration of the problems  of

citizenship in this country. Sir, I am  very  much

sobered  by the responsibility of office and  know

that  what  I  do in the Citizenship  Office  will

affect the future generations of Singapore. I have

considered the pros and cons of current policy and

have  come  to the conclusion that the  policy  on

citizenship built up over a period of years is  in

the best interest of Singapore - for your children

and  my  children, and their children's  children.

However, having said this, I would say that by and

large  we  have been very generous and liberal  in

our  citizenship policy. I have made a calculation

of  our citizenship figures, and I can say that 28

per  cent of our citizens are, in fact, registered

citizens,  a figure which is high by any standards

in the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to put the whole problem in its proper

perspective, let me give a comparison. I will take

the  year 1968 as the basis for comparison because

this is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>



only  year for which I could collect the necessary

statistical  data.  In  Australia,  in  1968,  one

person was granted citizenship for every 70 square

miles  of  land. In Canada in the same  year,  the

figure  was  one  for every 64  square  miles.  In

Malaysia, it was one for every three square miles.

In  New  Zealand, it was one for every four square

miles. But in Singapore, we granted citizenship to

16  persons  for every square mile. I need  hardly

remind Members that we have only 224 square  miles

of  land at high tide, with one or two more square

miles at low tide. In contrast, Australia has more

than 2.9 million square miles of land, Canada  3.9

million  square  miles,  Malaysia  130,000  square

miles,  New Zealand about 104,000 square miles.  I

am  not unmindful of the hardships imposed on  the

people,  but I am equally aware of the  fact  that

the  responsibility of this Government is  towards

the  people who are born in Singapore and who have

no other possibilities of acquiring citizenship in

other  countries. I think all of us here  in  this

Parliament are kind-hearted and gentle  people.  I

have  not  come  across any other  country  except

Singapore  which shows so much concern for  making

things   easier   for   the  people   to   acquire

citizenship of her country. In fact, records  over

the   past   few  years  have  shown  that   every

government  is  making it more and more  difficult

for  the  people  to acquire citizenship  of  that

country.  Perhaps  this quality  distinguishes  us

from  other people. Despite comments that  we  are

becoming  ugly Singaporeans, I suspect  that  deep

inside  us we have very soft hearts. But there  is

also  a  limit beyond which we cannot go,  without

jeopardising  our collective welfare.  It  is  for

this  reason that although we are very sympathetic

in  the granting of citizenship, we are also  very

careful in our consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has asked why do we not fix

a  time  limit and tell the applicants what  their

chances  are. The reason why we do not  do  so  is

because  we hope that, as time goes on, they  will

be  given citizenship. If they do not get  it  the

first  time, there is always a second chance,  and

then a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>



third.  We do not want to discourage them.  It  has

been  suggested  that  we are  in  relatively  good

times, and therefore why should we not be generous.

True,   our  economy  has  picked  up  far   beyond

expectations in the last two or three years. But  I

would like to remind Members of the House that this

is  the  first time, within the memory of a  living

generation after the Second World War, that we have

anything like the situation of full employment.  We

hope  this situation will exist for a long time  to

come,   in   which  case  the  whole  question   of

citizenship can be reconsidered. Until  we  can  be

assured  that the good times will last, the present

policy will continue. I should hate to think  that,

because of what this Government does and what  this

House wants, in the years to come our children  and

their  children's children would have to go  around

the world begging for citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I thank the Minister concerned for expressing

his wish that he is going to consider the cases for

citizenship  more sympathetically. I beg  leave  to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1751.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> I am not moving, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1801.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I wish to ask the

Minister  concerned  if he will  consider  allowing

parents  of  children born at  the  Kandang  Kerbau

Maternity  Hospital to apply for  their  children's

birth  certificates  at  the  Registry  of  Births,

Empress Place. As far as I know, the office of  the

Registry  of  Births  in Empress  Place  will  only

accept  applications for registration of  birth  of

babies who are born in their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>



homes or in private hospitals. As for those born in

the  K.K. Hospital, the parents will have to do  so

at  the  K.K.  Hospital.  Because  of  this,  those

parents   who  work  in  the  City  area  find   it

inconvenient to go to the K.K. Hospital. This means

that they might have to take one day's leave to  go

to    the   K.K.   Hospital   for   this   purpose.

Administratively,  if it is not  too  difficult,  I

hope  the Minister concerned will allow them to  do

the registration at Empress Place.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I would also like to make a request to the Minister

concerned.  My request is for exemption  of  search

fee  required for the inspection of particulars  of

birth  from the Register of Births. Normally a  fee

of  S2  is payable for this purpose in cases  where

the   applicants   do  not  have  the   red-printed

duplicate copy of the registration of birth, it  is

only  when  a search has been successful that  they

have  to  pay a further sum of 52 for a Certificate

of  Extract  from the Register of Births  which  we

normally call tile birth certificate. So a total of

54  will  have  to  be  paid  for  the  purpose  of

searching for a birth certificate. This is a burden

to the poor people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to make is that the time of

the  search should be shortened as far as  possible

so  as to facilitate matters for people who require

the information.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, if I

understood the Member for Tiong Bahru correctly, he

wants to centralise the issue of birth certificates

at  Empress Place. With that clarification, I  will

proceed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present practice is for births which

occur  in Government hospitals to be registered  at

the  hospitals.  Of the total of 45,934  births  in

Singapore in 1970, 36,129 or about 79 per cent were

born  in  hospitals. This system has proved  to  be

very  convenient for parents, and it  also  ensures

completeness  of registration. Births occurring  in

the  rural  areas  are  now registered  at  the  14

Maternal and Child Health Clinics, which have  been

gazetted as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>



registration  centres. This not  only  facilitates

registration, but enables the Maternal  and  Child

Health  Clinic  to undertake post-natal  care  and

supervision of the mother and child. Of the  total

births in 1970, only 6,439, or about 14 per  cent,

were  registered at Empress Place. It  is  evident

from  the  figures just cited that it is far  more

convenient to allow registration at the  different

centres than to centralise it at Empress Place.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  thank  the Minister for his reply. But  what  I

mean  is not centralisation at Empress Place. What

1   requested   was   for  Government   to   grant

registration facilities at Empress place to  those

parents  whose  babies  were  born  at  the   K.K.

Hospital. I know the Government has done a lot  in

improving  the registration of births. This  is  a

clear  example of providing better service to  the

people by the Government. But I feel it would  be

better if registration service can be provided  at

Empress  Place to those who want to  register  the

birth  of  their babies who are born in  the  K.K.

Hospital.  The  reason is that  it  is  usual  for

mothers  to be discharged after a stay of  one  or

two  days  in  the K.K. Hospital. The  law  allows

registration  of births within 42  days  from  the

date  of birth. The husband will have to take  all

the trouble to go back to the hospital to register

the birth if he happens to be working in the City.

It  is  inconvenient  for him.  So.  I  hope  that

registration of births at the Empress Place office

for the category of persons just mentioned can  be

allowed.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> I understand the point made

by  the  Member for Tiong Bahru. I will look  into

the matter and see whether administratively it  is

feasible.  As  regards the  point  raised  by  the

Member  for Mountbatten, I agree with him that  it

takes   a  long  time  before  a  search  can   be

completed. This is because of the large number  of

people  who apply for the searches. As to cost,  I

am afraid very little can be done because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>



it is quite a costly thing to run the Registry and

considering the time taken to produce  results,  I

think $4 is a very reasonable rate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view of

the  satisfactory answer given by the Minister,  I

beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments standing in the name of

Mr J. F. Conceicao were not moved -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(12) That the sum to be allocated for Head 1401

be  reduced  by  $10 in respect  of  item  (2)  of

subhead 2101.

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (11) of subhead

2120.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a matter of information, Sir While I applaud

the  Minister for any efforts that aim at bringing

about  greater safety and courtesy on  the  roads,

may  I  specifically  ask what  will  the  greatly

enhanced  sum for this item be spent  on?  Can  we

have further details, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, increase in the provision of

this  item  from $4,500 to $27,000  for  the  next

financial  year  is due to the following  factors.

First,  the replacement of old signs made obsolete

as  a  result  of the introduction of the  Traffic

Signs   (Size,  Colour,  and  Type)  Rules,  1970.

Secondly,   additional  signs  are  required   for

functions  such  as the Grand Prix,  National  Day

Parade, exhibitions, etc. Further, may I say  that

the  emphasis  is on Safety First  and  Signs  and

Pedestals.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I was first under the

impression  that perhaps this increased  vote  has

indicated  a  greater interest  in  educating  the

public  towards  greater  consciousness  in   road

safety. However, since my impression does not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>



seem  to  be  correct here, may I just express  the

hope  that such efforts may be intensified  in  the

future  until greater success is reached in  making

our   roads   much   safer,  and  with   conditions

reflective  of  greater courtesy. With  that  hope,

Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $60,589,890 for Head 1401 ordered to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1402 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.

(*The same amendment also stood in , the names of Messrs Sim Boon Woo and Govindaswamy)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Immigration Department is an important

department  and it must play its role in  a  proper

manner  because  it reflects the  attitude  of  the

Government  of that country. A few months  ago  the

action   of  Singapore  Immigration  officials   of

cutting  the  hair  of long-haired  foreigners  who

wanted   to   enter  Singapore  at  the   Woodlands

checkpoint  was  unsuitable  and  improper.   Every

tourist  who comes to Singapore wants to visit  the

country  and to see for himself what the  situation

is  like in our country. But suddenly he finds that

his hair has been trimmed to look like soldiers!  I

hope  this  matter  will  be  reconsidered  by  the

Immigration Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which I would like to raise with

the   Minister  is  the  complaints  received  from

members  of  the  public  against  the  Immigration

Department.  The  Immigration Department  does  not

entertain letters from members of the public.  This

is  a  very conceited attitude on the part  of  the

Immigration  officials. This  is  very  regrettable

because   the  work  of  immigration   bears   some

relationship  with  the  public.  Therefore,   this

department should entertain letters from members of

the  public, whether or not the matters raised  are

relevant.  As  officials of  the  Government,  they

must,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>



in  their  line  of  duty,  reply  to  all  letters

received, and must not throw these letters into the

waste paper basket.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, I do not quite agree with

the  Member  for Geylang Serai that the Immigration

Department does not reply to letters sent to  them.

I  think  the  Department has a  high  standard  of

efficiency as regards work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know how soon will the Immigration

Office,  presently situated at Empress Place,  move

to  its new office, which I am given to understand,

is  to  be located at Phoenix Park. Members of  the

House  are no doubt aware of the working conditions

of  the  staff  of the Immigration Department.  The

congestion  in  the public waiting  lounge  in  the

Immigration office is most unbearable and  chaotic.

The  situation now is quite similar to  that  of  a

fish  market. This certainly presents a bad picture

to  the tourists and foreigners, particularly those

prospective foreign investors and tourists who have

occasion  to  complete certain formalities  in  the

Immigration  Office.  However,  in  spite  of  this

pathetic  situation brought about by  insufficiency

of  staff  and  compact office  space,  Immigration

staff has maintained a high standard of efficiency,

for  which I commend. While I am concerned with the

image  that we present to the foreigners, who would

certainly  count  such a visit to  our  Immigration

Office  as  quite an experience,  I  am  even  more

concerned for our own citizens who have to wait for

several hours in seemingly unending queues in  such

an  environment. I hope the Minister will  make  an

immediate   adjustment,   bearing   in   mind    my

observation,  when this office  moves  to  its  new

premises.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr P. Govindaswamy is not here.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Sir, two views were expressed

of   the  Immigration  Department  and  its  public

relations. The Member for Geylang Serai indicated a

certain laxity, while the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>



Changi  has  praised the efficiency of  the  staff

working under very difficult conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not quite sure what the Member for Geylang

Serai  is  specifically referring to. All officers

in   our   Ministry,  including   those   in   the

Immigration Office, have instructions to reply  to

grievance  letters against them appearing  in  the

press.  They  are also instructed  to  acknowledge

letters written directly to them. If there is  any

specific  instance of what the Member has alleged,

I  will look into the matter if he will direct the

letter to me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of overcrowding at

Empress Place office, I think not only myself  but

all   my   officers,  including   those   in   the

Immigration   Office,   have   agreed   that   the

Immigration  Office  at  Empress  Place   is   too

congested  for  the purposes. Action  has  already

been  taken to look for an alternative  site,  and

the Ministry hopes that the new site will be large

enough to meet the needs of the Office as well  as

the public.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, there were

instances when officials of the Immigration Office

did  not  reply to letters. Those people who  were

affected did refer their cases to me, and  I  have

the  Member is concerned with our policy that  the

cutting  of  long hair will affect the  number  of

tourists coming in to Singapore. I do not have the

actual figures, but I can say that it does not, in

fact,  affect  the number of people coming  in  to

Singapore. The Government will continue with  the

policy of discouraging people with long hair  from

entering  Singapore.  There  has  been  sufficient

publicity on this. In fact, the

it had the effect of putting across the message to

other countries.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State of Defence (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years now, the disciplinary provisions

under   the   law  have  been  found  increasingly

anomalous,  unsatisfactory  and  unworkable,.  The

disciplinary   laws  had  diverse  origins   being

scattered,  as it were, in a number of  enactments

including the Singapore Army Act, the British Army

Act, Queen's Regulations, and the People's Defence

Force  Act,  a situation which made administration

cumbersome, tedious and frustrating. What was even

more   unsatisfactory  was  the  fact   that   the

provisions  in  these  enactments  were,   mainly,

relevant  to an army based on regular professional

soldiers or a volunteer part-time army. They  are,

apart from being partly irrelevant to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>



a  large  national  service  army  such  as  ours,

inadequate and inappropriate in the context  of  a

unified force consisting of army, maritime and air

commands    which   severally   and   collectively

constitute   the  Singapore  Armed   Forces.   For

instance, to a professional soldier in a  standing

army  to be discharged with ignominy from the army

would  be  a  grave form of punishment.  But  this

would  not  deter  some  of the  less  responsible

national servicemen who would, on the contrary, be

quite   happy  to  be  discharged  regardless   of

ignominy. For to them ignominy would be the way of

escape  from  their  military obligations  to  the

nation. A major difficulty experienced has been in

regard   to   the   punishment  of   Senior   Non-Commissioned  Officers  and  Officers  who,  under

present conditions, can only be tried summarily by

an  Officer of the rank of Brigadier. There is  no

such  officer in the Singapore Armed Forces today,

so  that Senor NCOs and Officers either had to  be

court-martialled  or  else let  off  scot-free.  I

shall  elaborate this further when I  discuss  the

salient features of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost, the Bill envisages a concept

appropriate  in  the context of  a  unified  force

comprising  the  army, maritime and  air  commands

which are brought under the centralised control of

an  Armed  Forces Council, which  is  the  overall

authority under clauses 7 and 197 of the Bill, for

all  matters  connected  with  the  Armed  Forces,

except  for the authority vested in the  President

for  the  formal  establishment of  the  Singapore

Armed Forces, vide clause 6.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major portion of the Bill deals with all the

various   matters  covering  and  connected   with

disciplinary  measures including the mechanics  of

the  administration thereof. Additional or revised

military offences are introduced and some  of  the

present military offences are extended, the  prime

purpose  being  to  consolidate,  streamline   and

telescope  within one single enactment  the  usual

military  offences  that are ordinarily  found  in

military law enactments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major change brought about by the Bill is in

respect of summary trials. There is now introduced

a  system  of  trial by disciplinary  officers  to

replace the system of trial by Company Commanders,

commanding   officers  and  appropriate   superior

authority  under  the Singapore  Army  Act,  1965,

where  the  only person who can be the appropriate

superior authority is a Brigadier. Under  the  new

system introduced in the Bill, there will be three

types  of  disciplinary officers,  namely,  junior

disciplinary    officers,   senior    disciplinary

officers, and superior commanders, and it  further

allows the appointment of any person commanding  a

command,  a  formation or any other  person  as  a

superior commander.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Singapore Army Act. Company Commanders

can  only  deal with offences committed  by  Other

Ranks  of  the rank of corporal and below,  whilst

Commanding Officers are allowed to deal only  with

temporary  warrant officers and those  below  that

rank.  Officers with the rank of Second Lieutenant

to  Captain  and substantive warrant officers  are

dealt  with by the appropriate superior authority,

whilst  officers above the rank of Captain  cannot

be  dealt  with  summarily but only  by  a  court-martial.  This  Bill, on the  other  hand,  allows

junior and senior disciplinary officers, that  is,

Company and Battalion Commanders respectively,  to

deal  with  Other Ranks of the rank  of  temporary

warrant   officers   and   below;   and   superior

commanders, that is, Brigade Commanders,  to  deal

with substantive warrant officers and above up  to

the  rank  of  Major.  Persons  of  the  rank   of

Lieutenant-Colonel  and  above   who   could   not

previously be dealt with summarily can now  be  so

dealt with by the Armed Forces Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the powers of punishment of disciplinary

officers  have been increased, the main aim  being

to  dispose  of more cases expeditiously  at  unit

level.  Under  the  Bill,  a  junior  disciplinary

officer can award up to 10 days' detention to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>



privates and recruits, a form of punishment  which

he  could not award under the Singapore Army  Act,

under  which  the most severe punishment  which  a

Company Commander could award to NCOs of the  rank

of  Corporal  and  below was a reprimand,  and  to

soldiers  the  minor punishment or restriction  of

privileges up to a maximum of seven days. The most

severe punishment that a Commanding Officer  could

award  previously was 28 days' detention and  that

too  only  to privates and recruits, and the  most

severe  punishment  that  he  could  award  to   a

substantive  NCO was nothing more  than  a  severe

reprimand.  This  Bill does away  with  all  these

restrictions   and   allows  senior   disciplinary

officers  to award detentions of 40 days  even  to

NCOs.  The Bill also allows the superior commander

to  award detention to warrant officers, which  he

could  not  do under the Singapore Army  Act,  the

most  severe punishment under which being  just  a

forfeiture of seniority of rank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very good reasons for increasing the

power of punishment of disciplinary officers. From

what I have said above, hon. Members will see that

extremely  light  punishments were  meted  out  to

NCOs, both regulars and national servicemen.  This

tended  to  give  the impression  that  they  were

immune  from serious punishments unless  the  case

went up for a court-martial. There were some cases

of  indiscipline during the last few weeks  before

the national servicemen NCOs were due for release.

These   acts  of  indiscipline  certainly  warrant

disciplinary  action  of a  higher  level  than  a

reprimand  at  the  unit level. Under  this  Bill,

senior disciplinary officers will be able to award

detention  to  NCOs, and superior  commanders  can

award  detention  to  warrant  officers,  measures

which will certainly dispel any impression amongst

the  less  responsible  that  they  can  get  away

lightly    for   their   misdemeanours.   Further,

punishment for an offence which did not warrant  a

court-martial  was  inadequate.  For  instance,  a

soldier who absents himself without leave  for  35

days could, as the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>



law now stands, only be detained for a maximum  of

28  days by his Commanding Officer. Clearly,  this

must  be  rectified and the Bill,  therefore,  now

allows Commanding Officers to give up to 40  days'

detention.  A further reason is that the  increase

in  punishment will allow cases to be  dealt  with

more  expeditiously.  An example  will  illustrate

this. Let us take a national serviceman NCO who is

due  to be released from national service in three

days'  time. He commits an offence which  deserves

something more than the punishment of a reprimand.

Under the present law, detention of NCOs can  only

be  awarded  by a court-martial. The NCO  in  this

case  will have to be held back from release until

a  court-martial  is held and he  has  served  his

punishment.   Under  the  Bill,   however,   since

detention  can be given to NCOs by the  Commanding

Officers, such cases can be quickly dealt with  by

the   Commanding  Officer  himself.  Further,  the

increase in punishment will also allow more  cases

to  be  disposed of at unit level.  It  must  not,

however,  be  assumed  that the  offender  has  no

safeguard.  If  in any case he feels  that  he  is

being wrongly punished and the punishment that the

disciplinary  officer  is  going   to   award   is

something more than a reprimand, he can  elect  to

be tried by a subordinate military court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that errors by disciplinary officers in

dealing  with  cases are corrected  and  that  any

abuse  of  powers  is checked,  the  Armed  Forces

Council  has  been given the power  of  review  to

enable  it  to quash the findings and sentences  0

disciplinary   officers  and  to  substitute   new

findings  and  sentences. For the  information  of

hon.  Members, I must point out that there  is  no

such  system  of  review under the Singapore  Army

Act.  However,  the power of review under  section

115  of the British Army Act has been made use of.

It is of interest to note, however, that the Armed

Forces Council in reviewing a case can only  award

a lesser form of punishment. It cannot enhance the

punishment already awarded. An enhanced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>



punishment  can  only  be  awarded  by   a

Military Court of Appeal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now discuss the system of military

courts,  including the Military Court  of  Appeal,

introduced by this Bill. Under the present  set-up

there  are three types of courts-martial,  namely,

general  courts-martial,  district  courts-martial

and  field-general  courts-martial.  Officers  can

only be tried by general courts-martial and field-general  courts-martial while other personnel  can

be  tried  by  all  three types of courts-martial.

Further, whilst general courts-martial and  field-general  courts-martial can  award  death  or  any

lesser punishment, the most severe punishment that

district courts-martial can award, however, is two

years'  imprisonment. There is,  as  hon.  Members

will appreciate, no reason to have three types  of

courts-martial when two can serve the purpose just

as  well.  We  can  do away with district  courts-martial and have, instead, one court, that is, the

general  courts-martial to deal with all personnel

irrespective   of  rank.  This  Bill,   therefore,

simplifies   the   military  court   system.   The

subordinate military courts shall consist  of  two

types  of courts-martial, namely, general  courts-martial and the field-general courts-martial, both

of which can deal with all servicemen irrespective

of  rank.  However, a field-general courts-martial

will only be convened when a unit of the Singapore

Armed  Forces to which the offender belongs is  on

active service. Each of these courts shall consist

of not less than three officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill establishes for the first time a

Military Court of Appeal. No such court exists now

and  the only remedy that the aggrieved party  has

in  such  circumstances  is  to  petition  to  the

confirming  authority  against  the  findings  and

sentence. The Military Court of Appeal established

by   this   Bill   is,  therefore,  an   important

innovation;  it  can  hear and  determine  appeals

against decisions made by the subordinate military

courts.  There  is, however, no  appeal  from  the

Military   Court  of  Appeal  whose   powers   are

analogous  to  those  of  the  Court  of  Criminal

Appeal. The President of the Court shall either



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>



be a Judge of the High Court or a person qualified

to  be such. There are four other members, two  of

whom  are  to be legally qualified persons  of  at

least  five years' standing. The other two members

will be officers of the Singapore Armed Forces  of

or above the rank of Captain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The punishment which subordinate military courts

can  impose  range from death to minor punishment.

For  non-military offences, a subordinate military

court  can impose the same punishment as  a  civil

court.   A   new  punishment,  however,   deserves

mention.  Subordinate  military  courts  can,  for

certain offences, require a reservist to serve for

a  further  period  of service  not  exceeding  12

months.  Provision is also made for the suspension

of  sentences and for the grant of a pardon by the

President for an offender.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another salient feature of the Bill is the

enlargement   of   the  powers   of   search   and

investigation. Hitherto, under the Singapore  Army

Act,  investigations have been  done  by  officers

appointed  by the Commanding Officer and  military

policemen had powers to investigate only with  the

permission  of the Commanding Officer. This  Bill,

however,  removes the restrictions placed  on  the

powers of investigation and search. There will  be

two    categories   of   investigating   officers:

investigating  officers  authorised  by  a  senior

disciplinary  officer or a superior  commander  to

investigate   specific   offences   and   Military

Policemen  who may investigate all offences.  This

is necessary in a rapidly expanding force, many of

whose   units   are   commanded   by   young   and

inexperienced officers. Other important aspects of

the  Bill  are  the  powers to set  up  Boards  of

Inquiry  where there is a matter relating  to  the

Singapore Armed Forces which would be desirable to

investigate into; the emergency powers in  clauses

191  and  192 which can be brought into  operation

only if the President so declares for securing the

public  safety  or  the defence of  the  Republic;

reduction in rank for inefficiency



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>



of a member of the Singapore Armed Forces;

and,   last  but  not  least,  channels  by  which

servicemen who are wronged in any matter may lodge

complaints to seek a redress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to the Enlistment Act effected

through  the  Singapore Armed  Forces  Bill  would

enable an employer to recover from Government  any

amount  that  he  has  paid as  makeup  pay  to  a

reservist  or  a  person  who  is  mobilised,   by

deductions from pay-roll tax, if the reservist  is

self-employed,  he  can  claim  make-up  pay  from

monies to be provided by Parliament. However, if a

reservist  is  convicted of  a  specified  offence

involving a breach of discipline and the court  is

satisfied  on the evidence that the reservist  has

shown  himself to be not responsive to discipline,

the court may punish him under clause 114 (14)  of

the  Bill  by  requiring him to  serve  a  further

period  of  service not exceeding 12  months.  The

reservist, if working under a contract of  employ-merit,  would be entitled to receive  make-up  pay

from  his  employer during the further  period  of

service, but the employer cannot deduct this  from

payroll  tax. An employer would not be obliged  to

reinstate   such  a  reservist  in  his   civilian

employment.  Indeed  an employer  can,  if  he  so

wishes, dismiss such reservist from his employment

at  any  time  prior  to the  completion  of  such

additional reserve service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members may look askance at these measures

now introduced by the Bill as they are undoubtedly

a  departure  from  what may be considered  to  be

accepted norms. But good and potent reasons  exist

to  introduce these measures if our Army is not to

degenerate into a rabble of indiscipline soldiers.

There have been a number of incidents which do not

credit  the Singapore Armed Forces and  which,  if

not  curbed  or deterred, can bring the  Singapore

Armed  Forces into disrepute. One of a  number  of

incidents that have taken place will convince hon.

Members  of  the absolute necessity to  adopt  the

strong measures proposed in the Bill. A number  of

reservist  service  officers  were  called  up  to

attend a conversion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>



course  sometime in November last year.  From  the

very  start,  these officers continuously  carried

out their training in an unwilling manner. Towards

the  end  of the exercise, however, the reservists

took  it  upon  themselves to walk  off  from  the

exercise,   without   the   permission   of    the

instructors.  They  also  hailed  two  lorries  to

transport them back to the Singapore Armed  Forces

Training   Institute  leaving  their   tools   and

equipment behind in the training area. Because  of

this,  these officers had their training  extended

for  one  week, and this had a salutary effect  as

they showed that they were capable of carrying out

their  tasks as required of them. This  particular

incident  is  one which would call  for  the  most

severe   form  of  punishment  possible.  Clearly,

therefore,  more stringent laws are  necessary  to

deal  with  such  situations.  However  exalted  a

soldier  may consider his civilian occupation  and

standing, he is not outside the scope of  military

discipline  once  he  is in  uniform.  The  strong

measures   introduced  in  the  Bill   will   deal

appropriately with those predisposed to insolence,

indifference and indiscipline which must  not  and

cannot  be  tolerated. Discipline  and  order  are

sacrosanct  in  any army, and an  army  devoid  of

these  qualities  will not be able  to  serve  the

nation well and truly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, I must point out that through

this Bill an amendment is also made to the Finance

Act to provide for a new definition of "payroll".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members will see from what I have said so

far that in concept and design the Bill is nothing

more   than  an  attempt  to  make  good   glaring

deficiencies in the existing law and to  encompass

within  the framework of one enactment the subject

of military discipline in all its manifestations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  everybody knows that the Singapore Army  Act

and  the  People's Defence Force Act  passed  soon

after independence in 1965 were temporary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>



measures  designed to  meet  an  emergency

situation.  It was inevitable that a comprehensive

code    relating    to   a   legal   organisation,

administration and discipline of the Armed  Forces

would  see  the light of day sooner or  later.  We

should pay tribute to the Ministry of Defence  for

having completed the work of reorganisation of the

Armed  Forces  and the drafting of its  basic  law

within   the   shortest  time  of  the  Ministry's

existence,  particularly  in  the  context  of   a

society  which  did  not have sound  or  organised

martial traditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am concerned with Part IV of the Bill.

While Part IV of the Bill lays clown an attractive

procedure  for  the summary trial of  offences  by

disciplinary  officers,  clause  65  of  the  Bill

typifies the basic human problem that we  face  in

Singapore,  whether in civilian or  military  life

and  the  problem of trained human beings fighting

shy  of  making unpleasant decisions. It would  be

interesting to see if the Armed Forces  would  set

new  standards which would not fail to  be  humane

for their civilian counterparts to emulate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the performance of the judicial function is

not  an easy one. It calls for qualities of  total

human breeding and responsibility which few humans

are  blessed with at the best of times. We are now

calling for these very qualities from the  men  of

the  Armed  Forces,  and we  must  hope  that  the

traditions  that they do establish would  help  to

mould  the  Armed  Forces into a  civilised  force

worthy of the fair name of Singapore. We have  the

beginnings of military jurisprudence,  and  it  is

essential that we build up expertise in this field

from  among the ranks of the officers of the Armed

Forces within the shortest possible time.



<br><br>4.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I

rise to give my support to this Bill. I am glad to

note  that one of the objects of this Bill  is  to

establish  a  unified force called  the  Singapore

Armed Forces consisting of military, maritime  and

air   commands.   This  Bill  is   definitely   an

improvement of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>



Singapore Army Act, 1965, and the People's Defence

Force  Act,  which my colleague,  the  Member  for

Bukit  Panjang,  has just pointed out  that  these

Acts  were temporary measures designed to meet  an

emergency situation. I Xho1e-heartedly agree  with

what  the  Member has just mentioned. I also  note

that this Bill will provide for the establishment,

administration, maintenance and discipline of  the

Singapore  Armed Forces. In other words,  all  the

three sectors of the Singapore Armed Forces,  i.e.

the  military, the maritime and air commands, will

now come directly under this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst I do not wish to go into the Bill in

detail,  I  would like to touch  on  some  of  the

points  raised by the Minister of State of Defence

pertaining to discipline. I am quite surprised  to

note  that  the  various  breaches  of  discipline

committed by the rank and file could only be dealt

with  by certain categories of officers at certain

levels under the two previous Acts. But now,  with

the  establishment of the Singapore  Armed  Forces

Council,  it  is noted that radical  changes  have

been  made and introduced in this Bill which  will

empower    officers   like   company   commanders,

battalion commanders, brigade commanders  to  deal

with  acts of indiscipline committed by  the  rank

and  file of the Singapore Armed Forces. I  cannot

disagree  with  the Minister of State  of  Defence

when  he  enumerated the various types of offences

for  which nothing much could be done in the  case

of  senior officers, and that for certain offences

there  is  the need for a Brigadier  to  mete  out

punishment.  But since the Singapore Armed  Forces

do  not  have the rank of Brigadier at the  moment

except  Colonels and below, I think this Singapore

Armed  Forces  Bill  would streamline  the  entire

Force  and will empower the various commanders  at

various  unit  levels to look into  and  mete  out

punishment  that is proper to the  severity  of  a

breach of discipline.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Minister of State mentioned an

instance   when   some  of  our  N.C.O. national

servicemen simply



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>



walked   out   during  an  exercise  without   any

permission. Sir, this is one of the many  examples

which  the Minister of State has brought to  light

in  this House. I am even more surprised to  learn

why  these  culprits  who have  breached  military

discipline could not be more severely dealt  with.

I hope that with the establishment of this Council

much improvement can be seen in the running of the

Singapore Armed Forces.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, I am pleased

to  see  that clause 196 provides for the mode  of

complaint by servicemen. It seems to me  that  the

average national serviceman is not aware that this

is one area where he can sound out his grievances.

More  often  than not he feels that  he  has  been

wronged  but does not know how to go about  it  to

complain  to  his superior officers.  This  clause

sets down the procedure how to go about it. I hope

that,  in  the  implementation of this  Bill,  the

particular  provision under clause 196 is  brought

to the attention of all national service recruits,

and  that  preferably each recruit is  given  some

guidance   and  explanation  in  the   particular

language in which he is conversant with.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Sir, with regard to the

observations  made by the Member for  Jalan  Kayu,

procedures have, in fact, been laid down  for  any

national   serviceman  to  raise  any   grievances

through   the   proper  channels.   All   national

servicemen   have  been  acquainted   with   these

procedures,  and I believe that many of  them  are

fully aware of them. However, special classes have

been conducted for this purpose and, of course, if

need  be,  arrangements can be made  to  publicise

these procedures. However, the Member's suggestion

will  be looked into, and proper measures will  be

taken to implement them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the comments made by the Members

for  Bukit  Panjang and Punggol who have expressed

their support of the Bill, may I say that it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>



due to the deficiencies in the present law that it

has  become  necessary to introduce this  Bill  in

order that adequate punishment can be meted out to

those who are disinclined to discipline.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committee to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Wee Toon Boon].

<br><br>4.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ngee Ann Kongsi was incorporated by the Ngee

Ann  Kongsi (Incorporation) Ordinance of  1933  to

administer its incomes and properties for  various

worthy  public purposes, including the support  of

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kongsi established the Ngee Ann College (now

Ngee  Ann Technical College) in 1963 and initially

housed  it in the Kongsi's premises at the Teochew

Building  in Tank Road. In i 967 a new campus  for

the College was built from public donations on the

Kongsi's land in Clementi Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1968, with massive financial support from the

Government,  the  College was reorganised  into  a

technical  college  offering  diploma  courses  in

engineering  and  commerce. This  reorganisational

change  was incorporated in the Ngee Ann Technical

College Act. Section 17 of that Act provides  that

the  income  and  property of  the  College  shall

include  such  contributions as the  Kongsi  shall

make.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land in Clementi Road on which the campus now

stands and the building thereon were given to  the

College



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>



by  the Kongsi through a conveyance on 26th March,

1971,  in  accordance with section 20 of the  Ngee

Ann Kongsi (Incorporation) Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kongsi currently donates 50 per cent of its

net income or $100,000, whichever is the more,  to

the   College  for  its  running  expenses.   This

contribution   is  made  in  accordance   with   a

resolution  passed by the Committee of  Management

of  the Kongsi at a meeting held on 5th May, 1967.

To  cover  the remaining major part of its  annual

increasing  budget,  the  College  has  also  been

receiving  grants from the Government  since  the

Act came into force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the reorganisation in 1968, the Kongsi has

contributed  $400,000 to the College,  as  against

financial assistance from the Government totalling

over  $2.5  million. With the proposed development

plan,   the  administrative  expenditure  of   the

College  is  expected to rise  very  substantially

from its present level of $2 million per annum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee of Management of Ngee Ann Kongsi at

a  recent meeting adopted another resolution  that

the  quantum of its contribution to the  Ngee  Ann

Technical College be increased from 50 per cent to

75  per  cent  of  its income.  The  Committee  of

Management  also  decided that these  resolutions,

that  is,  to donate 75 per cent of its income  to

the  College, should be embodied in its Ordinance.

In  this  respect, Sir, the term "income"  assumes

the  normal commercial interpretation which is the

total  receipts less the normal direct operational

costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This move follows from the fact that the Kongsi

proposes  to  develop its land along Orchard  Road

which,  when materialised, holds promise  of  very

substantial future income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property along Orchard Road was originally a

burial ground, but was allowed to be converted for

residential  and  commercial uses  by  the  former

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to congratulate the Ngee Ann Kongsi

for this decision which is in full accord with the

spirit  of  the  Prime  Minister's  remarks   made

recently over



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>



the  use  of  burial grounds in general,  to  the

effect  that  it  is not proper that  private  and

sectional groups should benefit from the gains  in

value  or productivity of land resulting from  the

public  developments taking place around  it,  but

rather  that  the  society,  as  a  whole,  should

benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, like to compliment tile Ngee

Ann  Kongsi for this bold and progressive approach

to  educational support by the direct  application

of  property and business income. The decision  of

the Kongsi to commit 75 per cent of its income for

the Ngee Ann Technical College represents the most

concrete and enduring way in which any association

can   apply  its  revenues  for  the  support   of

education.  I would like to take this  opportunity

to  urge other similar organisations and groups to

emulate this example and to take the positive step

of   pledging   permanent   endowment   to   other

educational institutions in Singapore, such as the

Nanyang University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before the House seeks to embody in

the Ngee Ann Kongsi (Incorporation) Ordinance, the

resolutions passed by the Committee of  Management

of  the  Ngee  Ann  Kongsi  with  respect  to  its

financial  contribution to the Ngee Ann  Technical

College established by the Kongsi itself in 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, 1 beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present section 17 of the Ngee Ann Technical

College  Act provides that the income and property

of  the  College shall include, inter  alia,  such

immovable  property as the Ngee  Ann  Kongsi  may,

subject  to the provisions of section  20  of  the

Ngee   Ann   Kongsi   (Incorporation)   Ordinance,

alienate or donate to the College.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, under section 20 of the said Ordinance,

before the Ngee Ann Kongsi can alienate any of its

immovable property, it must first go to a  General

Meeting  to  pass a resolution to seek leave  from

the  High  Court and subsequently apply  for  such

leave. Under these requirements, the alienation of

land and other immovable property by the Kongsi to

the   College  becomes,  each  time  a  long   and

cumbersome  process. Indeed, in  the  past,  there

have  been occasions when the development  of  the

College  has been hampered by the need  to  comply

with  these time-consuming requirements.  Further,

while   in   1933   when  the  Ngee   Ann   Kongsi

(Incorporation) Ordinance was enacted,  there  was

perhaps    justification   for   these   elaborate

safeguarding  provisions, this is  no  longer  the

case in respect of the Ngee Ann Technical College.

The  Ngee  Ann Technical College Act  now  already

provides  for the Kongsi to make contributions  to

the   College's  income  and  property,   and   an

amendment  to  the Ngee Ann Kongsi (Incorporation)

Ordinance  itself makes it statutory that  75  per

cent  of the Kongsi's income be set aside for  the

College.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kongsi has already donated 40 acres of its

property at Clementi Road to the College,  but  it

is  envisaged that if the $11 million  development

of  the College is to proceed as planned, it  will

involve  re-alignment of boundaries  and  possibly

will require a greater land area than the 40 acres

already endowed to the College.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, development of this educational institution

should  not  be  hampered  by  the  provisions  of

section  20 of the Ngee Ann Kongsi (Incorporation)

Ordinance,   especially  since  the  College   was

founded   by  the  Kongsi  itself.  The   proposed

amendment to section 17 of the Ngee



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>



Ann Technical College Act seeks to remove the need

for  compliance with the conditions under  section

20   of   the   Ngee  Ann  Kongsi  (Incorporation)

Ordinance in so far as the alienation or  donation

of  immovable property by the Kongsi to  the  Ngee

Ann Technical College is concerned.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill that is now before the House seeks

to  amend  the Legal Profession Act in respect  of

two  matters: firstly, in regard to the  necessity

of    legal    officers    obtaining    practising

certificates   to  practise  as  solicitors,   and

secondly, in regard to the nationality of those in

charge of the conduct and discipline of practising

members of the Bar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the first amendment contained in

clause  2  of the Bill, the general provisions  of

the  Act  on  this matter require,  in  the  first

instance,    the   obtaining   of   a   practising

certificate,  before  a  qualified  advocate   and

solicitor,  who has been admitted to  practise  by

the Court, is in fact able to carry on practice as

an advocate and solicitor. There are,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>



at  the present moment, certain exemptions to  the

general   requirement.  These  are  contained   in

subsection   (2)  of  section  30;  for   example,

solicitors  employed by certain Statutory  Boards,

like the Housing and Development Board, the Public

Utilities  Board, the Economic Development  Board,

the  Jurong  Town  Corporation  and  the  Port  of

Singapore  Authority, may now practise in  certain

matters  as  may  be specified  in  a  certificate

issued   by   the   Attorney-General.   Upon   the

certification   of   the   Attorney-General,   the

Registrar of the Supreme Court will issue to  such

a  solicitor a certificate in lieu of a practising

certificate. The solicitor concerned would then be

able  to practise in such branches of the law  and

only in his capacity as an employee of the various

Statutory   Boards  in  which  he   is   employed.

Unfortunately,  this  exemption  clause  has  been

found  to be defective in the sense that it  would

not  apply  to a member of the Legal Service,  who

may  not  even  defend  any member  of  the  Legal

Service, or Civil Service, who is or may  be  sued

in  his  private  capacity for acts  done  in  the

course  of his official duties. It is in order  to

remove this restriction that the present amendment

has  been  devised.  Legal officers  who,  in  the

course of their duties, meet with difficulties  by

way of having suits brought against them, will  be

able  to,  where they so desire, have the services

of a State Counsel. I must add, however, that this

amendment  will not preclude private practitioners

from  acting on behalf of those officers, nor will

it  restrict the choice of solicitors by those who

may   be   faced   with  legal  action   in   such

circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment, that is, in clause 3 of

the  Amendment  Bill,  will  have  the  result  of

confining  the  eligibility of membership  in  the

Council  of the Bar, which is the body responsible

for  the maintenance of standards of etiquette and

of  conduct  of  members of the legal  profession,

solely  to those who are of Singapore nationality.

It  has been felt that so important a body, as the

legal  profession,  should  be  managed,  in  such

important  matters  as  disciplinary  control,  by

those of that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>



profession who are our own citizens so  that  they

may  reflect, it is hoped, the needs,  aspirations

and   standards  of  behaviour  of  not  only  the

profession  but also of the society in which  they

live  and practise. It is felt that nationals with

their  roots  in the country would be  more  in  a

position   to   set  standards  which   would   be

acceptable to all in the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand, however, that in so far as the

present members of the Council are concerned, they

are  all Singapore citizens so that in effect  the

Bill will only affect the future membership of the

Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last amendment in clause 4 has been asked for

by  the  Council itself in reducing the number  of

members  necessary to form a quorum from seven  to

five. The Council of the Law Society feels that it

would  be  quite impracticable to insist on  seven

out of ten members in the Council to be present in

order to form a quorum. Recent amendments have had

the  effect  of reducing the overall size  of  the

Council,  and  it  is  for  this  reason  that   a

reduction in the number necessary for a quorum has

been requested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to reform the

existing  procedure of committing  criminal  cases

for trial in line with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>



United  Kingdom  Criminal Justice Act,  1967.  The

Bill  in  its  draft  stage was  referred  to  the

Council  of  the  Law Society of  Singapore  which

submitted its recommendations thereon. The Council

accepted   the  principle  of  admitting   written

statements  at  preliminary  inquiries,  observing

that this would (and I quote) "undoubtedly lighten

the  burden  of Magistrates' Courts  in  committal

proceedings  without  in any way  prejudicing  the

interests  either  of the prosecution  or  of  the

defence".  The Council also suggested a number  of

modifications  to  the Bill which  were  carefully

considered  and  which have,  in  the  main,  been

accepted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Members would have read a detailed account

of  the  contents  of the Bill in the  Explanatory

Statement, it would be helpful, I think, if I were

to  touch  on  the principal aspects  of  the  new

procedure  that  this legislation  will  introduce

into   our  subordinate  courts.  1  should  first

explain  that preliminary inquiries in  Singapore,

as in England, were originally considered to be an

extra safeguard for the accused. This procedure is

interposed between the arrest of a suspect and his

eventual trial before the High Court and  has,  as

its  main  object, the examination of the evidence

of  the  prosecution and its sufficiency in making

out  a  prima  facie case against the accused  for

trial   before  the  High  Court.  Of   necessity,

therefore, it was confined solely to such cases as

were  cognisable  only  in  the  High  Court.  The

current  practice in Singapore has, however,  made

it extremely doubtful as to the usefulness of this

aspect  or  stage  of  criminal  proceedings.  The

primary  purpose of these proceedings, namely,  to

allow lawyers to examine the adequacy of the  case

alleged  against  an  accused  by  cross-examining

witnesses for the prosecution, does not appear  to

have  been  utilised to the full.  In  many  cases

there  is  not  even  a  submission  made  to  the

examining   Magistrate  at  the   close   of   the

proceedings,  the  case  for  the  defence   being

reserved  until such time as the trial  begins  in

the High Court. Indeed, this practice has resulted

in committal proceedings or preliminary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>



inquiries  sometimes working against the  interests

of  an accused person. Newspapers that report these

proceedings  often dwell only on the case  for  the

prosecution, while nothing is recorded of the  case

for  the  defence. This could result in an  accused

being prejudiced at his trial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides for the existing procedure with

regard to preliminary inquiries to be abandoned  in

favour of committals to the High Court without  the

necessity   of   examining   witnesses   for    the

prosecution  on oath at a court hearing  before  an

examining  Magistrate.  This  will  no  longer   be

required of the examining Magistrate for, under the

proposed procedure, he may commit an accused person

to the High Court for trial if he is satisfied that

all the evidence for the prosecution or the defence

consists   of  written  statements  which  disclose

sufficient  evidence to put the  accused  upon  his

trial. While, however, the Bill is an adaptation of

the United Kingdom Criminal Justice Act, 1967, much

of  the English procedure being incorporated in the

Bill,  it  is  not exactly on all  fours  with  the

current English practice in that whereas in England

"paper   committals",  as  they  are   known,   are

optional, here they are to be compulsory.  This  is

because  much of the purpose behind the Bill  would

be  lost  if the English procedure were adhered  to

rigidly since it is more than likely that in almost

all  cases here counsel for the defence will  elect

to  proceed  under  the  old  system  of  examining

witnesses  for the prosecution one by  one,  orally

upon  oath before the committing Magistrate,  which

would   defeat   the  very  object   of   the   new

legislation. Another significant difference is that

under the English procedure, the Magistrate has the

power  to  commit  an  accused  for  trial  without

considering  the written statements  of  witnesses,

while  under our proposed procedure the  Magistrate

is  bound  to consider the contents of the  written

statements of witnesses to decide whether there  is

sufficient evidence to commit an accused for trial.

This may be regarded as an important safeguard



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>



particularly where an accused is not represented by

counsel at the preliminary inquiry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the new system proposed in the Bill

has  the merit of saving the time of the court  and

of the parties as well as of avoiding inconvenience

and expense to witnesses. On the other hand, as  in

England, a considerably enhanced workload will have

to  be  borne  by the Attorney-General's  Chambers,

since  as  a  result of the amending Act statements

will  need  to  be examined carefully to  ascertain

whether   they   sufficiently   disclose   evidence

admissible  in  court to prove  the  guilt  of  the

accused. The clarification of doubtful points which

must  be effected before the hearing will also take

up  time. I take the view, which is shared  by  the

Attorney-General,  that the additional  work  which

the  new  legislation will involve for his Chambers

would  be well worthwhile since it would be in  the

interests  of the more efficient administration  of

justice  and of the hundreds of witnesses who  have

to  give  evidence in our subordinate  courts  each

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must hasten to assure Members that the new

procedure,  as  embodied in the Bill,  accomplishes

the same purpose as the existing procedure which is

sought to be replaced. The principal difference  is

that in the existing procedure an oral statement of

a witness is taken down by the court in the form of

a  deposition,  that  is, a statement  on  oath  or

affirmation, arid witnesses are liable to be cross-examined  on  that statement, while under  the  new

procedure a copy of the written statement made by a

witness and signed by him and certified by him that

it  is true to the best of his knowledge and belief

will be given to the defence or the prosecution, as

the case may be, before it is tendered in evidence.

After  all  the  written statements and  all  other

evidence  in support of the prosecution  have  been

received in evidence, the examining Magistrate will

then  generally  follow the existing  procedure  of

either committing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>



the accused for trial, discharging him or

dealing with the case summarily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also contains two provisions modelled on

the English Act. The first relates to restrictions

on  the  publication  of  reports  of  preliminary

inquiries in newspapers, radio and television with

a  view  to  safeguarding  the  interests  of  the

accused.  Certain particulars such  as  the  name,

address and occupation of the accused, the offence

and  decision  of  the court are permitted  to  be

contained in reports. The second provision  is  to

the effect that the accused shall not, without the

court's permission, adduce evidence in support  of

an  alibi unless he gives notice of particulars of

the  alibi.  This is to ensure that no last-minute

defence of alibi is sprung upon the prosecution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two fresh technical provisions relating to

evidence  contained in the Bill  are  set  out  in

clause  4  and  are explained at the  end  of  the

Explanatory Statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to conclude by

making  two  points. First, the new  procedure  as

contained in the Bill achieves the same object  as

the  present  parallel provisions of the  Criminal

Procedure  Code in that the accused will  be  made

aware  of  the  case  that he has  to  meet;  and,

secondly, there have been no serious criticisms in

the  United  Kingdom as to the  operation  of  the

Criminal Justice Act, 1967, on which our  Bill  is

largely  based. Indeed, the general  consensus  is

one of approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Barker].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<br><br>5.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments proposed in this Bill are

concerned   principally  with   the   compensatory

provisions  of  the  Controlled Premises  (Special

Provisions) Act. Section 7 (3) of the Act provides

that  the  total  amount  of  compensation  to  be

awarded  in  a case where a tenant has sublet  his

premises   must   not   exceed   the   amount   of

compensation that could be awarded in a case where

a  tenant has not so sublet his premises.  In  the

working  of  this legislation since the  Act  came

into  force,  the Tenants Compensation  Board  has

found  that this section is unduly restrictive  in

enabling  the  Board to award fair and  reasonable

compensation  to tenants. The original  philosophy

behind  this  provision was that landlords  should

not  be  penalised  by  having  to  pay  out  more

compensation where tenants had sublet parts of the

controlled premises; for, after all, landlords had

over   the  years  derived  no  financial  benefit

themselves from the subletting. But the experience

of  the  Board  has shown that this  approach  has

failed adequately to take into account the reality

of  existing  economic  and social  conditions  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order, therefore, for the Tenants

Compensation Board to strike a fairer  balance  as

between  landlords and tenants  in  the  award  of

compensation,  it is proposed that section  7  (3)

should  be deleted from the Act. While the  effect

of  the  deletion  will be that landlords  may  be

liable  under the law to pay out more compensation

than  might otherwise be the case, it will  ensure

that  dispossessed tenants will receive sufficient

compensation to enable them to set up new homes or

businesses elsewhere.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tenants Compensation Board has also proposed

an  amendment  to give the Board  power  to  award

compensation to any person (other than a tenant or

subtenant)  using or occupying  any  part  of  the

controlled  premises.  Such  occupiers   have   no

protection or standing under the Control  of  Rent

Act,  upon which the Controlled Premises  (Special

Provisions)  Act  hinges.  The  adoption  of  this

proposal, therefore, entails widening the scope of

the  parent  Act in a way that was  not  envisaged

when  the  Act was drafted. Although  the  concept

does not lend itself to ready acceptability within

the narrow confines of property law, the Board  is

convinced  that social and economic considerations

justify  the  adoption of this novel concept.  The

proposal    has   principally   in   contemplation

occupiers who are stall-holders selling  goods  or

refreshments  to the public under  an  arrangement

with  the  chief tenant. So long as it is  enacted

that  any  compensation that is payable  to  these

occupiers comes out of the amount that is  payable

to  the  person who has derived benefit  from  the

occupation,  that is to say the  chief  tenant  in

most cases, the amendment can be justified on  the

wider  social and economic grounds and  will  not,

within  these limits, do too much violence to  the

settled  principles of property law. The amendment

giving effect to this proposal would appear  as  a

new section 9A in the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments in the Bill are of a

consequential or formal nature and do not call for

special comment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Amendment Bill

moved  by my colleague, the Minister for  Law  and

National Development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all agree that a large part of the

Central City areas is in need of renewal, as  many

of  the  properties were built in the last century

and  are now in a dilapidated condition. Some  are

even unsafe for occupation, quite apart



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>



from   health  considerations.  Thus,   when   the

Controlled Premises (Special Provisions)  Act  was

introduced   in  1969  to  remove  the  protection

accorded  to tenants of controlled premises  under

the  Control  of Rent Ordinance so  as  to  enable

redevelopment  to  take place, there  was  general

support from the public. In fact, all agreed  that

redevelopment of the Central City areas would  not

only  bring  greater  economic  opportunities  and

employment to the people of Singapore in  general,

but would also change Singapore into a modern City

befitting   its   status   as   a   regional   and

international centre of communication,  trade  and

commerce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the process, there is bound to be

some  dislocation and suffering  to  some  of  the

affected tenants and subtenants, especially  those

who  depend  on  the  Telok  Ayer  Basin  and  the

waterfront for their livelihood. It is  only  fair

and  just that they should be compensated to  make

their  removal and resettlement in a new and  more

distant  environment more bearable.  It  would  be

grossly unjust if prosperity in one sector of  our

society  should be built on the misery of  another

sector,  albeit  a smaller one. Indeed,  this  was

taken  into  consideration  in  the  Act,  wherein

provisions  were made for the establishment  of  a

Tenants Compensation Board to ensure that fair and

reasonable  compensation  shall  be  paid  by  the

landlord  or  developer to tenants  or  subtenants

affected by urban renewal in the designated  area.

The  landlord  is offered generous concession  for

undertaking urban renewal project in the  form  of

lower property tax - 12 per cent as against 36 per

cent.  A  landlord  who  can  commit  millions  of

dollars  in  a redevelopment project  can  in  all

cases  offer  a  fair  amount of  compensation  to

affected  tenants  and  subtenants,  otherwise  he

should  not  be  in  the  business  in  the  first

instance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the short period since the Act was

in  force,  it has been found that landlords  were

far  from  willing  to offer fair  and  reasonable

compensation to tenants and subtenants. They often

exploited   the   ignorance  of   the   illiterate

residential tenants and subtenants.  In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>



one  case I was informed, as I was then in America,

that  a  landlord even resorted to the  tactics  of

demolishing parts of a building in order  to  force

tenants  in  another  part to  accept  unreasonable

terms  of  compensation and move out for their  own

safety.  In  another instance, despite  the  strong

recommendation  made  by the  Tenants  Compensation

Board   for   enhanced  ex  gratia  payments,   the

landlord,  a  leading local bank, was unsympathetic

to   the  claims  of  a  number  of  occupiers   in

controlled  premises. The landlord was prepared  to

pay  only  a derisory sum of ex gratia to them.  It

was   only  through  the  intervention  of  elected

representatives that the bank eventually agreed  to

increase  ex  gratia payments to the occupiers.  In

fact,  it  was  as a result of this case  that  the

present  amendments to section 9  were  introduced.

Indeed,  if  landlords or developers,  particularly

those  with millions of dollars of assets, were  to

take  the lead and show a little sympathy  for  the

plight  of  the poor, the present amendments  would

not have been necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to the credit of the Tenants Compensation

Board that, in the course of its deliberations,  it

has   adopted  a  liberal  attitude  and  has  been

responsive  to  the changing circumstances  in  our

economy and the Government's more liberal policy of

compensation  in  respect of its  own  resettlement

cases. As the House is aware, since the coming into

force   of   the   Controlled   Premises   (Special

Provisions)  Act  in  1969,  the  rent  of  private

residential  properties has gone  up  several-folds

and well beyond the reach of tenants and subtenants

in  controlled premises in the Golden Shoe area. As

a result, the demand for public housing has shot up

to  an  all time high so much so that, despite  the

record  annual output of 16,000 units per annum  by

the  Housing  and  Development  Board,  the  demand

cannot be met promptly. Today, an applicant has  to

wait an average of about three years before he  can

obtain a fiat, either on rent or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>



purchase.  This  is  a  factor  which  the  Tenants

Compensation   Board  will  have   to   take   into

consideration   in   deciding   the   quantum    of

compensation  as the Housing and Development  Board

has  become  the  only source of  supply  of  cheap

housing within the reach of the poor living in  the

Golden  Shoe  area.  My personal  view  is  that  a

reasonable  minimum  amount of compensation  for  a

residential tenant or subtenant as of today,  shall

be  in  the  region of $5,000 or  18  years'  rent,

whichever  is the greater amount, not  taking  into

consideration  other  relevant  factors   such   as

removal  costs, location and siting  of  controlled

premises, hardship, etc. 1 have no doubt  that  the

Tenants Compensation Board appreciates the position

and  will know how to exercise discretion  in  this

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Amendment Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank my colleague,

the  Minister for Labour, for his support.  At  the

Second  Reading of the Controlled Premises (Special

Provisions)  Bill, I did inform  Members  that  the

formula  set out in the Ordinance, for compensation

of  at  least six to eight years' rent  was  not  a

magic formula,, and that we were experimenting with

this formula in an Act which has been extended only

to the Golden Shoe area in Telok Ayer. It was as  a

result  of  the experience of the Board that  these

amendments as contained in the Bill have  been  put

before  the  House today, and I  hope  that,  as  a

result,  fairer compensation will be  paid  out  to

occupants of houses in the Golden Shoe area. It may

well be that subsequent experience may even lead to

further amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

"That the  Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This purely formal Bill seeks to substitute in

subsection  (2) of section 10 of the Parliamentary

Elections Act (Chapter 50) the year "1971" for the

year  "1967"  so as to bring it in line  with  the

amendment  made  last  year by  the  Parliamentary

Elections  (Amendment)  Act,  1971,  and  also  to

delete  the  reference to the first  registers  of

electors in the said subsection, as that reference

is no longer applicable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill effects a minor amendment

to  Form  1,  which is the Writ of Election.  This

amendment  would  enable the  Writ,  which  is  at

present required to be signed by the President  at

the  top of the Form, to be signed by him  at  the

same  time at the end thereof as well. This  would

avoid  the  existing requirement  for  a  separate

reference  to  the Secretary to the Cabinet  under

section  34  of  the  Interpretation  Act,   which

provides  that  the exercise of  a  power  by  the

President may be signified under the hand  of  the

Secretary  to the Cabinet. In short, the amendment

proposed at clause 3 would obviate the need for an

unnecessary procedural step.

<div align="center"><b>VOLUNTARY STERILIZATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1969, when I moved the Second Reading of the

Voluntary Sterilization Bill in this House, I say,

inter  alia,  that  the  Bill  together  with  the

Abortion  Bill  and the Singapore Family  Planning

and Population Act of 1965 would be a "charter  to

liberate women from unwanted pregnancies". I  have

also stated that during the operations of the  Act

a   critical  assessment  would  be  made  of  its

effectiveness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Abortion Act and the Voluntary

Sterilization  Act have been in operation  in  the

last  two years. Experience gained has shown  that

the  Abortion Act has been operating smoothly  and

fulfilling  its  purpose. Since  its  coming  into

operation  till  the end of December  1971,  about

5,300  abortions have been carried out.  The  vast

majority of the abortions were done on women  with

unwanted  pregnancies who have a large  number  of

children  and belong to the low income group.  The

Abortion  Act  can  be  said  to  have  more  than

fulfilled  the objectives for which  the  Act  had

been passed. The same, however, cannot be said  of

the  Voluntary Sterilization Act. During the  same

period,  only  1,639 sterilizations  were  carried

out.  This  is a pity since sterilization  is  the

best  method  of  family planning  for  those  who

completed the number of children they want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the figures I gave a moment ago, it can be

said  that  the number of abortions performed  was

more than three times the number of sterilizations

over  the same period. This is because the  demand

for sterilization has been hampered by a number of

restrictions  in the Voluntary Sterilization  Act.

Some of these restrictions are connected with  the

procedure in applying for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>



sterilizations;  others with the  conditions  that

have  to be satisfied before sterilization can  be

approved   under   the  Act.  It  is,   therefore,

considered desirable to amend the Act suitably  so

that  it  will serve its purpose well, namely,  to

make   sterilization,  as  a  method   of   family

planning,  easily available to  as  many  men  and

women  who  come  within  its  ambit.  Hence,  the

present Bill before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Voluntary Sterilization Act, every

applicant has to appear before the Eugenics  Board

for an interview. This is a mandatory provision of

the  law  as  it  stands, and  the  Board  has  no

discretion  in  the  matter. The  purpose  of  the

interview  is  to  explain to  the  applicant  the

meaning  and  consequences of  sterilization.  The

reason  underlying this provision  is  that  every

applicant  should be clearly aware  of  the  steps

being taken so that he or she will not enter  into

it   unknowingly,   or  under  false   ideas   nor

frivolously - to be regretted when it is too  late

at a later date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes good intentions have a way of

achieving  unexpected results.  But  one  of  them

might have been foreseen. This is that many of the

applicants  find  it an embarrassment  to  present

themselves  before  the Board for  the  interview.

Many  have refused to attend the interviews  after

they  had  made their applications. How many  more

have   not  made  applications  for  sterilization

because  of this requirement will never be  known.

Because of this one reason, this important  method

of  contraception for family planning  is  not  as

popular as it should be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other reasons too, which make the

rigid  requirement for the interview  undesirable,

one  of which is that hardship is caused to  those

applicants  in the lower income group  (the  large

majority of applicants are in this group) who live

away  from  the City, particularly  in  the  rural

areas,  in  that they have to take time  off  from

work, perhaps losing a day's wages and spend money

on  transport  to attend the Board's interview  at

the Kandang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>



Kerbau  Hospital. As a result of  this  compulsory

interview,  the  Board has, to meet  regularly  to

deal  with  all applicants. In view of  the  large

number of applicants received - about 150 a  month

-  the  Board  at  present meets  weekly.  It  is,

therefore, considered desirable that the  question

whether an applicant is to be interviewed  by  the

Board   or  otherwise  be  left  to  the   Board's

discretion  and  provision  to  this  effect   has

accordingly  been made in the Amendment  Bill.  In

other words, the Board will decide on the basis of

the   information  contained  in  the  application

whether a person should be called for interview or

not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every applicant whose application for

sterilization  has been approved and  who  is  not

required  by the Board to appear for an  interview

will  be notified by post. As a safeguard  and  to

enable  the  applicant  to  have  a  full  medical

explanation,  he  or she will be provided  with  a

leaflet,  in the appropriate language,  explaining

the  meaning and consequences of sterilization  so

that  he  or she will be fully aware of  the  step

intended  to  be  taken. This  leaflet  has, been

prepared  in  four languages and has been  in  use

since  December 1970. In this connection, I  would

like  to  mention that the staff  of  the  various

hospitals and maternity and child health  clinics,

where most applicants go t& get application forms,

will  continue  to  give  an  explanation  of  the

meaning and, consequences of sterilization to  the

applicants as they have been doing hitherto.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Act, at least 30 days are required to

elapse between the date of the application and the

date  sterilization is to be carried out. This  is

intended  as  a  safeguard in case  the  applicant

changes his mind, when it would have acted against

the basic purpose of the law. The need for such  a

long waiting period has been criticised. Many are.

unable  to  understand the  need  for  the  delay.

Indeed, many applicants have indicated a desire to

be   sterilized  immediately  after  the   Board's

interview.  It  is  known that some  women  became

pregnant during the waiting period. An



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>



amendment to shorten the waiting period  from  30

days  to  7  days has, therefore, been made.  The

safeguard  is  retained, only the period  between

the approval and when the sterilization operation

can  be carried out has been shortened. There can

be  no  undue  haste  in  taking  this  important

decision, yet it should not be unduly long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present one of the conditions that every

applicant  must  satisfy before  the  Board  will

authorise treatment for sterilization is that  he

or  she  must  have at least three  children.  In

other words, the present position is that parents

who  have  decided that their family is  complete

with    two   children   cannot   benefit    from

sterilization and would have to adhere  to  other

contraceptive  methods  for  the  rest  of  their

lives.  It  is  an  undesirable hardship  on  the

marriage partners. It is inconvenient and can  be

expensive,   and  further,  other   contraceptive

methods are not 100 per cent effective and  there

is   the   ever-present  fear  of   an   unwanted

pregnancy.  After looking into this  matter  very

carefully,  it  is  considered  that   there   is

justification  in liberalising the  law  in  this

regard.  Accordingly, the present requirement  of

three  children has been reduced to two  and  the

Bill gives effect to this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, it is also provided that where there

are  exceptional  circumstances,  the  Board  may

approve sterilization in the case of an applicant

with   one   living   child.   The   "exceptional

circumstances" may be on medical, therapeutic  or

environmental grounds. The last mentioned  ground

includes  the  financial and social circumstances

of the applicant. Any application under this head

will  naturally be scrutinized by the Board  with

the utmost care, and approval would be given only

if  the Board is satisfied, having regard to  all

the    circumstances,   that   there   is    real

justification. Each case will depend on  its  own

merits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present law allows the Board to approve

sterilization  in the case of a person  under  21

years  of  age if he is suffering from hereditary

illness  that  is  recurrent, mental  illness  or

epilepsy, and if his parent or guardian  consents

to it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>



This precludes unmarried persons over 21 years of

age  and married persons of any age from applying

for  sterilization  if they  are  suffering  from

these  illnesses. The Bill seeks to remedy  this.

deficiency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Eugenics Board has no powers to

appoint  committees for any general  or  specific

purpose  or to authorise them to do any  specific

act  or  carry  out any specific  function.  Such

powers have been provided for the Termination  of

Pregnancy Authorization Board under the  Abortion

Act.  It  is considered that there is a need  for

similar  powers for the Eugenics Board. Clause  2

of the Bill gives effect to this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have dealt with the main

amendments   proposed  in  the  Bill   and   have

explained  why  they  are  necessary.  I   would,

however,  like  to  assure  the  House  that  the

existing  safeguards enshrined in  the  principal

Act remain, and these are -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that the authority of the Eugenics Board

will  continue to be required  to  authorise

sterilization;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that sterilization will not be carried out

against a person's, will, in each case,  the

consent   of  the  person  concerned   being

necessary;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) that sterilization will be carried out only

in   Government  hospitals  or  in  approved

institutions;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) that sterilization will be effected only

after  a  period of seven days  has  elapsed

following  the  Board's  approval   of   the

application, giving sufficient  time  for  a

change of mind;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) that no medical personnel will be obliged to

carry  out  sterilization if it is  against

his, conscience.

develop   Sentosa   as   a  tourist   resort.   An

internationally known firm was asked  subsequently

to study the feasibility of so developing Sentosa.

This study, which was completed in September 1970,

confirmed that the proposal was a viable  one  and

that   it   would  play  an  important   role   in

substantially  increasing the rate  of  growth  of

tourists  coming to Singapore. The study envisaged

that  the  development of Sentosa into  a  tourist

resort would require Government investment to  the

extent of $68 million spread over a period of nine

years  until  the whole project is completed.  The

private   sector  too  is  expected  to  play   an

important  role  by investing about  $56  million.

These   sums  will  have  to  be  spent   on   the

development of infra-structure and the creation of

facilities for tourist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>



attraction.  The  proposals  include  a   vacation

complex  comparable  to the  best  in  the  world,

centralised   shopping  facilities,   recreational

amenities  such  as  a  golf course,  an  open-air

theatre, a gun museum, a maritime museum, a marine

complex  consisting  of a corallarium,  a  pirates

cove,  and  an aquarium, together with first-class

hotels  and restaurants. In the creation of  these

facilities,  the greatest care will  be  taken  to

ensure  that  there  will be no  conflict  between

tourist   facilities   on  Sentosa   and   tourist

facilities  on  the  mainland.  I  should  mention

perhaps  that,  in  fact, a few of  the  essential

projects  such as the golf course, the  cable  car

and beach facilities are already in various stages

of implementation. It is anticipated that by March

1973,  there  should  be adequate  attractions  on

Sentosa to make a visit to the island worthwhile.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be appreciated from the above remarks

that   the  development  of  Sentosa  is  a  major

undertaking. This requires the establishment of  a

permanent  organisation which will be  responsible

not  only  for the implementation of the  numerous

projects but also for the efficient administration

of the island after the expected completion of all

projects  by  1979. It is, therefore, proposed  in

the Bill now before the House that there should be

established a Sentosa Development Corporation with

responsibilities    for    the     control     and

administration of Sentosa, and for the development

of  services  and amenities for tourists  and  the

public.  This  will  reduce the burden  shouldered

hitherto  by various Government Departments  such

as  the  Jurong  Town Corporation  and  the  Urban

Renewal  Department which, despite their stretched

resources, have hitherto been responsible for  the

implementation of the initial projects on Sentosa.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sentosa Development Corporation will be

placed   under   the  guidance  of  the   Economic

Development  Division of the Ministry of  Finance,

under  whose  purview is the  development  of  our

tourist industry. The Corporation will be run by a

Chairman,  a  Deputy Chairman and such  number  of

other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>



members  as  the Minister may from  time  to  time

determine,  provided that there will not  be  less

than eight or more than 15 members. For the day-to-day  administration of the Corporation, a  General

Manager will be appointed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the development and administration of

Sentosa,  provision has also been made  to  enable

the   Corporation  to  develop  other   areas   in

Singapore  as  touristy centres to complement  the

work  performed  by  the Tourist  Promotion  Board

which, due to lack of physical resources, may  not

be able to undertake such development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to financing, the Corporation may,

with  Ministerial approval, borrow funds  for  its

operation. Further, provision has also  been  made

for loans and grants to be made to the Corporation

from  the  Government  for capital  and  recurrent

expenditure.  As  for  its  surplus   funds,   the

Corporation  is  empowered  to  invest  these   in

trustee  securities.  The  Corporation's  accounts

will   be  audited  by  auditors  appointed   with

Ministerial  approval. An  annual  report  of  the

Corporation,  together  with  its  annual  audited

accounts,  shall be submitted to the Minister  and

presented to Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has general provisions to exempt the

Corporation  from stamp duty and  income  tax  and

also  provisions to appoint committees  and,  with

Ministerial  approval, to establish superannuation

schemes  for its employees. Clause 25 of the  Bill

empowers the Minister to make such regulations for

carrying out the provisions of the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Corporation is established, all

immovable  and movable properties in Sentosa  will

be  transferred to it on such terms and conditions

as the Minister may determine. Prior to this date,

the  Minister is empowered to make such  contracts

and  agreements  on behalf of the Corporation  for

the  development of Sentosa and such contracts  or

agreements  shall be deemed to have been  made  by

the Corporation when it is established.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate task of the Sentosa Development

Corporation   will   be   to, take   over    the

implementation  of  numerous projects  which  have

already been launched and are in various stages of

implementation.  It will also  have  to  evaluate,

reassess  and  implement the many  other  projects

proposed  for  Sentosa. In the  long  run,  it  is

anticipated    that   the   Sentosa    Development

Corporation   would,  at  the  least,   be   self-supporting.

<br><br>6.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Timber Export Industry Board was established

under    the    Timber   Export   Industry    Board

(Incorporation) Act passed by Parliament  in  1966.

This is a joint Singapore-Malaysian Board and is an

example  of the close cooperation between  our  two

countries. Since its establishment, the  Board  has

been  doing a good job in regulating and  improving

the timber export industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal source of the Board's funds comes

from  the  collection  of cess  on  the  export  of

timber. Section 20 of the 1966 Act provides for the

establishment  of the Timber Export  Industry  Fund

into which all monies collected by the Board are to

be paid. There is, however, no provision in the Act

for  the  investment  of  the  surplus  funds.   At

present,  the  Timber  Export  Industry  Board  has

accumulated  some $960,000 of surplus  funds  which

are  held in fixed deposit accounts because of  the

lack  of power of the Board to invest these surplus

funds in other forms of securities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An amendment to the 1966 Act is, therefore,

necessary to enable the Board to invest its surplus

funds.  And  this Amendment Bill seeks to  do  just

that. A new section, section 20A, is to be added to

the  1966  Act to empower the Board to  invest  its

surplus   funds   in  investments   or   securities

authorised  for the investment of trust funds.  The

Minister may also direct the Board to invest in any

of  these authorised investments and securities  as

he may think fit.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Loan Act, 1967 (Chapter 66),

authorises a sum of $1,000 million to be raised  by

way  of  loan  for the purposes of the  Development

Fund.  To-date,  a total of $963 million  has  been

raised  under the provisions of the Act, leaving  a

balance of $37 million of the prescribed maximum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are no doubt aware that besides external

sources   such  as  the  World  Bank,   the   Asian

Development   Bank  and  the  international   money

markets,   Singapore  will  have  to  continue   to

mobilise  resources  from the  domestic  sector  to

finance   its  development  programme.   For   this

purpose, it is envisaged that the loans raised  for

the  Development Fund will amount to  about  $2,000

million  over the next five years. The Bill,  which

is  now  before the House, is necessary  since  the

previous  legislation, which I  mentioned  earlier,

cannot  be suitably amended to increase the  amount

of loan that can be raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill follows closely the provisions of the

Development Loan Act, l967 (Chapter 66),  with  one

difference. This is that the maximum amount of loan

which  can  be  raised under  the  Bill  is  $2,000

million,  as compared to $1,000 million  authorised

by the 1967 Act. A new feature is that the proposed

Development  Loan Act will be administered  by  the

Monetary  Authority  of Singapore  instead  of  the

Treasury.

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL PRODUCTIVITY BOARD BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.51 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of raising productivity in

Singapore stems from basic economic realities.  We

are a small country in terms of our population and

the natural resources we possess. Indeed, our only

natural  resources  are  our  resourceful  working

population, our geographical location and  a  fine

harbour.   While  other  countries  have  abundant

mineral  deposits to exploit, we have none.  While

other countries have vast, fertile tracts of  land

to  till,  we  have none. We can build  a  healthy

economy  and enjoy a high standard of living  only

upon  the  productivity  and  discipline  of   our

working  population, including both  the  managing

and  the  managed in both the public  and  private

sectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike other populous countries, we do not even

have a large, guaranteed, domestic market for  our

locally-made products. Given our limited  domestic

market  of 2.1 million persons, in order to attain

our targeted Gross Domestic Product growth rate of

15  per cent annually over the next five years, we

simply  must  export  more  and  more.  To  secure

markets  for  our  exports, we  must  be  able  to

compete internationally in terms of the price  and

quality  of  our  products.  And  to  do  so   our

businessmen,  industrialists and workers  must  be

efficient and productive. The importance,  indeed,

the necessity of raising productivity in Singapore

can never be overemphasised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, increases in productivity make

possible  wage  increases  without  upsetting  the

economic  apple-cart. Many of our workers  in  the

past  have worked conscientiously, diligently  and

with  the welfare of the nation at heart. Not only

do  they  deserve our thanks, in this decade  they

should  enjoy higher wages. However, higher  wages

without accompanying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>



productivity increases can impede economic

growth.  Fundamentally, the  businessman  is  more

interested in his labour cost per unit  of  output

rather than wages as such. If the productivity  of

his  employees  rises, he can  raise  their  wages

without simultaneously increasing his unit  labour

cost.   Through  higher  productivity  then,   the

aspirations of our workers for higher wages can be

met   without  inflation,  without  damaging   the

competitiveness  of our products in  international

markets,  and  without reducing the attractiveness

of   our   investment  climate.  I  repeat   --the

necessity   to  raise  productivity  in  Singapore

cannot be over-emphasised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Productivity Centre was established

in May 1967, within the Economic Development Board

as  a result of a joint declaration signed by  the

National  Trades  Union  Congress,  the  Singapore

Employers'    Federation   and    the    Singapore

Manufacturers' Association. In July last year, the

National Productivity Centre was transferred  from

the Economic Development Board to my Ministry.  It

had  always been envisaged that after the National

Productivity   Centre   had  acquired   sufficient

experience  and  expertise, its  status  would  be

raised  to that of a statutory board. Having  been

in  existence  for  almost  five  years  now,  and

bearing   in   mind  the  importance  of   raising

productivity, it is opportune to transform it into

a statutory board now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to go into the

details  of  the Bill as regards the aims,  powers

and  functions of the National Productivity  Board

as  these are clearly indicated in the Explanatory

Statement to the Bill. I shall only point out some

of the salient features of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill provides for the

appointment of a 14-member board consisting of the

chairman,  three directors each to  represent  the

Government, employers, trade unions, academic  and

professional  bodies associated with productivity,

and  an  Executive Director. This equal and  broad

representation will help the Board to better serve

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>



felt needs of different groups in our society  and

to  better  elicit their support in  the  task  of

raising productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the fundamental task of the

National Productivity Board is to raise the  level

of   productivity  in  Singapore.   Its   specific

objectives  are set out in clause 6 of  the  Bill,

the more important of which are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to promote productivity consciousness

amongst  management personnel, trade union leaders

and workers;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to provide training facilities for

management  and  trade  unions  personnel  in  all

productivity    techniques,   including    general

management,   personnel  management,   supervisory

development, management accounting and  industrial

engineering;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) to foster and promote good industrial

relations   by  training  and  by  promoting   the

formation of joint consultative councils;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) to render management consultancy services

in  the  same fields in which training  activities

are undertaken with a view to assisting industrial

enterprises  to  achieve  a  general  raising   of

productivity; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) to assist industrial establishments in

formulating  and rationalising wage  policies  and

wage systems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that the objectives of the Board will

be  achieved, it is also empowered in clause 7  to

publish    works   and   disseminate   information

concerning  productivity  techniques,   to   award

certificates  of  efficiency to persons  attending

courses  organised by the Board and to  establish,

under clause 6, a scheme of subscribing membership

to the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  wish to express my views on the  National

Productivity Board Bill which are purely those  of

a  common man. Sir, I therefore beg the indulgence

of the economists and other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>



intellectuals to bear with the viewpoints  of  the

common  man, which I now express. The  common  man

believes that if he works, and works hard  enough,

he  is entitled to a fair wage and a bonus out  of

the  fruits of his labour. The average man's basic

philosophy   towards  work  and  the  purpose   of

production  as  an extrapolation  of  work  is  to

satisfy   his  own  welfare  and  those  whom   he

considers are part of society. I hope the National

Productivity Board, when it proceeds in furthering

its  objective,  will endeavour  to  simplify  the

meaning  of productivity in terms of job  security

and  satisfaction and a better standard  of  life.

The  average worker could hardly feel  secure  and

happy if it were otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for the time being I would like

to  express  my  views on the subject  in  simple,

rounded terms.  I hope over the years I could have

the opportunity of elaborating my viewpoints.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not but agree that this is a vitally

opportune   time  to  introduce  the  concept   of

productivity in the process of production  and  in

the  process of distribution of wealth in  a  just

and  logical mode and manner. Therefore, I support

the  establishment  of  the National  Productivity

Board   whose   main   purpose   is   to   promote

productivity  in  all enterprises   industrial  or

otherwise     for   the  general  well-being   and

economic progress of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is already accepted as a fact of life that

Singapore  does  depend  on  foreign  investments,

foreign  raw  materials  for  its  industries  and

foreign   markets  for  our  manufactured   goods.

Practically all that we have is abundance of human

resources,  and there is no option but to  improve

productivity through better use of labour  through

time  and  space. In doing so, I hope the National

Productivity Board will ensure the adoption of the

following working principles:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Productivity exercises should not cause job

insecurity.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Productivity exercises should proceed through

bargaining at grass-roots level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Productivity exercises should not endanger

the health and safety of workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The employer must pay for the cost of

retraining the employee when there is redundancy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these conditions cannot be fulfilled, then

all  productivity drives and plans will be  looked

with  suspicion,  cause  resentment,  frustration,

discord and conflict.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other pertinent point I wish to make is that

the  National Productivity Board should  not  take

upon  itself the ultimate of knowing the  absolute

truth and solutions to all problems and to proceed

by setting guide lines and recommendations without

due  consultation  with both individual  employers

and workers and their organisations. No amount  of

firm orders or benign decrees, even lawfully given

after  this  Bill  is  passed,  will  create  good

industrial  relations and human happiness  in  the

long  run.  Democracy must be practised at  grass-roots  level in the best principles of  industrial

democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you will recall, Sir, I said in Parliament on

11th  July,  1968,  when the   House  debated  the

Employment Bill in 1968 [Hansard, Volume  27,  No.

10 cols. 535-61]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The question of increasing productivity in any

firm   or   undertaking   and   the   payment   of

productivity  rewards  can  also  be  worked   out

between   the   particular  employer,   employees'

representatives  and  the  National   Productivity

Council.  There must be the machinery for  working

out  productivity plans, examining the results and

for negotiating the payment of incentive awards to

make   any   productivity   drive   achieve    its

objectives.    The    question    of    increasing

productivity is an urgent matter and should be  of

serious  concern to employers, Government, workers

and   their  organisations  in  the  interest   of

economic progress. In this respect, if workers are

asked to give their wholehearted support to higher

productivity programmes and campaigns,  they  must

be    allowed   to   participate   actively    and

constructively  in  formulating  and  implementing

them. When there is success there must be concrete

and reasonable returns or rewards.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was my thinking then as it is now that it is

illogical and beyond comprehension that payment of

bonus  to  workers,  a vital incentive  to  higher

productivity, is negotiable only within a  certain

restricted limit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see there is provision to foster and promote

good industrial relations through the formation of

joint   consultative  councils  as  one   of   the

objectives of the National Productivity  Board.  I

do  hope  that it will be within the  province  of

such  joint  consultative  councils  not  only  to

discuss  and  to implement agreed work procedures,

but  also to look into the question of the payment

of  productivity bonuses, provided, however,  they

represent the will of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at this point I would like to

say  that  the  idea of forming joint productivity

councils  in  enterprises, which  would  serve  as

consultative   bodies   guiding   and    promoting

productivity,  is not new. In 1965, the  Singapore

Employers'      Federation,     the      Singapore

Manufacturers' Association and the National Trades

Union  Congress  at the behest of  the  Government

jointly   endorsed  the  Charter  for   Industrial

Productivity Code of Practice. Unfortunately, this

Charter,  which was solemnly contracted,  was  not

religiously practised in spirit and in real terms.

This  Charter is nothing but a dead letter. I hope

the  National Productivity Board will pick up  the

fallen threads, but not tread the same path.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also observe that among its objectives,

the   National  Productivity  Board  shall  assist

industrial  establishments  and  trade  unions  in

formulating  and rationalising wage  policies  and

wage  systems;  shall assist the  Government  from

time  to  time in shaping a national wage  policy;

and shall undertake manpower and wage studies.  On

the other hand, the Minister for Labour has on 8th

February,  1972,  constituted the  National  Wages

Council  with somewhat similar terms of reference,

as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) To assist in the formulation of general guide-lines on wage policy;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) To recommend necessary adjustment in wage

structure,  with  a view to developing  a  coherent

wage system consistent with long-term economic  and

social development;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) To advise on desirable incentive systems

for  the  promotion of operational  efficiency  and

productivity in various enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister for Labour clarify if the Wages

Council  is to operate as a body separate from  the

National Productivity Board or as an adjunct to the

Board?  Or will the Wages Council be subsidiary  to

the  National  Productivity Board? Or  will  it  be

unscrambled?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister For Labour will consider

the  last  point because if he has  too  many  dons

around him, sometimes they become boisterous.  They

do  not  write a one-and-a-half page memorandum  to

the  Cabinet.  I  tend to think that  the  Minister

himself  might be confused, and we all will  suffer

in the end.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I share the

sympathy  of the Member for Kallang in  respect  of

his   apprehension  and  fear  that  the  increased

productivity  may lead to loss of job security  for

workers,  may endanger the safety of workers  while

at work, and so forth. It is, in fact, to meet this

kind   of   reservation   that   there   will    be

representations  from  the  trade  unions  on   the

National Productivity Board itself. I am quite sure

the  trade union representatives on the Board  will

be  competent enough to safeguard the interests  of

the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, regarding the question of bonus payments, as

I  have said earlier during the Budget debate,  the

whole  question of bonus payment and the amount  of

bonus  negotiable is being referred to the National

Wages Council for deliberation. The Government  has

made  known its views to the National Wages Council

regarding this matter, and we are waiting  for  its

recommendations. I think the Member for Kallang  is

well aware that the recommendations of the Wages



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>



Council will only be ready around the end of  April

or  early May. So I ask him to be a little bit more

patient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There can really be no conflict arising between

the   National  Wages  Council  and  the   National

Productivity Board, because the Board is, in  fact,

servicing the National Wages Council. The  National

Wages Council is purely an advisory body which will

submit reports and recommendations periodically  to

the   Government  on  wages  and  guide-lines   for

implementation by the Government and  the  `various

employer  organisations. In servicing the  National

Wages   Council,  I  am  quite  sure  the  National

Productivity  Board will be able to assist  in  the

various ways of formulating such guide-lines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Ong Pang Boon].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>7.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Prof. Wong Lin Ken):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to establish the Commercial and

Industrial Security Corporation to take over  on  a

commercial  basis the functions of  the  Guard  and

Escort Unit constituted under the Police Force  Act

in  providing for guards and escorts as a  security

service to the commercial and industrial sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guard and Escort Unit was formed in 1959 from

the  ranks of the old Special Constabulary  and  at

the   outset   consisted  of  the  Commandant,   11

Inspectors and 800 Special Constables.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>



The   Union  performs  a  wide  range  of   duties

including:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) guard for important personages;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) escorts for payroll and the delivery of

cash;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) static property and building guards; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) ship guards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unit was constituted primarily for the

purpose   of  providing  guards  and  escorts   to

Government   Departments,  thereby   leaving   the

regular  policemen to deal with matters pertaining

to  the preservation of public peace and order. In

addition, the Unit also contributes towards  crime

prevention by offering its services to the private

sector on payment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the Guard and Escort Unit providing a

security  service to the commercial and industrial

sectors, there are also a number of other  private

firms    in   the   security   business.   Despite

competition from these firms, the Guard and Escort

Unit  netted about $2.1 million and $2 million  in

revenue  for the years 1970 and 1971 respectively.

This amount was earned by deploying only one-third

of  the  manpower,  as the other  two-thirds  were

deployed  for  unpaid  duties  and  administrative

work.  It is, therefore, evident that the services

of  this  Unit  are heavily in demand  and  it  is

envisaged that the trend would continue well  into

the  future.  With  this  in  view,  the  National

Productivity Centre was requested in October 1970,

to  study  the feasibility of expanding the  Guard

and Escort Unit on a commercial basis. The finding

of  the National Productivity Centre is that it is

a viable project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the payroll and cash-in-transit

robberies occurred because of no security  guards.

On  4th  September, 1971, five  employees  of  the

Singapore  Woollen Knitwear (Private)  Limited  in

Jurong, including two female payroll clerks,  were

robbed  of a sum of about $45,000 at Quality  Road

while  on  their way back to the factory from  the

bank.  The  firm  probably felt  that  since  five

persons  were accompanying the payroll it was  not

necessary to have security guards to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>



escort  the cash-in-transit. On 1st August,  1970,

the  Manager  of Diamond Theatre at  North  Bridge

Road  was  robbed of the previous day's collection

amounting, to about $10,000 by two  youths  armed

with  daggers, when he was on his way to  bank  in

the  cash. He also had no security escort. I could

cite some more examples, but I think the point  is

made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill provides for the establishment of the

Commercial  and  Industrial Security  Corporation,

which  will consist of not less than four and  not

more  than  nine  members to be appointed  by  the

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The functions of the Corporation are:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to provide guard and escort for the protection

of persons and property;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to provide such other security services as the

Corporation may determine; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to co-operate as far as practical and

necessary with the Singapore Police Force  in  the

performance of its functions under this Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation is empowered to appoint such

officers  and employees as it considers  necessary

for  the  purpose of carrying out  its  functions,

including the appointment of a General Manager.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is considered desirable that the services

of   the   Corporation  should  be  available   to

Government in times of emergency, personnel of the

Corporation will continue to carry arms. Clause 12

of  the  Bill  enables the Corporation,  with  the

approval of the Commissioner of Police, to provide

its  officers  and  employees with  arms,  warrant

cards  and  powers  and  immunities  as  a  Police

Officer.  Like Police Officers, they will  not  be

allowed to be members of a trade union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 empowers the Commissioner of Police,

with the approval of the Minister, to mobilise for

active service all or any officers or employees of

the Corporation to perform either general



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>



or  special Police duties. An officer or employee

of  the Corporation who is so mobilised is liable

to  perform  such service as the Commissioner  of

Police  or his authorised representative directs,

and  during the period of mobilisation shall have

the   same   powers  and  duties  and  the   same

protection and immunities as a Police Officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer of employees from the present Guard

and Escort Unit to the Corporation as well as the

transfer  of  rights, liabilities and obligations

of the Unit to the Corporation are catered for in

clause  15. Those who will be transferred to  the

Corporation will go over on terms and  conditions

no   less  favourable  than  those  they  enjoyed

immediately prior to their transfer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation is empowered under clause 16 to

establish a scheme or schemes for the payment  of

pensions,  gratuities, provident  fund  or  other

superannuation  benefits  to  its  officers   and

employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial provisions relating to the Corporation

(for example, powers to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>



borrow and invest) are dealt with in clauses 18

to 21.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 empowers the Minister to make rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IX of the Police Force Act relating to the

Guard and Escort Unit is repealed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Prof. Wong Lin Ken].

amendment; read a Third time and passed.
