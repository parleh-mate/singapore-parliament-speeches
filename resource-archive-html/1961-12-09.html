<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members will remember that when the P.A.P. came

into  power, they created Political Secretaries  in  a

number of Ministries. There was no creation of such  a

post in the Ministry of the Deputy Prime Minister. But

in  1960  when the Political Secretary in the Ministry

of  Labour and Law came out into the open as a sort of

rebel   against  the  P.A.P.,  it  was  felt  by   the

Government  that his continued presence  as  Political

Secretary in the Ministry of Labour and Law  would  be

very  embarrassing to the Government.  The  Government

considered that his actions there were inimical to the

policy of the P.A.P., and yet it did not do the  right

thing  as  it would have done had the culprit  been  a

civil   servant.  He  was  not  summarily   dismissed.

Instead, a special post of Political Secretary had  to

be  created  in  the  Ministry  of  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister in order to contain this rebel. At that  time

last  year,  there  was  a lot of  discussion  on  the

creation  of  this  post. I  think  it  was  not  only

explained by the Government, but some Members  on  the

Government Bench even went to the extent of  defending

the  holder of this post - Mr Fong Swee Suan. The  post

was  created in this Ministry in order to contain  Mr

Fang  Swee Suan and his continuation in this  job  was

explained by the Government. He was defended, in fact,

very  vigorously. Today, Mr Fong Swee Suan is no more

with  the Government. Not only is he no more with  the

Government, but the Prime Minister in his series of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1745</b></font><br><br>



awful  disclosures  described him as  a  Communist.  It

would appear that the Government had misused this post.

The  Government  had felt it necessary to  give  public

funds to a Communist.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Pro-Communists.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Or pro-Communist, whatever it is.

Now that the necessity to contain a pro-Communist is no

longer there, is it necessary to keep this vote in the

Ministry  of the Deputy Prime Minister? I do not  think

the  Deputy  Prime  Minister would want  any  Political

Secretary any more after his sad experience.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Everything I want to

say  was  already said yesterday, but I would  like  to

know - oh, no, I misunderstood.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member is not speaking on this

amendment?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Leong Keng Seng?



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Thio Chan Bee?



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Inche Ahmad Jabri is not here. Dr Toh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I think we have to recollect the  events

leading to the appointment of Mr Fong Swee Suan as  my

Political Secretary in chronological order. When he was

appointed  Political Secretary to me, he was  given  an

opportunity  to  learn new subjects and  to  prove  his

qualities and ability in assisting me in my Ministry. I

believe  that was sometime in the middle of  1960.  The

Prime  Minister  made his series of broadcasts  only  a

couple of months ago. Unfortunately - I must say it  was

a  disappointment to me - my ex-Political  Secretary  did

not prove his mettle. However, I would like to say that

it  does  not necessarily mean that if a man could  not

fulfil his task



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1746</b></font><br><br>



in the post, therefore the post should be abolished.  I

think it stands on principle that it should remain, and

if  in the future I should find a man who will be  able

to assist me - and who will probably blow less hot air - on

technical matters, I am prepared to appoint him  as  my

Political Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, was it not a fact

that this post was created in 1960 just to contain  Mr

Fong  Swee  Suan - to transfer him from the  Ministry  of

Labour and Law to the

Ministry of the Deputy Prime Minister?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That was related in the debate on

the Estimates for 1960 and I do not want to go back  to

history.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I take it that the answer is

yes. Therefore, since the man is no longer there to  be

contained, why keep the vote?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> As I have pointed out to the Member

for Cairnhill, the post is already there and if the man

does  not  prove  his worth, it is up  to  me  to  find

another man to fill the post. If the man has not proved

his  worth, it does no necessarily mean the post  ought

to  be  abolished. May I give the hon. Member a  simple

example? There is a post--the elected representative of

Cairnhill. If the Member for Cairnhill does  not  prove

his  worth, it does not necessarily mean that we should

abolish that post.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as regards the manner and

the  moment of the creation of this post, it  is  quite

clear  to  the House that it was created in order  that

the Deputy Prime Minister, who is the mildest gentleman

in  the P.A.P., could deal with Mr Fang Swee Suan  who

was  getting  very  difficult, because  you  know,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, that when trouble brews in the P.A.P., it

is the Chairman who sorts it all out because he is such

a  gentleman.  It was this quality in the Deputy  Prime

Minister  that persuaded the Prime Minister to transfer

Mr  Fong Swee Suan from the Ministry of Labour,  where

he  had  to deal with the present Minister for  Health,

to;  the  Ministry of the Deputy Prime  Minister.  But,

unfortunately, no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1747</b></font><br><br>



such  post  existed. Therefore, the Government  created

the  post without reference to the Assembly because  it

had  to  be done quickly on a Special Warrant, and  Mr

Fong Swee Suan was put there. It is fairly certain  and

as  clear  as the nose on one's face that the post  was

created specially to contain Mr Fang Swee Suan. It was

never  the  intention  of  the  Government  to  have  a

Political  Secretary  to  the  Deputy  Prime   Minister

because,  if  one  looks at the departments  under  the

Deputy Prime Minister, it is quite clear that there  is

not  much point in appointing a Political Secretary.  I

think even the Deputy Prime Minister will admit that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My other point is that Mr Fong Swee Suan has left the

Government and has left the Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He will come back.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Well, if he comes back, that will be the

time for the Minister to come back to the House for  an

approval of the vote. I ask the Minister for Finance to

follow  Establishment practice in these matters,  which

is  this: if the use for the post has disappeared, then

the  post must be abolished. The use for this post  has

certainly  disappeared,  and I  ask  the  Minister  for

Finance  how  he,  in fairness to the finances  of  the

country, can tolerate this post in the Budget. We  know

what  a strict Minister for Finance he is. We know  how

difficult he is with the Establishment Branch on posts.

Therefore, he should apply the same yardstick  to  this

matter.  He is not concerned with the politics  of  the

P.A.P.  He  is  the Finance Minister of  the  State  of

Singapore.  I  will  tell  him  this:  if  he   carries

redundant  posts  in the Budget, it merely  means  that

sums  of  money  which  could be available  for  social

services  and  such  like valuable  objects  arc  being

denied.  Can the Minister for Finance tolerate  such  a

situation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, was

there  any  work  actually given  to  the  ex-Political

Secretary?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> rose -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1748</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Minister for Culture sharing in

this  debate? If he wishes to do so, he can do so.  Mr

Rajaratnam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> This is going to be a recurring

subject. I myself will be sooner or later involved.  It

is  just as well to dispose of it at this moment. There

are  two  points.  If I remember correctly,  when  this

business of Political Secretaries was discussed earlier

on,  I  think it was made quite clear that in principle

every  Minister was going to have a Political Secretary

because,  as  had  been explained, the  function  of  a

Political  Secretary  was to assist  Ministers  in  the

political aspect of their work. To that extent,  if  at

any particular time a Minister does or does not have  a

Political  Secretary, it does not mean that  he  should

not have one at some subsequent date when he feels that

he  can  get a man more suited to the post.  The  other

point  is  this. It is not necessarily true  that  just

because  Mr  Fong Swee Suan failed very badly  in  the

technical  job to which he was assigned, that  the  job

should  be  abolished. As you know, Sir, I  think  five

Parliamentary Secretaries have also defected.  It  does

not   mean   that  we  should  abolish  the  posts   of

Parliamentary Secretary. In fact, there was a time when

four or five Ministers had no Parliamentary Secretaries

for a while.



<br><br>2.45 p.m



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the fact that the post is vacant at any particular

time  does not necessarily mean that there is  no  need

for  its existence, because if and when we can  find  a

suitable man to fill it we will certainly do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Sir, the Deputy Prime

Minister has quite nicely suggested that Mr Fang  Swee

Suan was transferred to his Ministry because he was  to

be  given  training  in the technical  aspects  of  his

Ministry.  But I think the Member for Farrer  Park  has

made  his point, that there is practically nothing,  as

far  as I can see, in the Ministry of the Deputy  Prime

Minister which calls for a Political Secretary's  post,

having regard to the sort of work that Political



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1749</b></font><br><br>



Secretaries in the Ministry of Labour and Law  and  the

Ministry  of  Education are doing. I  do  not  want  to

labour this point. All that I am trying to do is to put

this  question  of Political Secretary  in  its  proper

perspective  so that, as the Minister for  Culture  has

said,  when  we  come  to  the next  Head  and  discuss

Political Secretaries, we may understand what it is all

about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To start off with this question of Political

Secretaries -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Member for Thomson

was here when we discussed this same topic under the

Prime Minister's Ministry, and I did indicate that two

aspects of the topic had to be discussed and disposed

of yesterday. The first was the principle as to why

Political Secretaries are necessary. That has been

disposed of. The other point is the increase of $250 in

salary. That too has been disposed of. Now we are

dealing with any reason why a Political Secretary is

required in any Ministry, and we have come to the

Deputy Prime Minister's Ministry. That is the subject

of debate now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I just want to say things that are related

to  what has transpired so far as Mr Fong Swee Suan is

concerned. In the first place, Sir, Mr Fong Swee  Suan

was not transferred from the Ministry of Labour and Law

because   he   needed  technical   training.   He   was

transferred  because  he  criticised  the  Government's

labour  policy when he spoke as a trade unionist  at  a

trade  union meeting. The Government did not  have  the

guts  to sack him because they knew that if they sacked

him  they would lose the confidence of the workers.  So

what they did was quietly to transfer him to some place

where  he  would  be considered least  harmful  to  the

Government.  Mr Lim Ching Siong was already  Political

Secretary in the Ministry of Finance where they thought

he  would be least harmful. So they could not have  Mr

Fong  Swee  Suan in the Ministry of Finance, and  their

next  obvious  choice was the Ministry  of  the  Deputy

Prime   Minister.  Therefore,  Sir,  the  question   of

Political  Secretaryship in the Ministry of the  Deputy

Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1750</b></font><br><br>



Minister  was  purely for the purpose of  accommodating

Mr  Fong Swee Suan. Now Mr Fang Swee Suan is no  more

in the P.A.P., and I do not think Mr Jek Yuen Thong or

Inche Rahim Ishak, the two Political Secretaries at the

moment,  would ever be required to take a  transfer  on

the same basis as Mr Fong took. Even if that happened,

Sir, the post of Political Secretary in the Ministry of

Finance being vacant, I therefore do not think there is

any need to have the post contained.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Member for

Thomson  has  said,  if Mr Fong  Swee  Suan  had  felt

unhappy in my Ministry as Political Secretary,  and  if

it  was thought that the idea was to contain him,  then

the  obvious  step for him to take would have  been  to

pack up instead of accepting the post.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> I am far

from being certain, Mr Speaker, Sir, that a Political

Secretary is not necessary in the Deputy Prime

Minister's Ministry. You will recollect that a week

go - or was it two weeks ago? - when the postmen decided at

a meeting to call a strike, I would suggest, Mr

Speaker, Sir, that if Mr Fang Swee Suan had been in

harness, that incident could well have been averted. So

I think the argument -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The Minister's argument?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> One way or the other. Whenever you

deal  with  a large labour force, there are matters  in

which  various officers in the Deputy Prime  Minister's

Ministry are involved in public relations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question raised by the Member for

Havelock, whether Mr Fong Swee Suan did or did not  do

any  work, I cannot speak for the particular gentleman,

but  I  do  know  what  happened to  my  own  Political

Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Perhaps the Minister will let us

know about that when we come to his Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> So be it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1751</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I was hoping that the Minister for

Finance  would answer the question, if he was satisfied

that  this  post was not likely to be filled,  or  that

there was no reason to believe that this post could  be

filled,  or  that there was anybody in the  offing  who

could  fill  that  post, whether he,  as  Minister  for

Finance, would not see to, it that this post be deleted

from  the Estimates. Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the main

difficulty  in this matter is this, that the Government

is  taking  a particular stand on this. They  made  the

first  move  in this. Right. The whole thing  has  gone

wrong  and,  if  I may use the Finance  Minister's  own

expression - a suitable expression - the Government is in a

state  of  "zugzwang". Any single move they  make  with

regard to Political Secretaries would be a wrong  move.

So  the Minister for Finance, who is a chess player, is

in  a state of "zugzwang". He refuses to carry out  his

duties   as  Minister  for  Finance  and  allows   this

appointment  to  continue. Sir, it is  quite  pointless

tying  up  in  this  manner public  money  which  could

otherwise be spent usefully. Sir, I would like to  hear

the Minister for Finance on the tying up of money which

could be utilised for other public purposes. This is  a

serious  proposition which I put  to  the  Minister  in

order to help his Government save its face - hundreds of

thousands of dollars are being denied for public use.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I must answer the

Member  for Farrer Park. I do not want him to refer  to

the  Minister for Finance because I also have  to  take

the responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give this House this assurance: if by the end of the

next financial year I am not able to find somebody  who

is  able to act as my Political Secretary and be a good

public  relations officer between my Ministry  and  the

public, then when the subsequent Budget comes,  I  will

see that that post is not kept in my Ministry.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I

would  like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister a question

on  this item. As far as I can see, the creation of the

post   of  Political  Secretary  in  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister's  Office can have only one  use - if  there  is

any - and  that  is  to assist in the design  of  postage

stamps.  In  this respect, there may be some  political

colour;  for example, on National Day we have  a  stamp

design. I wonder whether the Deputy Prime Minister  has

consulted his Political Secretary in this respect.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Time is getting on.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

heard the Deputy Prime Minister assure us that when  we

come  to  the Budget for 1963, if he does not have  any

use  for  his  Political Secretary,  he  will  consider

deleting  that  post. Might I remind him  that  we  are

coming to that Budget in a few days' time?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Barisan

Sosialis  have  got  the  facts  wrong.  We   are   not

considering  the 1963 Budget. It is a Vote on  Account.

It is different from the Budget.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, in view of the assurance given

by  the  Deputy  Prime Minister, may  I  beg  leave  to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 12 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (5) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because procedure requires that I cannot say

anything if I do not wish to move an amendment, I  have

taken  the  liberty of moving one in order  to  explain

that I have given notice of a number of amendments of a

similar  character. The first amendment was in  respect

of  the  Ministry  of  the  Prime  Minister,  when  the

Minister for Finance explained that there had been some

reorganisation in the civil service, and that there had

been  some  upgrading  and downgrading.  Therefore,  in

cases where I am satisfied



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1753</b></font><br><br>



that  it  was as a result of that exercise, I will  not

move  my  amendment.  I now beg leave  to  withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> After that long speech, any Member may

speak  if he wishes to. I am not preventing any  Member

from speaking. No one wishes to speak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of Tun Lim

Yew Hock and Inche Ahmad Jabri bin Mohammad Akib -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 12 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 3.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I am calling upon the Member

for the Southern Islands to move it.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 12 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 3.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concerns entertainment expenses. In 1961 $3,000

was  voted  for,  and  for 1962  $4,000.  There  is  an

increase of $1,000. I observe there are no increases in

entertainment   expenses  in  other   Ministries.   The

increase appears only in this Ministry. So I would like

to  know  why the increase of $1,000 is needed,  and  I

believe all other Members would also like to know.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I do agree there has

been  an  increase of $1,000 in entertainment  expenses

under  my Head. This is a personal application which  I

made  to  the Finance Minister, and the explanation  is

very simple. In my capacity as Deputy Prime Minister, I

have  to receive Ministers and statesmen from overseas.

Being  also  in charge of several technical departments

and  the  Polytechnic, I have to meet  technicians  and

professional  people  who come to Singapore  either  to

advise  me  or  to  offer  material  assistance  to  my

departments   or  to  the  Polytechnic.   Under   these

circumstances, I have found from my experience that the

sum  of $3,000 was quite inadequate. In fact, this year

with the Air Show I was pretty hard up. There were many

people whom I ought to have entertained rather than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1754</b></font><br><br>



just  merely shaking their hands and accepting material

assistance. I felt quite ashamed.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that this is not going to happen next year,

I  have personally applied to the Finance Minister  for

another  $1,000.  You  know, Mr Speaker,  that  not  a

single  cent enters my pocket because this money  comes

under  a  vote. Since I am going to get another  $1,000

under  entertainment expenses, if  any  Member  on  the

opposite  benches wants me to entertain them, they  are

welcome,   provided   they  can   give   me   technical

assistance!



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): In view of the

explanation of the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr  Speaker,

I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 12 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 4.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this item shows an increase of $1,800 in the

transport  and travelling allowance. We are told,  Sir,

that in regard to transport for Ministers, they do make

use  of pool cars. Where then is the necessity for this

increase of $1,800?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, the sum under

transport and travelling is not paid to me. I  have  an

office car to use, and the increase is not given to  me

at  all.  A  sum  of money is required  for  travelling

expenses  incurred by my Office and by my Parliamentary

Secretary.  As you are aware, Mr Speaker, particularly

with  changes  going  on in my departments,  which  are

largely  of  a  pan-Malayan  character,  there   is   a

considerable amount of discussion which has to be  held

between  Singapore  and  Kuala  Lumpur.  Sometimes   it

necessitates  frequent trips to  Kuala  Lumpur  for  my

officials  and myself to discuss with our  counterparts

there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 13 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, about five years ago, all political Parties in

Singapore  accepted the principle of Malayanisation.  At

that  time,  the present Minister for  Health  and  Law

played  a  very  predominant  part  in  demanding   that

Malayanisation be introduced as speedily as possible. It

was  felt, however, Sir, that in certain posts it  might

be  necessary to retain expatriate officers until  local

officers  were  trained.  Another  principle  was   also

mentioned, that as soon as a local officer could be  put

in, the expatriate officer could still be retained as  a

supernumerary officer or as an advisory officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the post of Director of Civil Aviation was

vacated  by  the  expatriate officer  at  that  time.  I

believe  the replacement was also an expatriate officer.

We  are not saying that the successor is not able to  do

the  job.  But if we are going to follow the  policy  of

Malayanisation,  will  the  Government  explain  whether

there are not suitable local officers who can fill  that

post?  If  it  is  necessary for the present  expatriate

officer  to  be  retained, cannot he be  retained  as  a

supernumerary officer?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, as far as the policy

of  Malayanisation is concerned, I can assure the  House

that  I am one of its champions. In fact, I have exerted

my utmost to malayanise as many posts as possible in the

departments under my charge. Now, with reference to  the

particular post mentioned by the Member for Tanglin - the

post of Director of Civil Aviation. I must give him this

information  in  case he speaks out  of  ignorance.  The

present Director of Civil Aviation was seconded  to  the

Singapore  Government by the Australian Government.  His

period of secondment will expire in June 1962.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1756</b></font><br><br>



As   far  as  the  present  incumbent  of  the  post  is

concerned, I can convince the Member for Tanglin that he

is  only  too happy to go back to his post in Australia,

because  otherwise  he will lose benefits  in  terms  of

pension and so on. We have just now two officers who are

being  trained and groomed for the post of  Director  of

Civil  Aviation.  A  report on their  capabilities  will

subsequently   be  submitted  to  the   Public   Service

Commission.  It  will be the P.S.C. who will  ultimately

decide  which one of these trainees will be suitable  to

fill the post of Director of Civil Aviation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the

assurance given, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 13 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (2) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this particular case, it is a downgrading of a

post.  An Airport Signals Officer drawing a salary scale

of Code I-10 is now regraded as Administrative Assistant

drawing a salary scale of Code I-25. That is to say,  it

is  on a lower salary scale. Although the starting point

is  still  the  same  at $680 a month,  the  maximum  is

different.  In the case of the higher salary scale,  the

maximum  is  $1,420.  In the case of  the  lower  salary

scale, the maximum is $1,030. Sir, I bring this point up

in  order  to  find out from the Minister the  procedure

adopted  in downgrading a post. Does the holder  of  the

post of Airport Signals Officer automatically become  an

Administrative Assistant on a lower scale?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Has the Member for Cairnhill looked at

the   correct  items?  The  bracketed  items   are   the

"Administrative Officer" and "Administrative Assistant".



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am sorry. When I said "Airport

Signals  Officer",  I  mean  Administrative  Officer  to

Administrative Assistant.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1757</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, this is part of the question

which  the  Member  for Cairnhill asked  yesterday  with

regard to Principal Assistant Secretary. It is all  part

of  the  scheme to reorganise the civil service. If  the

Minister  for  Finance were here, he could  explain  the

reorganisation much more clearly than I can. However,  I

have  a script down here which explains what is required

of  an Administrative Assistant. This is a trainee grade

where  new recruits to the Administrative Service obtain

training  and  guidance  from  senior  officers,  and  a

knowledge  of as wide as possible a range of  government

activities and structure. They will normally be attached

to  more senior officers as assistants, with the minimum

of  specified duties, but they will have an  opportunity

to  learn  other work for which they may be expected  to

have  responsibility in the future. There  may  well  be

periods  in  which they are charged with  duties  in  an

executive  field.  They will be  expected  to  serve  as

Secretary in Committee, to prepare draft papers  bearing

on   matters  of  policy  for  consideration  by  senior

officers,  and  to  carry out research  leading  to  the

presentation   of   facts  and  comments   on   existing

situations.  They  will  often  be  concerned  with  the

detailed study of legislation.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Deputy Prime

Minister  has  said a lot of things which  do  not  even

answer  the simple question asked by me. What I  ask  is

this - here we have an Administrative Officer on a  higher

scale. Then we reduce his scale to a lower scale. How do

we carry it out? Do we ask the Administrative Officer to

become  an  Administrative Assistant and shut his  mouth

and  make  him  get a lower pay? What is  the  procedure

adopted?  Is  it  because  the  Administrative   Officer

drawing  that  salary has already left  the  post,  and,

therefore,  the  post  has been renamed  "Administrative

Assistant"? Is it that a new entrant has come  into  the

service,  and  not that the holder of the Administrative

Officer post has been forcibly asked to take on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1758</b></font><br><br>



the  job  as Administrative Assistant on a lower  scale,

which means a reduction of nearly $300 in the maximum?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when we had an expatriate

service,  there  used  to  be what  were  known  as  the

Administrative  Service  and the Administrative  Officer

grades, the former a fully administrative grade and  the

latter  a  semi-administrative grade,  the  officers  of

which  were known as Administrative Officers. They  were

all  expatriate  officers. The grade  of  Administrative

Officer  has  been  abolished and we have  regraded  the

Administrative  service, timescale.  The  Administrative

service, timescale, has been broken into two. The  upper

half  of  it  (a  sort of super-scale) is  in  fact  the

timescale  of  senior  officers  of  the  Administrative

service and the lower half is the new timescale  of  the

junior  officers of the Administrative Service  who  are

now  known as Administrative Assistants. So that  really

these  former  post of Administrative  Officer  are  now

surplus to requirements. We also have, as Members of the

House  known,  the Executive Service with  its  echelon,

that  is,  the  Executive Officer, the Higher  Executive

Officer  and  the  Senior Executive  Officer.  With  the

reorganisation  of  the civil service,  these  posts  of

Administrative Officer are redundant.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the

explanation given, may I beg leave to withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 13 he reduced by

$10 in respect of item (40) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I find it difficult to understand the notes on

this  page.  According to the notes, we have  the  words

"Salary  scale revised from (II-5)". That is the  salary

code.  In other words, the salary scale now inserted  in

1962  is one step higher than that for 1961. Yet we find

that the amount for 1962 and that for 1961 are the same.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1759</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$11,160 works out nicely at $930 a month, which is the

maximum of the II-4 scale, which is right for 1962. But

in  1961,  it  means  that the post  has  already  been

regraded  as  II-4. Therefore, I cannot understand  the

note  appearing there - "Salary scale revised  from  (II-5)" - because  the salary that appeared in  1961  is  the

salary scale for II-4.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, the explanation I have

is this. The previous salary scale of this post was one

of  the  few anomalous scales carried over from  former

years.   In   1958,   the  Civil  Aviation   Department

recommended  that the post be regraded and  the  salary

scale  revised  to equate that of the Higher  Executive

Officer,  as  the  duties  and  responsibilities   were

comparable,  but  this was not then  approved.  Further

representations were made and it was also  pointed  out

that  the  officer  holding this post  would  be  in  a

position  to  compete with the other  Higher  Executive

Officers  in  the  Department for the post  of  Airport

Commercial Manager. Therefore, in the reorganisation of

the  Department the regrading of this post was approved

for  1962.  The former salary scale for this  post  was

$655-25A-905. The scale now shown against item (40)  is

the H.E.O. scale, i.e., $690-30A-930.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, it would appear from the

Minister's  explanation that  the  post  has  not  been

adjusted.   But  in  1961  it  was  already   adjusted.

Therefore, the  note is not correct.  $11,160  is  the

salary scale of II-4 and not II-5. The maximum of  II-5

is  $905  and not $930. If it had not been adjusted  in

1961, then the officer must have been overpaid.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I cannot follow the argument of the

Member  for Cairnhill. If he wants to know a few  more

details,  I  can tell him. The present  holder  of  the

scale  was  appointed on 5.5.60 on  a  salary  of  $930

personal to himself. He was transferred from being  Air

Traffic  Control  Officer  to  perform  the  duties  of

Airport Traffic Officer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1760</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Now I understand the Officer who was

transferred to take up this post was drawing $930,  but

then  why put in notes to confuse a Member? We  do  not

have  all  the information that the Minister has.  This

note should not have appeared.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, all these little

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 14 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have nothing personal against the Master Attendant. But what I want to know from the Deputy Prime Minister is this. As far as I know, a few

months  ago there appeared in the newspapers the  story

that  the  Master Attendant and a few others, one  from

the National Seamen's Union, Mr Teo Chan Toon, and Mr

Lim  Ching Siong, visited Europe in connection  with  a

seamen's   employment  delegation.  I   wish   to   get

clarification  as  to  the  results  achieved  by   the

delegation. But what happens? Mr Teo was recalled back

to   Singapore.   Was  it  because  of  the   political

conditions   in  Singapore?  Why  was  this  expatriate

officer permitted to go alone by himself? Why could not

local  officers, who will be taking his place, be sent?

Mr  Speaker, the most important thing is what are  the

results  achieved  by  this delegation?  Nothing, was

heard about it in the newspapers. As for the nomination

of  other  representatives, there was  no  consultation

with  the  other  seamen's  organisations.  Is  it  the

Government's  view that the other seamen's organisation

should be ignored?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1761</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I do not think the

Member for Kampong Kembangan is quite correct when he

says there was a little party which included Mr Lim

Ching Siong on this trip to visit shipowners in Europe

and the United States. Originally, a little party

headed by the Master Attendant, in his capacity as

Chairman of the Seamen's Registry Board, and a member

from the Ministry of Labour, was to Visit all

shipowners in Europe and the United States in order to

find out the prospects of recruiting Singapore citizens

as seamen on board their ships. Unfortunately, when the

dates and the itinerary had been fixed, tie Master

Attendant fell ill. Our local officer from the Ministry

of Labour, who was already in Europe, was left to

himself. So a cable was sent to him saying that the

trip had to be postponed, and he returned to Singapore.

Subsequently, the Master Attendant recovered from his

sickness and he went off by himself on my own

authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not that we do not wish to consult the unions.

His  trip was mainly exploratory, to find out what  are

the   possibilities   of  foreign  shipping   companies

recruiting  Singapore seamen. As  you  are  aware,  Mr

Speaker,  we have to look for new avenues of employment

for  our  citizens. One of the avenues  which  we  have

consistently emphasized is that our people must  go  to

sea. The Master Attendant has come back and he has just

given  me  a  report of the results of his  talks  with

shipowners  in  Europe and the United States.  This  is

rather  a lengthy report which I do not think  at  this

moment I am prepared to read out to the House. But at a

subsequent  date  I  am  quite  prepared  to   make   a

ministerial statement on the report or even to  lay  it

before the Assembly for consideration. However, I would

like  to say that it is quite encouraging that we  have

now  found  1,000 new jobs for Singapore  seamen.  But,

unfortunately, as a result of his trip abroad,  it  has

turned  out  that a minority of our seamen  are  giving

considerable trouble to shipowners, and the  result  is

that  we have lost 200 jobs. 200 Singapore seamen  have

just been discharged because of the trouble created  on

board ship,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1762</b></font><br><br>



or  because of desertion, or because of refusal  to  do

work  for which they have signed under contract.  These

are some of the problems which the Master Attendant has

related  in his report. A large part of these  problems

relate  to discipline among our seamen. However,  I  do

not  wish to enlarge in detail on this subject  at  the

moment. At some subsequent date I am quite prepared  to

make  a statement on this or to table the report before

the House.

first  point  is regarding the Singapore River  because

since last year -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am afraid the hon. Member is

on a wide policy of that nature without having filed an

amendment. The amendment which is being debated now  is

in  connection with a specific item of a subhead  which

really  is  the peg on which the debate can take  place

and what he himself does in detail.

On  the  first part of his question, unless he gives  me

sufficient notice, I am afraid I cannot just provide the

figures of the expenses involved.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): In a spirit of compromise

with  the Deputy Prime Minister, I beg leave to withdraw

the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,390,710 for Head 14 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 15 he reduced by

$10 in respect of item (6) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, item (6) of subhead 1 shows that the salary of

the  Superintendent of Government Vessels  and  Launches

has been increased over his 1961 salary by $3,270, i.e.,

about   $295  a  month.  The  normal  salary   increase,

according  to the salary scale, is only $30 a month.  It

may he that this is due to a change of holder.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister will, of course, be able to answer that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is another point which is difficult for me to

understand, Sir. The amount shown for the 1962 Estimates

is  $11,580 a year, which works out at $965 a month  and

there  is no such step in the salary scale of I-18.  Can

the Minister please explain the confusion?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I may as well give the House a

history  of  this  post.  It was  created  in  the  1958

Estimates in the salary scale of $560-630-660-690  X  30A-930/960  X  35A-1,240. The holder of the post has to  deal

with  a  large  volume  of work in  the  Marine  Surveys

Department and does not require the attention  of  fully

qualified surveyors who are engaged in statutory  safety

at sea requirements. The duties



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1764</b></font><br><br>



of the post are supervision of maintenance of machinery,

house  and  the treatment of all Government vessels  and

launches.  The  poet  was held  from  November  1958  to

October  1960 by Mr Alfred Heng who is now promoted  to

Engineer and Ship Surveyor. When the 1961 Estimates were

framed,  $8,310 was provided for Mr Heng's  salary.  In

the  1962  Estimates, as the post was  vacant  when  the

Estimates were drafted, the mean of the salary scale was

provided   for.  This  accounts  for  the  increase   in

provision to $11,580 which will be required to meet  the

salary  of  the present holder. The P.S.C. has  selected

and  an  offer of appointment has gone to a certain  Mr

Peterson  who  is  the  Dredging Superintendent  in  the

Public  Works  Department. He is a first-class  engineer

(steam  and motor) in the Mercantile Marine. His present

salary  in  the  P.W.D. is  $1,030.  Mr  Peterson  has

requested  the Establishment to reduce the three  years'

probation to a one year's trial as he had already served

the three years' probation in his previous post with the

P.W.D. with  similar duties. I hope that satisfies  the

Member for Cairnhill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $232,870 for Head 15 ordered to stand part

of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1764</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 19-



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 19 he reduced by

$10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Budget Statement of the Minister for

Finance,  he  said  that  it had  been  decided  by  the

Government  that every permanently engaged monthly-rated

City  Council  employee would retain his present  salary

and  salary  scale  on his transfer  to  the  Government

service. That decision was welcomed by my colleague, the

Member for Farrer Park.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us now examine how this decision has been

implemented in the Budget that is before us. Sir, the

Registrar of Vehicles, on his City Council salary scale

of $1,280-45A-1,370-50A-l,620, now has his salary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1765</b></font><br><br>



scale regraded to a Government Super-scale Grade G post

carrying  a salary of $1,520 a month. The City  Council

salary  scale for the Registrar of Vehicles  carries  a

maximum  of  $1,620, whereas it is  now  changed  to  a

Government  Superscale Grade G  carrying  a  salary  of

$1,520.  That  is a difference of $100  a  month.  That

certainly,  Sir,  is  a change from  the  City  Council

salary  scale to a Government salary scale. Of  course,

to  make  that  up, the salary to be paid  in  1962  at

$1,520  gives an increase of $120 a month on  the  1961

salary. If it is the same holder, then he will be given

in  1962  an increase of $120 a month instead  of  $50,

according  to his City Council salary scale. But  then,

if  it  is  the same holder, he will be losing  $100  a

month  on the top of the timescale. Sir, is this not  a

change in the declared policy of the Government?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Not at all, Mr Speaker, Sir,I do

not think there is any deviation from what the Minister

for  Finance  said.  In order to explain  this,  I  had

better give the House the history of this post.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, this post was a City Council post

carrying a salary of $1,280-45A-1,370-50A-1,620  as

mentioned  by the Member for Cairnhill. Prior  to  July

1961 this year, the holder of this post was Mr Goh Kee

Song.  He  was on a fixed salary of $1,400 on contract,

and  he was seconded as the Registrar of Vehicles  from

the  City Engineer's Department in September 1958.  Now

the  present  person who is acting in  this  post,  Mr

Schubert, the legal adviser and prosecutor of the  City

Council, is drawing a basic salary of $965 in the scale

of $785-45A-1,280 per month plus C.O.L.A. (30 per cent)

and  an  acting allowance of $90. So when Mr  Goh  Kee

Song  vacated his post, the Establishment regraded  the

post of Registrar of Vehicles. They considered the post

as    a    purely   administrative   post.   In   fact,

advertisements  were  placed in the  Press  asking  for

applicants  to  fill this post. The P.S.C. interviewed

the applicants,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1766</b></font><br><br>



but unfortunately found none of them  suitable.

In  fact, the P.S.C. recommended that an administrative

officer should act in the post. So it is proposed  that

when  the  Registry  of Vehicles is finally  integrated

with  the  Government,  this  recommendation  will   be

adopted.  Then, of course again, this post is  open  to

anybody  who fills the requirements. There has been  no

deviation from what the Minister for Finance said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been a number of allegations that

course,  it will be easy for the Minister to  stand  up

here and deny them. But what I want to ask is this.  We

require  an increase on the whole of about 48 (44  plus

4)  new  posts.  What plans has the  Minister  for  new

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, let

me  tell the Member for Cairnhill quite explicitly that

it  is  all  nonsense  to say that  all  these  Parking

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Never mind. Let me state quite

clearly  that  the appointments are made by  the  Staff

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b>- Labour Exchange and half from the

have  laid  down. The question was asked by the  Member

for  Cairnhill as to why we need another 44  new  posts

plus  4  Senior Parking Attendants. This is because  we

have  plans to open new car parks at 20 sites. Shall  I

rattle them out to the House?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Minister could table

<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the Member for Serangoon Gardens, I

cannot  tell him how many applied. I was not in  charge

or  responsible  for  appointing persons  as  car  park

attendants. It is not my job. As I have said, it is the

job of the Staff Committee of the City Council, and  so

I cannot tell him how many applied or were refused. But

if  he  wants  to know how many were dismissed  or  had

their  services terminated, I can tell him.  Since  the

service  was  started, in 1959 I think,  13  have  been

dismissed  for different reasons - for fraud, dishonesty,

or abuse of time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Regarding this recruitment of an additional 44  Parking

attendants, I would like to know from the Deputy  Prime

Minister whether they are to come from the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I have said already that the rule

is  that  half of the applicants come from  the  Labour

Exchange  and the other half from the Work Brigade.  It

is  that  simple. Quite honestly, I discourage  anybody

recommending anyone to fill these posts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  would like to ask this: if any senior  parking

attendant should disagree with the views of the P.A.P.,

will  he  be  dismissed? If the Deputy  Prime  Minister

could not understand me, then I -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am under the impression that the

hon. Member has completed his question. Does he wish to

continue? Did the Deputy Prime Minister hear that

question?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the hon. Member will repeat his

question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I was saying that if

there  are any attendants who disagree with the P.A.P.,

will  they  be dismissed? For instance,  I  know  of  a

senior  parking attendant who was a bad P.A.P. member.

He  was  dismissed because he did not  agree  with  the

P.A.P.  What  is  the explanation of the  Deputy  Prime

Minister regarding this matter?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1769</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The answer is quite simple. I am

not  interested  in whether any employee  in  the  City

Council agrees or disagrees with the P.A.P. As long  as

he disagrees with the P.A.P. outside his duty hours,  I

have  nothing  to do with him. But as I have  told  all

members of my staff, as long as they are on duty,  they

are  paid  to  perform that duty and not to  carry  out

politics.  But  if they carry their disagreement  while

they   are  on  duty,  that  is  a  different  question

altogether.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, does

the  Deputy  Prime  Minister mean that  this  dismissed

officer  was dismissed because he carried out  politics

during office hours?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to know whether this car parking

scheme  has  earned  the Government some  thousands  of

dollars.  If  so,  I  want to know  why  these  parking

attendants have not got any increase in pay.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Profit sharing? Dr Toh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is the trouble when an

Assemblyman  talks out of ignorance. I had better  tell

him what exactly has happened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will explain to the House quite frankly. One of the

main  reasons why I pushed forward very hard the policy

of  putting  up  car parks all over the  place  was  to

provide employment for our local people. There had been

a   suggestion,  which  had  been  pressured  by  other

quarters,  to use car parking machines. But I  rejected

them  and said, "Use human labour." The reason was that

I could in this little way offer employment to our boys

and girls who come out from schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the scheme was started, they were paid $120 per

month  only and were on a probationary period of  three

months.  Since  that time there have  been  changes  in

their  salary  scales.  In  fact,  there  has  been  an

increase. And if the Member for Moulmein would like  to

know, car park attendants are now paid with effect from

1st October, 1961, a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1770</b></font><br><br>



salary of $114x4A-134/Bar/138x4A-154, plus a 30 per

cent  cost of living allowance. So he cannot  say  that

car park attendants have been treated unfairly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): But-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member must not speak

until he is called. Mr Lin.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am sorry. It appears

that originally the salary was $120, and now there  has

been a cut in the salary and that has been taken as  an

allowance. Is it fair?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Does the hon. Member understand

that  they  are  getting, in addition to their  salary,

which  I  have just recited, a cost of living allowance

of  30  per  cent? A basic salary plus cost  of  living

allowance  of 30 per cent. And on top of it,  each  car

parking  attendant is supplied with two sets of uniform

per  annum, two pairs of shoes per annum, one  umbrella

per  month, and female parking attendants are  supplied

with straw hats.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, it would seem that there is

again going to be a P.A.P./Barisan exchange. May I  now

beg leave to withdraw?

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 19 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is one matter on which I wish

to  touch.  It  has already been touched  upon  by  the

Minister  for Finance in his Budget Statement  when  he

was  dealing  with the question of the fall  in  petrol

consumption - I think it was. He did say that there  have

been  brought on to the roads of Singapore a number  of

small  scooters.  Sir,  I have  nothing  against  small

scooters, but when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1771</b></font><br><br>



they  produce a noise totally out of all proportion  to

the  smallness of their structure, when they emit fumes

which  are  sometimes nauseating if you  happen  to  be

close  to  them, and when they seem to be  so  flimsily

constructed  and  yet carry pillions on  them,  then  I

think it becomes a matter for public concern.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a newsboy who comes to my home to deliver

newspapers  in  the  morning. He  has  now  acquired  a

scooter for himself and he scoots into my house  making

a  terrible noise. The noise is enough to wake  up  the

devils  in the neighbourhood, including myself. I  have

to  get  up, for which I am duly thankful to him.  But,

Sir, when he has left the house for well after five  to

ten  minutes,  the  fumes are still definitely  in  the

house.  Now,  if one small scooter could do  that,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  imagine  the hundreds  of  scooters  in

Singapore emitting their noxious fumes on the  streets.

I am sure it cannot be doing the health of Singaporeans

any good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would ask the Minister whether this matter has

been considered by the Registrar of Vehicles. I do  not

know  whether it is he who licenses these vehicles.  If

he  is, I would request the Minister to ask him to take

these  factors  into  consideration  before  he  allows

scooters on the roads. They may serve a useful purpose,

Sir, but I think the overriding policy of the Registrar

should  be whether the vehicle is fit to be put on  the

road. As to whether it is fit, I think the questions of

noise,  fumes and safety are vital factors which should

be taken into consideration.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, in May 1960 we did try

to  persuade  drivers and owners of motor  vehicles  to

examine  their exhausts and so prevent obnoxious  fumes

from being poured out into the atmosphere. In fact,  we

did  issue several statements over the radio and in the

Press  warning  all owners that action would  be  taken

against  them if there were reports that their vehicles

were emitting excessive and obnoxious fumes. We did ask

members  of the public, who had reason to complain,  to

report to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1772</b></font><br><br>



the Police, Post Box 5000, the vehicle number, the time

and  place  where  such a vehicle  was  found  to  emit

obnoxious fumes. There is also under the Motor  Vehicle

Rules a regulation which compels all vehicles propelled

by  internal  combustion engines to be  fitted  with  a

silencer,  an  expansion chamber or  other  contrivance

suitable and sufficient for reducing as far as  may  be

reasonable  the  noise  caused by  the  escape  of  the

obnoxious gases from the engine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the House, from January to

August, 54 cases were dealt with by the Traffic Police;

12  summons cases; 35 cases were compounded; 7 cases of

warnings  issued to owners. I may as well  repeat  that

the maximum fine for the first offence is $400, for the

second  or subsequent offence, there is a maximum  fine

of  $1,000 or three month's imprisonment - a fact which

I  think  the Member for Farrer Park should inform  his

newspaper  boy.  If  he  has  a  justifiable  complaint

against his newspaper boy, he has got one of two things

to  do - either  report to the Registrar of Vehicles  the

number of the scooter, or to tell the newspaper boy not

to go to his house anymore.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think

the  thrill of riding a motor-bicycle lies in the noise

it   gives.  To  provide  silencers  would,  I   think,

discourage the sale of motor-bicycles and scooters. The

effective way of taking off the fumes from scooters,  I

believe,  is  to  provide  chimneys  as  we   have   in

Federation lorries. Then our scooter drivers will  have

an  aerial for the radio in front and a chimney for the

fumes at the back. But, Sir, I think we should come  to

a  few of the more serious problems of transport in our

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Sir, I wish to bring to the attention of

the  Deputy Prime Minister the state of affairs of  the

present  bus routes and the buses. They are in  a  most

deplorable state.

spoken  on  scooters. The Member  for  Farrer  Park,  I

think, is entitled to the floor now. Mr Rajah.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, if I may answer the last point raised

by  the  Minister. First, about reporting the newspaper

boy. Mr Speaker, Sir, I am so frightened of him that I

dare not even complain to him, let alone report him  to

the  Police.  On  the other matter which  the  Minister

talked  about - fines.  I do appreciate  that  there  are

rules  and regulations which enable the police and  the

enforcing authorities to impose fines. But I would  ask

the  Minister to give very serious consideration to the

question  of prevention. I always think that prevention

is better than cure. What I am at the moment interested

in is whether the Minister would instruct the Registrar

of  Vehicles that in future, when he does license these

vehicles, he should satisfy himself that they  are  not

of  a nature that will create noise or emit fumes,  and

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Just on a point of

elucidation.  The  Deputy Prime Minister  gave  us  the

rates  of the fines. Could I ask whether those  are  in

regard to the noise made or to the fumes emitted?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> First, to answer the Member for

Farrer  Park.  I  give  him my assurance  that  I  will

discuss  this  problem with the Registrar of  Vehicles,

that is, how scooters could be properly controlled with

regard  to  the amount of noise made and the amount  of

fumes  emitted.  I  am  quite sure  it  can  easily  be

arranged, that no vehicle will be registered unless  it

has passed certain mechanical tests.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1774</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question asked by the Member for Mountbatten

with  regard to the amount of noise, there is a section

referring to noise, exhausts and silencers.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

fumes  are  more  dangerous than the noise.  Would  the

Deputy  Prime Minister do something about the fines  on

the fumes as well?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes. In fact, I told the House just

now  that in 1960 we issued two statements through  the

radio  and  the Press, asking for the cooperation  of

the  public and other vehicle owners to see that  their

vehicles do not emit excessive and obnoxious fumes.  As

I  have  said, if the Member for Mountbatten is  civic

conscious, and if she sees a vehicle emitting excessive

fumes, all she has got to do is to take down the number

of  the vehicle, report it to the Registrar of Vehicles

and we will take action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask the Minister from what

correspond  with  the restoration of the  allowance  to

distributed to the people there.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> This is one of the puzzles the Chair

must face, I suppose. The hon. Member wants to know how

many  pigs the Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister

Surely  that does not come under this head.  I  do  not

know  whether the head covers pigs and sheep. I do  not

think  I  can allow that question, not under this  head

anyway.  Perhaps the hon. Member will look for  another

head.

understand   they  have  never  yet  had  a   Political

Secretary.   Now,   if   the  Minister   for   National

Mr  Speaker, Sir, although the need was there,  I  was

not  able  to  find a suitable man to fill  that  post.

Recent  events have indicated that there is  a  greater

necessity now for a Political Secretary. Sir, you  will

remember  the  trouble we had in the  last  few  weeks.

There  was  trouble  in  the People's  Association  and

trouble with the students. Now that those troubles  are

more or less contained, there are counter attacks on my

Ministry.  We are having trouble, as all Members  know,

in  the  Work Brigade. We are having trouble  with  the

squatters,  which  is  retarding the  progress  of  our

development  in housing, as well as the  making  up  of

roads.  As  I have said, Sir, I agree with  the  Deputy

Prime Minister that my Ministry is quite different from

his,  and,  therefore, I will not be giving the  Member

for  Farrer  Park the assurance which the Deputy  Prime

Minister gave.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after having listened to

as a bridge between the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1777</b></font><br><br>



Government  and  the masses, it would appear  that  the

Government has no such person, no such creature, or  no

such  animal at its disposal. Now, let us be  realists.

The  P.A.P. have  always prided  themselves  on  being

realists. Why not be realistic about this situation and

say,  "Look, we do not have anyone of this calibre.  It

is not easy to fill this post." Because if it were easy

to  fill  the post, Mr Speaker, Sir, I entirely  agree

with  the Government that from the Government point  of

view  such  a  person, if he could be found,  would  be

worth  his weight in gold. Although I myself am against

the principle that the Party in power should pay out of

public  monies for posts which will place the Party  in

power in a more favourable position to contest again on

a  re-election.  I oppose that in principle.  I  do  so

today, and I will continue to do so. But that does  not

mean  to  say I cannot understand it. I can  understand

it.   Having  understood  it,  I  am  now  telling  the

Government that they have not got anybody like that  at

their  disposal. Nor are they likely to get one  during

the  next three years. Why carry on this sham?  Abolish

Work Brigade, and Deputy Director, Work Brigade - are two

new posts in the Estimates. They seem to be very highly

paid posts, and I suppose the holders must be very well

qualified. I am sure the House like to know  who  these

gentlemen are and what their qualifications and  duties

are. It was revealed by the Finance Minister previously

that  the Work Brigade is more or less semi-charitable,

as  it  is not quite economical to let the Work Brigade

do  operations  which could be better done  by  regular

workmen.  Sir, I wonder why the Government should  want

to  employ two highly qualified men. We would  like  to

have further information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I wonder whether Members are perhaps

puzzled.  Looking  at  page 396, the  same  two  posts - Director,  Work  Brigade,  and  Deputy  Director,  Work

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I have never said that the

Work  Brigade is a charitable institution. What I  said

was that it was a scheme intended to give assistance to

the  unemployed by giving them useful work to do in the

way   of   building  rural  roads,  digging  irrigation

ditches,  levelling hills, and so on and so forth.  But

the  work is so arranged that it makes use of more  men

than machines. It is what people sometimes call "labour

intensive".  If  you want to, say, level  a  hill,  the

quickest, cheapest, easiest and most economical  method

is  to use bulldozers. You employ a few people and  the

work is done very quickly and cheaply. But that is  not

the  purpose of the operation. The purpose of the  Work

Brigade  is to give work to as many people as  possible

within  the  limits of the Budget. Now, this  does  not

mean that you can do things any old-how. We have in the

Brigade more than 2,000 members already. They are sited

in camps; and camps have to be located and built. Water

supply  and  lines have to be laid down. Power,  light,

rations, clothes, leave, establishment matters  and  so

on   have  to  be  arranged.  I  mean,  it  is  a  huge

organisation. You do need a person with some  technical

skill because he has to see that the design of the work

is  well planned and executions well supervised.  As  I

have said, this is a major organisation, though at  the

moment  it is running into certain snags. We hope  that

eventually these snags will be ironed out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the qualifications of the incumbent,

he  holds the degree of Bachelor of Science and is also

a  professional  mechanical  engineer.  He  has  fairly

lengthy  experience  in a very large  commercial  firm,

both  in  engineering and administrative  work.  I  can

assure the Member for Tanglin that he is by no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1780</b></font><br><br>



means overpaid for the responsibilities he has to carry

out and for the qualifications he possesses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Deputy Director, we are still looking

for a suitable person but have not found one yet.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Did the Member for Tanglin say these two

posts were new posts?

I am glad they are old posts. But I want certain

information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In fairness to all Members of the House,

I think that point must be cleared. I think the Member

for Tanglin says the two posts are new posts in 1962. 1

do not think the Minister has said that. Will the

Minister clear that just for the record?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> They are not new posts. The man in

the post has been working for quite some time.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, my main purpose was

this: I heard that a trained engineer was working with

the Brigade and, in view of the shortage of technical

personnel in the Public Works Department and the fact

that the Government could not spend money allocated for

the various items of work, it seems a waste of

technical talent if a very highly qualified technician

were put here and he could carry out work requiring

technical skill with the means that he has in the Work

Brigade. It is better perhaps for this man, who is very

highly qualified, to be sent back to the Public Works

Department.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I did explain. It is perhaps

something really for the Minister to say rather than I

myself. But I did explain that the Work



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1781</b></font><br><br>



Brigade  is engaged in public work projects of  various

kinds - building roads, ditches, levelling hills  and  so

on.   These   are   matters  which  require   technical

knowledge. I do not know whether the Member for Tanglin

has  ever built a road himself or ever plan to build  a

road. But if he ever gets down to it, he will find that

he does need a fair degree of technical knowledge.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, but this present

incumbent,  as  the Minister has said just  now,  is  a

scientist and not a road engineer.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, he has the degree of Bachelor

of  Science,  but he is also a professional  mechanical

engineer. It is true that if we had a civil engineer he

could  be,  perhaps, more fitted to the duties  of  the

post. But, nevertheless, in his previous experience  in

a  local  company, he had to supervise the construction

of very major civil engineering projects.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There seems to be some difficulty about

interpreting. Will the hon. Member repeat  slowly  what

he has said?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. I will

repeat. According to what the Minister has told us,  it

is  quite proper for an engineer to be the Director  in

charge of the Work Brigade. But from what I have learnt

from  the Director, he feels that he has a rather heavy

task  because, in addition to administrative  work,  he

has  to  supervise members of the Work Brigade. Perhaps

his time for recreation is thereby reduced.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a few days ago I

had  occasion,  I  think,  in  this  House  to  make  a

reference to the Work Brigade. I said that we  expected

trouble  there  and  this remark of  mine  caused  some

merriment in the Opposition benches, particularly among

the Barisan Sosialis. Sir, the Member for Pasir Panjang

is  obviously  enjoying  what he  believes  to  be  the

predicament of the Director of the Work Brigade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1782</b></font><br><br>



being  confronted with the demand by some of  his  more

irresponsible members of the Brigade to  form  a  trade

union.  Sir,  since this subject is raised,  perhaps  I

should say a few words. I did say that we are expecting

trouble  in the Work Brigade. I think the trouble  will

come.  I also say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that this will  be

round  No. 4 between the Barisan Sosialis and the  pro-Communist  back-room boys and the P.A.P. Round  No.  I,

Mr Speaker, Sir, was the People's Association -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Let us forget rounds 1, 2 and 3.

Let us carry on with round 4. There is a time limit.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I will not describe the

sequence  of events in rounds 1, 2 and 3 and where  the

k.o. was administered. But just for the record,  round

No. 1 was the People's Association; round No. 2 was the

City  Council  strike, where the pro-Communists  got  a

bloody  nose  over  this event; round  No.  3  was  the

students: and round No. 4, is the Work Brigade.  It  is

coming.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Round No. 5 - the P.A.P. is knocked

zugzwang. Whatever they do now, the remedy for -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He has always been talking about

zugzwang  and  he  has  always been  giving  the  wrong

explanation. "Zugzwang" means stalemate.  He  has  been

saying something which is utterly wrong.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I am sorry that such a well-known chess player could make so foolish a mistake.

Stalemate means your king cannot move. You get a draw -[Laughter]



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1783</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. This is not the time to have a

debate on chess movements. If we are going to do so,  I

am  afraid  the guillotine will be falling much  sooner

than the Opposition would like it to fall.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I just want to assure the House

that  zugzwang  is not stalemate. Zugzwang  - you  lose.

Stalemate - you get a draw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, to go back to the subject. Sir, round No. 4 is

starting and obviously Barisan Sosialis members are  in

good  heart. They are in good heart because they expect

to  deal  a blow, as the Member for Queenstown  himself

said,  which may be a k.o. for the P.A.P. Sir, we  have

survived  three rounds pretty well and  we  shall  deal

with  the  4th round with the same skill and resolution

as  we handled the other three. Perhaps it will not  be

in  order,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, to go  into  the  issues

involved  in the request of Brigade members to  form  a

union.  Would  that be in order since the  subject  was

raised?



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Pasir Panjang started

this  hare and the Minister is chasing it. How  far  he

can chase it, I do not know at the moment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, things have reached a stage in

some  Brigade  camps where I think the Government  must

take   notice   of   the   position.   Discipline    is

deteriorating, and in some camps which have  been  most

exposed  to  manipulation by supporters of the  Barisan

Sosialis,  discipline has totally collapsed.  Obviously

something must be done about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Table a motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> What is behind all this agitation

in  the  Work Brigade camps is the request  and  demand

that members should be permitted to form a trade union.

Sir, I have explained that Brigade members are not full-time  employees of the Government. In other words,  the

membership of the Work Brigade is a temporary thing - six

or  nine months perhaps. When a youth is unemployed, we

put  him  there,  and give him useful work  and  useful

training if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1784</b></font><br><br>



we  can either in the Polytechnic or on actual training

courses;  but in the meantime he makes his contribution

to society by taking part in construction work by which

we  hope  to  instil in them a sense of pride.  And  in

return  for  this,  he does not get  paid.  It  is  not

intended  that he should be paid a salary. He gets  his

keep,   food,  accommodation,  clothing  and  a   small

allowance of $1.50 per day to keep him going until  the

time  when the Brigade get him a permanent job outside.

And the Work Brigade has found jobs for about 1,000  of

its members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is quite wrong to say that the Brigade

members have a right to form a union or that, in  fact,

a trade union is an appropriate organisation to advance

their interests. They say, "Well, look, why not pay  us

the  same  pay as the Government daily-rated  workers?"

The  answer  is, "If we do so, then we  might  as  well

absorb  you into the Government daily-rated force,  but

there  are no vacancies at present." If they  want  the

same terms of pay as permanent workers, then I say that

the  logical consequence of that is that we shall close

down the Work Brigade, engage a few of them to fill the

vacant  posts in the Government service, and  tell  the

rest  of  them,  "Well, you do not want this  temporary

scheme  whereby you are given some useful  work  to  do

until  we  get a few permanent jobs for you."  This  is

known to the members of the Barisan Sosialis because we

worked  out the scheme with them when they were in  the

Government; but for reasons of their own they choose to

misrepresent  the position to the Work Brigade  members

and  stir  up trouble. This has been going on for  some

months now. As I have said, it is likely to come  to  a

head  in  the  near future when round  No.  4  will  be

enacted. Until then, Sir, let us wait and see.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister  has touched upon the intention of members  of

the  Work Brigade to form a union. As far as I know,  I

want  to  inform this House that members  of  the  Work

Brigade  have  worked for more than a year  without  an

increase in pay. Some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1785</b></font><br><br>



of them have been recommended by either Members of

the  Assembly or the Party branches. This is  very

unfair because we know that the pay of a member of

the  Work  Brigade  is only  $1.50  per  day.  The

members of the Work Brigade have been working  for

more  than  a  year and they still go  on  drawing

$1.50 per day. How can they live on $1.50 per day?

So  it  is proper for them to form a union.  Maybe

they  want  to form a union in order to fight  for

better working conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. Why does the Government

put  the  blame  on the Barisan Sosialis  for  all

sorts  of  things? For example,  if  one  day  our

Speaker  in  this  House should disappear,  should

Members of the Barisan Sosialis be blamed for that

by  the Government? This is illogical, do you  not

think  so?  Therefore, whenever there is  anything

good done, they -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Did I hear the hon. Member

say  that  one day the Speaker will disappear?  If

that is so, then I suppose I will have to build  a

cage   round   me  as  they  do  in   some   other

Parliaments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I sincerely hope

the  P.A.P. know that whenever they do  a  thing,

they must be fair. For example, when I was in  the

P.A.P.,  whenever  somebody  came  into  a   Party

branch,  I  would recommend him for a job  in  the

Work Brigade.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. This is going too much into

details.  Time is getting short. I ask Members  to

cut this debate short.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I beg leave to withdraw, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (7)* is not being moved.

Mr Tee Kim Leng, amendment (8).+



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* See footnote at col. 1778.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ That the sum to be allocated for Head 20 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (88) of subhead

1.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1786</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concerns Camp Supervisors. Sir, I have one

or  two  points  to  raise on this  question.  The

vacancies have not been advertised in the  papers.

We  have  approved the vote for these  posts,  but

they have not been advertised. I wonder where  the

holders of these posts have come from.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is this. Is it not the duty of a

Camp  Supervisor to go round the camp to supervise

members  of  the  Work Brigade  and  to  find  out

whether they remain in the camp? Is it his duty to

check  the travelling bags of members of the  Work

Brigade  to  see whether they contain  papers  and

newspapers?   Some  members  are   interested   in

politics and so they buy political magazines  such

as  The Political Science Society and The Torch of

the  Malayan  Socialist Party. Does it  mean  that

when  such  magazines  are  found,  they  will  be

confiscated?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point - whether the P.A.P. Weekly

has been confiscated?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, of the four posts of Camp

Supervisors,   two  are  held  by   two   officers

temporarily seconded from other Ministries. One is

filled by an officer in a temporary capacity  with

the approval of the P.S.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the duties of these supervisors, their

duties are listed as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspection of Work Brigade Camps to check on

daily attendance and other matters connected  with

attendance. Check the daily accounts of  the  camp

and  other matters connected with finance.  Assist

in    the    maintenance   of   camp   discipline,

particularly  the  observance of the  Disciplinary

Code. Jointly responsible with camp officials  for

the   inspection  of  camp  sites  and   buildings

thereon.  Jointly responsible with camp  officials

for  the  daily execution of work by all  workers.

Check  on  stores and equipment belonging  to  the

Government.  Interview  and  enrol  recruits   and

deploy  them to camps. Prepare fortnightly reports

of  camp  activities, works progress, organisation

and  finance, camp instructions and various  other

duties for submission to the Director. Disseminate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1787</b></font><br><br>



instructions  from  the Director  and  check  on  their

observance.  Responsibility to  the  Director  for  all

matters  in  the  camps under their supervision  except

technical and manpower distribution matters.



<br><br>4.42 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the other matters brought up by the Member

for  Pasir Panjang, you will realise that in the duties

that  I  have just listed, the Camp Supervisors have  a

lot of authority over the Work Brigade Camps as regards

members. What the Member for Pasir Panjang has  brought

up, I think, occurred very recently due to the troubles

that  we  are  having in the camps. For the  past  l�

years,  the Work Brigade was able to function according

to  the Disciplinary Code, but the troubles are due  to

the agitation from the Barisan Sosialis - I particularly

refer to the Member for Toa Payoh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice also in this amendment paper that the

Member from the Barisan Sosialis Front has not made any

amendment whatsoever in respect of the Work Brigade. He

was  closely connected with the Work Brigade,  because,

when I tock it over from the Labour Ministry, he was at

that  time one of the Supremos. Later on, the  Supremos

were  abolished  and I appointed  him  as  one  of  the

liaison  officers  between the  Work  Brigade  and  the

Ministry. He was responsible for a lot of things  which

are happening now in the Work Brigade.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Pasir Panjang has just now mentioned

that the P.A.P. always says that if it has any trouble,

it   is  created  by  the  Barisan  Sosialis. In  this

connection, Sir, I have reliable information  that  the

Member  for Toa Payoh has been meeting leaders  of  the

Work  Brigade who are agitating to form a union now.  I

would like the Member for Toa Payoh to deny this. If he

dares to deny this, then it can be said that the P.A.P.

is  always blaming the Barisan Sosialis for the trouble

-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1788</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!--Mr John Mammen(Deputy Speaker)-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr John Mammen): </b>Order. I think the

Minister must bear in mind that the question concerns

camps. So it will be better for him to confine himself

to that question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> As I have said, Sir, because of the

trouble  in the camps, we have to make use of the  camp

supervisors to check on the activities of people in the

camps.  The  Camp  Commandants in  several  camps  have

already  thrown overboard the Disciplinary  Code  which

they were supposed to use on their subordinates as well

as  members in the camps. In view of the fact that  the

Director  of the Work Brigade could not get his  orders

down  through the Camp Commandants, he had to  use  the

camp  supervisors to do the duties which were  supposed

to be done by the Camp Commandants.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong (Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, just now the Minister for National

Development  has  accused me  of  being  involved  with

members  who want to form a union. I must clarify  this

point. He says that I have met leaders of those members

who  want to form a union. I can tell him this. When  I

was  in  the  P.A.P., I was responsible  for  the  Work

Brigade.  There  are several thousands of  members  all

over Singapore who know me. I have had occasion to meet

such  members whom I knew formerly. I can tell him that

two weeks ago -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We are on the question of camp

supervisors. If the hon. Member is going to indulge  in

a  debate  on  the  formation of a union  in  the  Work

Brigade,  that  will  throw  open  the  topic  to   the

Government to attack. So I think the hon. Member should

confine himself to camp supervisors.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> On a point of order, Sir, with

respect  to your ruling. You have allowed the  Minister

for  National  Development to level  a  charge  at  the

Member concerned asking him to deny whether he was ever

involved in such meetings. And the hon. Member was just

denying or confirming it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1789</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. As far as the Member is

concerned,  he has already explained his position,  and

that  is  the  end of it. But if he is again  going  to

indulge in speaking on the formation of a union in the

Work   Brigade,   then  I  think  that  is   completely

irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, I was just trying to meet this accusation made  by

the  Minister. I was saying that two weeks  ago,  on  a

Sunday,  six  branches of the Barisan  Sosialis  had  a

picnic  in  Pasir Ris. At that time I had  occasion  to

meet  members  of the Work Brigade. So  how  could  he,

without any foundation, accuse me of their meeting me?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to ask the Minister is

this:  is any of these four camp supervisors a  Central

Committee member of the P.A.P.?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, when the Member for Toa Payoh

was  in  the Work Brigade, he was a P.A.P. Assemblyman.

He was also in the category of officers. What I mean is

that he is in some way holding a position equivalent to

a camp supervisor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said just now, Sir, two of these officers

were  seconded  from  other  Ministries-one  from  Home

Affairs and the other from Education.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> The answer is "Yes" or "No".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> And the other member is Inche Roslan

bin Hassan who was at one time in the Central Executive

Committee of the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, the Minister did not answer the other question.  I

ask  him  whether  any of these camp supervisors  is  a

disciplinary officer in then P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, I am not aware whether he is a

disciplinary officer in the P.A.P. I only know that  he

is in the P.A.P. And they were working together before.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1790</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, would the

Minister for National Development then find out whether

this person is in the Disciplinary Section of the

P.A.P. and let us know?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now the

Minister has said that members of the Work Brigade want

to  form  a union. As far as I know, some Party members

in  the  Work Brigade are responsible officers  in  the

Work  Brigade and whenever there is a new member,  this

new  member  will  be  given an  application  form  for

membership in the P.A.P. Some wonder whether this is  a

Party branch.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not understand. Here we are

talking  about camp supervisors, not P.A.P. membership.

So  will  the  Member please confine  himself  to  camp

supervisors?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, what are the

hours of duty of these camp supervisors?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> As the Member for Pasir Panjang has

said, I do not exactly know what are the hours of work.

But  the  Member for Pasir Panjang has said that  these

Camp  supervisors  were working in the  middle  of  the

night.  I  can imagine they must be working  very  long

hours.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member for Pasir Panjang wish

for a vote or does he wish to withdraw his amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng:</b> I want a vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr A. P.

Rajah -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 20 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 1.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am not moving.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 20 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 41.*



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The same amendment stood in the names of Mr Leong

Keng Seng, Mr Tee Kim Leng and Mr Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1791</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we come to the Work Brigade proper. So much

has  already been said on the Work Brigade that we need

not  say  very much more on this. In the 1962 provision

there  is  an increase of nearly $3 million. Last  year

the  vote  was  for $3 million, and this year  what  is

asked for is $5,890,000, i.e. nearly double. Last  year

it  was  explained  that  the money  was  required  for

capital  expenditure, like construction and maintenance

of  camps,  provision of beds, food,  and  purchase  of

tools. Now with this doubling of the vote for 1962,  is

it  envisaged  by the Government that they  propose  to

increase the Work Brigade contingent? Or is it for some

other  scheme? During last year's Budget sitting,  Sir,

we  pointed out that what was being paid to the members

of  the Work Brigade at $2 a day was inadequate and was

not  fair. No doubt the Government explained that  they

were given places to sleep in, they had other amenities

which  they  could enjoy. In fact, they had been  given

every opportunity to have their brains washed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this was not pointed cut last year because there

was no by-election. The only thing pointed out was that

members  of  the  Work Brigade were at the  Airport  to

greet  the Minister for Labour and Law when he returned

from  Tokyo.  That was last year. But this year,  there

were two by-elections. I say in this Assembly that  the

P.A.P.  Government has made use of workers in the  Work

Brigade  to attend election rallies by force.  This  is

most improper.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, I want to ask how many members and camps there are

in the Work Brigade now how much pay is paid to members

of  the  Work Brigade, including its leaders  and  camp

leaders.  I  also  want  to ask a  question  about  the

working hours of such members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, some $5 million is allocated for the Work Brigade.

But  last  year  it was very much less,  only  some  $3

million.  All  of  a  sudden, there is  a  considerable

increase.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1792</b></font><br><br>



At  present  there are only eight camps, in  the  Work

Brigade,  as far as I know.. Now, if the vote  for  the

Work  Brigade is doubled, will the number of  camps  be

doubled  as  well?  That is one point  which  I  cannot

understand.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.

<br><br>5.31 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in

the  total expenditure for the Work Brigade in the 1961

Estimates,  we can see clearly the itemisation  of  the

expenditure. But in this year's Estimates, there are no

specific  items of expenditure. Does it mean  that  the

Minister is too busy to do that?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the hon. Member for Pasir Panjang

indicate where he has seen those itemised projects  for

1961? Perhaps he will indicate the page.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, can

the Minister itemise the expenditure for 1962?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Pasir Panjang now agrees

that the 1961 expenditure was not itemised.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1793</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Work Brigade

has been in existence for nearly two years. I think we

are in a position to assess its value to the community.

Mr Speaker, Sir, unlike the special squad which was a

revolutionary working force, it seems to me that in the

past two years, the Work Brigade, despite the millions

of dollars being thrown into it, has actually

contributed nothing to the capital improvement of the

community. I say that the only useful purpose it has

served was during the Hong Lim by-election, where it

attended the mass meetings. This, as the Member for

Nee Soon has said, was not very useful either.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we will spend $6.1 million

approximately on this item in 1961. I do not  know  how

much  we  are  going to get out from it. If  this  $6.1

million  is  being  used to build  roads,  stand-pipes,

community projects, I think we will be able to see more

constructive  achievements.  During  the  time  of  the

special  squad,  only a few hundreds  of  thousands  of

dollars  was spent. Yet we have had projects  like  the

Kallang Park, the promenade, and many parks were built.

Here we have millions to be spent - I have estimated that

it would be twenty times the amount - and yet nothing has

come out of it. It is time now, Sir, for the Government

to consider the usefulness of the Work Brigade.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, there are at present nine Work

Brigade  camps, consisting of about 2,000 Work  Brigade

members.  The hon. Member opposite asked about  details

of  hours  of work, the camps and the expenses incurred

for the year. These are little details which I have not

got.  But if the Member is interested, I will send  him

those details.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the provision of $5,890,170 for next year,

the  breakdown  of this figure is as follows.  Actually

the  provision will cover expenses for 15 camps  and  a

force of 3,000 camp members.

Sir, as the Finance Minister has mentioned just now, the Work Brigade is

formed  for  the  purpose  of keeping in useful and  gainful  occupation

youths between the ages of 16 and 30 who would otherwise be joining  the

ranks of the unemployed. The Member for Hong Lim has mentioned just  now

that when he had the special squad, he was doing a lot of projects.  But

I would like to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1795</b></font><br><br>

inform  him  that  these  unemployed youths, in  addition  to  being  kept

occupied in the camps, are doing very useful work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major projects tackled by the Work Brigade are as follows. In

Queenstown, they are working on the outer ring road, Jalan Bukit Merah, and

also  working  on  the Jurong link road. The earthworks,  foundation  work,

laying of run curbs, pipes, construction of roadside drains, footpaths  are

all  done  by  the  Work Brigade. In addition, they are  doing  earthworks,

clearing  of undergrowth, cutting of slopes and levelling of banks  of  the

Sungei Api Api. When we had the drought and there was an acute shortage  of

sand,  the Kaki Bukit camp of the Work Brigade was operating a sand  quarry

and supplying sand. In the resettlement areas, the Work Brigade are engaged

in  construction of new agricultural roads, timber bridges, roadside drains

and  the  laying of pipe culverts. In the rural areas, they are  doing  the

maintenance and the reconstruction of rural drains, de-silting and widening

of  drains, as well as the laying of culverts. In addition, there is  other

work like camp construction, repair of public stand-pipe platforms and  the

slabbing  of  drains. This, Sir, has provided a lot of  amenities  for  the

rural areas which are benefiting the rural folks.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I wonder whether anybody did ask the question: How old are these 3,000

odd members? As far as my recollection goes, they are all under 21. If I remember rightly,

the Work Bridage is especially intended for youths - so I understood from the hon. the Finance Minister.

So I take it that most of them are under 21. Mr Speaker, Sir, I have always felt that, from the

Government point of view, it is a desirable social project. But when one considers this desirable

social project, one must weigh it against the background of the ultimate benefits which society derives

from these social experiments. On the whole, Mr Speaker, Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1796</b></font><br><br>

I am inclined to view that, on balance, the State loses out on this. The position is that the Government takes in these boys either from school or two or three years after school, 18, 19, 20, 21. By taking them in and putting them to the type of work that they are being put, somebody else is being deprived of a job. That is most definite and certain. These people have normally been in charge of a family. They have been dependent on such type of work in order to maintain themselves and their own families. The direct effect of this social experiment is that you might keep some boys off the streets, but you are depriving one person who maintains two or three members of the family, and those persons are the direct sufferers as a result of this social scheme. If the social scheme is a success, at least one might say there are compensating benefits and therefore, perhaps, it is all right. But as against that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is fairly clear from the break-up given by the Hon. the Minister for National Development that the maintenance charges connected with this Brigade far outweigh the direct work they put into all these projects. For instance, on the personal emoluments for the Singapore Work Brigade on page 143. Now, that, I take it, is the civil service organisation which is paid (and that comes to over $200,000 a year) to keep this Brigade ie function. Now, that is waste of money. These people, originally, were civil servants doing some other form of social good. I believe they were civil defence and civil fire brigade officers, or some thing like that. These officers who were responsible for civil defence and the civil fire brigade have been put into this. I notice from the break-up figures given by the Minister for National Development that the figure of $2 million for wages and the rest of it seems to be concerned mostly with utensils or articles used in these projects which in 2, 3 or 4 years' time will be written off completely, and it will be a waste of money. All these things could be better done if the Government went to tender and the people who have been normally doing these works could then do it. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in order to give employment to 3,000, it seems to me we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1797</b></font><br><br>

are  depriving another 3,000 of this employment, and those 3,000  not  only

keep themselves, but keep two or three others in addition to themselves. So

I ask the Minister: is it really a worthwhile social experiment which, even

if it does help these 3,000, only adds confusion and misery to 3,000 others

and the 9,000 who are dependent on these 3,000? I think, on balance, it  is

not.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what the Member for Farrer Park says



would have substance if, in fact, creating the Work Brigade meant that it is worth an equivalent number of people who would be put out of job. Sir, I do not think his contention could be sustained by facts. Whether or not there is unemployment created by the Work Brigade could be judged by the level of activity in the construction industry - building of houses, levelling of land, building of roads and so on and so forth. We all know today, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the construction industry is going at full blast. In fact, the Government is always keeping an eye on building and construction costs to see that we do not over-stretch the industry with the result that we just pay higher prices for the same volume of work.



Therefore, I do not think it can be said that the existence of the Work Brigade has brought about unemployment among other people. I may add this:



the sort of work given to the Work Brigade to perform would normally be the less urgent categories of public works which the Government could wait to be performed if funds were not available, or the designing and planning capacity of the Public Works Department were otherwise engaged, or if the construction industry itself could not cope with the work. We do not give to the Work Brigade the very urgent or top priority jobs. The P.W.D. have a number of long-term projects in hand for long-term improvements of roads, drainage, irrigation and such like. These are the projects which we give to the Brigade to perform. So, to sum up, they do not take away jobs from other people. There is a long-term addition to the amenities and services that Singapore has.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1798</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the claim by the Member for Hong Lim that his special squad

performed prodigious work-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b> rose-

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Yes. Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems that the Minister for National Development has already

replied to the Member for Hong Lim. Is it necessary for the Minister for Finance to reply to him?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Why not?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Minister for Finance was replying to the Member



for Farrer Park on the type of projects that members of the Work Brigade are undertaking. That is perfectly in order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I think the Member for Havelock is right. I was



making a new point in replying to the Member for Hong Lim. This is a point which, I think, my colleague -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am sorry then. I did not quite hear that. If, in

fact, that point has been touched upon, I do not think the Minister should repeat it.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,



earlier in the afternoon, I think the Minister for Finance did mention rounds 1, 2, 3 and 4 between the P.A.P. and the Barisan Sosialis. But while he is keeping his eye on round 4, I think he should also look deeper into the matter concerning the Work Brigade, because I understand the situation in some of the camps is really tense and those who are supporting this idea of a union in the Work Brigade are Chinese and those who are against it are Malays. Trouble may brew in time. If the Government is going to take action, it had better take action quickly and swiftly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I can assure the Member for Geylang Serai that we are keeping a very close

watch on the situation. Mind you, Sir, we have said this is round 4, but I have met the Member for

Thomson and he says,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1799</b></font><br><br>



"This is not round 1, 2, 3 or 4. This is just sparring." Mr Speaker, Sir, he assures me that when round 1 comes, there will be a knock-out blow in the first second. That is, he adds with due prudence, "unless we have prepared a zugzwang for you." I have duly assured him that the zugzwang has been prepared.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time has expired. Does the Member for Cairnhill wish to take a vote?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Yes, of course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 22 be reduced by $10 in respect of

item (21) of subhead 1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, with regard to the posts of Building Inspectors, Rural Division, I wish to get an answer from the Minister concerned as regards

the houses or temporary buildings which were inspected about two years ago,

and  what has happened to the application forms for those houses which have

no  numbers. Of the applications which I myself have had occasion to  bring

up  to the Ministry, more than half have been approved, but why is it  that

the  rest  have not? Why is it that some houses have numbers and the  other

adjoining houses in the same locality do not have numbers yet? I would like

clarification and an explanation from the Minister concerned.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, the normal procedure is that the application for

house numbers goes to the Assessment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1800</b></font><br><br>

Department  in  the Prime Minister's Ministry, but since the  Member  for

Kampong Kembangan has inquired about this, I will say that I am not aware

of  what  the position is like as far as his case is concerned.  But  the

normal  procedure  is that applications for house numbers  for  temporary

buildings go to the Assessment Department, the Assessment Department will

refer to the Chief Building Surveyor's Department of my Ministry, and the

Chief Building Surveyor's Department, will send inspectors out to have  a

look  at  these houses and see whether they comply with the building  by-laws.

<br><br>6.00 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they comply with the building bylaws, then the Chief Building

Surveyor  will  recommend  to  the Assessment  Department  to  issue  the

licence.  I  do not know whether these houses have the recommendation  of

the  Chief  Building Surveyor, and I am not in a position to  answer  the

hon. Member. But if he could give me details of these cases, I can assure

him  I  will look into them and see whether they comply with the building

by-laws. If they do, they, will be recommended.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder whether the Minister is

aware  that  during  the time when the City Council was  under  a  P.A.P.

Mayor,  rumours  went  round all over Singapore that  the  P.A.P. was  a

Government  for the poor and that therefore they could build  houses  and

they would get numbers. Many poor people under that delusion built a  lot

of  houses  and those that were lucky enough - I would not like to  suggest

how they got them, but they somehow managed to pull strings with the City

Council - did  get  the  numbers at that time. As the  Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan  has  said, there are some houses which have  numbers  but  the

others by their side do not have any numbers. This has gone on ever since

that  time, and until today the people living in such houses are dreading

that one of these days - especially in view of what has happened in Malcolm

Road - they will suffer the same fate. They were not the type of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1801</b></font><br><br>

people  whom  the Prime Minister referred to as "trying to beat  the  gun".

They  were disillusioned at the time when the P.A.P. really had the reputation of working for the poor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, would the Minister tell us what would happen to such people,

especially  if  they happen to have a mandatory order due to  no  fault  of

their own? Could the Minister do something about it?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Sir, on a point of clarification. Just now I

have heard the Member for Mountbatten mention unauthorised structures, that

some  can  get  numbers  and  others cannot.  Was  it  perhaps  in  Kampong

Kembangan? To refresh the memory of the Member for Mountbatten, I think  in

those  days  Kampong Kembangan came under the control of  the  Rural  Board

which  was  under the direct supervision of her colleague, the  Member  for

Cairnhill.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> On a point of information, Sir. I am talking about

Kampong Amber and not Kampong Kembangan.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, there is a difference between houses built without

the  permission of the landlord and without proper plans, and  those  built

with the permission of the landlord. I think the Member for Mountbatten  is

confusing the issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards those cases in Kampong Amber - which are her problem - I have

looked  into  them  and found that these people were building  unauthorised

houses.  That is quite a different kettle of fish. If a man is prepared  to

risk  and  build  an  unauthorised house  without  the  permission  of  the

landlord, the Land Office, and the City Council, then he is, faced with two

courses  of  action. One is, that immediately it is discovered,  the  house

will  be  demolished. On the other hand, if he escapes the  notice  of  the

Chief  Building  Surveyor, then when the time comes and it  is  discovered,

there  is a possibility that because of long occupation-the house will  not

be  pulled  down, but the process of law takes over, and that is a  summons

will be served on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1802</b></font><br><br>

the occupier to demolish the house. If he fails to demolish it, the Chief

Building Surveyor may, for humanitarian reasons, just summon him to court

and fine him. In such a case, the court will issue a mandatory order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think we are going on a different topic. We are

on  Building Inspectors. I should imagine that that debate could properly

have  taken  place under subhead 3, but no amendment has  been  moved  in

relation to subhead 3.

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has

clarified  the  position.  After this debate is  over,  I  will  bring  a

delegation  of  the  applicants to the Minister so  as  to  increase  the

finances of Singapore. I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 22 be reduced by $10 in respect of

subhead 1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will not be very long as there are only four

minutes more. The problem is of some importance. I will make the point as

shortly and quickly as I can.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a matter which comes under the control of the people under

this head. Sir, quite recently - over the last year or 18 months - there  has

been  a spate of building (if I may put it this way) in the backlanes  of

the  city, on the side-tables of roads, and sometimes on pavements.  They

start  off in a small way and end up with domestic living premises.  This

is  a fact, Sir. Anybody who goes round town can see it. The only persons

who do not see it are the people working in this department. It is public

knowledge  now. Mr Speaker, Sir, if it were a purely hawking  concern  -

little  hawkers - one does not mind it so much. But this has become  a  big

establishment.  Now what is worse is that the establishment  is  changing

hands  at  big  sums of money. The man has a goodwill in respect  of  the

premises. He sells it to somebody. He goes and establishes somewhere else

and then establishes a goodwill in respect of that;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1803</b></font><br><br>

and  goes  again somewhere else. This has become a good thriving  business.

Sir, one can carry this a little too far, and I ask the Minister not to let

Singapore  go to ruin. Let us not build up problems today and  continue  to

let  them  grow,  which some other government has to tackle,  because  some

government must eventually tackle it. So I beg of the Government to step in

and  solve  this  problem and not let it get out of hand so  that  it  will

eventually  become  a  social problem which some  agitators  use  to  upset

governments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing, Sir, which I want to bring quickly to the Minister is

this. We have discussed buildings on Crown lands. I would like to bring  to

the notice of the Minister buildings on private lands by similar persons on

a

big  scale - business enterprises that go in, develop quickly and sell.  They

go  in  and  then the owner and the Building Department are  unable  to  do

anything  on  human  grounds. So the Minister should try  and  devise  some

scheme  which  will  prevent  these building  operators  from  fooling  the

innocent public who go and buy them and so create a social problem.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, this problem of unauthorised building has become,

as  the  Member for Farrer Park has said, mare and more serious. But  until

such  time as the Local Government Integration Bill comes into force, there

are  certain fields over which the Chief Building Surveyor's Department has

no jurisdiction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member for Farrer Park that we have looked into this

question  very  carefully. In cases where we have to move  in  to  demolish

summarily,  we have been accused of being hard-hearted. But,  Sir,  without

the  proper  legislation, it is difficult for the Government to  carry  out

what it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1804</b></font><br><br>

wants  to  do;  that  is,  the control of unauthorised  buildings.  This

problem  is rather a big one, because at the moment there are  thousands

of unauthorised houses under mandatory orders, and until such time as we

set  up  a Review Committee and also introduce new legislation,  we  are

rather helpless.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time has expired. Is the Member for Farrer Part

claiming a division?

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> No. I withdraw the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may, at the same time, deal with another amend

ment  notice  of which I have given, that is, in respect of  item  (2)+,

because the principles involved are the same is both?

<hr size="2" noshade>

+The  amendment, also standing in the name of Mr Leong Keng Seng, reads

as follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 23 be reduced by $10 in respect

of item (2) of subhead 1.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, if it is convenient.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while discussing this, I would like to

draw  the attention of the House to page 163 of the Estimates in respect

of items (103) and (104) .

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House will notice a full vote in respect of the City Engineer and

the Deputy City Engineer, but in respect of item (1) , which is now being

discussed,  and item (2) of subhead 1, there is a token vote.  I  raised

this question previously in the last Estimates and the answer given  was

that  the  present Director of Public Works was being paid out  of  this

vote on page 163. The

question  I  then asked was whether it was intended that  one  of  these

posts was to be abolished. I understand that the incumbent of this  post

is being paid out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1805</b></font><br><br>

of  the vote on page 163 - he calls himself the Director of Public Works  and

not  the  City Engineer. I think the two departments, insofar as  the  City

Engineer's Department in the City Council and the Director of Public  Works

are  concerned, have been sufficiently integrated in fact.  For  the  vote,

either  one  or the other should disappear. But this is merely a formality.

But  what is more important is this. The holder of the post of Director  of

Public  Works is not a permanent official, because the person  who  is  now

holding  the  post  of  Director of Public Works originally  was  the  City

Engineer, under the previous administration of the Mayor of Singapore,  who

was  holding it on a temporary contract. So that legacy has been taken over

by  the Government. The Director of Public Works is also being held against

the  post  on contract. Now directly under this officer, who is a  contract

officer,  there  are  a number of officers, architects and  engineers.  The

position  is  not  satisfactory from a staffing point of view  or  from  an

establishment point of view. I know there is frustration there. I  mean  no

disrespect  to  the holder of the post. There is absolutely  no  reason  to

doubt  that  he is an efficient man - I am not criticising that at  all.  But

they  feel  that  the situation of keeping such a person  as  head  of  the

department  for the last two or three years with permanent officials  under

him  is  a  frustrating  business. It is felt  that  this  officer  is  not

sufficiently interested in the department's staffing, because he is only  a

temporary officer himself.

<br><br>6.15 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not a permanent officer. He has no obligations to the department.

He  does  not  feel  that the department is his. And therefore  I  ask  the

Government  to  make up their minds - they must make this  post  a  permanent

post. Unless they make it a permanent post and give this officer a sense of

responsibility  for the department, there is going to be this  frustration.

The  Public Works Department is a very important department because  it  is

the spending arm of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1806</b></font><br><br>

Government. If the spending arm of the Government is not fully geared  to

all  the  projects, all the Government's intentions as  set  out  in  the

Budget must necessarily fail. It is important that all the architects and

engineers who are working under this officer should work happily. If they

do  not  work  happily, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is reflected in their  work.

That  is only human. I do ask the Minister to look into this and come  to

some  definite arrangement: either make this officer permanent, or if  he

cannot be made permanent, then some other permanent arrangement should be

made.  It  is  vital to the efficiency of the department, I  think,  that

immediate consideration should be given.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to ask

this:  when will this post of Director of Public Works be filled? Why  is

it  that after two years there is still no man capable of filling it?  Is

it because there is no local talent available?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I quite agree that the debate should range over the second

amendment*. Does the Member for Serangoon Gardens wish  to  add  to  his

remarks in regard to the second amendment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* See footnote at col. 1804.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I put the same question to the

second amendment.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I take it the Member is not adding anything to his

remarks. Mr Tan.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> I do not know what the Member for Serangoon Gardens is

driving at. Perhaps he is not aware that the Director of Public Works  as

well  as the Deputy Director are local men. If he says there is no  local

talent, then what does he mean?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the Member for Farrer Park, this is the first

time I hear there is frustration amongst the architects and engineers who

work under the Director and the Deputy Director of Public Works. I really

do  not believe the question of permanency or contract is going to affect

them.  But,  Sir,  the  Director as well as the Deputy  Director  are  on

contract. As I said last year, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1807</b></font><br><br>

votes  for  the posts of Director and Deputy Director of Public  Works  are

paid  out  from the City Engineer's vote. When local government integration

comes  into  being,  one  of the posts will be abolished.  As  regards  the

Director's  position  with  the Government, he is  still  on  a  three-year

contract starting from early this year, and he still has two more years  to

go before permanency could be considered.

<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Is it not correct to say that the City Engineer or the

present  Director of Public Works also served the Government  in  the  same

capacity, that is to say, the contract mentioned by the Minister  just  now

is a second contract?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> He served under the City Council from October 1958 on a

two-year contract, and he has just got a new contract for three years.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, the Minister says he does not believe there could be

frustration.  That  is a happy frame of mind for the  Minister  to  be  in,

because  he  must firmly believe in the officers under him. I  congratulate

him  on  that  frame of mind. Sometimes, Sir, things get to other  people's

ears which do not get to the ears of the person most responsible for it.  I

personally  know one or two cases which are frustrated. Sir, this  business

of  working  under  a chief is a question of faith and loyalty.  It  is  as

simple  as  that  and as difficult as that. If one owes  loyalty  to  one's

chief,  one works oneself to death practically to get the job done. But  if

one  has no loyalty, one has no faith, one has no friendship towards  one's

chief, one just works to rule, and we know what work to rule means. Nothing

much  gets done. That is the position so far as some people in the  Public

Works  Department are concerned. I only mention this. But if  the  Minister

thinks he does not want to investigate this further, well and good.  But  I

do  assure him that unless this loyalty moves from the staff to the head of

the  department, none of his works will be carried out in the way he  hoped

and as he intended. That is the point I wish to make.

<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I disagree entirely with the submission of the Member for Farrer Park.

The  House  must  remember that senior appointments in  the  P.W.D. are

filled by professional and technical men. The men employed in the P.W.D.

are  either  civil engineers, quantity surveyors, architects, mechanical

engineers  or  electrical engineers. These men respect  the  seniors  in

their  profession.  They place great reliance on the  ability  of  their

seniors,  whether  those  seniors  are contract  officers  or  permanent

officers.  So  long as their seniors are qualified and  of  considerable

experience, they will accept instructions from them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I moved into the Ministry of Health, I found that there was a com

paratively  junior administrative officer acting as Permanent Secretary.

There  was  also  a  very  senior City Council medical  officer  in  the

Ministry, and he was taking instructions from this comparatively  junior

administrative  officer.  And  under him there  were  professional  men,

doctors  on the permanent establishment. That state of affairs  did  not

lead  to efficiency. The first thing I did was to get this comparatively

junior administrative officer moved out of the Ministry immediately, and

I  had  this City Council senior medical officer acting in the  post  of

Director  of  Medical Services, with a chain of command from  him  right

through the Ministry. The Ministry is working very efficiently now.  The

acting  Director of Medical Services was a City Council officer. He  was

quite senior in the City Council service. In the process of integration,

it  might not be possible for him to be appointed substantively  to  the

post  of  Director  of  Medical  Services.  Even  if  he  was  appointed

substantively, he would be absorbed on his existing City  Council  term

on  a  different salary scale. But what the Member for Farrer  Park  has

stated  is not how professional men behave. They are not concerned  with

the  fact that their superiors are contract officers or not, so long  as

their superiors are qualified and competent men. Once



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1809</b></font><br><br>

that is established, I think they are quite happy to serve under competent

contract officers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I do not want to drag this on, for we might keep this

going for well over an hour. I entirely agree with the Minister. I am also

a professional man and I know what professional reactions are. We all know,

but this is the point I want to make to the Minister: that the staff should

be  satisfied  in their own minds that they have a head of  department  who

will  fight for them and look after their interests. And that frame of mind

is  more  easily  induced if the head of that department  is  a  permanent

official.  That  is  the point I am trying to make,  not  the  point  about

professional  jealousy. Let me put this way. If he is  a  contract  officer

with  one  year  more to go on his contract, he is not  going  to  get  too

difficult  with the Government. He is only human if he wants his  contract

renewed.  He is looking over his shoulder all the time. To the extent  that

he  is  looking  over  his shoulder, he is not fighting  the  case  of  his

professional  officers. If once that feeling is created  in  a  department,

then  efficiency  is  gone.  That is all I  say.  I  am  as  interested  in

maintaining  efficiency  of  the Public Works Department  as  the  Minister

himself.  We  are  all involved in this. Therefore, I ask the  Minister  to

consider  seriously  making this post permanent. I am not  saying  anything

else.  I  am not saying this contract officer is inefficient. I  say:  make

this  a  permanent post. Let him not all the time think, "Is  my  contract

going  to be renewed next year or not?" He will then know what the position

in the Government is, that after permanent appointment he will be protected

by the Public Service Commission. But a contract officer is not.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> I do not agree with the Member for Farrer Park on this

point, i.e. whether an officer is permanent or not does not ensure that  he

will  fight  for his staff. It is the worth of the man that counts.  I  can

assure the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1810</b></font><br><br>

Member  for Farrer Park that the Director of Public Works is not  currying

favour  with the Government whatsoever. In fact, we had to hold  him  back

and  offer him a contract with a little bit more to keep him there. To say

that an officer of the calibre of the Director of Public Works would go to

the  extent  of doing things just to please the Government and  would  not

fight for his subordinates is really unfair.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Just one further point on what the Member for Farrer Park has

said, Mr Speaker, Sir. There has been a very great burden of work thrown

on  to  the Director of Public Works. The reason for that was the  action

taken  by  the  Member  for Hong Lim when he was  Minister  for  National

Development. For no reason at all, he abolished the post -

overseas, officers

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, I think the Member for Serangoon Gardens is merely

being  frivolous  about this matter. Cluny Lodge is one of  the  Government

holiday  bungalows.  It  is leased from the Singapore  Harbour  Board.  The

Government  did  not build it. This bungalow, like all  the  other  holiday

bungalows, is used by senior Government servants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Construction of Crematoria . . . $29,500". Mr Speaker, Sir, might I ask

the  Minister whether this is in respect of the crematoria at Upper Aljunied

Road?  If  it is so, I know they have been partially constructed  but  they

have  not  been completed. Could I ask the Minister whether the  crematoria

are now actually in use? If they are not in use, why are they not in use?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, the crematoria are not in use. In fact, they are

still  waiting for spares for the furnaces. The horticultural treatment  is

not completed and certain architectural features are not completed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1812</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, if I may draw you into this debate. You remember

the  City Council debate on, this a long, long time ago. We had a lot  of

trouble over it and eventually we got the Council to approve it.  We  got

the  Government  to come in on it on a sharing basis. Eventually  it  was

built.. That was about-three or four years ago, if I remember correctly.

At  least from the outside, it looked as if everything was all right, and

the  corpses  were being dealt with. But to and behold, it seems  not  to

have  been done. If the Minister says that the hold-up is due to shortage

of  some  of the paraphernalia for the crematoria, can I ask him why  all

this has been held up? There must have been a vote for all this when  the

building  was completed. Someone must have fallen down on the  job.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I am most certain that somebody must have fallen  down  on

the job. If so, the Minister should take action against those people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can assure the Member for Farrer

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 23 be reduced by $100.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have with me here a copy of Cmd. Paper 22 of 1961 - the Interim

Report of the Commission of Inquiry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1813</b></font><br><br>

into  the  Constructional Capacity of Singapore. Under  the  Public  Works

Department, Sir, the Report states that there is an extreme shortage among

the senior members of the staff of the Public Works Department, especially

in  experienced engineers and architects. There is also an acute  shortage

among  the  junior architects and a shortage of electrical and  mechanical

engineers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Committee has made two recommendations. I wonder whether the

Minister  for  National Development can say whether these  recommendations

are  being implemented. One of the recommendations is that these technical

experts  should not be made to do administrative chores. They  have  recom

mended,  therefore, that the post of Administrative Officer in the  Public

Works Department, which was abolished in January 1958, be restored.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also recommended that, since the present terms and conditions of

service  are  not  sufficiently  favourable  to  attract  experienced  men,

something  should be done about senior posts. They also stated,  Sir,  that

the Housing Board offers better terms than the Public Works Department.  In

view  of  the fact that the Public Works Department is the technical  agent

for various Ministries, it is very important, therefore, that steps must be

taken to strengthen this Department, otherwise the money, that we vote  for

development may not be spent.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, when I answered the previous question, I had

already touched on the question of shortage of technical staff, both senior

and junior, in the Public Works Depart

ment.  As regards the Interim Report of the Commission of Inquiry into  the

Constructional  Capacity of Singapore, its recommendation  to  restore  the

post of Administrative Officer has been implemented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that the remuneration offered in the Public Works Department

does  not  attract  young people who have come out from  universities  with

their degrees. To this end we have already made adjustments to the point of

entry of such salary scales. I am told by the Director of Public Works that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1814</b></font><br><br>

this move of ours has attracted quite a lot of applicants for jobs in the

Public Works Department. But these are people who have just come out from

universities and it would be two or three years before they would  be  of

much  use  in carrying out Government development projects. I can  assure

the  Member  for  Tanglin  that  we are paying  great  attention  to  the

recruitment  of  staff  in  the  Public  Works  Department  so  that  the

development  projects  that  we  have  in  the  Four-Year  Plan  will  be

fulfilled.

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is only an Interim Report. I

wonder  if  the  Minister  could say .whether  this  Commission  is  still

functioning, because several of its members are from the Barisan  Sosialis

group.  It may well be that if I do not remind the Minister that the  work

is important, then maybe the Commission might be abolished. I suggest that

the  Commission  be  allowed  to continue.  If  the  Government  wants  to

substitute  some other people for their ex-colleagues, still  they  should

not  abolish the Commission. But we should wait until the Final Report  is

published.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister may wish to give an answer later.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, I am not the one to appoint this Commission. I am

not aware whether it is going on. But if the Member for Tanglin will refer

to the Ministry of Finance, he will get the answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Tanglin has made the point,

at  least it seems to give me that impression, that the Housing Board  and

the  P.W.D. are in competition for a small number of a particular type  of

professional officers, and that the Housing Board is winning all the time.

If  it  is correct, Mr, Speaker, Sir, it is a very serious matter, I think

the  Ministry  should try and hold a balance between the  P.W.D. and  the

Housing  Board. It could well be that that is one of the reasons  why  the

Housing Board is doing so well and the P.W.D. is doing very little.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1815</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, competition is not just between the

P.W.D. and the Housing Board but also by other countries. That  is  where

the difficulty comes from.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You do not pay them enough.

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.

ance  of Government Quarters, Barracks and Grounds. Item (1) is in respect

of wages and salaries, which shows that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1816</b></font><br><br>

there  is  a  100 per cent increase on the previous year's estimates.  In

regard  to item (3), i.e., Public Utility Services, it is also more  than

doubled.  Can I ask the Minister whether this is due to a large  increase

in  the  number  of  Government Quarters,  Barracks  and  Grounds  to  be

maintained, or is it due to an increase in costs?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, there is no increase of quarters or staff under

this  provision. The current provisions for maintenance of  City  Council

and Government quarters were given under separate subheads of Head 24  of

the   1961  Estimates.  In  respect  of  Government  quarters,  they  are

chargeable to Head 24, subhead 2, whereas for City Council quarters  they

are chargeable under subheads 15, 23, 29, 33, 35, 39 and 42 of Head 24 of

provision  have been amalgamated into a bloc subhead for the  maintenance

of both City Council and Government quarters.

subhead 15.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it concerns, I am told, the maintenance of public street lighting. I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to one point, i.e.,

that  I  believe that there should not only be public street lighting,  but

kampong  lighting  as  well  in the lorongs that  have  been  made  by  the

Government. Most of the kampong lighting facilities, however, have overhead

wires  which  are  naked. There was an accident in the past  because  these

naked wires snapped, as a result, a child in the kampong was injured. If we

do  wish to provide lighting facilities in the kampongs, I feel the  safety

of  the  kampong folks must also be taken into account. One  of  the  steps

which I think should be taken, if there is no other alternative but to  use

naked   wires   overhead,  is,  at  least  to  fell  the  adjacent   trees.

Unfortunately, the lighting facilities have already been installed  in  the

kampongs.  The  trees, however, have not been felled. In the  interests  of

public  safety  in the kampongs I think this matter should receive  serious

consideration from the department concerned. At least those trees which are

considered dangerous must be felled or other alternative arrangements made.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, I agree with the Member for the Southern Islands

that  the welfare and the safety of the kampong folks should be safeguarded

and, in this respect, Sir, if he could bring specific examples of where the

danger would come from, I will certainly look into it.

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Is it the intention of the Minister that I

should submit specific cases before the Government will take action to fell

these trees which are in line with the wires? For the safety of the people,

I  think it is not enough just to wait for reports of such incidents. It is

the duty of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1818</b></font><br><br>

Government to investigate where the kampong lightings have been installed

and,  where  dangerous trees are found, action should be  taken  to  fell

them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> I think the Member for the Southern Islands thought I

was not going to do something about it. When I said I agreed with him,  I

meant  that  something would be done in general in the rural areas  where

there  is  street  lighting to see that if there  is  any  tree  that  is

endangering  the  wires, or anything of the kind  connected  with  street

lighting,  then something would be done. I was just asking him to  supply

me  with specific examples of places he knows where things could be  done

immediately.

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I am satisfied with the

explanation,  and I assure the Minister I will give him  my  fullest  co-operation, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Tun Lim Yew Hock -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 24 be reduced by $10 in respect of

item (1) of subhead 16.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Tun Lim?

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 24 be reduced by $100.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concerns the total expenditure for Head 24. I am subject to

correction,  Mr  Speaker.  I  wish  to  get  an  explanation.  In   this

expenditure  there  are  shown items concerning  wages  to  each  subhead

amounting to not less than $4 million. I am told that this expenditure is

from  the  previous City Council administration which has been integrated

into the Government departments. Concerning the expenditure, I think  the

items  on  wages  could  be included under the head Personal  Emoluments - O.C.A.R.  We want to know the holders of the various posts so  that  they

will be put under one specific head. I hope the Minister will be able  to

explain.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, this has to do with the Local Government

Integration   Bill  again.  Although  the  City  Council  departments   are

comes about, the suggestion of the Member for the Southern Islands will  be

implemented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Health and Law was previously the Minister for

Labour  and  Law and he had the experience of one Political  Secretary  who

went



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1820</b></font><br><br>

against  his  own policies. It was quite a sad experience.  Then  he  was

transferred  to  the  Ministry of Health and  Law.  Not  long  after  the

transfer, he had another sad experience with another Political Secretary,

who  resigned. May I ask, Sir, whether the Minister considers, after  his

sad  experience with Political Secretaries, he wants to keep the vote and

have another sad experience with another Political Secretary?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,

recommend that this post be deleted.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we see now that the once Minister

for  Labour and Law has been transferred to the Ministry of Health.  I  am

just wondering whether there was any grievance against him as the Minister

for Labour.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown starts off with being out

of order. He has now moved an amendment,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 25 be reduced by $100.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1821</b></font><br><br>

And therefore he must debate the .general policies of the Ministry. If  he

wishes  to  ask  the Minister for Health whether he is keeping  in  better

health  in  this  Ministry than in the last, he ought  to  have  moved  an

amendment to item (1) of subhead 1. That has passed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, I was just wondering because previously the

Member for Hong Lim had said that the Minister for Health was made a scapegoat.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We must not have a debate on those lines. I would

now  like a debate on the general principles of Government policy  on  the

Ministry of Health and Law.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, I will leave it out because I was thinking that

it might be on the subject of the Minister for Health and Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to speak on the congestion in the Out-patient Departments. As we

know, the Out-patient Departments in the hospitals have been overworked. It

was  the general policy of the P.A.P. Government to make sure that if  they

ever came into power, the facilities for the Out-patient Departments would

be  improved  so that the general health of the people would  not  only  be

looked  after  but  that  it  would  also  be  attended  to  swiftly   and

efficiently.  Now because of the unfulfilled promises of 1960,  as  I  have

said, $3.7 million from the Ministry of Health has not been used.  As  a

result  of  that, the out-patient service has not been improved. There  was

general  talk of having combined clinics, poly-clinics and the Kallang  out

door  dispensaries. But what do we see? Only a token sum has been spent  on

all  this. In the case of the combined clinics, two are supposed  to  have

been  built; but one was actually a conversion from some other  building - I

believe it was a community centre. Only one, Sir, was actually built.  This

shows  what  service  the P.A.P. Government has given  to  the  people  of

Singapore as regards outpatient service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just wondering, Sir, if the Government would care to look into

these matters and make sure that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1822</b></font><br><br>

out-patient  service would be improved so that all the people - especially

the  poor - in  Singapore would not have to wait for hours and  hours  for

treatment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to bring up is this matter of direction finding. I

see it is already earmarked in the Development Estimates, but this scheme

was  raised  by  Assemblymen in the P.A.P. quite some time  ago.  I  will

explain.  A  lot of people who visit the General Hospital for  the  first

time  do  not  know  how  to  go to the Surgical  Wards,  Medical  Wards,

Orthopaedic Wards, Out-patient Department or even the Mortuary.  What  we

would  like,  Sir, is that the Ministry take note of this and  when  they

really  start  on this direction - finding scheme - if that  is  the  actual

scheme  that is earmarked in the Development Estimates - then we hope  they

will  make large simple signs or symbols so that any person will be  able

to find the place he wants to go to. We want to make sure that any person - whether  he be Chinese, English, Malay or Indian - will be able  to  locate

the place that he wishes to go to. If, for example, we could have a large

drawing  of  an eye for the Eye Department, everybody will be  helped  in

finding the way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I would like to raise is the dental service. As we

know,  there is only one adult dental service in the whole of  Singapore.

It  is centred in the General Hospital. We have seen crowds waiting  from

early morning until the afternoon to be attended to, and we know of cases

where  people  have to wait for at least one year in order to  get  their

dentures  made. We know that certain people like the Minister for  Health

could get things done more easily because he has enough "pull". But there

are  a  lot of people who have to wait for a very long time. We hope  the

Minister  will  look into this matter and expedite all services  to;  the

public as regards the Dental Department. Of course, this is partly due to

the  shortage of dental officers and dental technicians. We would suggest

that in future, if the Government should decide on any district hospitals

or poly-clinics, a dental wing be put in so that everybody would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1823</b></font><br><br>



be  served more easily. As regards the dental service, I would also like to

mention  that there is a complaint of a lack of post-graduate opportunities

for   advancement  for  the  whole  Dental  Service  as  well  as  for  the

technicians.  There  have  been no post-graduate  study  opportunities  for

dental  officers since 1959. As a result, a number of them  have  resigned,

and  in  such  a  small dental service, the small number who  resigned  has

caused a certain amount of dislocation in the service. We hope the Minister

will look into that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on a very unhappy subject, and that is in respect

of  the Japanese doctors. It is a subject in which the Minister for Finance

is interested.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Why?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> There is a lot of unhappiness and misunderstanding at

the present moment amongst the local staff in the hospitals. They find that

the  Israeli doctors are doing good work and that they are really worth the

money paid to them. But the same cannot be said for the Japanese doctors. I

do  not  mean we should emphasise the fact that they are Japanese,  but  it

just  happens  that  they are Japanese. I will give you one  example,  Sir.

There  is  one  doctor  now  in  the Pathological  Laboratory  who  has  no

experience  of  the  work  he  is supposed to  do.  In  fact - so  far  as  I

understand, Sir - he is not up to local standards. He has been used to  doing

a certain type of work that requires electron-microscopy, but unfortunately

in  Singapore  they have to use only the ordinary light microscope  and  in

this  particular field of work, he is not as efficient or as  qualified  as

our  own local men. In fact, Sir, this particular doctor is now doing post-mortem  work  for  the first time. In other words, we are inviting  doctors

from  Japan in order that we may train them. On top of that, Sir, they also

have no experience

of  medico-legal work, so that in anything concerning the courts, they have

to  ask for advice. In fact, this particular person was transferred to  the

Trafalgar



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1824</b></font><br><br>

Home.  He  was  found  unfit  and sent back  again  to  the  Pathological

Laboratory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> To Woodbridge Hospital.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Of course, the Japanese doctors know a smattering of

English, but that is not good enough. Their clinical work is not  up  to,

standard,  so  much  so that they cannot even do night  duty  because  it

entails  a  certain  amount of work in which they  are  not  experienced.

Therefore, we have these doctors from outside getting paid more than  our

local  doctors. But they do not have the experience of our local  doctors

and  they come here to be trained by our local doctors! Surely, Sir, this

is entirely different from what we have been told.

<br><br>7.15 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not against the principle of recruitment of foreign doctors. In

fact, we would advise that if such is necessary for certain grades and  if

no  local man is found suitable, then a foreign man should be enlisted  to

help  us in our work. But we urge the Government to make sure that if they

want  to  recruit people from outside Singapore, they recruit  the  proper

men,  men who can teach us something. Do not let them be men whom we  have

to teach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point about these foreign doctors, Sir, and it is this:

that in any department a certain number of people [Laughter].

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Perhaps the Member for Cairnhill would like to

change his seat!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> There is another grouse, Sir, about these Japanese

doctors. A certain number of doctors are assigned to every Unit, and if a

non-Singapore doctor is assigned to that particular Unit,  it  means  one

local  doctor is deprived of the opportunity of learning things  in  that

particular   Unit.   We  realise,  Sir,  that  non-local, doctors   are

supernumerary. But in spite of that, only a certain number of people  can

be assigned to any one Unit or any one Department, and because of, say



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1825</b></font><br><br>

X  occupying  the place in a particular Unit a local doctor is denied  that

opportunity.  And it means, Sir, the loss of opportunity  of  training  and

experience  for  the local men. We hope the Minister will  also  look  into

that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, Sir, a letter has been sent inviting all nursing sisters who

resigned  as a result of the pay cut to rejoin the service. They have  been

offered  the same basic salary as when they left the service. To  that,  we

agree. It is a very good thing. But -

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, on a point of elucidation.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Could the Member for Queenstown tell me on what

criterion he would distinguish a nursing sister who resigned as  a  result

of the pay cut, from one who resigned as a result of marriage, or from one

who resigned for other reasons?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is no elucidation, Sir. He has puzzled me more.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am asking you to distinguish -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Let us not waste time.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But these nursing sisters, Sir, are only asked to do

duty  from 8 o'clock in the morning to 4 o'clock in the afternoon,  whereas

those  who have been faithful to the service and who have remained in spite

of  the pay cut are asked to do night duty. Now, we are not going into  the

pros and cons of this matter, Sir. Probably there are reasons for it; we do

not   know.   We  hope  the  Minister  can  enlighten  us.  But   this   is

discrimination, and any discrimination can only engender resentment. Let us

hope this resentment will not cause more resignations later on, because  it

only  means  that our health service will be depleted of more  sisters  and

more nurses. Although this seems to be a small matter, we hope it will  not

go unnoticed by the Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1826</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also understand, Sir, that the nursing service at the present moment

is  actually short of staff nurses. Since such a generous offer has  been

given  to the nursing sister, would the Minister not also consider making

the  same offer to those staff nurses who left because of the pay cut and

who wish to rejoin?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have only one more matter to raise, Sir, and this I hope the Minister

could  explain,  especially  in regard to,  this  so-called  merger.  We

understand,  Sir, that Federal citizens can get permanent employment  in

the  Singapore  medical service, but this does not  hold  true  for  the

Singapore citizen who wants to get into the Federation medical  service.

There is, therefore, no equality as regards opportunities offered to the

Singapore  citizen  and' the Federation citizen.  If  the  Minister  for

Health  and Law would care to get details from me later on, I  am  quite

willing to give him examples and the names of people, especially in  the

dental  service, who have not been able to get jobs in Singapore because

those  jobs have been taken up by Federation citizens, and yet Singapore

citizens  have  not been able to get a chance in the Federation  medical

service.  This alone shows, Sir, how important it is that we  get  equal

citizenship rights.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I hope the hon. Member for Queenstown is not going

on  that  tack.  The  complaint, I think,  should  be  confined  to  his

allegation  that  Singapore citizens cannot be employed  in  the  Health

Department in the Federation. That is all.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Of course, the Minister for Health and Law will not

deny what I have said, Sir,I can give him facts if he likes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on the, health

policy, we cannot forget what the P.A.P. promised the electorate in  the

1959  general  elections. This could be read from the  pamphlet  of  the

P.A.P.  There is a statement on the Government's health policy  made  by

the  present  Minister  for Home Affairs to the people  during  election

time. He said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Within the next five years, the Health policy of the P.A.P. government

will be to make improvements to the existing health



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1827</b></font><br><br>

system so that the benefit from public expenditure on health will go

principally to the board masses of Singapore. It cannot be denied that in

Singapore the medical situation leaves room for improvement.'



<br><br>This passage is very important. If we pay attention to Government's work in

regard  to health, we can easily find out that Government has done only  20

per  cent of the work as provided in the Estimates. In 1959 it promised the

people  many things in regard to health, but the Government has not carried

out its promises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I want to mention is that a few months ago, strange to

say,  there  was a lot of mosquitoes around my house. I remember  I  raised

this  point with the Minister concerned. I asked him whether this  was  the

result  of abolishing the Anti-Mosquito Unit. Otherwise how could there  be

so  many mosquitoes around my area? So I hope the Minister will pay special

attention to this point, because it does not only concern me but some other

areas may also be affected by mosquitoes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the Minister should be given time to reply. If

there  is  any  further time, then perhaps the Member for  Mountbatten  can

raise her point, unless it is very brief.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Yes. Mr Speaker, Sir, I am just trying to be help

ful.  There was mention about helping the poor people to find their way  to

the different departments. I would like to draw the Minister's attention to

what  is  done  in S.A.T.A., which he might like to adopt. They  just  have

lines - black lines, white lines, red lines, for instance  - that lead  to  the

different  departments. And the poor people have just to  be  told  by  the

doctor,  "Follow the black line" or "Follow the red line and it  will  lead

you to the right department."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is this. I just want to ask the Minister what he intends

to  do  or  has he done anything about the dirt in the drains that  I  have

complained about?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1828</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will first deal with the complaint by the

Member for Queenstown that though we have been in the government for  the

past  two  years, their has been very little done in the way of  building

clinics,  outpatient clinics and combined clinics. Sir, he must  remember

that  a doctor was the Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Health.

He  was the political head who must bear the responsibility for all this,

Mr Speaker, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No, Mr Speaker, Sir,I have looked through the files and I

know  the position. I shall indicate what has happened, Mr Speaker,  Sir.

The  only  clinic we have completed is the clinic at Lim Ah  Pin  Road  in

Upper Serangoon. There was a community centre in Lim Ah Pin Road and  next

door to it there was an ante-natal clinic.

<br><br>7.30 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An approach was made to me, when I was Minister for Labour, to release

that community centre and convert it into an outpatient clinic. That  was

done.  That community centre was given to the Medical Department  and  it

was converted into a clinic. By the time the conversion was completed, my

Ministry  was able to build a new community centre opposite  Lim  Ah  Pin

Road. That was about the 40th community centre we built.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the other clinic that is being built is the clinic in

Still  Road.  It will provide outpatient as well as maternity  and  child

welfare services. There will be a dental hut in that clinic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since I have been in the Ministry, I have met all the

doctors  concerned with planning. We have devised plans for  stepping  up

the  building  of outpatient clinics. We have zoned the island  off  into

five  major districts, with the main thoroughfares as dividers. One  zone

will be all the area east of Geylang/Changi Roads.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at the present moment, extension work is going on at

the  Kallang/Mountbatten  Road Clinic. That used  to  be  the  old  Civil

Airport canteen. It has been extended to double



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1829</b></font><br><br>

its  size. It copes with about 600 patients every day. It is the  biggest

outdoor clinic after the General Hospital Outpatient Clinic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also building outpatient clinics at this very moment. Plans are

afoot  to transform the Siglap Community Centre into an outpatient clinic.

We  have  plans also to build another outpatient clinic in Somapah Road  at

Changi.  The  Still  Road clinic is in the course of  construction  at  the

present moment. Once we get those clinics built, we will zone off the East

coast  area,  so that all persons who want treatment and who live  in  that

area  will  receive their outpatient treatment at the clinics  within  that

area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We propose also to build clinics in the housing estates. One will be

built  in Aljunied Road Estate. In the Serangoon Road district, we  propose

to  .build  a clinic at Yio Chu Kang. There is a very small and old  clinic

now at the junction of Paya Lebar and Yio Chu Kang Roads. But that junction

is  going  to  be turned into a roundabout very soon, and we will  probably

lose  that  clinic. We, therefore, propose to build another one further  up

the  road. Further up in Kampong Kayu, a clinic has already been built.  We

propose  also  to  build a clinic in the Thomson Road area,  an  outpatient

clinic  in  the  grounds  of the Thomson Road Hospital.  In  the  Sembawang

district an outpatient clinic will be built.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Bukit Timah area, Mr Speaker, Sir, there is already a small

outpatient unit, and a maternity and child welfare clinic at the corner  of

Bukit  Timah  Road and the junction of Bukit Batok Road. It is proposed  to

build a big outpatient clinic in the vacant ground behind the maternity and

child  welfare  clinic at Bukit Timah Road. There is already an  outpatient

clinic in Bukit Panjang. We are also going into J wrong Road. We propose to

build  a  small outpatient clinic at the 16th mile. The Thong  Ho  Village

Community Centre is being converted now into a maternity and child  welfare

and  outpatient clinic. Along Pasir Panjang Road, there is a maternity  and

child welfare clinic at Kampong Kay Hai Road. An outpatient



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1830</b></font><br><br>

clinic  is  at  the  5th milestone, Pasir Panjang. We  propose  to  build

another  new outpatient clinic in the area of the Harbour Board. Once  we

get  these clinics built, we will zone off these five areas, and  require

all the people who need treatment to have it at the clinics in one of the

five  areas  where they live. That will reduce the pressure  on  the  Out

patient  Clinic  in the General Hospital. The Outpatient  Clinic  at  the

General  Hospital  attends to about 3,000 patients  a  day.  It  is  very

congested  and  treats  besides  outpatients,  patients  in  the  General

Hospital itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in addition to this unhappy state of affairs in the

outpatient  clinics, there is also tremendous congestion in  the  various

medical and surgical units in the General Hospital, so much so that these

units  themselves  have  their own problems as  far  as  outpatients  are

concerned.  These  medical  units  have  to  have  their  own  in-service

outpatient  facilities. So to relieve that congestion, we  are  going  to

provide a third medical unit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We propose also to get all the chronic sick out of the General Hospital

into the new Chronic Sick Hospital which is to be built in the Woodbridge

Hospital  grounds.  In  fact  there are two vacant  wards  which  we  are

converting right now into a chronic sick hospital So, that would  relieve

the bed space in the General Hospital.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope in the course of this year the situation will

have considerably improved as far as outpatient facilities are concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as to direction finding notices, Mr Speaker, Sir. The suggestion

has  been  made  that  I should have a look at the direction  notices  in

S.A.T.A. I hope to go round and see what these notices are like. We might

introduce  these improvements in the General Hospital and  in  the  other

hospitals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the dental services are concerned, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

true  most of the facilities are at present concentrated in the  General

Hospital,  although,  there  has been some dispersal.  There  have  been

dental chairs provided in community centres. I have seen dental



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1831</b></font><br><br>



chairs  for children at the Sims Avenue Community Centre as well as at  the

Buona  Vista Community Centre and at the schools. I will have to look  into

this matter. In the short time that I have been in the Ministry, I have had

such  a lot of work to do that I really have not had the time to give  this

my personal attention. But I can assure the Member for Queenstown that this

question will not be overlooked. I will look into it immediately. I was not

aware  that  there  was  a complaint that there were not  sufficient  post-graduate  scholarships for dental officers. I will look  into  this  matter

also.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Japanese doctors, Mr Speaker, Sir, I know it is true this has

caused considerable dissatisfaction amongst our local doctors. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  at  one time there was a shortage of highly skilled medical officers.

We thought we should try to get specialists from overseas to come and train

our  local officers. We have been able to recruit two, very skilled Israeli

doctors  who  are  holding  specialist  superscale  appointments   in   the

Bacteriological  and the Pathology Departments and are doing  good  service

there. They have improved conditions in these Departments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third Israeli doctor is serving as a Senior Registrar. We had hoped to,

get four Senior Registrars from Israeli. In point of fact, we have only got

one. Another Israeli doctor was offered appointment, but he has turned down

the  offer.  I do, not think there is any possibility of getting  any  more

Israeli  doctors. As far as Japanese doctors are concerned,  we  have  been

able to get five of them. From the reports I have received, one of them  is

of  Senior  Registrar  standard. I do not think the others  are  of  Senior

Registrar  standard. At most, they are of the same standard as our  medical

officers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Below.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> With regard to the doctor from the Pathology Department, as

soon  as  I  heard  he  was a misfit there, I took steps  to  send  him  to

Trafalgar Home. I understand he is a skin specialist. One



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1832</b></font><br><br>

of  the Japanese doctors is doing very well indeed. He has received very

good  reports.  He  is  in the Orthopaedic Unit.  As  a  result  of  the

representation  I  had, received from our  local  doctors,  I  met  the

Japanese  Consul and explained the position to him. I told him  that  if

any more doctors, were to come from Japan, I wanted an assurance that we

would  get  doctors  of  the competence and experience  we  require.  He

assured me that if the Japanese sent us any more doctors, they would be

of the competence and experience that we require.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these Japanese doctors have come in to help us and

are  here  through  no fault of their own. We have offered  them  Senior

Registrar  terms  and they get on well with our doctors.  They  are  not

blocking  the  promotions  of  our  local  doctors.  They  are   filling

supernumerary posts of Senior Registrars. Mr Speaker, Sir, we  have  32

posts of Senior Registrar on our establishment dispersed throughout  our

hospitals.  We  have  18  senior local officers who  have  already  been

appointed Senior Registrars. We have another 17 local doctors  who  have

just come back with the requisite specialist qualifications and who are

queuing  up  for appointment as Senior Registrars. These  vacancies  are

being circulated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have provided funds to employ all our doctors who have received

higher  training abroad as Senior Registrars. They cannot complain  they

are  being done out of jobs by the presence of these Israeli doctors and

Japanese, doctors now in service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next matter raised was the recruitment of sisters at new rates of

pay. Mr Speaker, Sir, we have an authorised establishments of 211 posts

for  nursing sisters, and the number of persons in these posts  is  136,

leaving  a  vacancy  position of 75. In the  establishment  for  trained

nurses,  there is an authorised establishment of 1,175 posts..  We  have

1,021 persons in these posts, leaving a vacancy position of 154.

<br><br>7.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the expansion in the medical service, Mr Speaker, Sir, we

envisage that we would need to create another



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1833</b></font><br><br>



14  posts  of nursing sister, so that the vacancy position will be  89  for

nursing  sisters. For trained nurses, we would need to create  another  144

posts, so

that the vacancy position will be 298.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we also have an establishment of 550 assistant nurses. We have 530

persons  in  those posts, leaving 20 posts vacant. With such a big  vacancy

position,  something has had to, be done to attract back into  the  service

all  those  who had left the service. With that end in view,  we  sent  out

invitations asking all sisters and staff nurses who had left the service to

come  back.  Many of them had left the service on marriage and  we  thought

that  if  we offered them employment in the outpatient services where  they

would  not have to do night work, they would be prepared to return  to  the

service.  Seventy letters were sent out and to date, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  we

have  been  able  to re-employ 12 temporary sisters and 8  temporary  staff

nurses.  One  more temporary sinter and three more temporary  staff  nurses

have  told us they will be prepared to come back at the beginning  of  next

year. So that in that effort we were able to get only 20 more persons  into

the  service. We have had to offer them some inducement to come  back.  We

have offered that all those who have had service of less than a year would

come  back on their previous salary plus the cost of living allowance  they

get  now.  All those who had left the service between one and  three  years

should  get  one  additional increment as an inducement to come  back.  All

those  who  had  left the service for over three years should  receive  two

additional increments. With this inducement, Mr Speaker, Sir, none of them

who  come back into the service can ever supersede those who are at present

in the service. So that those who are in service cannot complain that these

inducements  are  unfair. We have had to offer this inducements  and,  even

with  this offer, Mr Speaker, Sir, we have only been able to get  20  back

into the service. I have already indicated what the vacancy position is - 89



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1834</b></font><br><br>

vacancies for sisters and 298 vacancies for staff nurses.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister will notice, there are two minutes left.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I see. Well, the last point, Mr Speaker, Sir, is the

question  of the appointment of Federal citizens. This affects  not  only

doctors  and  nurses,  but it also affects other officers  in  the  civil

service.  The  rules  for entry are such that only Federal  citizens  can

enter  the  Federal civil service, whereas in Singapore,  those  who  are

Federal  citizens can also enter the Singapore civil service. I  have  to

answer the point the Member for Queenstown has made just now. He says  we

are  taking  Federal citizens into the Singapore civil  service  in  such

numbers  that  our own locally qualified persons are being  done  out  of

jobs. That is not true as far as the medical service is concerned.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If it is true - then?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> If you say it is true, I shall first have to check up on it.

But it is certainly not true as far as the medical service is concerned.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time has expired. Does the Member for Queenstown

wish to take a vote?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I beg to withdraw, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,904,200 for Head 25 ordered to stand part of the

Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1834</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 26-

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 26 be reduced by $10 in respect

of item (335) of subhead 1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have been talking of doctors, nurses, sisters, and now we come to

matrons -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What about brothers?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1835</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> A vote of $18,000 is asked for, that is to say, the

maximum of the time-scale for Matrons, Grade II. In 1961, the vote was only

$15,600, but for 1962, it is going to be $18,000, that is to say, for  each

of  the  two  matrons, an increase of $100 a month is proposed.  Will  the

Minister please explain how this situation has arisen?

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there must be an explanation for all this. I

must confess I am rather surprised to see such a big bump up myself.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the Minister in charge of Establishment might give

the answer.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am also convinced there is an answer, but I am as

much  in the dark as the Minister and, therefore, I do not know if it  will

satisfy the Member for Cairnhill if we say, "All right, let there be a  $10

reduction in the vote."

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No, the Minister cannot say that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> How can that be?

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, it seems that both the Ministers are having

difficulty  answering a simple question. The only possible answer  is  that

the  matrons, according to the vote, have resigned and two new matrons  are

put in. But what I cannot understand is why the matrons should be put in on

the top of the time-scale?

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, so far as I am aware, there are two

vacancies  actually. At the Tan Tock Seng Hospital there  is  one  post  of

Grade I Matron and two posts of Grade II Matron. I know the post of Grade I

Matron has been substantively filled, and one of the two vacancies of Grade

II  Matron is being used to pay for a Grade II Matron at the Kandang Kerbau

Hospital.  But  I am really unable to say how the salary should  have  been

bumped up this way - from $15,600 to $18,000.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the Minister could give the information later on?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1836</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I will look into the matter and give the Member the

explanation, if there is an explanation.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, in order not to cause a breakdown in the medical

service, I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 26 be reduced by $10 in respect of

item (385) of subhead 1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another peculiar situation,. Sir. This is in respect of Matrons

again.  In the previous case there was a bumping up, but in this case  it

remains  so  stationary  that no increment is  given.  Can  the  Minister

explain that? [Laughter].

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> This is another establishment problem. I shall look into it

myself, Mr Speaker, Sir. I have been aware of many similar items, but it

is very difficult to give an immediate explanation -

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Perhaps that is the top of her time-scale?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is that the answer?

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No. It is not the top of the scale.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, in order not to make life more difficult for the

Minister, may I withdraw?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood in the name of Inche Ahmad Jabri bin

Mohammed Akib -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Inche Ahmad Jabri?

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr. Speaker, Sir, because time is very

short,  I  ask  for  a  written answer from the  Minister  in  regard  to

amendments (3)* and (4)+. (In English) I am giving notice now, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member is not moving?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1837</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri:</b> I am not moving.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member is not moving but hopes the minister will give

him a written reply.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 26 be reduced by $100.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice there are many posts where salaries are reduced from 1961. Not

less  than 25 posts have had their salaries so reduced. Under subhead  116,

there  is a sizable reduction. I would like to know what it is that  causes

this  sizable reduction. If we study the Estimates carefully, we will  find

there  are more of such instances of big reductions, but there is  no  time

for such a careful review; so I pose that question to the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, with regard to the maintenance of vehicles -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is, "That the total sum to be allocated for

Head  26  be  reduced by $100." Now, if the hon. Member wishes to  pinpoint

certain items, he ought to have given notice of amendments of those  items.

He cannot now ask for information about certain items. He must now touch on

the general policy of the department.

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Because this matter would possibly cause

uneasiness among workers in this department. I assume these people have

had their salaries reduced. So if people who have no proper qualifications

are appointed, then that is not in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1838</b></font><br><br>

interest  of health. I want the Minister concerned to give an explanation

of these matters for the benefit of the public.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Time has expired for the item. If the Minister considers a

ministerial statement is necessary on that particular point, then at 2.30

p.m. on Monday, he will be able to make a ministerial statement.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I can answer it.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is too late now. An answer could be given by the

Minister  by way of a ministerial statement at 2.30 p.m. on Monday.  Does

the Member for the Southern Islands wish to take a vote?

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri:</b> No.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $35,453,140 for Head 26 ordered to stand part of the

Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it being 8 p.m. Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and took

the Chair of the Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to report that the Committee

of  Supply has made progress on the Main Estimates, and ask leave to  sit
