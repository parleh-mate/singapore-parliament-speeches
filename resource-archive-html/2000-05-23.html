<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>CARRIAGE OF PEOPLE ON OPEN BACKS OF PICK-UPS AND LORRIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Gerard Ee</b> asked the Minister for Communications

and  Information Technology whether he will consider  banning

or  introducing stricter laws on the carriage of  people,  in

particular  workers,  on  the  open  backs  of  pick-ups  and

lorries.



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology (Dr John Chen Seow Phun) (for the Minister for Communications and Information):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Government allows the carriage of workers in goods  vehicles.

This will help reduce business costs.  We should continue  to

do  so, provided the workers' safety is not compromised as  a

result.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Road Traffic Act, the owner or hirer of a

goods vehicle is allowed to use the vehicle to transport  his

workers to their place of work or business subject to various

safety rules and requirements.  For example, the workers must

be  properly seated and in a manner that would not cause them

to  fall  off the vehicle.  For pick-up trucks, the  vehicles

are  required to have proper side railings to further protect

the  passengers.  In addition, the drivers of  such  vehicles

are  not  allowed to carry an excess number of passengers  or

travel  faster  than the stipulated vehicle speed  limit  for

goods vehicles, which is currently set at 50 km per hour.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penalties for the violation of safety rules and

requirements  are stringent.  The LTA monitors the  situation

closely  and, if necessary, they will work together with  the

Traffic  Police to step up enforcement action against drivers

or   vehicle  owners  who  violate  the  safety   rules   and

requirements while conveying workers on their goods vehicles.



<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would like to

ask  whether allowing the continuance of carriage of  workers

in  open  trucks  is  a contradiction of trying  to  build  a

gracious society in terms of how we treat foreign workers.



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, I think the answer is no.

What  is  more  important is safety.  So  if  safety  is  not

compromised, and if they are seated properly, I think  it  is

an acceptable way of transporting workers in this part of the

world.



<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> Do we have an assurance that there will

be   a  step  up  of  enforcement?   Because  it  is  evident

travelling  on the road every day that there are breaches  of

these rules.



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Yes, indeed, LTA and the

Traffic  Police  have been stepping up their enforcement  and

will continue to do so.  We will also publicise the rules  so

that companies know how to behave.



<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, in what way does the

LTA  monitor the carriage of these passengers?  What has been

done?  Because I see that many of them are packed and some of

them appear to be over-packed from time to time.



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, in the same way that we

enforce  traffic  rules, speeding, and so on  and  so  forth.

Just  to  give the Member an indication, in 1998,  206  goods

vehicles  were  booked for committing these offences  and  in

1999,  this number has increased to 486.  So we will continue

to send a strong message to these companies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, is message enough? That is what I am

trying  to  find  out.  Because many of  the  passengers  are

perched in very dangerous positions, and if safety is one  of

the  basic  requirements, then other alternative arrangements

would  need  to be undertaken.  So I want to know what  plans

there  are for improving transportation conditions for  these

workers.



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> It is not just a message. We

have  stringent rules.  For instance, depending on the  floor

area  of the vehicle, there is a formula that calculates  the

permissible number of passengers.  The fines are  also  quite

steep.   And  we  are  also looking at  other  measures,  for

instance,  hand straps or hand holds and, if practicable,  we

can get them installed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister

of  State how many workers have been injured using this  mode

of  transportation so far, and have any workers died  because

of this mode of transportation?



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> According to Traffic Police

statistics,  they  have  monitored accident  rates  involving

goods  vehicles, but they have not divided them, eg,  whether

the  injured  are open back passengers or passengers  in  the

vehicles.   But  even this figure shows that  the  number  is

quite low compared to, for instance, motorcycles.  If you are

concerned, motorcycles are even more risky.  But, of  course,

the point is that if you observe safety rules, then there  is

no  concern  about  safety.  The reason why motorcycles  have

high  accident rates is that a lot of them speed and  do  not

observe  traffic  rules.  My point is  that  as  long  as  we

observe safety rules, there should not be any safety concern.

And  if the Member is interested in the actual figures, I can

give  him  a  comparison.  For instance, number of passengers

killed  in  1999 for pick-ups and lorries, 2 (and we  do  not

know  whether  they  are  the open  back  passengers  or  the

drivers);  number  of people killed for motor-cycles,  11  (5

times).  So I do not see the concern.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> May I ask the Minister of State so far,

how  does the Ministry enforce the rule that the workers  are

safely  transported during the night, especially  during  the

early morning where construction works are going on along the

roads?



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, as I said, there are

traffic regulations, whether it is the proper lighting of the

vehicles,  or  whether  it  is  our  road  conditions,   road

lighting, and so on.  And, of course, there are measures that

we  can  look further into, for instance, fixing of  luminous

tape  at  the back of the vehicle.  All these can be measures

to enhance safety.



<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> Sir, I do not think we should wait for an

accident to happen before acting on it.  Will the Minister of

State  consider  stiffer  penalties such  as  impounding  the

vehicles that are caught breaching the rules?



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, I think the present

penalty is stringent enough.  Let me just give the Member the

figure.   The punishment for first time offenders is  a  fine

not  exceeding  $1,000 or imprisonment  not  exceeding  three

months.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia (Nominated Member):</b> Will the Minister

of  State  consider  labelling the vehicles  on  the  maximum

number of persons they can actually accommodate?



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Yes, I have just said that

there  is  a  formula, depending on the  floor  area  of  the

vehicles.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia:</b> Can you label it on the vehicle

itself?



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> I will ask LTA to look into

this.

<div align="center"><b>OPENING OF MORE SINGAPORE POOLS' BETTING OUTLETS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Effect)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Minister for

Finance,  in  the light of the Singapore Pools' intention  to

open 50



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



more  betting outlets in various parts of Singapore,  whether

his  Ministry  has  considered  that  by  allowing  legalised

gambling to be more accessible to the public, it can  have  a

long-term  unintended  effect of indirectly  influencing  and

promoting undesirable values amongst more Singaporeans.



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in any society, there will always  be  people

with  the  propensity to gamble.  It is far  better  for  the

Government  to  provide  legal  channels  for  gambling;   as

otherwise, those who wish to gamble would be encouraged to do

so  through  illegal  operators.      The  number  of  Pools'

outlets of 150 has been kept constant for 14 years despite  a

12-fold increase in sales.  The growth of the lottery  market

has therefore created the urgency for new outlets.  If we  do

not  make  it equally convenient for people to bet  at  legal

outlets  and offer a reasonable standard of customer service,

the  long queues could well drive them into the laps  of  the

illegal operators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retailers appointed will have to observe strict

operational  procedures prohibiting service to persons  under

18 years of age.



<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Can I ask

the  Minister  if there are any studies to substantiate  that

opening  more legal betting outlets will help to  reduce  the

number  of  illegal  betting  outlets?   That  is  the  first

question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second question: May I ask the Minister whether, as a

means  of counter-balancing any ill social effects of  making

betting  outlets  more accessible, there  will  be  a  public

education  campaign,  similar to the anti-smoking  and  anti-drinking  campaigns, to remind the public of the  ill-effects

of gambling or excessive gambling?



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> On the first question, it is

impossible to obtain accurate statistics.  We would  have  to

ask  the  public at large: do you patronise illegal  outlets?

What  do you think the answer is going to be?  So I think  it

would be quite difficult to obtain the figures he wants.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of a public education campaign, I think

that  is something we can do, although excessive gambling  is

undesirable.   But I do not think the level  of  gambling  in

Singapore has reached a stage where we need to mount a  major

campaign.   We  are nowhere near the propensity  of  gambling

compared to many other countries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, by opening 50

more outlets, is that not a signal to the people of Singapore

that it is all right to gamble or to condone gambling?



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I do not think so. We have 150

outlets.  Another 50 outlets will be provided to make it more

convenient.  We believe that unless you can say that gambling

can  be wiped out altogether, which I think it is impossible,

then  we have to make it reasonably convenient for those  who

want to have a flutter to be able to do it conveniently,  and

that  is  the main purpose.  From 150 to 200 outlets over  14

years is not a large number.



<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> Could the Minister consider making such

premises  nondescript and enclosed so that under-aged  people

are restricted from entering the premises?



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> To do that defeats the purpose.

I  think he would appreciate that the locations selected  are

reasonably  far away from places where children will  gather,

schools,  places  of  worship,  and  so  forth.   Pools  will

exercise  due  care and not to place outlets at places  where

children might be attracted to, although legally children are

not allowed to patronise them anyway.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, on the one hand, the Government

tells  the  people of Singapore that gambling is anti-social,

it is bad for the family.  On the other hand, it is making it

more  convenient, opening more outlets for people to  gamble.

How does the Government reconcile the two?



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I think it is very difficult to

reconcile human nature.

<div align="center"><b>CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION OF BUSINESS FIRMS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Renewal fee)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Finance, in

regard  to  renewal fees of Certificates of  Registration  of

Business Firms, what is the reason for those who pay by  Giro

paying less (i.e. $75) and those who pay by cash paying  more

(i.e. $105).



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

differential fee structure for the renewal of Certificates of

Registration for Business Firms was implemented on 1st  April

2000  to  reflect  the  different  costs  of  processing  the

different modes of payment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before 1st April, the annual renewal fee was $25. This

rate  has  remained unchanged since 1974.   As  a  result  of

increasing costs over the years, the fees for renewal by cash

and  cash  equivalents had to be increased to $105 for  three

years  to reflect the higher operational costs.  If, however,

renewals  are done by GIRO, the processing costs  are  lower.

Therefore,  MOF  is able to pass on the cost savings  to  the

business  firms, and keep the renewal fees unchanged  at  $75

for three years, or at $25 per year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, people are asking why there is

such  a big differential rate.  When you pay by GIRO,  it  is

only  $75 and when you pay by cash, it is $105.  So they  are

asking:  as  far  as  the registration of business  firms  is

concerned,  cash  payment does not have  the  same  value  as

paying by GIRO.



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> By paying cash, you require

someone,  a clerk, at the counter to receive and process  the

cash.   For  GIRO,  you  do  it by just  pressing  a  button.

Surely, the difference is quite significant, in terms of cost

processing.  Lower cost of electronic processing is not  only

applicable  to business registration but to other  activities

where you are moving away from counter services to electronic

services.

<div align="center"><b>LICENSING AND CONTROL OF CATS</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Simon S C Tay -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. To ask the Minister for National Development what are

the  policies  and  practices relating to the  licensing  and

control of cats.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Question No. 4, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, cats are not licensed in

Singapore.   Unlike  dogs, cats would not play  an  important

role  in the spread of rabies in the event of an outbreak  in

Singapore.   Hence,  the licensing of cats  to  enable  quick

location of the animals for disease control is not necessary.

However, under the HDB Rules, lessees are not allowed to keep

cats  in HDB flats because it is difficult to confine  a  cat

within a flat. By nature, they tend to wander around and  can

find  ways  and means to get out of the flat thus creating  a

nuisance to other residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Agri-food and Veterinary Authority's (AVA) policy on

the  control  of  stray  cats is to promote  responsible  cat

ownership within the community through a voluntary Stray  Cat

Rehabilitation  Scheme implemented by various town  councils.

This scheme was successfully tried out as a pilot project  in

Tanjong Pagar Town Council in 1998.  A survey of residents in

this area showed that more than 80% of them were agreeable to

having   the  stray  cats  around,  provided  the  cats   are

sterilised  and  managed so that they do not cause  problems.

To date, 39 areas under 12 town councils are registered under

the scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Stray Cat Rehabilitation Scheme, volunteers

get  the  stray  cats  in their community  sterilised.   They

assist town council officers to attend to complainants of cat

problems  and help to resolve them.  The volunteers feed  the

cats  in an organised and hygienic way.  They clear away  the

food remnants after feeding the cats.  The sterilised cats do

not  reproduce and their presence deters other non-sterilised

cats from settling in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



area.   Unsterilised cats and cats causing  nuisance  can  be

removed from the area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AVA loans cat traps free of charge to residents who are

bothered  by  stray cats and will collect  the  trapped  cats

without charge.  Impounded cats which have been tagged,  ear-tipped (to indicate that it has been sterilised), or have any

other indication that it is owned, will be detained for  five

full   working  days  after  they  are  collected   by   AVA.

Subsequently, cats that are not claimed from AVA will be  put

down humanely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stray cats are usually found in areas where food is

readily  available.  Hence, the effective  control  of  stray

cats  requires cooperation of every member of the  public  to

dispose  food waste properly and also not to feed the  strays

indiscriminately.   Very  often, well-meaning  citizens  feed

strays  indiscriminately and leave food scraps lying  around.

Such  unhygienic practice not only increases  the  stray  cat

problem, it also exacerbates other animal nuisances, such  as

crows, pigeons and especially vermin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AVA is currently reviewing its policies and

practices  with a view to control indiscriminate  feeding  of

animals as well as the abandonment of pets.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> Although cat is not my problem, I am

asking on behalf of somebody else.  If the Minister of  State

is  in agreement that we should control cats, why do you  not

license them so that at least we do not shoot the wrong cats,

to  begin  with,  and  whoever  is  the  owner  will  have  a

responsibility  in making sure that the cat  does  not  stray

around, but is confined to the flat?



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, I do not think licensing

is the solution to stray cats.  The cat can still move around

and create nuisance, or scavenging on food, and so on.  So  I

do  not  think  there is a need, at this point  in  time,  to

license cats.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> If you can license dogs, what is the

difference for licensing cats?

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."

<br><br><i>Objective of Bill</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of the Bill is to amend the Housing and

Development  Act to enable the Housing and Development  Board

(HDB)  to introduce a new class of upgrading works, known  as

"special upgrading works", to cater for block works



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



that  will directly benefit only some flat owners  in  a  HDB

block  and to remove the restrictive covenant that HDB  flats

can be used only for residential purposes to enable the flats

to  be  used  as  home  offices under the Technopreneur  Home

Office (THO) Scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now explain the rationale for the amendments

in greater detail.

<br><br><i>Special Upgrading Works</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In implementing the Main Upgrading Programme (MUP), MND

and  HDB  have  been  receiving  requests  from  Members   of

Parliament  and  residents  for  upgrading  works  which  are

outside  the scope of the standard upgrading packages offered

to  MUP  precincts.  This has arisen due mainly to  the  many

different designs and configurations of HDB blocks,  and  the

diverse needs of our HDB residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for example, lift upgrading works. At present,

HDB  provides lift upgrading only to HDB blocks that  meet  a

set   of  criteria,  such  as  lift-to-flat  ratio  and   the

accessibility rate.  These criteria are necessary  to  ensure

that  the  upgrading  works carried out  are  cost-effective.

Some  HDB  blocks  are  unable to meet the  criteria,  mainly

because  not  all  the flats are served by common  corridors.

For  these HDB blocks, it will be necessary to add extra lift

shafts  and lifts in order to provide direct lift access  for

all  the residents in the block.  The benefits of such  works

are  obvious,  especially  for the  elderly  and  those  with

mobility  problems.  Some Members of the House have fed  back

to  my  Ministry  that lift upgrading  is  one  of  the  more

appreciated items in the MUP.  However, these works can  cost

anything  between  $10,000 and $30,000 per  flat.   There  is

therefore  a  need  to  obtain  a  strong  endorsement   from

residents before we proceed with the works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to introduce a new class of upgrading

works,  known as special upgrading works, to cater for  block

works  of this nature.  The objective is to give HDB  greater

flexibility  to  do  more during the  MUP  to  bring  maximum

benefits to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



largest number of Singaporeans living in various types of HDB

blocks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special upgrading works will proceed only if they

are valued and endorsed by the residents.  To gauge the level

of  support for such works, HDB will conduct a separate  poll

among  flat  owners  who stand to benefit directly  from  the

works.   HDB  will implement these works only if the  minimum

75%  "yes"  vote  is  obtained.  The Government  will  pay  a

majority share for such upgrading works. However, flat owners

who  stand  to  benefit  directly from  such  works  will  be

required to co-pay part of the cost.  This is only fair.   It

also  helps to ensure that flat owners consider the need  for

such upgrading works carefully.

<br><br><i>Use of HDB Flats As Home Offices</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn now to the subject of allowing HDB residents

to  use their flats as home offices.  Sir, in order to create

a   conducive  environment  for  technopreneurs  to  start  a

business  easily  and  at  low cost, the  Technopreneur  Home

Office  Scheme was set up.  This scheme allows technopreneurs

to  operate their IT-related start-up businesses from HDB and

private residential premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, HDB flat leases issued prior to 1983 contain

covenants which impose on lessees the obligation to  use  the

premises  solely  for residential purposes.  These  covenants

are made between the lessee, HDB and all other lessees in the

same  building.   This means that consensus amongst  all  the

lessees  living  in  the  same  building  is  required  if  a

particular  lessee  or  tenant wishes to  conduct  activities

beyond those of a residential nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill discharges HDB and the affected lessees from

this  obligation under the lease and allows all HDB flats  to

be  used  as  registered  offices of  companies.   This  will

facilitate the use of HDB flats as home offices under the THO

scheme.   Nonetheless, NSTB and HDB will regulate the  scheme

to  ensure  that the residential character of public  housing

estates  and the safety and comfort of surrounding  residents

are not affected.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Administrative Measures</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the two main amendments that I have

highlighted,  the  Bill also introduces  some  administrative

changes   to  improve  the  enforcement  of  public   housing

regulations and policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Bill allows HDB to prosecute any person who

knowingly  makes any false statements to HDB in  relation  to

the  sale,  purchase, mortgage or transfer of  an  HDB  flat.

Secondly, the Bill confers on HDB the exclusive use of  HDB's

logo  and the acronym "HDB" by making it an offence for other

persons  to use HDB's logo, the acronym "HDB" or one that  is

so  similar  as  to cause any deception.  Thirdly,  the  Bill

removes the requirement to obtain the sanction of the  Public

Prosecutor  before HDB takes prosecution action for  offences

committed under the Housing and Development Act or Rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, most Members in

this House must have heard about this IQ question:  A man who

stays  on the 12th storey of a flat always takes the lift  up

to  the  9th storey and walks up three storeys to  his  flat.

However,  when  he leaves for work every morning,  he  always

takes  the  lift on the floor where he stays,  ie,  the  12th

storey.  Why?  The answer is that the man is short, not  tall

enough  to  press the upper button.  He can  only  press  the

lower button so he can reach only the 9th storey.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in many of our mature housing estates, many

residents  living on the upper floors are doing  exactly  the

same as the short man though they are not short. Why?  It  is

because  our lifts do not reach the top floor.  Our lifts  do

not  stop  on every floor either.  Thus, residents living  on

the  upper  floors have to walk up or down a few  storeys  to

take the lift. This is especially so for residents of the  4-room  segmented  blocks.  Due to structural constraint,  some

need  to go a few storeys down to the common corridor  floor,

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>



walk past a few units to take the lift; as not all staircases

are  equipped with a lift. As a standard, only two lifts  are

provided in a block where there are five pairs of staircases.

Thus,  residents  wish that a new lift can be  added  to  the

segment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, when we urge residents to vote "yes" for

the  Main  Upgrading  Programme, the  most  frequently  asked

question  is,  "Will the new lift stop on  every  floor?"  or

"Will there be a new lift in our segment?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residents also comment that in the lift that serves a 12-storey block, we normally can find only five buttons. The

buttons  numbered "5" and "9" are to enable you to reach  the

5th  floor  and  the 9th floor.  And one more button  is  for

everyone  to go down. The other two buttons do not bring  you

up or down. It is just meant for the door to open or close.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What about emergency?



<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> For emergency, it is the green

button.  Normally, we do not press this button.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, HDB's existing lift upgrading criterion is that

each  new  lift  landing must serve at  least  four  dwelling

units.  This  has  caused disappointment and  unhappiness  to

residents  of 4-room segmented blocks as there are  only  two

units in each of the segment on every floor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residents are of the view that they should benefit from

the  new  lift landings at every floor if there is already  a

lift  and  should  not  be deprived of it  just  because  the

proposed  lift  landings cannot comply  with  the  criterion.

During  my meet-the-people sessions, there have been  several

requests  from senior citizens or families with aged  parents

of  swapping their flats with those on the floor where  there

is a lift landing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must commend Mr Mah for moving this amendment. As

Chairman  of  the Inter-Ministerial Committee on  the  Ageing

Population,  he  is  in the best position to  understand  the

frustration and disappointment of residents who cannot enjoy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



easy access to the lift due to the existing regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is timely that we made these amendments to meet the

needs of an ageing population.  It will be too late if we  do

not  make  this  amendment in time as such  segmented  blocks

constitute 22% of all the high-rise blocks built by HDB.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more of these blocks will undergo the Main

Upgrading  Programme.  Though similar blocks in  the  earlier

MUPs  were  not  given  the full lift  upgrading,  it  cannot

justify  that all other segmented blocks should not be  given

full  lift  upgrading just because the earlier  blocks  could

not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill empowers HDB to carry out selective polling and

payment for special upgrading works.  I support this as  this

will give the affected HDB blocks a more realistic chance  of

achieving the minimum 75% vote as only flat owners  who  will

benefit  directly from the works will vote and  pay  for  it.

However,  the  residents  are concerned  about  the  cost  of

sharing  as it may be too high that they cannot afford.   The

Minister did not mention the percentage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I would like to urge the Minister to set a lower

ratio  so  that  the owners need to pay,  say,  15%  to  20%,

instead of the normal 30% for the additional upgrading  item,

especially if they opt for a new lift.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Amendment Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  Singapore is one of the  countries  with  the

fastest  ageing population.  Sir, we have now  about  370,000

people  above  the  age  of 55, accounting  for  10%  of  the

population. Among our senior citizens, about 90% live in high-rise HDB buildings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the earlier generation of HDB flats, lifts do not

stop  on  every floor.  Because of the design, many residents

do  not have the lifts serving the floor on which they  live.

Just  now, Mr Seng Han Thong had already mentioned this.  For

the younger population, walking up stairs does not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>



pose a problem. But "time and tide wait for no man". With the

ageing  population, there are now more and more older  people

in  our  population.  These senior citizens  are  finding  it

difficult  to cope with the flights of steps to walk  up  and

down  every time they leave their flats as the lifts  do  not

stop on their floors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget debate this year, I suggested to the

Minister for National Development that the Government  should

make  a  comprehensive study on how to improve  the  existing

lifts  or install new lifts for the convenience of our senior

citizens.   I  am very happy to note that this suggestion  of

mine has been taken up by the Minister.  I would like to take

this  opportunity to thank the Minister and the  Housing  and

Development  Board staff for introducing this Amendment  Bill

so  speedily.  I would like to thank them sincerely from  the

bottom  of  my heart for this effort to provide  better  lift

services to our older citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, I support this Amendment Bill. But I would

like to comment on certain clauses of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, section 65A, as amended, defines "special

upgrading  works"  as works to be carried  out  in  buildings

comprising 2 or more storeys.  That being the case,  I  would

like  to ask the Minister whether those four-storey HDB flats

will  also  be  provided  with  lifts  when  they  are  being

upgraded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the amendment to section 65C provides for a

poll to be conducted in connection with any proposal to carry

out special upgrading works, for which the support of 75%  or

more  of the occupants having direct benefit from the special

upgrading  works   must  be secured for  the  project  to  be

carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel the upgrading of lifts is the most important

item  in the entire Main Upgrading Programme.  It is a  basic

item  that should be regarded as a necessity.  It must be  an

essential,  compulsory provision which requires  no  separate

voting  to  decide  whether new lifts  should  be  installed.

Lifts  are very essential for high-rise buildings. So to  add

new lifts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>



to  old  buildings is to improve existing facilities  and  to

provide  equal services for all residents.  It is not  a  new

project, so there is no need for a separate voting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that the amendment to section 65D, which

states  that the cost of upgrading works should be  co-shared

by  the affected residents, is unfair. There are four reasons

for this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, flat allocation. In the early days, flats were

allocated  to  applicants  by  ballots  conducted   by   HDB.

Applicants themselves have no free choice to select their own

flat.   If  you are lucky, you get a flat on the  floor  with

lift landing.  If you are not, you may get a flat one or  two

storeys above or below the lift landing.  The only choice you

had was to accept it or reject it.  Once you accepted it, you

cannot change your decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the sale price of the flat. During the earlier

days,  whether your flat was on a high floor or a low  floor,

with or without lift landing, you paid the same price for the

flat. There was no different  pricing. As a result, those who

had bought flats on the floors with no lift landing will have

to suffer a disadvantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, market price. In the open resale market, a

flat  on the floor with lift landing commands a better  price

than  the other flats without a lift landing. Those who  live

in   flats   without  lift  services  will   suffer   another

disadvantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, lifts as public facilities. In public

housing, the installation of lifts is  not restricted to only

certain residents. It is not their monopoly to use such  lift

services. Everybody is allowed to use the lift in a block  of

HDB flats. It is part of common property.  It does not belong

to any particular group of residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lifts in high-rise buildings are very important

facilities,  particularly to the senior citizens.   It  is  a

very  important item in the upgrading programme. So the  cost

of   installation  of  the  lifts  should  be  borne  by  the

Government  and the residents should not be required  to  co-share in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>



the   cost.    The  Housing  and  Development  Board   should

therefore regard the lift installation as part of the overall

upgrading  cost.  It should not be shared separately  by  the

residents  affected.  All residents should be  encouraged  to

"share  weal and woe". We should promote the "kampong spirit"

and  the community spirit. We should not discriminate against

one another. We must create a better living environment and a

better home for everybody.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Minister said that the residents would

have  to  bear  only  a small  part of the  total  cost.   My

colleague,  Mr  Seng Han Thong, also mentioned  that  if  the

Government  cannot  bear 100% of the cost of  installing  new

lifts  and the residents are asked to co-share in it, then  I

think the co-sharing should not exceed 20% of the total cost,

and  it should be borne by all the residents and not just the

affected residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if upgrading and installation of lifts is

considered  only  in  conjunction  with  the  Main  Upgrading

Programme, then the HDB should consider bringing forward  the

age criterion of 20 years to 15 years, and the IUP should  be

coordinated  so  that  the  upgrading  programmes  could   be

accelerated,   and  the financial and human resources  better

utilised  to  provide  a  better  environment  for  all   the

residents, and  better homes for everyone.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  can  make  HDB  estates  more  luxurious  with  continued

improvements  and upgrading works.  But this  will  not  make

them as attractive as the private housing estates as long  as

HDB  continues to maintain and enforce a standard set of very

rigid,  restrictive and outdated covenants  and  rules  which

stifle the creativity, resourcefulness and initiatives of its

lessees and the tenants at home or work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this thought in mind, I am particularly pleased to

note  that  HDB  is now taking such a big and  bold  step  to

remove  the  restrictive covenants in its  standard  list  of

instruments which will impede the reasonable use of HDB flats

as a home office for any commercial purpose. This is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>



certainly  the most welcome move for both our young  and  old

enterprising  HDB  flat dwellers who  aspire  to  have  their

business  start-ups established in their HDB  home  for  good

reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is well-known for its over-regulation because

civil  servants, like HDB officers, are good in making  rules

and  regulations to ensure law and order, especially  in  HDB

estates.  This might be important in our early days of nation-building  and  community development.   But  such  regulatory

approach,  if carried out to the extreme in the  modern  day,

would  have  the  adverse effect of making life  increasingly

difficult  and  stressful in Singapore.  This  is  definitely

detrimental to our current effort of attracting and nurturing

talents  for  the  new  economy.  To make  the  estates  more

attractive, HDB has challenged its planners and architects to

design  flats to rival those of condominiums.  But I want  to

pose  yet  another challenge to HDB.  Instead  of  trying  to

create  more rules and regulations to plug loopholes  in  its

administration, can HDB officers use their creative minds  to

actively  revise  and  relax  more  of  its  restrictive  and

outdated  rules and regulations to make every  HDB  estate  a

more  conducive  and  attractive place  to  live  and  to  do

business.  For example, can HDB revise its parking rules  and

charges to make visiting friends and relatives in HDB estates

not  always an inconvenient and costly affair?  Can HDB allow

shopowners  or  tenants  to use or sublet  the  underutilised

dwelling   units  in  their  shop  premises  for   commercial

purposes?   Can  HDB allow its lessees and tenants  to  build

proper  flower  boxes  or  install suitable  facilities  with

safety  features to grow plants at balconies or corridors  of

their HDB flats?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments to the Housing and Development

Act  will  also allow the Minister to approve such  upgrading

works as additional lifts, especially upgrading works for HDB

apartment blocks if more than 75% of the flat owners affected

supported the proposal.  Such special upgrading works may, in

some  cases,  give rise to the need for HDB  to  compulsorily

acquire  certain  units  of flats for the  intended  purpose.

Would the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>



Minister  ensure  that in such a situation, the  flat  owners

affected  would  be given adequate compensation  as  well  as

alternative accommodation within the same block or  the  same

estate before approving the upgrading works?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the House expressed a great deal of concern

over  the killer litter problem in HDB estates, and suggested

various  ways,  including  public education  and  enforcement

action,  to  address  it.  I would also  like  to  take  this

opportunity  to suggest that HDB and town councils  seriously

look  into the common aspirations and interests of  many  HDB

flat dwellers who want to beautify their monotonous high-rise

flats  with colourful plants and flowers.  Besides  education

and  enforcement action, can HDB and town councils also  pool

their  efforts  and resources together to  design  and  build

proper  and  attractive flower boxes with safety features  to

replace all the existing movable or hanging flower pots which

can  be  potential killer litter in HDB estates?  I  am  sure

such a special or general upgrading works are worth pursuing,

as  we all share a common aspiration to make every HDB estate

a  safe,  clean and green living environment that also  makes

Singapore a garden city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with my sincere hopes and appeals, I

support the motion to pass this Bill in this House.



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the

Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the new sections 13A and 13B that

confer  exclusive rights to HDB to use its  name,  symbol  or

representation   will  provide  added   protection   to   HDB

residents.    This   will   also  prevent   unscrupulous   or

unconscionable traders or individuals from abusing  the  name

of  HDB  to  take  advantage of less informed HDB  residents.

Over  the  years, there have been several cases  of  cheating

when  traders, especially renovation or trade craftsmen,  who

claim  to  be  accredited  HDB contractors,  carry  out  poor

quality  repair  works  for  HDB  residents  at  unreasonable

prices.  Very often, it is difficult to trace these culprits,

and not much redress



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



is  made to the affected residents.  With the introduction of

these  powers,  I  hope  that  the  HDB  can  provide  better

protection  to its lessees.  To ensure that this  legislation

is  effectively implemented, I would urge HDB to conduct more

public  education  programmes to keep  HDB  residents  better

informed  of the authentication procedures for HDB instructed

works  or  accredited  contractors.  This  will  ensure  that

better  quality of services and products can be  rendered  to

HDB   residents.   To  further  protect  HDB  residents,  the

Ministry  should  also make similar amendments  to  the  Town

Councils Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the amendments to sections 65A, 65C and 65D

regarding  the  introduction of special  upgrading  works,  I

would   like  to  highlight  some  concerns.   Although   the

amendment  may  seem logical and acceptable to HDB  residents

undertaking upgrading works, it has an undesirable impact  on

the  concept of communal living and the definition of "common

property".   The concept of communal living in HDB  flats  is

similar  to  that  of a private condominium  where  residents

agree,  at  the time of purchase, to live together  within  a

block  or  precinct and share facilities that are defined  as

common  property.   Common property includes  items  such  as

roof,  building  structure elements, external  walls,  lifts,

stack  pipes,  playground, swimming pool, etc,  that  benefit

residents within a block or a precinct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a private condominium, the voting rights of the flat

owners  are  specified in the Land Titles  Strata  Act  where

owners  can exercise their voting rights according  to  share

value.  In the HDB context, the voting rights of lessees  are

normally  only exercised during the Interim or Main Upgrading

Programmes.   Each eligible flat owner has one  voting  right

irrespective  of  the  size  of  the  flat.   The   cost   of

maintaining and upkeeping of all these buildings  is  usually

apportioned   according  to  share  value  or  voting   right

respectively.    By  segregating  special   upgrading   works

comprising  additional lifts or such  other  works  that  are

declared by the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>



and  introducing selective voting for such work items, we are

eroding the spirit of communal living and tampering with  the

rights of HDB lessees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lift is a common property that benefits every

resident in a high-rise block, irrespective of which floor he

or she stays.  Therefore, all residents should share the cost

of maintaining, upgrading or installing new lifts.  These are

existing  practices  of  both town  councils  and  management

corporations.   Sir, I do not believe that  selective  voting

for  special  upgrading works will work, and it is  also  not

fair to the affected residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we were to start introducing selective voting

for common property, the result will be disastrous.  Many HDB

residents will question why should they pay for the  cost  of

maintaining   the  roof,  water  pumps,  lifts,   structures,

playgrounds, senior citizens' corners, etc, as some of  these

facilities do not benefit them directly.   This will lead  to

potential conflicts among residents, thus weakening community

bonding.   Therefore, I would urge the Minister  to  consider

either removing the proposed amendments in sections 65A,  65C

and  65D  or  make  it compulsory for such special  upgrading

works  to  be  included  in  the  IUP  or  MUP  works,  where

necessary.  These special upgrading works can be packaged  in

the list of essential works such as water proofing of toilets

or  changing  of stack pipes which are presently included  as

compulsory works in the MUP standard package.  In addition, I

would  urge  HDB  to bear the cost of making  all  HDB  flats

elderly and handicapped friendly, so as to meet the needs  of

a fast ageing population.  As a good landlord, HDB has a duty

to  improve the accessibility and functionality of its flats,

in  particular, the installation of lifts that stop on  every

floor.  The provision of lifts that stop on every floor is no

longer a privilege but a necessity in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to  focus  my comments on what I deem to  be  the  main

aspect  of  this  Bill, ie, pertaining to  special  upgrading

works.  I believe this Bill is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



worthy of support  because of three essential principles that

underpin it.  The first is the flexibility it endows the  HDB

with in the implementation of upgrading projects.  The second

is  the  choice  it  will  give  Singaporeans  so  that  more

Singaporeans can benefit from upgrading works.  And the third

is  the  principle of equity, to ensure a certain  degree  of

matching  or congruence between those who benefit  and  those

who bear the cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the MUP projects that we have seen so far

implemented  attempt to strike a balance between these  three

principles  of flexibility, choice and equity, by adopting  a

layered approach.  In a typical MUP project, we have, at  the

first   tier,  precinct  works  which,  it  could  be  argued

reasonably,  are of benefit to all residents,  and  therefore

all  should  bear the cost and all should have the  right  to

vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the second tier, we have block works. They are

specific  to  the  block but of general benefit  to  all  the

residents in the block.  And in these instances, because  all

blocks in the precincts are given the same form of privileges

and benefits, it could also be argued that there is a general

benefit  that stems from them and therefore all  should  vote

and all should pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We then have a third tier of what are called space

adding   items  which  give  specific  additional  space   to

individual  units, and here the voting is done separately  at

the  block  level and the residents of each block can  decide

whether they wish it, and if they meet a threshold, they  can

have that item.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this has been a very pragmatic and balanced

approach to our upgrading projects, but the key limitation of

this really is when we want to consider a project at the sub-block level, ie, where we want a project which will benefit a

substantial  but not necessarily all units in a  block.   The

implementation of such projects will be stymied and  I  think

this  is  not  a hypothetical exercise.  As my colleague,  Mr

Seng  Han  Thong,  has pointed out, a case in  point  is  the

provision of lifts for segmented 4-room blocks.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the inclusion of such lift provisions in the main

or general programme of HDB which everybody votes on has been

suggested by some of the Members, but I would like  to  point

out  that, in practice, this is not going to work out for two

reasons.   Firstly,  the cost of such projects  is  unusually

high,  unlike risers or roof repair works, etc.  I have  been

told that each new lift well  -  and I speak with some degree

of  experience,  although I am not a  man  of  the  industry,

because  I  have been involved in some of these  projects   - can cost anything from $1/2-$1 million.  And if you have that

three-fold, that is a substantial cost.  And if  you  are  to

argue  that  this  substantial cost of a  particular  block's

benefit  is  to  be borne by the whole, the argument  may  be

untenable  and  that may result in the entire  project  being

defeated unnecessarily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also difficult, from what I can see, to conduct a

vote for this special item like a lift upgrading at the block

level in the way it is carried out for, say, the space adding

items.   Because even within a block, there are only specific

beneficiaries who directly derive benefit from it.  For those

who  know  the  topography of a 4-room segmented  block,  you

would  understand  what I am getting at.  Essentially,  if  I

take  a 100-unit block, there will be 30 or so units who  are

already  benefiting  from some form of  direct  lift  access,

either  because  the lift stops on their floor  in  front  of

their  doorstep or they are served by a common corridor.   It

is  the remaining 70-odd units who need this facility but are

deprived  of it.  But if you put it to a vote and subject  it

to  a  75%  test,  I think it is obvious that  the  odds  are

stacked against this project being carried through.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question really is this: how can such improvement

works  be  carried out?  The options are, first, as has  been

suggested by some Members, a generalised Government programme

for lift upgrading fully funded by Government.  That would be

like manna from heaven and nobody would object to that.   But

in  the absence of such largesse, I think we have to look  at

the next most pragmatic option, and that really is the nub of

this  special  upgrading works that are being proposed.   The

Bill



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



enhances  flexibility.  It means that, when implementing  the

project,  we  can now look at some worthwhile projects  which

might  benefit a sub-set of a particular block but  we  still

deem it to be worthwhile to endeavour to deliver.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it offers choice. The direct beneficiaries can

decide  for  themselves: is the price worth the  benefit  and

they  vote for it.  If they want it, and enough of them  vote

for  it, it will be delivered.  If not, it will not be  done.

That  really leads on to the point of equity, ie, only  those

who  benefit  will have to pay.  I think it is  a  reasonable

proposal  and  it has the added advantage that such  projects

can  be  bundled into a larger scale MUP project  which  will

achieve economies of scale and a lowering of cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do share some of the concerns about the implications

for  common property which my colleague, Dr Teo Ho  Pin,  has

raised.   But  there is a spectrum of works involved  in  any

upgrading,  from those at one end which are very  clearly  of

general  value  to all residents, to the other extreme  where

there  are  those which are of specific value  to  individual

units  or blocks.  This lies somewhere in between and I think

we have to make some pragmatic choices in this regard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do have one concern for the Minister to address, ie,

how  do  we safeguard against frivolous proposals with regard

to these special upgrading works?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of lifts on every floor is a serious

matter.   With an ageing population, the need is obvious  and

we  ought to make our best effort to deliver this.   But  one

can imagine that there might be other less important and more

frivolous  requests coming from a sub-set of residents  in  a

particular  block.   How does the HDB  and  the  Ministry  of

National Development propose to deal with this?  Should there

be  some  form  of  criteria, at least  requiring  a  certain

minimum  percentage or proportion of units in a block  to  be

beneficiaries of a project before it can be considered  under

this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>



special provision, or should it be confined to certain  types

of  works?   I know the Minister has considerable  discretion

based  on  the way the Bill is worded, but I would appreciate

it if he could shed some light on how these safeguards can be

put in place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the

debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to commend the Minister for

introducing  the  Bill to amend the Housing  and  Development

Act.   It  is  indeed very important that the HDB looks  very

seriously  at the estates which have more elderly population.

Those  would  be the estates that are going to  benefit  very

much from the special upgrading works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Minister would appreciate, when residents

first  moved  to these estates, they had very  little  choice

because  the flats were balloted and many of these flats  are

about  30  years  old  which require  a  good  face-lift  and

upgrading.   Many  of the old flats would be benefiting  from

the Main Upgrading Programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the design issue, many of these

residents  have very little hand in the design  because  they

are  designed  by architects.  When these flats   were  first

conceived in the planning stage, they were thinking of a very

vibrant  and  young population that never ages.   That  is  a

serious problem and many of these places have aged today.   I

am  glad that the Minister, being the Chairman of the  Inter-Ministerial Committee, has realised that there is a  need  to

really provide accessibility to the ageing population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what will happen is the problem of affordability.

In  many of these old estates, there are the retirees and the

elderly who are not fully employed and many of them have  low

income.   I feel that it is going to be a serious problem  if

they  are  unable to take advantage of the special  upgrading

works.  It will be a pity that we have a very good objective,

but  this objective remains on paper and may not be achieved.

That  is  my basic concern.  Knowing that more than  half  of

them are going to be retirees



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>



with  very  little  income, I would say that  with  the  very

exorbitant  payment  for  lift upgrading,  it  will  be  very

difficult for the residents to take advantage of it.  It will

be  a  tremendous pity that many of them may have to struggle

and manage to find access to their flat in the near future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is important is to make it really affordable.

The question is: how affordable is affordable?  Many of these

residents are going to appreciate what the Minister  will  do

because  each time they press the button, they will  remember

the  Minister for enabling them to get access.  If the prices

are  expensive,  each time they press the  button,  they  are

going to be very sorry.  They may press the wrong button  and

it may never get to his notice.  They will be remembering him

for  life  too if they cannot really find access.   The  real

question is the question of affordability.  The HDB is one of

the  prime movers in making estates accessible.  The Ministry

has  a building code which I am sure HDB was one of the prime

movers   in   proposing  this  to  make  estates  accessible.

Building codes ensure that buildings are accessible.  I think

the  onus  is  on  HDB  to  ensure  that  the  buildings  are

accessible.  These are common user properties.  Being  common

user  properties, it is obviously the role of HDB  to  ensure

that  these  buildings are accessible to  residents,  whether

they  are disabled or elderly.  Realising that a large number

of  them  are going to be the elderly population,  they  will

thank   the   Minister  if  he  takes  their  interest   into

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest a very low co-payment that will make it

really  affordable, and there is no need for a second  ballot

because many of these estates have already undergone the  MUP

itself.  It is the public and social responsibility of HDB to

ensure  that many of these flats, particularly the  segmented

blocks where there is a large number of growing elderly, will

benefit from the changes that are going to be introduced.   I

hope  the  Minister will ensure that the charges  are  really

within the means of the elderly retirees who have very little

income.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I thank all the Members who have

supported this Bill.  I do not think anybody has objected  in

principle  to the idea of having special upgrading  works  in

order  to  give  the  HDB  more flexibility  to  improve  the

upgrading  package.  However, the Members have  made  several

very important points which I would like to address.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the question of why selective polling and

whether  it will destroy the concept of community  living  or

collective responsibility, as Dr Teo Ho Pin and other Members

mentioned  just  now.  It is an important point  because  the

concept  of  collective responsibility,  of  sharing  in  the

maintenance  and the cost of upgrading of common  properties,

is an important pillar of communal living in HDB estates.  So

whether  or  not  they  use  the  playground  or  the  Senior

Citizens' Corner, or even the linkways,  they pay their share

of  the  cost  of upgrading and of maintaining  these  common

facilities.   Indeed,  this  is the  case  for  the  standard

package of the Main Upgrading Programme.  It includes many of

the  items that were mentioned by the Members, booster pumps,

Senior  Citizens' Corners, linkways, playgrounds,  etc.   But

that  is  the standard package.  Some of the items  that  are

desired  by  residents  may not be in the  standard  package.

They  are  outside the scope of the standard package  of  the

MUP.  This  is the reason why the Ministry and  the  HDB,  in

response  to  many  of  these requests,  came  up  with  this

particular amendment to the Bill to introduce what is  called

"special  upgrading works" in order to give the  HDB  greater

flexibility to do more, in addition to what is being done  in

the standard package and in the space-adding items, ie, to do

more for residents during the Main Upgrading Programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the common requests on the wish-list of Members

of Parliament is lift upgrading for those blocks which do not

meet the HDB lift upgrading criteria.  Right now, such blocks

would not have their lifts upgraded.  The reason why this  is

so,  we  have  discussed  in this  House  many  times.   Lift

upgrading is an extremely expensive exercise.  As Mr  Iswaran

pointed  out  just now, to install a new lift shaft  and  new

lifts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



can  cost  anything between $500,000 and $1 million or  more.

When  we  are talking about lift upgrading for these  special

blocks,  those Members who are familiar with the  issue,  who

have  such  blocks  in  their constituencies,  the  so-called

segmented blocks, would appreciate the exercise.  We are  not

talking of just installing one or two additional lift shafts.

We  can be talking about three or even more lift shafts.   If

we  are talking about three lift shafts, we are talking about

$3   million  and  dividing  this  across,  say,  70  or  100

residents.  That is a lot of money.  We are not just  talking

about  one  or  two  blocks.  We are  really  talking  about,

throughout  the  whole of Singapore, something  like  900  to

1,000  blocks. These are the blocks of flats which were built

before  1990  and which were built with this special  design.

They  were  popular at that time because there was a  certain

degree  of privacy involved in these blocks and quite  a  few

residents actually opted for these blocks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be that as it may, there are many of these blocks

around.  They do not meet the lift upgrading criteria set  by

HDB.   These criteria are put in place in order to make  sure

that in embarking on the lift upgrading exercise, there is  a

certain financial discipline involved.  As it is already, the

HDB  has undertaken under the Main Upgrading Programme in the

standard  package to upgrade all those blocks which  do  meet

the  lift  upgrading criteria.  Here, we  are  talking  about

something like 3,000 over blocks.  As we progress in the Main

Upgrading  Programme,  the lifts will  be  upgraded  to  give

direct  lift  access to the residents in these 3,000  blocks.

So  we are coming back to the issue of what do we do with the

segmented  blocks.  We all know it is an extremely  expensive

exercise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time we also realise that the issue of

mobility  for  the aged is a real problem.  The  IMC  on  the

Ageing  Population has made this recommendation, as  Mr  Seng

pointed out, that the HDB should retrofit its blocks in order

to make sure that the aged can grow old graciously in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>



situ,  in  other words, to remain where they are in the  flat

and not have to move out.  HDB, in fact, has already embarked

on  such  an  exercise to retrofit most if  not  all  of  the

blocks.   As I explained before, there is a certain financial

constraint  involved  in trying to upgrade  all  the  blocks.

There  is  a certain financial discipline that they  have  to

observe,  and  this  upgrading  programme  must  comply  with

certain criteria.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the purpose of this particular Amendment Bill really

is  to  give HDB that flexibility to do more, over and  above

what  is  currently being done under the standard package  of

the  MUP.   It allows residents, in consultation  with  their

Members  of Parliament, if they really desire such additional

works,  to vote for these special works, like lift upgrading,

and  by  so  doing,  to  signal  their  intention  and  their

agreement to co-pay part of that cost.  In other words,  this

is an additional option for them.  We are not taking anything

away.  We are saying, "Look, if you really feel that this  is

necessary,  then  here is another choice  for  you,  here  is

another option."  And then once we get past that hurdle,  the

next thing we need to do is to work out the mechanics of  it,

such  as  how  do we decide whether to proceed or  not,  what

constitutes  majority vote, how do we decide  that  there  is

this very strong endorsement, and so on and so forth.  So  we

have   for  want  of  a  better  percentage  taken  the  same

percentage that we do for the other polling exercises that we

conduct for upgrading programmes.  We use 75% yes vote as  an

indication of strong support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have asked why should they pay in the first

place.   Mr Ang Mong Seng gave several reasons why it is  not

fair  to  get  the residents to pay, that it  should  be  the

Government  that should be paying for it.  I  think,  in  the

first place, the upgrading package under the MUP is already a

very  generous package.  There is a budget per flat for  MUP.

The  budget ranges from $40,000 to $60,000 per flat for  MUP,

depending  on  whether there is a space-adding item  or  not.

And  this  budget  of $40,000 to $60,000 per  flat  allows  a

certain amount of work to be done.  There is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



certain  list of works that is required to be done under  the

standard package - precinct works, block works, and even some

works  within  the flat.  At the last Budget  debate,  I  had

announced  the  revised budget for MUP  which  involves  more

works  within the flat.  But the total budget is  a  generous

one,  and  the  co-payment by the residents is minimal.   The

value that they get is very much more than what they pay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this Bill is not about increasing the MUP budget. It

is  about giving the residents more options during their MUP.

It  is  in  a  way  a bonus for those residents  who  benefit

directly  from  the  works.  If we  are  talking  about  lift

upgrading for segmented flats, as Mr Iswaran will be able  to

tell  you,  not every resident is going to benefit  from  it.

The  lifts  are already there.  They do stop at some  of  the

floors.  If we were to ask the residents who already  have  a

lift  that stops on their floor, whether they would  like  to

vote  yes for the lift upgrading, I think the answer is quite

obvious.   So really it is a bonus for residents who  do  not

have  this benefit today but who will be benefiting  directly

from such works.  Therefore, on the basis of fairness, on the

principle  of equity, it is the residents who are  benefiting

directly  who  should  be  co-sharing  this  cost  with   the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of this, as I have explained earlier, these works

do not come cheap.  They are expensive.  And I think it is  a

very  good  test  of whether you really need  such  upgrading

works  to be carried out if you are also required to  co-pay.

If  we  were to go around and say, "Look, this is free, would

you  like to have it, I do not think we would be here in this

House  debating  this issue today."  And I think  such  manna

from  heaven, as the Member has suggested just now, does  not

come  very  often.  The fact remains that this is a necessity

for  many  residents.   I think we all recognise  that,  many

Members  of Parliament also recognise that.  So,  how  do  we

within  the existing budget, within the amount of  the  money

that  has  been  allocated for upgrading, try to  accommodate

such  requests?  In the first place, should we have  such  an

additional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>



option?  The answer is yes, I think we should.  In the second

place, how do we work it, how do we make it happen in such  a

way  that there is equity?  This is where we have a selective

polling  and  the requirement for those who benefit  directly

and who vote yes, pay for it.  And the Government on its part

will also allocate part of its MUP budget for the purpose  of

embarking on these selective upgrading works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong, and I think Dr Vasoo also, asked

whether the cost of sharing will be affordable.  Will  it  be

too  high,  therefore making it an academic exercise,  as  it

were?   I  mean, what is the point if they cannot afford?   I

have two points to make here in response to the Members.  The

first  point is that we will have a fair co-payment  formula.

What  that co-payment formula will be must vary from  project

to  project, and it depends on the type of work that is going

to be undertaken.  So I cannot at this point in time tell the

Members what that particular percentage will be.  But we will

make  it  a point that it will be a fair percentage  and  the

Government's  share will be the majority share.   What  about

those who cannot afford to pay?  I think what the Members can

do  is  to inform these residents who are either not working,

who  are retired, or who are low-income families, that  there

are  schemes  available in the upgrading package  which  will

allow them either to defer their payment for up to a year  or

even  longer  to stretch their repayments, or even  to  avail

themselves of schemes whereby they do not have to pay upfront

at  all, if they can demonstrate that it is not within  their

capacity  to pay, but to pay only at the end when  they  sell

off their flats, if they were to sell off their flats.  So it

is  really  a deferred payment scheme.  But, of course,  such

schemes  are  not  available  to  all,  only  for  those  who

demonstrate that they cannot afford.  So we will  make  it  a

point to make sure that those who cannot afford will be given

assistance  and  in such a way that they will  not  lose  the

opportunity  to benefit from this scheme.  And we  will  make

sure that it is not an academic exercise.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran also asked about frivolous proposals, what

happens  if some residents were to come up and say that  they

want something to be done, which he would consider frivolous.

I think I would entrust this responsibility to the Members of

Parliament.   If  they  feel  that  the  proposal  is   worth

considering and they bring it up to my Ministry, I would take

it that it has passed the test of the Members of Parliament's

scrutiny and therefore it cannot be frivolous.  Anything that

comes  up  to the Ministry is not frivolous.  But  if  it  is

frivolous, then I do not expect it to come up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I would like to address is Mr Tay Beng

Chuan's  point about the home office.  I think  he  may  have

been  mistaken because the amendments do not allow HDB  flats

to   be   used  for  any  commercial  purpose.    Under   the

Technopreneur Home Office scheme, it requires the business to

register  with NSTB to meet certain criteria in order  to  be

allowed  to register their office in an HDB flat.   This,  of

course,  is different from using the HDB flat for businesses.

I  think  we  know that many people use their  HDB  flats  to

conduct  small  businesses.  Some do sewing;  some  do  other

work, like making boxes and so on.  There are also others who

use  their flats for drafting, like some architects  who  use

their flats for doing their work at home, and many people, of

course, who telecommute, work from home.  So that is quite in

order.  So long as they do it without creating a nuisance  to

their  neighbours,  HDB does not have any rules  against  it.

But   what  the  THO  scheme  does  is  that  it  allows  the

entrepreneur to register his office address as his HDB  flat.

That  is the special requirement or special dispensation that

is   being  given  to  these  start-up  companies.   So  this

Amendment  Bill does not actually open up the scheme  to  all

commercial  enterprises but only to those registered  by  the

NSTB  under the THO scheme.  But having said that, of course,

we  will continue to monitor the scheme on an on-going basis,

and  if  it does not create any disamenities, I see no reason

why we cannot extend the scheme later on.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay also made several other points. I think the

general point he made was that HDB should actively revise and

relax  out-dated rules and regulations.  I do  not  think  it

would  be  a  fair  statement to say  that  HDB's  rules  and

regulations  are  so  stringent as to  stifle  creativity  or

innovation.   In  fact, I wonder whether the rules  that  are

enacted  by,  say,  the  management corporations  of  private

estates, are not as rigorous, if not more so.  For example, I

know  that there are many management corporations who do  not

allow  the flat owners within their estate to renovate  their

flats, to change their windows or to do other things of  that

nature,  because  it  may mar the general  outlook  of  those

particular  blocks.   I  think it would  be  too  sweeping  a

statement  to say that HDB's rules and regulations are  over-stifling.   Take  the three examples that he  mentioned,  for

example, parking rules.  Why are there parking rules, why can

HDB  not  encourage friends and relatives to visit  by,  say,

waiving  fees?  This, indeed, is being done.   I  think  most

Members  of Parliament who have made a request on  behalf  of

their   residents  will  find  that  HDB   has   been   quite

accommodating in this respect.  But there is a certain limit.

There are certain times and certain areas where the answer is

no,  and  the  answer  is  no simply  because  the  residents

themselves object.  Why?  Because if it so happens that their

block  is next to a neighbourhood centre, on Sunday, all  the

customers  of the shops would come and park their cars  there

and  shop, and instead of having friends and relatives coming

to  visit  them,  it would actually be free parking  for  the

benefit of the shops in the area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Members of Parliament put this proposal up, they

know   that,  on  the  ground,  there  are  certain  problems

associated with just opening it up completely.  That  is  the

reason why in some areas there is free parking and some other

areas, there is not.  So HDB has been accommodating and  will

continue  to  be  accommodating in such instances.   But  for

every   rule   that  they  change,  while  that  benefit   is

appreciated  by  one group, at the same time,  another  group

would be quite against it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On flower boxes and other safety features, HDB informed

me,  when I was looking at the killer litter issue, that they

in  fact  did  incorporate flower troughs in  the  design  of

several  blocks  of  flats in Pasir Ris  and  Queenstown.   I

believe  that was about five years ago.  It was  one  of  the

design  innovations that HDB embarks upon on a regular basis,

arising again out of requests by some residents who say  that

they  would like to plant flowers.  But five years  down  the

road,  they have gone back to revisit the situation and  they

find  that, lo and behold, instead of flowers in the troughs,

you  have all sorts of other stuff in the troughs.  So it  is

being  used for rubbish disposal, for storage, for  anything,

but  putting  flowers.  So another well-meaning gesture  goes

down  the drain.  I do not think we should go and start  this

process  all  over again.  But what really worried  me  about

that  particular design innovation was not so much  the  fact

that they were using it to put rubbish, but that it could  be

a receptacle for breeding mosquitoes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of dengue fever and breeding of Aedes

mosquitoes is still a big problem for high rise estates,  and

it  has  not  disappeared.  It is still  there.   People  are

careless,  people are either ignorant or they just could  not

care  less.   But the Environment Ministry still  has  to  go

around  putting  pressure on town councils  to  keep  chasing

residents  to  make  sure that they do not breed  mosquitoes.

And dengue fever is not a laughing matter.  Every year, there

are  people  who  die from dengue fever and  there  are  many

others who suffer from dengue fever and get very ill.   So  I

have  told HDB that if they solve the problem, make sure that

they do not create other problems.  When people suggest these

things,  it may appear reasonable at first glance, but  there

are  many other implications involved, which I think need  to

be thought through carefully before we implement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there was one last point he made about whether,

in  the  special upgrading works, we are going to  compensate

them if an acquisition is involved.  The answer categorically

is no.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>



The  special  upgrading works do not involve any acquisition.

It is just a matter of lift upgrading or other types of works

which  would require selective groups of residents  to  vote.

There is no question about Government acquiring the flats for

any purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I think I have answered all the questions

that  have  been raised.  I thank the Members once again  for

their support.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, may I be allowed to clarify two

points  with the Minister?  What is the rationale for  making

the town councils pay for the special upgrading works?  Under

the  statutory duties of the Town Councils, we are only asked

to  maintain  the common property.  Sir, in the case  of  the

opposition  town councils, we do not receive  any  CIPC  fund

and,  if  we  are made to pay more contributions through  all

these  upgrading works, we will be at a disadvantage compared

to the PAP-controlled town councils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that I would like to raise with the

Minister is that, at first, I was quite elated that they  are

going  to  allow HDB flats to be used for business  purposes.

But  now,  as  it  is,  it is only confined  to  IT  start-up

companies.   Sir,  I  am wondering whether  the  Minister  is

willing  to expand this usage of HDB flats to other  business

activities  as  long as they do not create a nuisance.   Sir,

80%  or more of Singaporeans are living in HDB flats.  At the

moment,  all  these  flats are only for residential  purposes

and,  as  such, they are only used for consumption.   If  you

allow them to be used for other business purposes, they  will

be  converted  to productive use.  Our national income  would

increase  significantly if these flats  were  allowed  to  be

converted  for business use as long as they do not  create  a

nuisance.  Like in Hong Kong and other places, they have been

used  for  making  artificial flowers,  assembling  of  wrist

watches and taking parts from the government factories to  do

them at home.  There are so many uses which are being carried

out.  It will be beneficial to Singapore economically.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Let me take the easy one first. Mr

Chiam  is under the wrong impression that town councils  have

to pay for the special upgrading works.  No, they do not have

to  pay.  The special upgrading works are special works which

are  over and above the existing standard package of the MUP.

Town councils are not involved in this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the THO scheme is concerned, whether it should

be expanded to other activities, in my answer just now, I did

allude  to  the  fact that this is already being  done.   HDB

allows  for  other activities, like allowing people  to  work

from  home  if  they are using their phone,  fax  and  modem,

whether  they are architects or whether they are draughtsmen,

that  is  perfectly all right.  And indeed,  there  are  many

other activities that are carried out in the HDB flats which,

so  long  as  they do not cause nuisance to their neighbours,

are not disallowed.  If you go around your block visits, from

time  to  time, you will come across homes where  they  bring

back work to do, whether it is sewing, or other small cottage

type industries to assembly at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



home.  That is already practised and HDB does not say  no  to

that.   The only distinction that they make is that when  you

indulge in such activities, you do not cause nuisance to your

neighbours.  If your neighbours find that you are operating a

factory  in your flat, no matter how productive they are,  we

will come down on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.
