<div align="center"><b>AND SINGAPORE GOVERNMENTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ON FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>RELATING TO PAPER CMD. 33 of 1961</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> asked the Prime Minister

whether  he will make a statement on the talks,  to

date,  between  the Federation of  Malaya  and  the

Singapore Governments on the financial arrangements

relating to Head 17 (Finance) of Paper Cmd.  33  of

1961.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  will make  a  statement  on  the

progress  of negotiations relating to the financial

arrangements between Singapore and the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee of Officials of the Singapore and

Federation Governments reached no agreement on  two

matters:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The apportionment of expenditure and the

quantum of Singapore's contribution for Federal

expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Responsibility for collection of national

taxes in Singapore after merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, these and other unresolved matters

were referred to the plenary sessions of the Inter-Governmental Committee which to date has held  nine

sessions.  The  first  session  was  on  the   28th

February,  1963,  convened at the instance  of  the

Federation  Government to discuss these  unresolved

matters. On the 21st March, the plenary session  of

the  Inter-Governmental  Committee  met  again   to

discuss  a  memorandum forwarded to  the  Singapore

side on the 18th March setting out the proposals of

the  Federation  Government. The main  features  of

this memorandum are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Provisional actual expenditure incurred in

Singapore  in  the  year  1962  is  classified

according to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>



whether  it  is State or Federal  expenditure

according  to  the  interpretation   of   the

Federation Government of the White Paper Cmd.

33 of 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Similarly, revenues are classified as

State  or  Federal  in accordance  with  the

interpretation of the Federation Government of

White Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The Federation Government proposed that

Singapore  should bear 21.2 per cent  of  certain

common Pan-Malaysian expenditure such as defence,

internal  security, external affairs, Parliament,

etc. This percentage was based on the average  of

the  1961 actual revenue and the 1962 provisional

actual   revenues  collected  in  each   of   the

territories to comprise Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Since Singapore's revenue from State taxes,

as defined  in  the  Tenth  Schedule  o  the

Federation  Constitution, will  be  inadequate

to meet   local   State   expenditure   plus

Singapore's   contribution  for  common   Pan-Malaysian  services, as well as  the  cost  of

Federal   departments   in   Singapore,    the

Federation  Government proposed  that  certain

revenues  be assigned to the State  to  enable

Singapore  to  meet  her obligations  in  both

these respects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the above proposals will be that

Singapore's  revenue surplus, in other  words,  the

whole  of the balance between revenue collected  in

Singapore,  on both national and State  taxes  over

Singapore's expenditure for both State and  Federal

departments will go to the Federation Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government objected to this scheme

on the following grounds:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The figures used for computing Singapore's

State   expenditure   were   based   on    the

provisional   actual   expenditure   in   1962

whereas   the   cost  of  Federation   defence

services is based on projections as far  ahead

as  1970. Even expenditure outside the  fields

of defence and internal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>



security  of the Central Government  has  been

raised by varying percentages representing the

expected increase in future expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The percentage of Singapore's contribution for

common Pan-Malaysian expenditure, assessed at 21.2

per cent was too high. The percentage, in our view,

should  have  regard to two factors,  namely

representation in the Central Parliament and

population, and not just capacity to pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The whole of Singapore's surplus based on

1962 calculations goes to the Federal Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreement had already been reached on the 1st

March,  1963, on the initial disposal  of  national

taxes collected in Singapore. The proceeds would go

neither   to  the  Singapore  nor  to  the  Federal

Consolidated Fund but to an account to be opened in

the Singapore branch of the Central Bank. The money

collected  must  physically  be  in  Singapore.  No

disbursement from the fund would be made until  the

apportionment between the two Governments has  been

agreed  to  as to Singapore's contribution  to  the

Central Government for Federal services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government then proposed a scheme

which  was  embodied in a paper  submitted  to  the

Inter-Governmental Committee for  consideration  at

its  meeting  on  the  2nd  April,  1963,  held  in

Singapore.  The main outline of the scheme  was  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Singapore's contribution for Pan-Malaysian

services  should  be  based on actual  expenditure

and  not  projected expenditure. The  contribution

in   the   first  instance  should  be  based   on

estimates  passed  by  the Federal  Parliament  in

respect  of these common Pan-Malaysian expenditure

and  should  be  adjusted  after  the  Accountant-General  has  submitted  his  accounts  of  actual

expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Capital expenditure on defence and internal

security  should be financed partly  from  revenue

and partly from loans.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The percentage of Singapore's

contribution  should be based  on  three  factors,

namely,    its   representation   in   Parliament,

population and economic growth through Time.  This

percentage  will increase in accordance  with  the

growth of industry in Singapore determined by  the

annual   census  of  production  carried  out   in

Singapore   since  1960.  The  percentage   should

initially  be below the proportion of  Singapore's

population  to total Pan-Malaysian population  and

eventually rise beyond it, to the extent  that  it

falls short of it in the initial year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation Government objected to Singapore's

proposals on the following grounds:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the contribution for Pan-Malaysian defence

and internal security expenditure was far too low.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) there would be troublesome accounting

difficulties which may lead to acrimonious  annual

disputes over the quantum of contribution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the Federation Government would be put

into an invidious position of having its financial

accounts scrutinised by a State Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) the surplus of the Singapore Government was

not   shared  and  made  available  to  the  other

territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tun Razak, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Federation, then discussed the matter informally with myself and the Minister for Finance and stressed that the expenditure approach must be abandoned by the Singapore Government if any progress was to be made in these discussions. The contribution must be assessed in terms of

percentage  of national taxes arising in  Singapore

and  this  percentage could be subject to  periodic

review to ensure fairness to both sides.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation Government then submitted an

amended  scheme.  This approach is  identical  with

that  to  the  first scheme, but  it  contains  two

concessions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>



First,  defence and internal security  contribution

by  Singapore was reduced from $93.6 million to $75

million  a year. Next, Singapore retains  half  her

surplus,  based  on 1961 calculations,  instead  of

surrendering the whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposals of the Federation Government were

then  discussed at plenary sessions of  the  Inter-Governmental  Committee on  10th  and  11th  April,

1963.  The  Singapore Government, at this  meeting,

accepted that Singapore's contribution need not  be

rigidly   related  to  actual  Federal  expenditure

incurred   and  we  attempted  to  work   out   the

apportionment pf national taxes between Singapore's

contribution  for  the  cost  of  common  Malaysian

services  and  the cost of Federal  departments  in

Singapore  and  Singapore's State expenditure.  The

gap between the estimates of the two Governments of

the  cost  of Federal departments in Singapore  was

narrowed  down  to $8.7 million.  This  is  due  to

differing interpretations of the White Paper on the

responsibility  of three Departments -  Income  Tax,

Customs and Broadcasting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of $75 million for defence and

internal security expenditure was accepted  subject

to a consideration of the following factors:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) British contribution to defence expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Details of the defence and internal

security   expansion  programme  have   not   been

examined by the Singapore Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Capital cost of defence and internal

security  expenditure  which  may  amount  to  $18

million  out  of  $75  million  would  be  met  by

capital  transfers  from  Singapore's  Development

Fund to Federation Development Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The percentage agreed upon should be

reviewed  periodically for the first five  or  six

years   until   defence  and   internal   security

expenditures have stabilised themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards non-defence expenditure, such as

External Affairs, Parliament, the Civil List, etc.,

this  constitutes  a small part of  the  total  and

could be settled



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>



without difficulty. We have agreed in deference  to

the    Federation   Government's   approach    that

expenditure  on  these  Federal  services,   except

defence  and  security, would  not  be  subject  to

scrutiny  of actual expenditure. We were,  however,

unable  to do so for defence and internal  security

expenditure,   because   future   expenditure   was

unpredictable  and  periodic  reviews,  which   the

Federation  Government  had  agreed,  would  ensure

fairness to both sides.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation Government had indicated that it

is not prepared to meet any prospective deficits in

Singapore's  Budget. Accordingly, Singapore's  view

is  that there is no case for surpluses to be  paid

into  the  Federal  Treasury. If  the  question  of

sharing  surpluses computed on the  basis  of  1961

figures   were   not  pursued  by  the   Federation

Government,   the   difference  between   Singapore

calculations   and   the  Federation   calculations

becomes very narrow indeed. The gap amounts  to  no

more than $13.7 million, or about four per cent  of

what  we estimate national taxes in Singapore  will

yield in 1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had also offered to amend our laws to allow

the Federal Minister of Finance sufficient scrutiny

over Singapore's tax collection machinery to ensure

that the collection of taxes, including Income  Tax

and   Customs,  was  carried  out  efficiently  and

effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two elements which have a bearing on

Singapore's   financial   contribution    to    the

Federation.  The first consists in  the  accounting

approach,  and  the  purpose  is  to  forecast,  as

accurately  as possible with the figures  at  hand,

what  would  be the cost of Pan-Malaysian  services

and  of  Federal  services in Singapore  from  1964

onwards.  On  the  basis of this forecast,  we  can

agree   on  the  apportionment  of  national  taxes

collected in Singapore for Singapore's contribution

to the Central Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second element consists of sharing

Singapore's   prosperity   after   Malaysia.    The

financial talks have run into difficulties  because

the  Federation Government wants to introduce  this

element  into the apportionment ratio,  taking  the

1961 surplus as the yardstick of prosperity. Whilst

we  agree  that  prosperity in Malaysia  should  be

shared all round, we have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>



been unable to agree to this particular formula. It

is   the   additional  prosperity   consequent   on

Singapore's  entry  into Malaysia  that  should  be

shared,  not  its  past prosperity  based  on  1961

figures  when  it  was not part of the  Federation.

Should   for  instance,  Singapore  prosper   under

Malaysia  with the advent of a Common Market,  then

we  must share this prosperity with the rest of the

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A meeting was held informally on Wednesday, 29th

May,  in  Kuala Lumpur. It was agreed in  principle

that   a   Common  Market  should  be   established

throughout Malaysia. This agreement will  pave  the

way  for a settlement of the financial arrangements

between  the  Federation of Malaya  and  Singapore.

Singapore's  progressive  entry  into  the   Common

Market must necessarily mean the gradual erosion of

its free port status as Malaysia industrialises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further informal meeting was held on Tuesday,

4th  June,  in  Kuala Lumpur.  On  the  basis  that

satisfactory  arrangements will  be  made  for  the

establishment  of  a  Common Market  including  the

setting up of a Tariff Board under a chairman to be

nominated   jointly  by  the  two  Governments   by

Malaysia  Day, we have agreed to consider that  the

Singapore   Government   should   pay   a   certain

percentage  of  our national taxes to  the  Central

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government is also being asked to

pay by way of grant a sum of $50 million during the

first   five  years  of  Malaysia  for  development

expenditure  of  the  under-developed   States   of

Malaysia, namely, the Borneo territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Finance is at the moment carefully

going  through  these proposals, in particular  the

percentage  figures, and a reply will be  given  to

the Federation Government this week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have set out only the main outline of the course

of  discussions. When final agreement  is  reached,

all  details  will  be  published  for  debate  and

adoption in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, may I say that the rationale for

the arrangements in regard to Singapore lies in the

fact  that  there will not, in fact, be a  complete

merger  on  the basis of one of the present  eleven

States of the Federation. Had there been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>



complete  merger  as advocated by some  Parties  in

Singapore,  like  the Barisan  Sosialis,  then  the

whole  of  Singapore's revenues  from  Income  Tax,

Customs, vehicle taxes and others will logically be

surrendered to the Central Government.  This  means

that  we  give up more than three-quarters  of  our

total  revenue  instead of only  about  one-quarter

under the White Paper terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the White Paper, the usual

arrangements which are suitable in the case of  the

other  States  in the Federation do  not  apply  to

Singapore.  The  special position of  Singapore  is

also  shown  by the fact that it has been  allotted

only  15  seats  in  the House of  Representatives,

which  is  below  the number it is entitled  to  if

there  was  complete merger. Within the  limits  of

this  position, we have tried and will continue  to

try  to  work  out  a  fair formula  to  share  our

prosperity consequent on the formation of a  Common

Market for Malaysia. Needless to say, if the Common

Market  terms are inequitable in their  application

as  between industries in the Federation of  Malaya

and Singapore, then the whole basis of contribution

to the Central Government must be altered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the Order Paper I notice there is a motion standing in the names of the Member for Cairnhill and the Member for Tanglin. There are approximately ten minutes to go before we have, under Standing Orders, to move on to the discussion of the Development Estimates. With the

concurrence  of  the  House, I would  suggest  that

since this is a matter of some importance and since

it  has  been raised not only by way of a  question

but  also by way of a motion, perhaps we could,  at

the end of the debate on the Development Estimates,

take the motion standing in the names of the Member

for  Cairnhill and the Member for Tanglin.  In  the

course  of that debate I would be able to give  any

such  further  information as  Members  would  deem

proper or necessary for a proper discussion on this

matter.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On the suggestion made by the Prime

Minister,  the  relevant Standing  Order  would  be

Standing Order 10, paragraph (2) . The Leader of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>



the  House  could move a motion to the effect  that

item No. 20 on the Order Paper be taken immediately

after  item  I  on  the Order Paper.  That  is,  of

course,  after  the disposal of questions  and  the

Development Estimates. Perhaps Members  would  like

to ask questions on the statement first.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like to ask a supplementary question  before

we come to that issue.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged. Mr Speaker, I

would  inquire from the Prime Minister  whether  he

does  not think it more appropriate that we  should

have a White Paper? Would he consider publishing  a

White Paper together with the memoranda referred to

by  him, and particularly, Sir, in view of the very

grave connotations to that statement of his, that a

common  market has been agreed upon,  which  rather

suggests  not a common market, Sir, but  a  Customs

Union; and whether he would also publish the  Rueff

Report  for which we have been anxiously  awaiting,

so  that  we  should  be in a  position  with  some

responsibility and seriousness to consider a matter

gravely  affecting our future.  It  should  not  be

taken so hurriedly, Sir. This is a matter for study

and  I  would  urge the Prime Minister to  indicate

whether he would consider the urgent publication of

a White Paper with the memoranda and the details he

has  given, and other details that might  help  us,

together with the Rueff Report.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> At some stage or other, either

when negotiations are successfully concluded or are

unable to he resolved, then all the memoranda  that

had  been  put in stating in detail the  respective

stands  of  the  two Governments will  have  to  be

published together with the Rueff Report. It is  my

considered  opinion that publication at this  stage

would  not  help the course of negotiations  as  it

would  tend  to harden attitudes on both  sides.  I

have  made this statement because a Member  of  the

Alliance Party has requested me to do so.  I  would

not otherwise have thought



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>



it  appropriate at this juncture when we are  still

closely  scrutinising the detailed proposals  which

we  received last week, but since a member  of  the

Singapore  Branch of the Federation  Alliance,  the

Member   for   Cairnhill,  has  made  some   rather

disparaging remarks about my not being prepared  to

answer   these   questions,  he   has,   in   fact,

unwittingly brought these issues into the light  of

day. I would have preferred to allow his principals

in  Kuala  Lumpur more freedom for  discussion  and

negotiations.  I  have  deliberately  slurred  over

certain  parts of the immediate proposals  that  we

are  considering in order to give a certain  degree

of  flexibility  of approach. I hope  "flexibility"

would  be  an  appropriate  word  for  both  sides,

because   of  this  new  element  that  they   have

introduced  into  the discussions - the  question  of

Singapore's prosperity being shared with  the  rest

of  Malaysia. I say the House can have my assurance

that we will not move, and in fact we have no right

to  move,  from the terms of the White Paper  which

had been voted upon by the people, unless there  is

definitely a quid pro quo. If we are asked to  give

something more than what we had agreed to give  and

what  they had agreed to accept, then obviously  we

must  in  return have some benefit arising  out  of

Malaysia, and I was glad on the 29th of last  month

we   reached  agreement  on  a  common  market   in

principle.  The  detailed  recommendations  of  the

Common Market are contained in the Rueff Report. It

will have to be gone through by the officials.  But

I  can  assure  the Member for Anson  that  nothing

would   give  me  more  pleasure  eventually   when

negotiations have been successfully concluded  than

to  publish them in toto, and I think he, and  even

more so the merchants who have built a valuable and

lucrative trade over the years on the basis of  our

free  port,  will have a great interest  in  seeing

that all this does not disappear in the chase of  a

will-o'-the-wisp for a common market.  I  think  he

can  take the assurance of my Minister for Finance,

who  has met these merchants, that there is no such

sudden disappearance of our free port at all  under

contemplation.  I have given an indication  of  the

common  market proposals when I said  that  by  the

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Prime  Minister felt that it was inappropriate

to  disclose the terms of the discussions in  Kuala

Lumpur, but because I asked a question he felt that

he    had    to   disclose   what   he   considered

inappropriate.  Would  he consider  it  appropriate

that  he  should go to the Press and start  telling

the  Press all the things he felt he wanted to tell

the  public of Singapore and not this House  first?

Would he consider it appropriate that he should  go

to  the  Press, whereas the question asked in  this

House could be considered as inappropriate?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, I am not saying the

questions are inappropriate, Mr Speaker, Sir.  All

I  said  was  that  I would not  have  chosen  this

particular juncture, but since the matter has  been

raised  by a member of the Singapore Branch of  the

Federation Branch, I felt perhaps they had  thought

it in the public interest that the matter should be

canvassed.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Minister signify the

recommendation of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara before

the  Committee  proceeds with the consideration  of

these Estimates?

do.

page  7 of the Paper. We are to deal with heads  of

expenditure in respect or Which amendments stand on

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D.19 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D.19 he

reduced by $l0 in respect of subhead 2.*



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The same amendment also stood in the name of Dr Thio Chan Bee.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Paper Cmd. 16 of 1963, Head D.19 is

about  the  Multi-storey Car Park.  The  Government

approved the project for this Multi-storey Car Park

in 1961. In 1962, the Government asked the House to

approve a Supplementary revote.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>



In  all these estimates, there was  no  such

provision  as  this  one.  Why  is  it   that   the

Government now intends to ask for $600,000 for this

Multi-storey Car Park in such a great hurry?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we would like the Minister to

tell  us in this House whether or when this  Multi-storey

Car Park can be completed. At the same Time, When will

the capital outlay be recouped?



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

what I am worried about is that greater expenditure

will  have to be involved in order to ensure  rapid

progress. Sir, if a contract has already been  made

for  the  completion of this project by  a  certain

date, then usually for every day's delay after  the

contractual  date,  the contractor  has  to  pay  a

penalty of a certain sum. If that is the case, then

naturally he will have to complete the contract  as

soon  as  possible in order to minimise his losses.

Now  here  the Government is going to ask for  more

contractors to help and get itself involved  in  an

expenditure  of $600,000 more in order  to  achieve

completion  in  February 1964. What  is  the  magic

about  the  date  February 1964 that  requires  the

Government to spend up to $600,000 more.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I can understand

why  the  Members for Yio Chu Kang and Tanglin  are

hotted  up  over  this item. I  myself  was  pretty

hopping  mad and when I came back and I found  this

explanation  given  under Head D.19  - Multi-storey

Car  Park.  I  have  since  made  inquiries  in  my

Ministry and have discovered that actually the  sum

of  $600,000 does not represent an increase  to  be

asked for in this Assembly on account of our desire

to  have  the car park completed in February  1964.

The  sum  of  $1 million was voted to be  spent  in

1962.  However, only $400,000 was spent last  year.

Therefore, the sum of $600,000 as indicated in this

estimate  is  actually a revote. Members  will  see

that it is written down there quite clearly "Multi-storey  Car  Park -Revote - $600,000" which  we  are

asking to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>



spent this year. There is no necessity - in fact,  I

would  be  the last person to come to this Assembly

to ask for a sum of money of this size just to have

the car park completed by that date.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, if this is a revote, it

means that the original situation still holds good.

According to the Four-Year Development Plan of  the

Government,  this  Multi-storey Car  Park  is  just

going  to cost $2 million - a million to be spent  in

1962.  But  because $400,000 was spent,  therefore,

$600,000 more will be required as a revote. But  in

the explanation given to us in this Paper, Sir, the

construction  of this car park is  mentioned  at  a

cost of $2.45 million. Where does the $0.45 million

come  from,  if it is a revote? It just  makes  the

matter more confusing. If it is $2 million, why can

it  not  be mentioned as $2 million? Why should  $2

million become $2.45 million and then we are led to

believe  that  it was an increase on  the  original

cost of the Multi-storey Car Park? According to the

explanation given by the Deputy Prime Minister,  it

is  still  $2  million. Then what is the  point  of

putting in $2.45 million? Somebody must be  making

some mistake somewhere?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, the mistake, if it arises,

is  not on my account. The Member for Cairnhill  is

quite  correct  when he pointed  out  that  another

$450,000  has `been mentioned as the  cost  of  the

Multi-storey  Car  Park. In fact,  Members  of  the

House  will  remember reading in the Press  of  the

delay  which was experienced in building the multi-storey  car  park owing to the extra depth  of  the

piling  which must le made and, in fact,  we  shall

come  later  to  this  Assembly  to  ask  for  this

additional sum of money to compensate for the extra

amount  of piling that will be needed. But  at  the

moment, these estimates are asking simply for a sum

of  $600,000 as a revote, a sum of money which  was

not spent in 1962.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister

admits  that  an extra $450,000 would be  required.

May I ask -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> For piling.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> For piling. As this is the place

where money required for Government expenditure has

to  be  brought  up, and as he knows that  $450,000

extra  would be required for this Multi-storey  Car

Park project, would it not be proper that he should

have asked for the full amount instead of doing  it

piecemeal  -  $600,000 - and   then   coming   back   for

$450,000? I think that is a wrong way of budgeting.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, it is really a matter for

the  Public Works Department to work out  increases

that  are required on the project. Only the sum  of

$600,000  which should have really  been  spent  in

1962   is  being  asked  to  be  revoted  and   the

additional  sum of $450,000 which is  required  for

extra  piling would probably have to  come  up  for

Assembly approval at some later stage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

just  now the Member for Cairnhill has pointed  out

to   the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  that  from  this

estimate it is clear that the Government,  when  it

put  forward  this estimate, did not find  out  how

deep  the  piling has to be. That is why they  have

made this mistake in the estimate. Therefore, since

the   Minister  has  asked  for  another  $600,000,

according to him, this was a revote which  was  not

spent in 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Deputy Prime Minister has not answered my

two  questions  which I raised just  now.  Firstly,

when  will this Multi-storey Car Park be completed,

and  how  long will the Government take to  recover

the  capital  expenditure on this Multi-storey  Car

Park from the receipts from the car park?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The car park is expected to be

completed sometime in 1964. Whether it is going  to

be done in February 1964 or not, I cannot guarantee

because  the  progress of the work must necessarily

be dependent on several factors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second question raised by the

Member for Yio Chu Kang, it has been estimated that

we would recover the cost of the Multi-storey



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



Car Park by renting out the ground floor  as

shops  and also by charging motorists the  cost  of

parking, probably within a space of five years.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> As I understand the

Deputy  Prime Minister, there was a vote  for  this

Head  of  $1  million  for the  1962  Estimates  of

Expenditure.  Now,  in  the  explanation   to   the

Supplementary  Estimates, it is put down  as  $2.45

million,  so  that, in effect, the Government  have

already  spent  $0.45 million more  than  they  had

expected to spend during that year. It would appear

from the Deputy Prime Minister's statement that the

$0.45  million has been incurred on account of  the

extra  piling. If that is correct, then,  I  think,

with due respect to the Deputy Prime Minister, this

House  has  not been given the proper  information,

and  they  should have come to this House then  for

$600,000 plus $0.45 million. Otherwise, it does not

make sense.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> It is a matter of accounting

the  responsibility of which,  of  course,  is  not

mine.  But  it  is  quite  correct  that  we   have

discovered  that the original cost  of  the  multi-storey car park has now exceeded by $450,000. $2.45

million would, therefore, be the revised cost. Now,

presumably when we spend the $2 million  which  had

been  voted for in the 1962 Estimates, the Assembly

will be asked to approve another sum of $450,000.





<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

disagree. It is not a matter of accounting. It is a

matter   of   P.A.P. style  of   misleading   the

Opposition.  $450,000 has already  been  spent,  as

admitted  by  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister.   $0.45

million has already been spent On extra piling, and

yet  that extra cost is paid for out of a vote  for

the whole project. He says that the extra cost need

not he brought to the attention of this House until

the 1964 Estimates come up for discussion. That  is

a way of trying to mislead the Opposition.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> There is no intention to

mislead  the  Opposition. I have placed  the  facts

very  clearly before the House. In fact,  they  can

investigate  the matter more closely in  detail  in

the  Estimates Committee if they so wish. But these

are   the  facts  and  they  are  very  simple   to

understand.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The matter could be referred to the

Estimates Committee.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> All right, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member for Choa Chu Kang

wish for a vote?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Member withdrawing his

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> May I say a few words before I

withdraw my amendment?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): After hearing the

explanation of the Deputy Prime Minister, the $0.45

million  intended as a sum to build  a  skyscraper,

like a multi-storey car park, has now gone down the

drain. Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $600,000 for Head D.19 ordered to stand

part   of   the   First  Supplementary  Development

Estimates of Expenditure for 1963.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D.20 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to he allocated for Head D20 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Government's intention to ask for

$740,000  for rural development projects. According

to the explanation given in the Estimates, they say

that it is for the purpose of "raising the standard

of  living of rural dwellers and assisting them  in

the  improvement  of their production  techniques".

Among  the  schemes proposed by the Government  are

`the  construction of three Veterinary Clinics  and

Extension  Centres, and a Fertilizers and  Mixtures

Supply Service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. have been in office for four years. It

is  the  fourth year now. Over the past four years,

we have never seen the Government doing anything to

help  improve `the agricultural techniques  of  the

farmers,  nor  have they done anything  to  improve

their  standard of living. From these Supplementary

Development   Estimates,  we  can  see   that   the

Government  in  the past four years have  not  been

looking  after the livelihood of the rural  people,

especially the farmers and poultry-keepers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me point out to the

Government that, in fact, this $740,000 should have

been  spent in 1961 but in that year the Government

did  not use this money. Let me quote Paper Cmd.  6

of 1963 - Financial Statements for the Year 1961 - page 191.

The  money  voted  to  be  used  for   Rural

Development Projects in 1961 was $500,000.  But  by

the  end of 1961, the money spent in this field was

$34,000 -  not even $35,000. Therefore, in 1961,  the

Government  had only spent 6 per cent  of  the  sum

voted,  and the balance of about $460,000  has  not

been  touched.  In the 1962 Development  Estimates,

the  Government asked for a vote of  $470,000.  How

much of this sum has been spent? This House has not

received any financial report on this. In 1963, the

Government  have also asked for a sum  of  $200,000

for  rural development projects. The sums voted for

the  two  years  1962 and 1963 total  $670,000  for

rural  development projects. But up to now,  we  do

not  know  how much the Government have spent  from

these  votes. If the Government have  spent  6  per

cent  of the 1961 vote, then we believe they  could

not  have used more than ten per cent of the  total

votes  for 1962 and 1963. Therefore, we can clearly

see  that  from  1961 to 1963 the  Government  have

spent   less  than  $70,000  on  rural  development

projects. That is my calculation. But the  Assembly

has  approved  $1.37 million for rural  development

projects,  and  we can therefore see  clearly  that

during the past three years the Government have not

spent  $1 million to improve the standard of living

of  the  rural  people and to help the  farmers  to

improve their production techniques. And today, the

Government want the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>



Assembly to approve $740,000 for this purpose. This

only  goes  to  show  the false  intention  of  the

Government  because this sum of money  should  have

been  spent during the past three years,  but  they

have not done so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from these figures, we can clearly see that the P.A.P. Government have no intention of improving the livelihood of the rural people. They do not care about the living conditions of the farmers, the bankrupt rural economy, and the reduced prices of eggs. The

Government  are  not  concerned  about  all   these

matters.  It is now 1963. In one year's  Time,  the

P.A.P. will have to face the people's judgment. The

people know -  and the P.A.P. also know - that what the

P.A.P.  Government did in the past will be exposed.

The  coming  year  will also show that  the  P.A.P.

Government  will no longer receive the  support  of

the rural people. That is why the P.A.P. Government

have now come to the Assembly to ask for a vote  of

$740,000  for  rural development projects  for  the

construction  of Veterinary Clinics  and  Extension

Centres,  and  a  Fertilisers and  Mixtures  Supply

Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before the P.A.P. took office, they proposed to the rural people their so-called P.A.P. Development Plan, in which they promised that they would establish co-operatives and all sorts of things to help the rural people, especially the farmers. But so far they have done

nothing  of  this  sort, and  they  still  have  no

intention  of doing anything. The P.A.P. have  not

done  what they had promised to do. This is a  fact

both the P.A.P. and the people know very well.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past four years the rural people have

been very disappointed at what the P.A.P. have done

for   them.  Everywhere  you  can  see  the  people

scolding  the  P.A.P.  Government  for  not  having

improved  their living conditions and helping  them

in  their  agricultural production. They blame  the

P.A.P. Government for having increased their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>



assessments,  taxes and all the other  things.  The

P.A.P. Government cannot shirk their responsibility

for this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, from this vote of $740,000

that is asked of this Assembly, we can see clearly that the P.A.P.

have always been trying  to seek  ways and means to deceive the people,

and  to give  them  the  impression  that  the  P.A.P. are looking

after  them and are taking care  of  their

livelihood   by  trying  to  give  them  veterinary

services,  fertilisers, supplies  and  things  like

that.  But  this sum of money, which was originally

intended to be used for the people, has never  been

used  to the fullest extent by the Government.  Now

the  Government have come to this Assembly  to  ask

for  this vote in spite of the fact that there have

been  surpluses  every year. These  surpluses  have

been  due to the fact that the Government have  not

been  able to carry out its work. The Minister  for

Finance should resign since he is unable to use all

the vote that has been approved. I am going to tell

the P.A.P. Government that it is impossible now for

them to cast a smokescreen to deceive the people of

Singapore. The so-called development of the  P.A.P.

is nothing more than a paper tiger. It is something

that  is good to look at, but there is nothing  in

substance. Therefore, I want the Government to give

us the full facts about these matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, now that the Government have come to this House to ask for a supplementary vote of $740,000 for rural development and other purposes, it shows that the P.A.P. have failed in their work in this respect. They have failed to look after the interest and livelihood of the

people in the rural areas. Now that they are  going

to face their death, they are fabricating imaginary

figures and plans in order to deceive the people of

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Tan Kia Gan):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Choa

Chu Kang seems to be out of his mind today. We come

to  the  House to ask for a supplementary  vote  of

$740,000 to meet the expenditure of construction of

three



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>



veterinary  clinics,  a  mobile  unit  to   provide

veterinary services to Pulau Ubin, Pulau Tekong and

the  Southern  Islands, a fertilizers and  mixtures

supply  service, extension schemes for agriculture,

animal  husbandry,  fisheries,  animal  nutritional

unit,  a  veterinary  diagnostic  laboratory,   and

primary  production services to the rural community

centres and other projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this House on the 8th April, 1963, I spoke

quite  lengthily  on  the  services  that  we  have

supplied to the farmers and fishermen of Singapore.

It  looks to me as if the Member for Choa Chu  Kang

is  deliberately saying untruths in  this  Assembly

just  to  blind  the  eyes of the  people  who  are

probably  ignorant. I have mentioned in this  House

of  the  services  that have been supplied  to  the

farmers  and the fishermen. What we are  requesting

today  is money to implement more schemes  to  help

the farmers and the fishermen of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the farmers in Singapore know that today if

they need inoculations for their chickens and pigs,

they  can easily get them from either the extension

centres  that  we  have built  or  from  the  rural

community centres which we have recently built.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as you know, these rural community centres

are built not only to supply amenities to the rural

folks but also to supply veterinary services to the

farmers, the pig rearers, the poultry rearers, etc.

We   have  introduced  artificial  insemination  in

Singapore for pigs. As I have said before  in  this

House, Sir, Singapore is the first tropical country

to introduce this service. Already numerous farmers

who  have  pigs  in  their farms  are  getting  the

benefit of this service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1959 when we came to office, there were

two  veterinary  extension  centres  in  existence.

Since  then,  we  have built  three  more  of  such

extension  centres - one in Changi, one  in  Yio  Chu

Kang and one in Tampines. The fourth one at Thomson

Road  is  nearing completion. From these  extension

centres,  we  supply  veterinary  services  to  the

people  who live around these areas and certain  of

our  services are even brought to the doorsteps  of

the farmers. When



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>



the  Member for Choa Chu Kang says that the  P.A.P.

Government  have  not been doing anything  for  the

farmers  of  Singapore, he must be talking  through

his hat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this additional sum of $740,000 is for the

purpose  of  providing more services to  the  rural

folks. In the Development Estimates for 1963, there

is   a  vote  of  $200,000  for  rural  development

projects. This money is committed to the artificial

insemination  service, the anti-pest  service,  the

provision of fisheries training and also  one  film

unit,  and  the  building of the  fourth  extension

centre  at  Thomson Road. What we  are  asking  the

Assembly is a provision of $155,000 for three  more

veterinary extension centres to be built in Jurong,

Mandai  and later on one to be built in the Punggol

area. We are planning ahead so that the benefits of

all  these  services can be brought to farmers  all

over the island of Singapore, including Pulau Ubin,

Pulau Tekong and the Southern Islands. We know that

whilst   it  has  been  possible  to  improve   the

veterinary  services  on Singapore  Island  by  the

establishment  of veterinary clinics and  extension

centres, it has not been possible to provide  these

services  to  the  adjacent islands  of  Singapore,

particularly  Pulau  Ubin,  Pulau  Tekong  and  the

Southern  Islands.  It is therefore  intended  that

such  services should be extended to these islands,

and  we intend to build a mobile team to move  from

island to island and from one part of the island to

another  part  of the same island where  there  are

concentrations of farmers. In order to render these

mobile  services, a properly fitted boat which  can

carry  up  to  ten persons with a reasonable  speed

will  be  required.  To provide  this  mobile  unit

service,  we  require $40,000. On top of  that,  we

intend to initiate a Scheme whereby we will produce

sludge  and chemical fertilizers and sell  them  at

cost   to   farmers  through  all  our   veterinary

extension centres and the rural community centres.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> Order. May I remind the

Minister  that there are only six minutes left  for

this item?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, in other words, all these

services  that  we intend to supply  to  the  rural

areas  are  solely  meant for the  benefit  of  the

farmers and the fishermen of Singapore.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Choa Chu Kang has deliberately

closed a blind eye to all these services. But I  am

quite sure that some day someone will open his eyes

for   him.  And  when  the  time  comes   for   his

constituents to pass judgment on him, they will  do

him justice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, the Minister for National Development  has

admitted  and  neither has he denied  what  I  have

pointed  out in this House. That is, the Government

should have done all these things between 1961  and

1962;   because  in  the  past  three   years   the

Government was given more than $1 million for rural

developments, but it did not fully make use of  the

money  voted.  The  Minister himself  has  admitted

this.  From  this admission, we can  see  that  the

Government  has no sincerity in looking  after  the

livelihood of the rural people. In fact, it is only

concerned  with the future elections  that  it  has

come out with this supplementary vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $740,000 for Head D.20 ordered to stand

part of the First Supplementary Development

Estimates of Expenditure for 1963.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D. 25 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D.25 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 35.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, subhead 35 concerns markets and the construction thereof. According to the Government's explanation, it intends to put up markets in the Housing Board estates to the number of six, and the total expenditure is estimated at $1,350,000. We would like the Minister for Health and Law to explain to this House where these six

markets  are intended to be built. In the meantime,

what  is going to happen to the hawkers around  the

streets, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>



how  are  they going to apply for pitches in  these

markets?  I  would  also  like  to  know  on   what

principle  or basis is the allocation  of  hawkers'

pitches to be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, we have seen that the Government is doing its very best to support a certain hawkers' organisation. In fact, a Member of the hack benches and a Parliamentary Secretary are acting in the capacity of advisers to this hawkers' organisation. So what we are concerned about is this. On completion of these markets, is the

Government   going  to  hand  over  the   work   of

allocation to this hawkers' organisation? We  raise

this question because in Singapore almost everybody

knows  that  if  you want to get anything  done  or

apply  for anything, you must get the rubber  stamp

of  the  P.A.P. before it can be done. So  I  would

like the Minister for Health and Law to assure this

House  that the future allocation of hawker pitches

in  these markets will be made on a very fair basis

without any party bias.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Mr  Deputy Speaker, Sir, in modern town  planning,

public  markets are recognised as essential  social

amenities and often the markets form the centre  of

the  shopping  area  of the neighbourhood.  In  the

planning  of  the various estates, the Housing  and

Development  Board  have  been  requested  by   the

Ministry to include in their layout suitable  sites

for   markets  in  relation  to  the  size  of  the

population  itself and the needs of the people.  In

conformity   with  this  planned   development   of

essential amenities for the public, it is necessary

that  markets in the Board's housing estates should

be  provided. The responsibility for the  provision

of  markets  lies with the Ministry of Health,  and

the   Housing  and  Development  Board  have   been

requested   to   provide  in  their  planning   the

construction  of  such markets  as  part  of  their

overall development plan. Experience has shown that

the  construction costs of markets by the Board  as

an  integrated project result in development  at  a

much lower cost, so that the market extensions  can

be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



phased suitably with the development of the Board's

estates.  Details  of  the  markets  proposed,  the

population  served  and the costs  of  construction

which  the  Member for Choa Chu Kang has asked  for

will now be provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed, Sir, to build a market consisting

of  198 stalls at 70 pitches at Geylang Serai,  off

Jalan  Turi. This market is estimated  to  serve  a

resident  population of 70,000.  The  cost  of  the

building will be $375,000 and the cost of equipment

will be $31,610. The second market will be built at

Jalan  Merpati,  that  is in  the  Macpherson  Road

(South)  area. It is to be a market of 100  stalls.

It  is  proposed  that  this market  will  serve  a

resident population of 17,000. The building cost is

$180,000 and the cost of equipment is $31,600.  The

third market is to be a market of 150 stalls to  be

built  in  Beo Lane in the Bukit Ho Swee  area.  It

will  serve  a resident population of  48,000.  The

building cost is estimated to be $225,000  and  the

cost of equipment, $71,990. The fourth market is  a

market of 100 stalls to be built in Tang-un Halt in

the Queenstown neighbourhood (Four). It is expected

that  this  market will serve a resident population

of   32,000;  the  cost  of  construction  will  be

$190,000  and  the cost of equipment, $31,600.  The

fifth market is to be a 100-stall market, off Jalan

Batu  in  Tanjong Rhu. It is expected  to  serve  a

population  of 24,000 residents. The  cost  of  the

building   will  be  $190,000  and  the   cost   of

equipment, $31,600. The sixth market is  to  be  at

Hoy  Fatt Road. This is a 100-stall market  in  the

Alexandra  Hill Estate. It is expected to  serve  a

population  of 18,000; the cost of construction  is

$190,000; the cost of equipment is $31,600. It must

be  pointed  out  that the population  figures  are

estimates  of  population growth  in  the  area  of

redevelopment alone. In fact, experience has  shown

that  these  markets, when completed, can  serve  a

much larger population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, apart from markets in the Housing Board areas, hawker pitches are also being provided by the Housing and Development Board and up to date, the Board has provided 35 pitches in the Tanjong Rhu Estate, costing $25,000. In addition, the Board



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>



has  built 35 pitches in the Alexandra Hill Estate,

costing  $11,000. The Board has already built  half

of  the  312 hawker pitches in the Kallang  Estate,

costing   $40,000.   The   Board   will   soon   be

constructing 88 new hawker pitches, costing $35,000

in the Bukit Ho Swee Estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of hawker pitches in Housing and

Development Board Estates has been designed  as  an

extension  of  the  enlightened  approach  to   the

control  of  hawkers. In a number  of  Housing  and

Development  Board  estates,  hawker  stalls  began

developing and there was a danger that these modern

housing  estates would be reduced to slums if  such

hawker development were allowed to go on unchecked.

In  order to meet the demands of the population for

hawker  facilities and at the same Time to exercise

effective  control and maintain the  estates  in  a

sanitary  and aesthetic state, hawker pitches  have

been provided and are being developed in all recent

development. The cost of such construction is borne

entirely by the Board. The arrangement between  the

Board  and  the  Markets and Hawkers Department  is

that  70  per  cent of the fees  are  paid  to  the

Housing and Development Board for recovery of costs

and  30  per  cent is retained by the  Markets  and

Hawkers   Department  for  maintenance  and   water

charges. The licence fees are $10 or $15 per stall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of providing suitable alternative sites

for  hawkers has been followed in the case of other

hawker  areas.  Those  are  areas  other  than  the

Housing Board areas, where it has been necessary to

move   hawkers   to   deal  with   development   or

redevelopment,  traffic  obstruction  or   hazards,

interference with public cleansing and other health

activities. This policy has been satisfactory  and,

in  a  number of cases where such resettlement  has

been necessary, there has been good co-operation on

the  whole  from the hawkers. Such resettled  areas

include East Coast Road, the big bottleneck at  the

junction  of Joo Chiat Road and the Changi  Market,

the  hawker congestion outside Killiney Road Market

and  the  vicinity of the Lido Theatre  in  Orchard

Road.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All hawker policy matters are carefully discussed

by  the  Hawkers Advisory Committee and all aspects

of  the  problem are carefully examined before  any

action is decided upon. Individual appeals are also

considered  by this Committee. Mr Deputy  Speaker,

Sir,  on the Hawkers' Advisory Committee there  are

important  Government  officials;  the  police   is

represented  on  that Committee,  also  the  Health

Department. We have also somebody from  the  Social

Science Department of the University who serves  as

a  representative  and  all hawkers'  problems  are

carefully examined by that Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the allocation of stalls, I can assure the

Member  for Choa Chu Kang that it is done  properly

and  in a very fair manner. These pitches are built

to  replace the existing shacks and everyone who is

in  occupation  of an existing shack is  registered

and he is provided with a new pitch. Allocation  is

done  by  ballot.  Everyone has an  opportunity  of

drawing in the ballot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the charge that is being made by the Member

for  Choa  Chu  Kang that preference  is  shown  to

certain  hawkers' unions, I can assure him that  no

hawkers'  union  is represented  in  this  Hawkers'

Advisory  Committee.  I can assure  him  also  that

balloting is done in a fair and proper manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $579,980 for Head D.25 ordered to stand part of the First Supplementary Development

Estimates of Expenditure for 1963.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D.49 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D.49 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 4.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, subhead 4 deals with extension and development of radio, information and publicity services of the Ministry of Culture. According to the Government explanation, because Malaysia will be established on 3 1st of August, therefore it is necessary to extend short-wave

radio transmission to the three Borneo territories.

Therefore, the Government has asked this  House  to

approve  this vote of $1,350,000 for this  purpose.

The  so-called Ministry of Culture is, in fact, the

propaganda machinery of the P.A.P. Radio  Singapore

is,  in fact, the voice of the P.A.P. From the past

series of incidents,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



the people of Singapore have come to  know

that   Radio   Singapore  is  the  main  propaganda

machinery  of  the P.A.P. Government,  because  the

P.A.P. is  already bankrupt in  the  eyes  of  the

people  and  it  has  no possibility  of  convening

rallies,  street conferences and other meetings  of

the   people.  That  is  why  the  only  propaganda

machinery  available to it is to make  use  of  the

money   of   the  people  for  its  own   political

propaganda,  that is, through Radio Singapore.  Mr

Deputy Speaker, at present the facilities of  Radio

Singapore are more than sufficient and there is  no

necessity to expand them further by spending  $1.35

million.



<br><br>4.05 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can know that the P.A.P. not only wants to

carry  out  party propaganda throughout Malaya  and

Singapore,   but  also  it  wants  to  extend   its

propaganda to the three Borneo territories  because

it  hopes to set up branches there. But so  far  it

has  not  been  successful. No  members  have  been

forthcoming. Because the P.A.P. is unable to set up

branches in the Borneo territories, it has now come

to   think  of  this  method  of  extending   radio

services. It has now come to this House to ask  for

a  vote of $1.35 million to extend short-wave radio

transmission  to the component parts  of  Malaysia.

According  to the Government's explanation,  it  is

scheduled to spend $550,000 in 1962 on the National

Art  Gallery,  but so far we have not seen  whether

work  has  started on it. The Minister for  Culture

has  never  mentioned about it at all,  because  he

knows  that  the  National Art  Gallery  cannot  do

anything  in the field of political propaganda  for

the  P.A.P.  That is why although the vote  on  the

National Art Gallery was already there in the  1962

Development Estimates, the P.A.P. did not carry out

the project because it found it was of no political

use  to  it. Mr Speaker, in col. 2288 of  Hansard,

Vol. 15 No. 24 dated 15th December, 1961, when  the

Member  for  Farrer  Park asked  the  Minister  for

Culture about the building plan of the National Art

Gallery,  the Minister for Culture pointed  out  to

the House that the plan would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



be  implemented in 1962. But he had not carried out

what  he had promised in this Assembly. But now  he

has  transferred this $550,000 for the purposes  of

extending   the   short-wave   radio   transmission

service. Mr Speaker, this sum of $1.35 million  is

not  small. It is collected from the people in  the

form of taxes and it amounts to one-quarter of  the

assessment revenues for 1963. Since the P.A.P. came

into  office, it has introduced various taxes,  one

of which is assessment tax. The present Government,

in order to extend the services of Radio Singapore,

intends now to use a further $1.35 million which is

one-quarter  of  the property tax  for  this  year,

1963.  But  we  would like to ask this.  After  the

extension  of  this  radio service,  what  can  the

people   get?   Can  their  living  conditions   be

improved? Can sanitary conditions be improved? Will

there be more schools? Why does the Government  not

want  to  use  this big sum of money  to  help  the

people improve their standard of living?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little while ago the Minister for National

Development boasted about helping the rural  people

to improve their livelihood and standard of living.

Granted  that the money to be spent is  only  about

$740,000. But $1.35 million is proposed to be spent

just for the extension of radio services, which sum

is  derived from various forms of taxes paid by the

people, such as property tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this House has a duty to prevent the P.A.P. from squandering away public money and the wealth of this country in schemes like this extension of radio service. Through Radio Singapore, the P.A.P has also threatened the people. For instance, on May Day after every interval of a few minutes, Radio Singapore made an

announcement threatening workers repeatedly not  to

attend the May Day celebration of the S.A.T.U. for

fear  of  violence. On the other hand, the  P.A.P.,

through  Radio  Singapore,  urged  the  workers  to

attend  the N.T.U.C. May Day rally. All this proves

that the P.A.P. is abusing State



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



machinery   to  achieve  its  political   ends   by

political  propaganda. That is why we cannot  allow

the   P.A.P. to  squander  away  any  more   money

belonging to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today it comes to this House asking for a vote of

$1 .35 million for the extension of radio services.

I  suggest that this vote should be withdrawn,  and

that  this sum of money could be put to better  use

for the benefit of the people.

Governments  of  the  Federation  of   Malaya   and

Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I think I will answer the first  two

questions  raised  by the Member for  Tanglin.  His

first  question is: is it necessary to expand radio

services before Malaysia is established? The  point

about  the time factor - whether it should  be  spent

before Malaysia is established or not - is irrelevant

because radio services have to be expanded to cover

the  Borneo territories as well through the  short-wave  band  for the simple reason that  practically

all  the radio services in the five territories are

operating  on  a  short-wave  band,  including  the

Borneo territories where they are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



establishing  a more powerful short-wave  band.  We

ourselves therefore have to follow suit, regardless

of what happens after Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other reason is that, as the Member for

Tanglin  knows, we have a commercial service.  Once

every  other commercial service goes on short  wave

and  we stick to medium wave, then perhaps we shall

have to ask for more than the $1.3 million that  we

are  asking for today. We have to go on short wave,

if  for  no  other  reason  than  to  establish   a

commercial service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, it follows on what the Member for

Yio Chu Kang has been ranting against. We are quite

gratified,  Sir,  that  the  Communists  and  their

puppets  here  have developed a  phobia  about  our

radio  propaganda. We are not afraid of propaganda.

They  are  afraid  of propaganda.  The  Member  for

Queenstown  has  every reason to  be  afraid  of  a

further  extension of our radio services  to  cover

the   Borneo   territories  as  well,  because   if

performance  within our limits on  medium  wave  in

Singapore has cost him dearly, then I am quite sure

that if our performance over radio forums could  be

heard  throughout the Borneo territories,  many  of

his  Communist supporters in the Borneo territories

would  certainly  have cause to doubt  whether  the

Barisan  Sosialis,  which  has  always  put  itself

forward  as the spearhead of the Communist movement

in Malaysia, is a dependable ally. Today they are a

broken wing if we are to pay any credence to  their

own  propaganda  in  the Barisan newspapers.  Today

they  are relying on guerilla warfare in the Borneo

territories to save them from the predicament  they

are  in. We are quite open about it. It is the duty

of  a  democratic  society to  use  the  propaganda

machinery.  It has always been here. It is  nothing

new.  We have never established it. When the Member

for Queenstown and the Member for Yio Chu Kang were

on  this side of the House, they had no occasion to

raise  questions  about the money spent - whether  it

was  worth while spending money on radio. In  fact,

they   were  anxious  that  our  radio  should   be

strengthened.  But  today, now  that  they  are  no

longer on this side and no longer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



fighting  the  cause  of  democracy  but  obviously

fighting  the  cause  of the Communists  and  alien

confrontationists, they know that the radio can  be

used  effectively to stifle them and  to  conscribe

them, as we had shown them in the referendum.  That

is why, Sir, they are terrified of any extension to

the  radio  services because it would be  one  more

blow against their propaganda and one more means to

expose Communist falsehoods, Communist strategy and

Communist propaganda. The Member for Yio Chu  Kang,

though, he made wild allegations ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Choa Chu Kang, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member for Choa Chu Kang

has been referred to as the Member for Yio Chu Kang

by  not only the Minister for Culture, but also  by

the  Deputy Prime Minister. I was wondering whether

there  is  any  hint  that there  will  be  another

constituency  called the Constituency  of  Yio  Chu

Kang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No, Sir. It is purely in

anticipation of the political future of the  Member

for  Choa Chu Kang, because we are never quite sure

where he is at any one moment. It is possible, Sir,

that he will have to find new pastures, probably in

Yio Chu Kang or perhaps some other quarters.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Woodbridge!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I am sorry, Sir,I should refer

correctly  to  his present constituency,  which  is

Choa Chu Kang.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Yio Chu Kang is the Tanjong

Rambutan of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the Member for Choa Chu Kang

has  been  saying that the radio has been used  for

P.A.P. propaganda.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> It is true.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> For him, the P.A.P. is synonymous

with  democracy. We have never made any  propaganda

for  the  Party. We have always made propaganda  on

behalf   of   the  democratic  cause  against   the

Communists. I challenge him at any moment  to  show

any  one occasion where the radio has been used for

party propaganda.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



It is a tribute to us that he equates  the

P.A.P. to the democratic cause in general. We  have

always   challenged,  accused,  and   exposed   the

Communists  but  never have we ever  gone  and  put

across on any occasion purely party propaganda.  We

are  able to deal with them in this field  when  we

have  occasion  to  meet  them  outside  the  radio

studios.  But  over the radio, our main  cause  has

been to espouse democracy in our fight against  the

Communists.  They  know very well,  Sir,  that  the

referendum proved that for the first Time. That  is

one  of the reasons why we are expanding our  radio

services.  The Communists believe in pro, paganda,

but it is quite a different type of propaganda when

they send school children carrying Ovaltine or Milo

or  milk  bottles  and going around  whispering  to

farmers  that  the Government are  doing  this  and

doing  that. They know that the blank votes in  the

referendum were least in the city areas where there

is  adequate radio coverage, but in the rural areas

where   there  is  not  adequate  radio  propaganda

coverage,  the  blank votes were  high.  Since  the

referendum,  it has been our policy to  extend  the

publicity services, including radio and television,

in the rural areas which are their last stronghold.

They know today that that stronghold is being taken

away  from  them. Therefore, there is every  reason

for  them  to come out now and say that  the  $1.35

million  that  is being spent on the  extension  of

radio  services is a waste of money and why can  we

not  build  houses  and clinics.  We  are  building

houses.  In  fact,  Sir, the  damage  done  by  the

Barisan  Sosialis and the Communists by  trying  to

sabotage  the  economy  of  the  country   and   by

misleading workers to artificial strikes  has  cost

the  country far more than the $1,300,000  that  we

are  going  to  spend on radio. This $1.35  million

will ensure that the capacity to damage the economy

of  the  country by the Communists and the  Barisan

Sosialis  is more effectively reduced.  The  result

will  be  that this $1.35 million will ensure  that

the  economy of the country will prosper  and  that

our  country will develop far quicker,  because  we

can  expose  all their machinations.  Secondly,  by

extending  the services to the Borneo  territories,

we  hope  that  we will he able to conscribe  their

Communist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>



friends in the Borneo territories as effectively as

we have done to the Communists in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

has  not  answered  my  third  and  most  important

question:  if this expenditure were to  take  place

after 31st August, 1963, would the expenditure then

he shared with the Central Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think I

shall  answer that question because this  point  is

among  the Radio and Broadcasting matters still  to

be discussed with the Central Government.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer to

that  is  very  important, and I am glad  that  the

Minister  is  not  able to give it,  because  after

Malaysia  I  understand that the policy as  regards

programmes and so on will have to be subject to the

approval  of  the Central Government and  that  the

misuse  of propaganda media by the local Government

for  party  purposes could very  well  be  checked,

whereas today such propaganda cannot be checked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if the expenditure will be shared by the

Central Government after 31st August, 1963, then to

save  Singapore  unnecessary expenditure,  I  think

this  item  could  be  postponed  till  after  31st

August.  The  inordinate hurry being shown  by  the

Ministry  of  Culture to have  two  very  expensive

items  before  the  House for  approval  shows  its

eagerness  to have radio and television  propaganda

before 31st August.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know how important it was for the

Japanese  during  the Japanese  occupation  not  to

allow  local people to be able to time in to short-wave broadcasts. We were only allowed to time in on

the medium-wave band. It is recognised all over the

world by both power blocs that radio propaganda  is

so  important  that  even  without  sending  forces

across  the  seas, they can capture the territories

they want by subversion in that way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I was in Jesselton and in Kuching, there

was  fear  expressed by the people there  regarding

the  poison  in  Singapore.  This  was  due  to   a

statement by the P.A.P., who said that the  Barisan

were  open-front Communists. They said,  "They  say

so. If there are open-front



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



Communists, what about those who are not open-front

Communists?" The Finance Minister in his  financial

statement  has referred to the last  ten  years  as

being  years of strife. Sir, that period  coincides

with  the period of the establishment of the P.A.P.

in  Singapore. If propaganda is broadcast on  short

wave to our neighbours who are going to be partners

in  Malaysia  and they are already  scared  of  the

poison from Singapore, the earlier installation  of

all  this machinery will simply mean the chance  of

more  propaganda for the P.A.P. throughout Malaysia

disturbing the climate in other territories.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Sir, the P.A.P. may say that they have

changed, but we have not yet seen the change to  be

more  than  a  bit above the surface.  We  are  not

convinced  of that yet. Already we see a strike  in

Singapore  today  affecting  the  nurses  and   the

welfare of the sick people in the hospitals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Ministry of Culture is really anxious

to preserve the good climate in Borneo and Sarawak,

they  could very well refrain from trying to extend

the  scope of their propaganda machinery till after

31st August, when people can say there will be fair

play  for  all.  At this particular Time  President

Soekarno  and  the  Tunku have decided  that  there

should  be a policy of co-operation and not one  of

confrontation.  The P.A.P. have said  they  believe

definitely in open confrontation. I can foresee, in

these   radio   programmes  over   the   short-wave

broadcasts,  there  can be such  statements  as  to

invite  open  confrontation from other territories,

thereby  spoiling the atmosphere not  of  Singapore

but of Malaysia. If the P.A.P. Government is really

interested  in  more co-operation instead  of  more

confrontation in Malaysia, they could refrain  from

spending this sum till after 31st August, 1963.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

we have heard the three Ministers of the Government

referring to me as the Member for Yio Chu  Kang.  I

think  this  is  because  they  will  be  going  to

Woodbridge Hospital in Yio Chu Kang one day.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Culture made a reply to me. His reply clearly shows that it is when the P.A.P. is unable to explain its abuse of the Government machinery that it will bring out the weapon of the so-called united front of the Communists. All this so-called united front of

Communists is a claim made by the P.A.P. in  order

to  shirk  its  responsibility and to  deceive  the

people.  It  is  claimed by  the  P.A.P. that  the

Barisan  Sosialis has infiltrated into  the  unions

and  led  strikes, and so it is necessary  for  the

Government  to expand the services of  broadcasting

in order to pin down the Barisan's infiltration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past few days we have seen that if the argument of the Minister for Culture can stand, then it means that the Communists have already infiltrated into the Ministry of Home Affairs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have seen employees of the Ministry of Home Affairs on strike. The pickets perform their duties outside the C.I.D., on the doorsteps of the Special Branch, outside the Central Police Station and even outside the Ministry of Home Affairs itself. On all these

buildings  we can see banners and strike  placards.

The   slogan  is  that  the  strikers  condemn  the

Government   for  using  the  Police  against   the

legitimate strikers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are even a lot of cartoons on display, and one of the cartoons says, "Small men, small pay. Understand?"



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Personally, I do not understand how

all  this has got to do with the motion before  the

House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  am mentioning all these in order to reply to the

allegation  of  the Minister for Culture  that  the

Barisan  has led strikes and infiltrated  into  the

unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the leader of the strikes is actually the Secretary of the A.U.P.E. who is the ex-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture. Does the Minister for Culture mean that Mr Kandasamy is also a member of the united front of the Communists?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all this talk of Communists has been made in order to enable P.A.P. to shirk its responsibility and all this talk is very unconvincing in the eyes of the people. In fact, the Government intends to make use of the radio to achieve its political propaganda and it is actually

impractical. They are unable to do this because the

future general election will show where they stand.

As  a  matter of fact, the naive arguments  of  the

Minister for Culture over Radio Singapore will  not

be  able to deceive the people. If he thinks so,  I

say  it is a mistaken conception. We all know  that

the  Voice  of America has a very great voice.  Its

transmission  is very strong, but the  strength  of

the U.S.A. imperialists is decreasing from Time  to

Time.  All  that we are concerned now is  that  the

Government  should not be allowed to  abuse  public

funds   on   an   insignificant   and   unnecessary

expansion. So if the Government wants to  show  the

world  that it is interested in the welfare of  the

people, then it must make use of this money that is

being  asked  for,  for  the  improvement  of   the

livelihood of the people and not for the  expansion

of this short-wave service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the Member for Tanglin takes

objection, as far as I can gather, to the extension

of the short-wave service on two grounds. First, be

seems  to  be  under a misapprehension  that  Radio

Singapore  is  for party propaganda.  He  has  been

saying  that for the last three years.  There  must

have been many instances over the past three years.

I  have asked him Time and again if he could  quote

any  instance where party propaganda,  as  distinct

from  government  propaganda, has gone  across  the

air.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, he says he went to Jesselton and saw

some people - I do not know which people he saw  -

who said that they are afraid of the poison that is

going  to  be spread from Singapore to  the  Borneo

territories. Obviously, Sir, this "poison" is  meat

to  many  people in Jesselton, because we have  had

from  the Political Study Centre-which has also  in

the  past been accused of being a P.A.P. propaganda

outfit  -  enquiries from certain people  who  came

from the Borneo territories and the Federation to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>



attend  our  Political Study Centre,  who  were  so

impressed  by  what  was going on  that  they  have

officially requested us twice to send our lecturers

and  speakers  to go and conduct similar  political

study  classes in the Borneo territories. In  fact,

we  have  another  request  and  we  have  been  so

successful that they have asked us to go across and

tell   their   civil  servants  of  the   political

background to the big struggle that is going on  in

this  area.  I cannot therefore see that  what  the

P.A.P. says  over  the radio or at  the  Political

Study  Centre  could possibly be called  poison  by

people  who  matter. I do not  know  who  were  the

people   whom  the  Member  for  Tanglin   met   in

Jesselton. Obviously, they could not be people  who

mattered. Secondly ---



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> All people matter. Ha, ha, ha!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Obviously, Sir, these people whom

he saw ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Nobody knows ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the Member for Anson

occasionally   breaks   out   into   interjections.

Obviously  he does not quite understand what  I  am

saying. I am saying that the Member for Tanglin saw

some  people, and as it was a short visit he  could

have  seen  only two or three people. It  is  quite

possible  that those people do not matter in  terms

of what the people of Borneo or Jesselton want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, if what goes over Radio Singapore

can be considered as poison, the radio stations  in

these three territories would not have asked for an

exchange  of  programmes, especially  many  of  the

programmes   in   regard  to   political   matters.

Therefore,  Sir,  what  we  are  trying  to  do  by

establishing a short-wave service is to ensure that

instead of recording programmes on tape and sending

them there weeks late, with the establishment of  a

short-wave service people in the Borneo territories

can  listen  in  to the same radio  programmes  and

enjoy  the  same  radio  diet  as  the  people   of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his other point, whether this

expansion  could  not  be  held  back  until  after

Malaysia, it is our duty not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>



to halt everything, even necessary extensions, just

because  of  Malaysia. We have to go  on  with  the

normal extension of our service, not only for radio

but  also  other services. Nor can we say  that  we

should  stop  building  a  few  more  post  offices

because we should wait till after Malaysia for  the

Central Government to decide whether to build those

post  offices or extend the airport. It is our duty

to  carry on doing what is necessary, regardless of

what  happens after Malaysia. That is the basis  on

which  we  plan  to extend this short-wave  service

because it is necessary and not because we want  to

spread  poison.  It  is  ridiculous  to  say  that,

because  far  from receiving poison the  people  of

Borneo  want to listen in to many of the  Singapore

programmes,  such as some of the radio forums.  The

Member  for  Queenstown  has  excited  considerable

interest in the Borneo territories and many of them

regretted  that they were not privileged to  listen

in  to the fiasco that the Member for Queenstown is

supposed  to  have experienced at  a  recent  radio

forum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a reference to T.V. in the latest issue

of  the  Barisan  from which  I  shall  quote  some

relevant extracts when we conic to deal with T.V. I

think  they were more interested in the  report  of

the performance of the Member for Queenstown during

this  radio  forum.  And now with  this  short-wave

service, they will have direct experience  of  what

the Member for Queenstown and his ghost-writers are

capable of.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

for  Culture  should really he called the  Minister

for  Propaganda. He is a trained journalist and  he

knows  how to obscure the main points by adding  so

many other points until people get confused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we give credit to the P.A.P. for knowing

when to slow down and when to expedite matters. The

Sembawang by-election has been slowed down for many

months,  because they want to build up a new  image

of  the  P.A.P. That is why the Prime  Minister  is

going all over Singapore. The whole of Malaya knows

it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Why don't you go around? [Laughter]



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I am asking something very

simple.  Is  Singapore  not  going  to  benefit  by

sharing  the  expenditure on  this  item  with  the

Federation by postponing it for just a few  months?

Surely  it  is  reasonable  for  the  Minister  for

Culture  to agree, and I would be glad to  withdraw

my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, regarding the question of the Minister

for  Culture. Firstly, he says that I merely met  a

few "nobodies" in the Borneo territories and formed

a   quick   impression  therefrom.   Sir,   I   met

responsible  leaders  of the political  Parties  in

North  Borneo, and they explained to me the  reason

why  they  insisted on controlling  immigration  in

their  territory. That is because they were scared,

particularly about the poison in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is this, Sir. He asked me for

proof as to how the present broadcasting system can

be regarded as P.A.P.-controlled propaganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Party propaganda.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, before the P.A.P. came to

power,  was the Broadcasting Department not  fairly

independent  when  it came to the  broadcasting  of

news  and  the selection of news? As soon  as  they

came to power, `the Control Room was shifted to the

Ministry  of Culture. Now that is an indication  of

closer control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, and this is very specific. Once

somebody in the Broadcasting Department rang me  up

and  said, "I am sorry, we can only give you little

space," and he read out to me what he was going  to

report  of my speech in the Assembly. [Laughter]  I

am  not a liar. I claim anybody to charge me  as  a

liar, Sir. Sometimes the Government benches like to

laugh derisively.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Because you put us in good humour.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please continue, Dr Thio.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I expected that at least the

small bit that he read out would be reported in the

broadcast of the proceedings of the Assembly.  Sir,

what  he read out to me was brief enough:  it  was

cut down further.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Possibly the Broadcasting

Editor thought otherwise.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Well, those are just two things

that  indicate that ever since the P.A.P. came  to

power,  there  has  been  greater  thought  control

through the radio and through the Press. We know it

and  we  know very well that there are two versions

of  many Singapore papers. The papers that are read

in  Kuala  Lumpur give one impression;  the  papers

that are read in Singapore give another impression.

Anyway,  Sir, I was just asking for something  very

simple: whether in the interests of the economy  of

Singapore to save some money this item could not be

postponed  until after 31st August, and  I  suppose

the answer will be "No".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Anything further? No? Mr

Rajaratnam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I think his last statement is

correct, Sir. The answer would be "No". As  I  have

indicated, these things should be judged  on  their

merits.   It  has  nothing  to  do  with  Malaysia.

Regardless  of  Malaysia  or  not,  it  cannot   be

postponed  until after 31st August. But I  ask  one

question  of  him.  Can he give evidence  of  party

propaganda -  I think those were the words he used  - over  Radio  Singapore?  And  he  said  "Yes".  The

evidence  was  this: that the News Room  under  the

Labour  Front  Government - then  they  metamorphosed

into   the  S.P.A.,  and  I  think  now  they  call

themselves  the Grand Alliance. But  his  claim  is

that before, under their regime, the News Room  was

elsewhere, and that with the present Government the

News  Room is in the City Hall. The News  Room  has

always been in City Hall, so I do not see how  that

constitutes party propaganda over Radio Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his speech. I cannot recollect it.

Normally   we   never  interfere  with   the   news

presentation and he can challenge it. He can ask of

Editor. The only thing we are interested in is, how

should the news be relayed? Normally what the  News

Editor  does is he has got only two, three or  four

minutes.  He  uses his judgment and  cuts  out  the

least  impressive of the speeches. It may  be  that

when  he  first read out the report of the Member's

speech  unedited, which as he said came  to  a  few

paragraphs,  and it was discovered  that  the  Time

limit  at  his  disposal  was  only  two  or  three

minutes,  he went through it with a red pencil  and

decided to delete it. It is a normal process  which

goes on in every newspaper office. So that does not

constitute proof that'd there is P.A.P. propaganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are the two points I wish to make,

because  the  Member and other  Members  have  been

saying  that  we  broadcast  party  propaganda.  We

always challenge them. Please produce instances. If

there  were  any  instances during the  past  three

years, there must obviously have been a great  deal

of  party propaganda going across. They should have

noted   it   down - "Such  and  such  a  date,   this

particular item or party propaganda was put across.

Please,  can you explain?" Then we will be prepared

to  explain.  But to make a general statement  that

there   is  party  propaganda,  as  distinct   from

government  propaganda. What  hurts  them  most  is

this.  This  Government has achieved a great  deal,

unlike the previous Government, and therefore has a

lot  to boast of. Therefore, the more we boast, the

more  it  hurts  them. That is the crux  of  `their

complaint that there is P.A.P. propaganda. What  he

means is that by contrast we build houses; we  show

them  over  T.V. If they had T.V., they would  have

nothing  to  show.  If  you  want  to  boast  about

something,  you should boast about something  which

is  convincing.  Now we have achieved  so  much  of

which  we are proud and we are justified in putting

it  over  the radio. We have built houses, we  have

built  schools, we have built roads; we show  them.

When  Members like the Member for Tanglin  look  at

all  this, it irritates them. It annoys the  Member

because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



it  is  the  truth. Therefore, he decides  being  a

"moral  rearmamenter"  to  say  that  all  this  is

propaganda. The houses could not exist, the schools

could   not   exist;  therefore   this   is   party

propaganda.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will

pardon me, I have to bring up an illustration  that

I think should be brought up under television. This

is  to  answer his point that the P.A.P. never  use

their machinery for P.A.P. propaganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the referendum, they made a film to show

that  it  was victory for the people; but the  film

was  so  made that it gave the impression `that  it

was a victory for the People's Action Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> They were there, but your chaps

were asleep.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> They asked us in the national

interest to put aside party considerations; we did.

We  told  the  people  to vote for  certain  issues

regardless of party considerations. It  was  not  a

vote for or against the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, usually, Sir, my temper seldom rises. [Loud

laughter]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Now, Sir, I was there right

through the counting ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The what?



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> --- the counting of the ballot ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> We were told that there must be

no  display of banners of any Party. The moment the

P.A.P. knew  that the result was going  to  be  in

favour of the referendum ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What time was that?



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Well, a crowd of people began

to  gather  outside the Hall with  P.A.P. banners.

Sir, when the Supervisor of Elections announced the

result  of  the referendum, he made a  mistake.  He

announced  it to the crowd outside and  not  to  us

inside the Hall. Now, to show that the masses  were

so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>



powerful that they were eager to please the masses,

they announced the result to the public rather than

to  the  polling agents who were inside  the  Hall,

until  I  pointed  this out. I saw this  particular

scene  on  television.  The  closing  scene  showed

people waving flags. Whose flags, Sir? The People's

Action  Party  flags! So it was a victory  for  the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, it occurs to me that the

Member   for   Tanglin  has  great  difficulty   in

producing evidence to substantiate his claim  that

there is party propaganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Sir, this was after the referendum was

over.   The   Supervisor  of  the  Referendum   was

announcing  the result. There has been a  tradition

that such announcements are made publicly over  the

loudspeaker to the people, because they  voted  for

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, we went through the same process after

the  referendum. Surely if the Member for

Tanglin - I  do  not know if he was there, I did not see  him

after  the result - he could have hobnobbed with  the

masses   and  listened  together  with  them,   and

rejoiced over the result together with them. It has

been  the  custom  always  for  the  Supervisor  of

Elections  to  make the announcement publicly,  and

not whisper it privately to a few friends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, regarding some films over T.V. There was no

T.V. then. T.V. started on 15th February. I do  not

know whether he is mentioning some other instance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the display of flags, we made a film,

and  there  were  occasions during  the  referendum

struggle when there were rallies for the Tunku.  We

took  a  lot  of  pictures - some  where  the  S.P.A.

brought banners.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> They were not shown.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> They were shown, and if the Member

wants, we are prepared to show him. We have sixteen

Berita Singapura, each lasting about ten to fifteen

minutes.  There were pictures with lots  of  S.P.A.

banners.  In  fact,  there was a  slight  confusion

between S.P.A. and A.U.P.E. banners. If he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



wants  to,  he  can come and see  them.  There  was

nothing  to  prevent  the S.P.A. on  the  day  the

referendum results were declared to come  out  with

their  flags and banners and mingle with the P.A.P.

banners.  The  Barisan  were  there;  they  brought

banners,  but they had to leave hastily before  the

results  were  announced.  So  they  now  have  the

opportunity of being filmed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore submit, Sir, that the Member for

Tanglin  has not yet produced tangible evidence  of

party propaganda as against government propaganda.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> The Minister for Culture has

not denied that there is such a television film and

that it was shown over the television programme.  I

can bring witnesses of people who were present when

we saw that film. We were surprised.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member for Choa Chu Kang

desire a vote?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Chang Sam indicated assent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I move simpliciter.

<br><br>5.31 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head D.49 - Ministry of Culture.

Amendment (3), Mr Ong Chang Sam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D.49 be

reduced  by  $10 in respect of item (2)  of  subhead

10.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this item is related to television. Here the Government is asking for a vote of $4,460,900 for providing furniture and equipment. According to the explanation given here, the T.V. Pilot Service was inaugurated on 15th February, 1963 and the Regular Service came into

being on 2nd April, 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we can see clearly that this House has

approved  two votes for this expenditure. In  1962,

this  House  already approved $3 million  for  T.V.

expenses.  On  18th June, 1962 the Government  also

asked  this House to approve $787,030 as  shown  in

Command  Paper No. 11 of 1962. Therefore,  the  two

votes  passed previously should be enough  for  the

Government  to  use on T.V. services. Fundamentally

speaking,  the emphasis should be on educating  the

people. The television services should not be  used

to  mislead  the people or as a means of propaganda

for the ruling Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since the 15th o February when the T.V. Pilot Service was inaugurated in Singapore, the Government have installed quite a number of television sets in the community centres. At the last sitting of this House, the Minister in his reply said that the Government had installed 78

T.V. sets in these community centres. At the  same

time, he said that the Government would install the

same



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



number of T.V. sets from then on in other community

centres. But can these T.V. sets bring any  benefit

to  the  people? We have to examine  this  question

closely. It is now four months since the setting up

of  television  in  Singapore.  During  these  four

months,  many guardians of households have advanced

their  views  on the T.V. services  and  they  have

pointed  out  the errors of the Government,  saying

that  the Government have been using T.V. for their

propaganda purposes for their own Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the T.V. programmes are normally on in the evening from 7 p.m. to about 11 p.m. This period is very important to certain people, especially to the students. As a result of the introduction of T.V., many students waste their valuable Time watching T.V. programmes and do not

concentrate  on  their  school  lessons.  This   is

especially  so in the community centres where  many

afternoon  session students do not  go  home  after

school.  They  just  loiter  around  the  community

centres  waiting  to see T.V. programmes.  Quite  a

good  number of parents have complained about  this

to  us.  They say that because the Government  have

installed T.V. sets in many community centres their

children  have not been returning home in Time  and

that   they  have  been  neglecting  their   school

lessons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we should remember that in the rural areas every family makes full use of its labour force. Some of these students have to help in the farm or look after the poultry after school. But as a result of the Government's installation of T.V. sets in community centres in the rural areas, these students do not return home in Time to help in this

sort  of  work.  Thus, the family as  well  as  the

students  themselves suffer a great  loss.  We  can

therefore  say that the period for T.V. programmes

is  already long enough, and yet the Government are

trying to introduce another channel, a second  T.V.

channel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I believe that the Government will be receiving complaints



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



and  they  will have to think twice about  this  to

ensure  that  the students pay attention  to  their

lessons. Instead of this, the Government are trying

to  extend  T.V. services. What is the Government's

intention? I think the Government intend to  extend

their  T.V. programmes to the rural areas in  order

to  propagandise their rallies and meetings with  a

view  to  the  next general election. But  whatever

they  do,  we  know  that the people  will  not  be

attracted  to  these  rallies.  That  is  why   the

Government intend to attract and induce the  people

to come to their rallies and talks by means of T.V.

programmes. The Conservative Party in England  also

used  this  means  and I believe  that  the  P.A.P.

Government  are also trying to emulate this  tactic

for their political publicity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Government are wrong in wanting such a great sum of money for T.V. extension. They should not be doing this. The vote asks for $4.46 million plus $3 million voted in 1962 plus $780,000 voted for 1961. Altogether the Government will have $8 million for T.V. purposes. Now this total sum of $8 million is the same amount as the house

assessment rates in the rural areas for  1961.  Mr

Speaker,  let us see Paper Command 6 of 1963,  page

81.  Under the heading of Rural Administration, the

sum  is  about  $8.5 million for  house  assessment

rates.  The Government are asking $8.2 million  for

T.V.  Why  can the Government not use this  sum  to

build  more  creches and other social amenities  in

the  more crowded areas to give more benefit to the

working  population? The Government have  not  been

looking  after the livelihood of people in the  low

income  groups. They are only interested  in  their

political future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the way in which the Government are squandering the money will not be forgotten by the people in the next elections. The Prime Minister's trips and his speeches here and there and certain American films of low taste are televised.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the P.A.P. came to power, the Minister for Labour inspected various community centres and ordered that all American publications should be confiscated because, according to him, these publications gave American imperialist propaganda and should not be allowed in the

community  centres. But in the T.V. programmes  of

today  the  Government  is  exhibiting  a  lot   of

American  films and other undesirable  films.  This

goes  to  show  that T.V. Singapura  is  unable  to

provide  its  own programmes. On the  contrary,  it

wants to extend the time of T.V. shows and thus  it

will  have  to borrow from elsewhere. That  is  why

quite a great deal of American films have been used

in   Singapore  T.V. programmes.  This   is   very

dangerous to the people of Singapore. This practice

is exactly opposite to what the Minister for Labour

has said in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, a little while ago when discussing the question of Radio Singapore. I said that the Government should spend more time on social welfare and not on their struggle for their own future political life. Dr Thio Chan Bee: Mr Speaker, Sir, the sum of

almost  $4� million is a very big sum to  spend  on

extension of television services at this Time. From

those  who have been watching television programmes

there  have  been  complaints that the  Government,

instead  of  spending more money on quality  films,

are  giving very, very old films, and educationally

the films especially for the children arc not quite

suitable.  I  saw a few of the films on  television

and  I  must  say  that young children  with  their

imitative faculties highly developed would be  able

to  follow  the creatures in the cartoons resorting

to  the use of axes to break down doors anti so  on

and  to  chase  one  another  with  very  dangerous

instruments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we know very well that the main purpose

of  television at this time is propaganda on behalf

of the P.A.P. We know very well that in the case of

the P.A.P., the Government and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>



the  P.A.P. are almost identical, because when  the

Prime  Minister  goes  on his rounds  visiting  the

people,  he  is greeted as the Prime Minister,  but

when he talks he attacks other Parties, making  him

appear  as a Party leader rather than the  national

leader.  So, how are people to know that the  Prime

Minister  appearing  in  television  is  the  Prime

Minister or the Party leader, because he acts as if

he  is  both  at  one and the same  Time,  and  the

Minister   for   Culture  himself  has   indirectly

admitted  only  a  few months  ago  that  the  main

purpose of television is to reduce the influence of

the Barisan in the rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Communists.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, by implication, that means

it  is really to put up the stock of the P.A.P. in

the rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> That is right.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> If that is the main purpose of

the  sense  of this item, I think it is not  proper

for  the  Party  in power a: this  Time,  with  the

general elections probably not far away ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Round the corner.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> --- to spend large sums of

money  to  bolster  up the party prospects  in  the

coming  general  elections; that is,  using  public

funds, I think, Sir, for wrong purposes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Chu Chu Kang ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> C-H-O-A Chu Kang. [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> --- spent a great deal of Time

arguing that we should not have spent more money on

television but that we should have no television at

all  .Sir,  he pointed out the evils of television.

Young  people  instead of going  home,  go  to  the

community  centres:  farmers' children  instead  of

staying  at home go to the community centres.  But,

the  Member  for Choa Chu Kang knows that  even  in

Communist China long treatises are written  to  say

that  the advent of television is to keep  up  with

the Times, so the people should have the advantage of  the  latest  of

scientific devices,  which  is television. So,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>



to that extent, the Barisan Sosialis is not only  a pro-Communist group  but it is outdated. It does not keep in touch with the latest advance in  Communism, because  in  Moscow  and in Peking,  television  is regarded

as an essential part of the people's life. Therefore,  for the Barisan

Sosialis now  to  claim that television is no good - and that is what a

great deal  of  the  argument  was  about,  because  some parents are

complaining that their children are not staying in their homes and are

spending their  time in the community centres, I can tell him that if he

tries  to say that the Barisan Sosialis would  like the  Government to

dismantle all T.V. sets  in  all community  centres,  I shall be  prepared

to  take Members  of  the Barisan Sosialis to any  community centre  to get

them to get up and say that  we  are going  to take away the community

T.V. sets, and  I am  quite sure, Sir, what the answer of the  people would

be. The Barisan Sosialis would probably  have to go to Jakarta to seek

refuge. Sir, this is quite simple. Just like radio, T.V. is one more weapon

to expose the falsehoods of the Communists. They  keep on  saying - they have

been saying for the  last  two years  - that the P.A.P. is exploiting

the people and has  done  nothing  for the people,  has  not  done anything

to improve the welfare of the people.  But what  is happening since T.V.

came? The people  arc seeing  houses. They see them visually and the  lie of

the  Communist propaganda that a  non-Communist Government  cannot  do

things  for  them  has  been exposed.  They  say there arc no clinics.

We  show clinics  being  opened.  They  say  there  are   no schools.

We show schools being opened. People  see that  in  community centres

in the rural areas  for the  first  Time  on TV. People  are  beginning

to realise - visual  evidence, concrete evidence - that unlike what the

Communists claim, that only under a Communist  society  can  life  be

better  for  the people,  they now say, yes, in a democratic society it

is  possible to create a better  life  for  the people,  and that is the

main motivation.  Because, Sir,  when  the project for television was

started while hon. Members were still in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>



Government,  they  were  quite  excited  about  the prospects  of

television.  But  since  they   left suddenly,  television has become

a  bad  thing,  a dangerous weapon to deceive the people. Why  is  it when

the  television project was mooted when  they were  still  in  the

government,  they  were  most enthusiastic about television? They

saw  in  it  a weapon  to educate the people, to teach them.  That

is  what we are doing now, teaching the people what is happening in

Singapore. For the first Time, they are beginning to see things which

were not possible to convey purely over the radio. So, Sir, I hope it

will  be made public that the Barisan Sosialis have now  come to a stag

e where they will deny  T.V. to the  ordinary people in the community

centres  who cannot  afford  T.V., that they are  now  demanding that

the Government should withdraw television sets because it is a waste of

Time and it is not fit for ordinary people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> On a point of

elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Minister give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Sir, as far as I understand my

colleague,  the Member for Choa Chu  Kang,  he  has

said  that the contents of television are no  good.

It is not television itself.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If the Member for Choa Chu

Kang  had  been misrepresented, I am sure he  would

have  got up to say how he had been misrepresented.

Mr Rajaratnam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I have got my notes here saying

that  farmers are complaining that their  children,

instead  of helping them in their houses at  night,

are spending Time in the community centres watching

television. Obviously, therefore, the Barisan  line

is   that  children  of  farmers  are  not  to  see

television. I hope this is a line that the  Barisan

is  taking, that they have come to a  point  where

they have now to argue that television is all right

for doctors who can afford



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>



television. Their children can see television,  but

as  regards children of farmers, the Government  is

wasting  money  providing a television  service  in

community centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again he says that the television programmes

fall  far short of expectations. We have only  been

four  months on television. People are trying hard.

We  are  short of money and some of the  programmes

are not up to standard. But it is not quite true to

say, as the Barisan Sosialis has just claimed, that

we  show  only American films. It is true  we  show

American  films,  but we also show  Chinese  films,

Indians films, Indonesian films, Malay films, Malay

programmes. It is difficult to get Malay films,  so

we spent more money putting forward live programmes

which  cost  six  or  seven  Times  as  much,  even

sometimes  ten  Times as much  as  getting  feature

films on hire -  old films - but again I have said that

we hope that as our people become more experienced,

they will be able to produce better programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I quote, Sir, that even the Barisan Sosialis,

after  making all this denunciation of  television,

find  it  convenient from Time to Time to refer  to

television?  Recently, we had  a  T.V. forum.  The

leader  of the Barisan Sosialis came to the  forum.

If  he thought it was an instrument of reaction,  a

waste of Time, a waste of public money, why did  he

come  up  to  the television forum? And the  latest

issue  of the Barisan referred with great pride  to

what  happened  at the T.V. forum.  They  used  the

programme  as  an argument in their favour - "It  has

been  noted that three M.P.s in the T.V. forum have

similarly suggested that Malaysia had been rushed."

So,  Sir, when television suits their ends,  it  is

good  television; but if it does not, then  let  us

deprive  the  people  of television.  That  is  the

approach.  We  are  quite frank about  our  use  of

television. We use television, we use the radio, we

use  all  means of propaganda to defeat and  expose

the Communists; and this is a powerful weapon. As I

have  said before, Sir, we will continue to use  it

to  conscribe and defeat the Communists as we  have

done in the past.

<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with reference to the Member for Tanglin, I

am  not  quite sure what he said. After  regretting

that  we have spent $4 million, he went on  to  say

that  we should spend more money on quality  films.

If,  on  the  one hand, he believes that television

should  be improved by using better films, I  quite

agree with him. We hope there will come a Time when

with  the  introduction  of  commercial  television

there will be enough money for us to buy newer  and

better films and produce our own films. But this is

a  normal  part  of  our  expansion  of  television

service.  As  you  know,  the  television   service

originally  started off as a one and  a  half  hour

service.  Since  then, far from  what  the  Barisan

Sosialis  have to say. I have lots of letters  from

people  saying that they want more Time.  They  say

that  three hours are not enough. The Chinese  want

more  programmes; the Indians want more programmes;

the  Malays  want more programmes and the  English-educated  want more time. Therefore, the  expansion

which  has  been foreseen is now taking place,  far

sooner than we expected. So this money is to ensure

that  expansion takes place as rapidly as possible;

and  I am quite sure the Member for Tanglin did not

really  mean  what  time said  when  he  said  that

cartoons  had a bad effect on children. I am  quite

sure  in  his school he must have provided  Grimms'

Fairy  Tales to school boys. There are more horrors

in  a  Grimms' fairy tale than in one of our modern

cartoons, because modern children are bright enough

to  be  able  to  distinguish between  fantasy  and

reality,  and  I  am quite sure that  none  of  the

cartoons  really  have  an  adverse  influence   on

children.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

think  I want to waste too much Time because  there

is  a very important motion coming after this.  But

realising. Sir, that it is no use arguing too  much

and too long with the Government side when they are

determined to run the thing through, I want to  say

this. If the Government had spent with as much



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>



sense  of  urgency the huge sums of money to  avoid

the  water shortage, there would have been no water

shortage, but when it comes to election propaganda,

money is available and it must be spent quickly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

a  while  ago, I pointed out to the House that  the

present  T.V. service is more than sufficient  and

that there is no necessity for further expansion of

the T.V. service, but the Minister for Culture said

that we are opposing all the T.V. services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have pointed out, another point is that the

Government make use of T.V. for political purposes.

On  28th  June, 1962, when this House was  debating

the  First  Supplementary Development Estimates,  I

asked the Acting Minister for Culture, that is  the

present Minister fur Finance, to assure this  House

that  the  T.V. service should not be used  by  the

P.A.P. as a sort of political propaganda.  I  also

pointed  out  on  that  occasion  that  the  Acting

Minister  for  Culture  should  give  us  such   an

assurance, but he did not and dared not  give  such

an  assurance. Therefore, this clearly  shows  that

the  P.A.P. are only interested in their  political

propaganda  and not in educating and informing  the

people  but  only  in their political  future.  The

Government  feel that the present T.V. service  is

not  sufficient, and therefore they have asked  for

another $4 million approximately to expand it. This

will be a great loss to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister said just now that when I was in the P.A.P. I said that T.V. was a good thing and that it should be started. This is wrong. When we left the P.A.P., the Prime Minister saw me and the Member for Upper Serangoon and we talked for more than three hours in his office. At that

Time, the Prime Minister said that all the measures

and  policies can be put to the people through  TV.

The  Prime Minister then requested us to give  very

careful consideration to this problem. However,  we

told  him  that propaganda through T.V. could  not

deceive the people, that it would only increase the

misery and hardship



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



of the people and that therefore this would be

a waste of public funds. If the Prime Minister were

here,  I hope he would rise up and confirm this  if

he has the courage to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as responsible representatives of the people, we have a duty to keep a check on the actions of the Government, so that money derived from the people will be spent for the benefit of the people and not for the benefit of the Government.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not

really  intend to get involved in this debate,  but

since  my  name has been used in vain,  I  think  I

should say a few words of clarification. The Member

for  Choa  Chu  Kang  said  that  he  asked  for  a

guarantee which I dared not give. The guarantee  he

asked for was mat T.V. should not be used for party

propaganda. Sir, it is just like asking  a  man  to

guarantee not to beat his wife with a big stick. It

is  obviously  an  irrelevant and  loaded  sort  of

guarantee  and I treated it with the contempt  that

it   deserved.  My  colleague,  the  Minister   for

Culture,  has repeatedly said that if  the  Barisan

Sosialis or the Member for Tanglin has any concrete

example that any particular programme is being used

for P.A.P. party propaganda, please let us know.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Will you appoint a Commission?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I am really surprised to

learn  that  the Party appointed the Commission.  I

thought  it  was the Government that appointed  the

Commission.  And as my colleague, the Minister  for

Culture,  said, the Government make no apology  for

using   the  instruments  oil  all  the  media   of

publicity  to  put forward their  policies  to  the

electorate.  It  is  his duty.  And  if  we  do  it

effectively to the discomfiture of Members  of  the

Opposition, well, it is too bad for them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I think it is necessary to make it

clear  once  and for all that so far in  all  these

discussions  we  admit that we use  the  radio  and

television  to publicise and put forward Government

propaganda  and Government views, but  never  party

interests.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>



We  have  challenged them time and  time  again  to

produce  arty single bit of evidence where T.V. or

radio has been used for purely party propaganda. We

have  our  own  newspaper as far as  our  Party  is

concerned.  They have beaten about  the  bush,  but

nobody has yet produced a single bit of evidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Choa Chu Kang really gave

the  game away. He said that he talked to the Prime

Minister  during the break, not before  the  break.

Long  before  that, the Government had  decided  to

launch into T.V. and there was no dissenting  voice

then.  It was during the break that he went to  see

the  Prime  Minister to say that propaganda  should

not  be  used  to deceive the people. That  is  the

Barisan Sosialis type of propaganda. Our propaganda

is  used  to  expose those people who  deceive  the

people as well as to educate the people and that is

the crux of the problem. What really annoys them is

that their deception is Time and Time again exposed

over  television  and  the  radio  to  their  great

discomfiture and also to their gradually  declining

prestige among the people.

<br><br>6.12 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Head D.51 is Defence Services. In our present Constitution, defence services and foreign affairs are the responsibilities of the United Kingdom and therefore we, the people of Singapore, should not shoulder these responsibilities. The Members of

this   House   are   elected  according   to   this

Constitution.  Before our present position  alters,

we  should not incur any expenditure to expand this

Regiment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year on 28th June, we had a very heated

debate  in  this  House  on  the  question  of  the

establishment  of  the Second Battalion,  Singapore

Infantry Regiment. On that occasion, the Government

asked  for $2 million for the establishment of  the

Second Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment,  and

that Development Estimate was approved in spite  of

our  strong  opposition. Today, the Government  are

asking  for  $3.8 million for the same purpose.  If

the  Government are going to use this sum of  money

on  other development projects, then we welcome it.

But the Government are now going to use this sum of

money   for   the  establishment  of   the   Second

Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since the P.A.P. came to power, among all the

pledges they made during the election, they had not

pointed out that they were going to use this sum of

money   on   the  establishment  of   this   Second

Battalion.  At that Time, they promised the  people

that  they  wanted  to  use all  the  resources  to

improve   the  living  standards  of  the   people.

However, not only do the Government now not  intend

to  carry  out their pledges, but, on the contrary,

they are going to do all sorts of things which they

did  not  promise the people during the  elections.

The request for provision for this Second Battalion

is   a  very  clear  example  of  the  Government's

intention.  The Labour Ministry has  published  two

publications.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>



The  first  one  calls on the people  to  join  the

Police  Force;  the second calls on the  people  to

join  the Singapore Infantry Regiment. It looks  as

if  the  P.A.P.'s industrialisation scheme has  now

been  turned  into  a scheme for expansion  of  the

Armed  Forces.  The Labour Exchange of  the  Labour

Ministry  have not told the people what  employment

they  have given them. Instead they have asked them

to join the Police and the Armed Forces. Singapore

is a small island with only 1.6 million population.

Is  it  really necessary that we should expand  the

Armed  Forces?  At present the U.K. Government  has

stationed  a  lot  of  troops  in  all   parts   of

Singapore.  The  Prime Minister last  Friday,  when

replying  to  the Member for Upper Serangoon,  also

pointed   out  that  the  British  Government   has

occupied  13,000  acres of  land  for  their  Armed

Forces.  Apart from the British forces,  there  are

also  Federation troops in Singapore. Last  Friday,

the   Minister   for  National  Development,   when

replying to the Member for Changi, pointed out that

there were 1,380 units of houses which are occupied

by the Federation troops. Therefore, in addition to

the  British  troops  in Singapore,  we  also  have

Federation troops stationed in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these troops, we also have local

troops - the  First  Battalion,  Singapore   Infantry

Regiment, established on 11th March, 1957,  by  the

then  Labour Front Government, which was  an  anti-people,  anti-worker, reactionary  Government.  The

purpose  of  forming  this Regiment  was  to  fight

against  the  people in Singapore. But the  P.A.P.,

which  professes to be an anti-colonial Government,

not only does not disband the First Battalion, but,

on  the  contrary, is doing all it can to establish

another Battalion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very good political lesson to the people

of  Singapore. We have seen that the P.A.P. has  no

intention whatsoever to improve the people's living

standards.  They  are now building their  political

future on the strength of the Armed Forces so as to

maintain  themselves in power. Can we say that  the

Loops at present in Singapore are not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>



sufficient? In fact, Singapore has become a  police

State  and a military State. Hence we can find  the

reason   for  the  establishment  of  this   Second

Battalion  by  the  Government. In  The  past  they

relied on the people's strength, but now they  have

forsaken  the  people and lost the support  of  the

people.  Their  very survival now  depends  on  the

Police   and  troops.  The  Government  have   also

anticipated  that  the  people  will  resent  them,

because   they  have  suffered  enough,   and   the

resentment  and dissatisfaction of the people  have

also   increased   day  by  day.   Therefore,   the

Government, in order to suppress the discontent  of

the people and to shore up the British position  in

this  area,  have found it necessary  to  establish

this Second Battalion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We the people of Singapore should not incur this

extra  expenditure. If this amount  of  money  came

from  their  own pockets, we still want to  object.

However,  this big sum of money has to be  paid  by

the people, and that is all the more reason why  we

should object to this request. This sum of money is

not  used  to  protect the people but  to  maintain

troops  who will be used to suppress the people.  I

do  not  know  whether, apart from  expanding  this

Battalion, the Government have the intention to set

up  a Third Battalion. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,  we

must  not  allow  the Government  to  increase  the

troops   to  suppress  the  people.  The   revenues

collected from the people should be spent on  their

welfare.  Now,  the Government is asking  for  $3.8

million,   which  is  equivalent  to  the   revenue

collected  from radio licences and vehicle  driving

licences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Member for Tanglin pointed out to

this House that when the people asked for money  to

be  used on development which is beneficial to  the

people,  the  Government replied  that  it  had  no

money. But now the Government are asking for a  big

sum  of  money  to support British imperialism  and

colonialism, and they are willing to be the running

dogs  of  British imperialism. They are willing  to

see the people suffer, and to see that there are no

opponents.   The  establishment   of   the   Second

Battalion only shows that the people will have more

misery and hardships in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>



future  and  that they will be suppressed  by  this

military unit. We, the people of Singapore, must be

united   to   condemn  the  Government   for   this

irresponsible  action  in establishing  the  Second

Battalion,  Singapore  Infantry  Regiment.  If  the

Government  are sincere in caring for  the  people,

then  we ask them to make use of this sum of  money

on  social  relief, because this sum of money  will

double  the amount at present available for  public

assistance  and other social welfare  purposes.  If

the  Government  are going to set  up  this  Second

Battalion by hook or by crook, then the P.A.P. will

not  be  able to avoid their responsibility in  the

future  and  the  consequences  arising  from  this

action.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, first of all, I

would  like  to  ask the Member for Choa  Chu  Kang

whether he thinks that the defence of a country and

its  internal  security  should  be  handed  to   a

colonial ruler. Perhaps he did not have the time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman (Mr Mammen): If the Member for Choa

Chu Kang wants to reply, he will reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, from what the Member for Choa Chu Kang has

criticised about this vote, we can only come to one

conclusion.  That  is, he is of  the  opinion  that

Singapore's defence and internal security should be

the responsibility of the British colonialists, and

not  that  of  the people through their  own  Armed

Forces.  Because, according to him, there are  many

British troops in Singapore, therefore, there is no

necessity to expand this Battalion of the  Infantry

Regiment,  and  there is no necessity  for  such  a

large  sum of money to be spent on it. His argument

is  that  we should leave our defence and  internal

security in the hands of the British troops. He  is

in fact speaking like a colonialist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, no nationalist with any self- respect, will allow his own county and its defence to be in the hands of a colonial government. The Singapore Government has been elected



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>



by  the  people themselves. The Battalion  that  we

have  established comprise the citizens themselves.

The  aim  of this infantry Regiment is to  shoulder

the  responsibility of internal security in our own

State.  It  is  necessary for  us  to  expand  this

Infantry  Regiment,  because  after  the  31st   of

August,   1963,   Singapore  will   have   achieved

independence  through merger and Malaysia,  thereby

becoming a part of an independent nation. As I have

already  pointed  out,  no nation  with  any  self-respect  will ever allow its internal security  and

defence  to be in the hands of any foreign country.

So  it  is necessary for us at the present juncture

to expedite the expansion of the Infantry Regiment,

so that by the 31st of August, we will have our own

troops  to shoulder the responsibility of  defence.

As  a matter of fact, the question of whether there

is  a  necessity for this Battalion arose last year

when  we  were debating the Supplementary Estimates

on  the Second Battalion. But for the fact that the

Member for Choa Chu Kang has seen fit to raise  the

question  again,  there is, in  fact,  no  need  to

repeat  the  arguments in reply  to  the  criticism

raised  at that Time and repeated now by the Member

for Choa Chu Kang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that the Labour Ministry has published two

booklets  calling upon the people of  Singapore  to

join  the  army and the police. What is wrong  with

that?  Any independent nation should have  its  own

Police  Force and Armed Forces. Is the  Member  for

Choa  Chu Kang suggesting that the Police Force  of

Singapore should be manned by foreigners?  Does  he

also mean that the Armed Forces of Singapore should

be  manned by foreigners as well, entirely  in  the

hands  of a foreign nation? Does he also go a  step

further to mean that we should leave the protection

of  the  lives and properties of our people in  the

hands of a foreign nation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also said that the intention of the Second

Battalion is to suppress the "people". I would like

to  ask him for a definition of "people". According

to  what  I understand, the word "people",  in  the

dictionary of the Barisan Sosialis, refers  to  the

Communists   and  those  elements  which   are   in

collusion with foreign Communist forces. So in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



eyes  of  these "people", the Armed Forces and  the

Police  would  be used to suppress  the  people  as

indicated  in their own definition. The Member  for

Choa  Chu  Kang says that the amount we are  asking

for  should be utilised in building more houses and

increasing public assistance. But I would  like  to

tell  him  this. If the pro-Communist  elements  do

less   to   instigate  political  strikes,  thereby

resulting  in the loss of employment for  thousands

of  people and cause untold misery and suffering to

their  families,  then there will  be  no  need  to

increase the amount of public assistance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, it is our contention that our State should

have  no  bases  for  foreign forces,  and  foreign

control  in a united Malaya. The Minister for  Home

Affairs  does not in his speech deny  what  I  have

alleged in my speech. It is obvious that we can see

that  the  First Battalion and the Second Battalion

have  their  Commandants  appointed,  not  by   the

Minister  for  Home Affairs, but by somebody  else.

Are  they appointed by the Prime Minister? In fact,

all  these officials and Commandants are not in the

hands  of  the Minister for Home Affairs.  Can  you

tell  us  in  whose hands and in whose control  are

these  people?  If the Government thinks  that  the

people  of Singapore are in the Armed Forces,  then

these  Armed Forces are forces of Singapore people.

Who are actually controlling these Armed Forces and

in whose interests are these Armed Forces intended?

It is obvious that the present Armed Forces are not

actually  in  the  hands of the people  themselves.

They   are   being   controlled  by   the   British

colonialists and the British rulers. In  fact,  the

Minister for Home Affairs is, on the face of it,  a

Minister  who  appears to have some  powers  within

himself,  but  in actual fact, the appointments  of

the  Commandants  and other Army Officers  are  not

within his powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, one of the Members of Parliament of the Labour Party of Britain came to Singapore on 17th April and he told the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>



Affairs in the presence of representatives  of  the

Press  that  if a nation still has its economy  and

Armed  Forces  in  the hands of a foreign  country,

then  that nation is still a neo-colonial  country.

In Singapore and Malaya today, can we ask, is there

true  independence? Even in the event of  so-called

Malaysia, Singapore will still remain in the  hands

of  the British rulers. The British/ Malayan Treaty

will still remain in force to protect the interests

of the British colonialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in the debate on Radio Singapore, the Minister for Culture talked about Communists; so did the Minister for Home Affairs. It was said that because the Barisan Sosialis

instigate  political strikes, it  is  necessary  to

establish the Second Battalion. From the  words  of

the  Minister for Home Affairs, we can see  clearly

that  the  Government  has established  the  Second

Battalion  in order to suppress legitimate  strikes

and  the  working  class. In the  struggle  of  the

workers,   strikes  are  forced  on   the   workers

themselves.  There is no question of Communists  or

no  Communists.  If  it is a matter  of  Communists

inciting political strikes, then how are you  going

to  explain  the strikes that are happening  within

the Ministry of Home Affairs itself? Can we ask the

Minister  for  Home  Affairs what  happens  to  the

strike  that  concerns the Special Branch  and  the

Police   Force?   Have  all  these   strikes   been

instigated by the Communists? It is clear that  the

working  class, in order to improve and  raise  its

living  standard, will have to resort to the  final

weapon of strike. But the Government has classified

strikes as "political" and "non-political".



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strikes that are organised by unions belonging to

the  Government are non-political, whereas  strikes

organised by unions that are not affiliated to  the

Government Party are political. But in the eyes  of

the  working people, it is clear what intention the

Government have in the establishment of the  Second

Battalion.  In fact, the Minister for Home  Affairs

himself  has  already indicated the real  intention

for the establishment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Second Battalion. So this Committee should

refuse to approve this vote that is being asked for

for the Second Battalion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,   let   me   explain  the   intention   of

establishing the Second Battalion. The  purpose  is

to  suppress  those traitors who try  to  sell  our

country  to  foreigners and  not  to  suppress  the

people. We can therefore understand why the Barisan

Sosialis  and  the people who toe  their  line  are

worried  about this, because they are  serving  the

interest  of certain foreign powers. Their  purpose

is  to  sell  out  our national  interest  and  the

interest  of  the  people to these foreign  powers.

They   would  like  to  see  Singapore  and  Malaya

controlled by foreign powers. That is why they  are

worried and are averse to the idea of setting up  a

Second Battalion. But the genuine nationalists  and

those who are law abiding and loyal to Singapore do

not have to worry about the expansion of the police

or  the  armed services. They do not have to  worry

about the consequences of this expansion. They  can

sleep  well without any worries, but to those  pro-Communist  elements and those who try to  sell  out

the  interest  of  the people of Singapore  to  the

Indonesian  Communists, it is, of course,  a  cause

for  concern.  The  process  of  suppressing  those

people who try to sell out their countries and  the

interest  of  their  people has  been  carried  out

periodically in many neutral Afro-Asian  countries,

for instance, in the United Arab Republic, Cambodia

and  India.  They  have suppressed  those  traitors

among them who want to sell out their countries.  I

would like to tell these people who want to try  to

sell out our national interest that we will use all

the  forces  available in Singapore  to  deal  with

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To such people like the Member for Choa Chu Kang,

whether  a country is truly independent depends  on

whether  it  is in the Communist bloc.  Only  those

countries in the Communist bloc are independent and

those   outside   the  Communist   bloc   are   not

independent  countries. Therefore,  to  argue  with

these people on whether Malaya is truly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



independent is only a waste of Time because we will

be  playing a harp to a cow - it will not be able  to

understand.  Malaysia,  when  established  on  31st

August,  would be an independent nation.  This  the

Member  for Choa Chu Kang cannot understand. Unless

and   until  Malaysia  joins  the  Communist  bloc,

according  to  the  Member,  it  will  not  be   an

independent country. But I would like  to  ask  him

one  question:  Is  Hungary  truly  an  independent

country?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Deputy Speaker, I am rather surprised that the

Minister  for Home Affairs a little while ago  said

that  he  was  playing a harp to a cow.  In  actual

fact,  he  is  not clear himself. His mind  is  not

clear  when he clearly states that the independence

of  a  country  depends on the  fact  that  in  the

country there are no foreign military bases, and in

the  field  of  economy  it is  not  controlled  by

foreign powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, to become a so-called independent Malaysia,

the   establishment  of  the  so-called  additional

Battalion  in  a  so-called  independent  Malaysia,

according to our view, the intention is to use  the

manpower  of  Singapore  to  be  colonial  puppets,

because  we  know  that if the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs  can recognise that an independent  country

is  one  that  does  not have  military  bases  for

foreign  powers, then we can say that the expansion

of  a  further Battalion is necessary, but we would

like  to point out that the purpose of this  is  to

suppress the people of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  I  cannot agree with what the Member  has

said.  I  cannot understand what his definition  of

"an  independent  country"  is.  He  says  that  an

independent country should be one that is without a

foreign military base in it. In my opinion, whether

a  country,  is independent depends on whether  the

military  base is there by consent of  the  country

concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Chairman.

We  seem  to  have  strayed  radically  beyond  the

amendment before the House, Sir. The discussion  is

not on the definition of "independence'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



It  is  not  a  question  of external  security  or

external  defence at all. The issue is  merely  the

formation of a Second Battalion and I do  say  with

respect ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman (Mr Mammen): The point of order

being?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The point of order is that the

statements  now  being  made  by  the  speaker  are

totally irrelevant to the issue and the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not think it is a point of

order,  but  I  was trying to make my stand  clear,

that  since  Head D.51 is on Defence Services,  the

Opposition and the Government Benches have gone  to

some  lengths to define what is "independence"  and

what is the purpose of defence, and so far they are

within  the limit of the defence services. Mr  Ong

Pang Boon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Whether a country

is  independent depends on whether it has the right

and  power to decide if there should be any foreign

military  base  or troops in it. If an  independent

country  is  of the opinion that its own  resources

and  financial  means are insufficient  to  protect

itself and needs the help of foreign forces to help

it,  then it is entirely within its power to invite

foreign assistance. If the country has the right to

make  such  a  decision, then  it  is  independent,

because the decision rests with it and the presence

of foreign troops is as a result of the decision of

the  country concerned. Just now I have  asked  the

Member  for  Choa Chu Kang whether  Hungary  is  an

independent  country. I would also ask  the  Member

for  Pasir  Panjang  whether Hungary,  Rumania  and

Eastern  Germany are independent countries, because

in  these  countries, foreign troops and bases  are

there not by treaties but as a matter of rights.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> Mr Ong Chang Sam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D.56 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 6.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 6 relates to the Pulau Senang Settlement.

I wish to ask the Minister for Home Affairs to tell

this  House how many persons are being detained  in

Pulau  Senang  Settlement  and  of  those  who  are

detained  there,  the longest for how  many  years,

what  crimes they have committed, and what are  the

conditions  for  their release?  I  also  wish  the

Minister for Home Affairs could tell this House the

actual facts regarding the incident in April  where

the officers in Pulau Senang were assaulted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As fair as I know, the Government has set up a

camp  to  rehabilitate  all  those  secret  society

members  who  were released, but it  makes  use  of

these  gangster members to take part  in  the  mass

rallies  and  on other occasions organised  by  the

Government.  If they did not present themselves  at

the  meetings, then their salaries would be cut for

three  days.  I  would like the Minister  for  Home

Affairs to tell this House whether there have  been

such incidents.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong Pang Boon, in Mandarin?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon (In English):</b> No, I do not

think so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not sure whether this is the appropriate time for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>



him to raise the first few questions and whether  I

should  answer  him here. The questions  about  the

number of detainees in Pulau Senang, how long  they

have  been  detained  in  Pulau  Senang,  and   the

conditions  for their release - those  are  questions

being  asked by the Member for Anson. So I think  I

should  reserve the answers when it  comes  to  his

questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the incident which happened in April, I

would  suggest the Member for Choa Chu Kang put  it

in  the form of a question and I shall give him  an

answer here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the last allegation, that those Pulau

Senang  detainees who have been released  into  the

Work   Brigade  Camp  have  been  asked  to  attend

government functions and all that, I wish  to  deny

completely the false allegation made.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I have visited

Pulau  Senang, Sir, and I have been struck  by  the

amount  of  work that has been carried out  there - a

very  considerable amount of work. I  was  informed

that  there  is  an  average of about  400  persons

there.  Sir, we want to remember that they are  not

prisoners.  They have never been convicted  by  any

court  of law. They are detainees detained by order

of   the  Minister  on  inadequate  information  to

convict  them  in  a court of law,  otherwise  they

would be produced in Court.



<br><br>7.12 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister, in the public interest, on suspicion detains them. And these arc the persons we call gangsters or who are alleged to be gangsters. One thing I want to draw your attention to, Mr Chairman, is that there is no right in law to make these people work, no right whatever; but with a now traditional capacity for intimidation, what in

China  is  called persuasion, the P.A.P. makes  it

plain  to these detainees that if they do not agree

to work, they do not have to but they will not come

out of gaol alive. It is very simple. We have power

to  detain  you for ever and a day,  not  like  the

Judges  of  this country who can only send  you  to

prison for life, which means 15 years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>



We  have  power to detain you for ever and  a  day.

Every  two  years  it  is  renewed.  And  so  these

detainees,  under  threat,  which  in  a  different

climate  would  constitute  criminal  intimidation,

volunteer  to  work,  Mr Chairman,  and  they  are

working in the heat of the day  - and I do say  heat,

Sir, of the day. They are working, I understand,  8

hours  a  day and I accept the assurance I received

from  the Commissioner of Prisons that they do  not

work  for  more  than 8 hours at very  hard  manual

labour;  and  they get paid, Sir. Do you  know  how

much they get paid?  - 10 cents a day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember in Japan, as a prisoner of war being

made  to  work at the same type of work  and  being

paid  10 Japanese sen a day which I never received,

because at the end of 10 days they exchanged it for

10  cigarettes for 1 yen, 1 cigarette  a  day.  But

here these people are paid 10 cents a day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, there are two things I want to draw your attention to, apart from having drawn attention to the fact that these persons have not been convicted. I know we are on Pulau Senang itself only and I shall limit myself to the issue there, and it is this, that there is a responsibility, where a person is not properly

convicted, for us to look after those families whom

we  deprive  of their bread winner.  I  think  that

there is a duty to maintain them reasonably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a second aspect and it is this, Mr

Chairman;  there is a duty on us to  pay  for  work

according to the value of the work, that is to say,

according  to  trade union rates. These  people,  I

repeat, are not prisoners. These are basic issues.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other matter, Mr Chairman - I was received with

every courtesy and shown, I believe, all round  the

island,  certainly all the places that I wished  to

see. But it is rather far away, and possibly it  is

not  often visited. I may be wrong in this,  but  I

came  away with a very strong impression of an aura

of   fear  in  all  those  detainees,  an  aura  of

helplessness and hopelessness, because they are  so

utterly  at  the mercy of every minor  official  on

that island. Their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>



release or their continued detention is at the whim

of  officials and is no longer subject to law. They

are  beyond the pale of the law. It is the rule  of

fear.  It  is  a  very unhealthy atmosphere.  I  am

informed, Sir, contrary to my fear, that, in  fact,

there  is  no cohesion between the different  gangs

from whom these 400 people are alleged to be drawn.

That  is  one  matter which I find it difficult  to

understand  and  which would like the  Minister  to

explain if he can; whether, in fact, bringing these

people  in  close propinquity over  a  long  period

subject  to not merely superior discipline  of  the

officers  from  the prisons but the  discipline  of

their  own groups does not build an esprit de corps

which  could  endanger our peace if  in  fact  they

are - as I have no doubt some of them are - drawn  from

secret society gangs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One final matter, Mr Chairman. It is a dreadfully

forlorn  spot, this wrongly named island.  I  would

like  to  hear  some  public  assurance  that   the

officers  in the Prison service, who are  condemned

to  do  part do their duty on that island,  receive

some  recompense in some fashion either by  way  of

special   leave  or  over-time  pay  because,   Mr

Chairman,   they  are  doing  jobs  not  originally

envisaged under the Prison service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think, in

fact,  some  of the points mentioned by the  Member

for  Anson have already been raised in the form  of

questions and I would be repeating the answers if I

were to answer him in detail now. But briefly, what

I  would  like to say is that prior to  the  P.A.P.

Government assuming office, the detainees who  were

detained   under   the  Criminal   Law   (Temporary

Provisions)  Ordinance had, in fact,  no  means  of

securing  their own release, because  there  is  no

scheme  for  rehabilitating  these  secret  society

members and what the previous Government did was to

lock  them up in Changi, three to a cell. Now, when

we  came  to  power we thought that this  state  of

affairs  was undesirable and that something  should

be  done  to rehabilitate these detainees  so  that

they  could be returned to society as normal  human

beings. Therefore, the Government appointed  an  ad

hoc committee



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>



in  December  1959  to  inquire  into   the

existing arrangements for the detention of  persons

under   the  Criminal  Law  (Temporary  Provisions)

Ordinance 1955 and to make recommendations for  any

modifications  or  alterations  of   the   existing

arrangements  and also to make recommendations  for

the rehabilitation of detainees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report of this ad hoc committee was submitted

in  January  1960,  and I would like  to  draw  the

attention of the Member for Anson to sections 6 and

7  of  the  said Report which can be found  in  the

Report  of  the  Prisons Inquiry Commission,  1960.

Except  for  some  minor  modifications  based   on

practical experience, the Government has, in  fact,

implemented  the  scheme for the rehabilitation  of

criminal law detainees or better known as the Pulau

Senang Scheme recommended by this ad hoc committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to say that detainees who go to Pulau

Senang  volunteer to go there and also  voluntarily

agree  to  work there. The work they  do  at  Pulau

Senang  is not punitive in any sense but  part  and

parcel  of  the  whole  rehabilitation  process  of

teaching   the  detainees  the  normal   acceptable

standard  of conduct in society and to  equip  them

with the necessary skills for making an honest  and

productive livelihood when they are released.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as I can say, it is very much of an

experiment, and I think only time can tell  whether

the  scheme  is really a success. But judging  from

the results since the implementation of the scheme,

I   would   say  so  far  the  results  have   been

encouraging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson just now mentioned about an

aura of fear in Pulau Senang. I just wish to repeat

what  the Director of Prisons replied to him,  that

is,  he went, in fact, at the wrong time. When  the

Member for Anson visited Pulau Senang, there was an

incident  which  happened just a  week  before  his

visit  where, I think, a warder or several  warders

had been assaulted `by some criminal law detainees,

and  consequent  upon  that, these  detainees  were

punished. They might have been sullen as  a  result

of that. Presumably that might



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



have  given the impression to the Member for  Anson

that  there was an aura of fear. But I have  myself

made  several visits to Pulau Senang, and I do  not

think  there  is  an  aura of fear.  In  fact,  the

detainees  were  very pleased to speak  to  me.  In

fact,  occasionally, they even raised  problems  to

me. I did not detect any aura of fear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the dependants of the detainees, if they

are in difficulty, they can always go to the Social

Welfare Department and public assistance is  always

given  to  them.  As  for  the  law  wages  of  the

detainees - and  I am sure the Member for  Anson  was

informed by the Director of Prisons - it is receiving

the  attention  of the Government. In  fact,  their

wages  have been increased to 30 cents a few months

ago.  I  think, since early this year, their  wages

have  been  increased to 30 cents  a  day  and  the

Government is considering further increases  if  it

can afford to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Government do recognise that the officers

working  in Pulau Senang are isolated from  society

and  therefore  merit  some  compensation  for  the

isolation  that they have to undergo. In fact,  the

Government  gives each officer $3 allowance  a  day

extra, and in addition to this the Government  also

gives each officer one day leave per week over  and

above  their  normal leave period. In other  words,

each  officer is entitled to two and  a  half  days

rest per week.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I am sorry if my little

speech  gave  the impression that I was criticising

the  concept of Pulau Senang. The fact that  I  did

not  praise  it  is  possibly due  to  the  unhappy

infection  from P.A.P. traditions of  never  saying

anything nice about your opponents. The concept  of

Pulau Senang and the experiment of Pulau Senang  is

a  good  one. What I am criticising is that we  are

using  persons who have not been convicted  by  any

courts  as  slave labour. The Minister having  been

there - and   I  know  he  has  been  there - must   be

impressed  by  the  very  considerable  assets   in

buildings, vegetable gardens, irrigation works  and

the provision for water which are being constructed

by these detainees. And it is my submission, Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



Speaker,  that if you make a man work,

you  should pay  him  his  full wages -  what I call trade  union wages,

or   what   you   might   call   economic wages - deducting therefrom

the cost of his  enforced lodging  and the cost of his board.

That  would  be fair.  I  am glad to hear that it is 30 cents.  But you  know,

Mr Speaker, they do not  even  have  a canteen.

They  cannot  order  a  cup  of   coffee. Gangster or no gangster, Sir, if you are trying  to attract  them

to  a human way  of  life,  I  would suggest  a proper approach, and

from the  point  of view  of socialists and persons who believe

in  the trade  union  movement, I resent the suggestion  of using

persons detained by executive act  as  slave labour. I resent the

suggestion that we can  compel human beings to work at below

economic wage and let the Government benefit by it.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to see a canteen for these people from

which  they can purchase a few of  the  minor necessities

of  life.  I  would   like   to   see opportunities for them

to receive their families in the  island,  so  that it does

not  sound  so  bad, instead of being brought to some prison

in town for the purpose of their fortnightly meetings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the concept is a good one: do not let us spoil

it by being mean. I say that they  should be  paid  in  full

and I say that they should  have some human amenities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of volunteering, Mr Speaker, the Minister

was not completely frank with this  House. Perhaps he would like

to add that any detainee  who does riot volunteer to go to Pulau

Senang will  not be  released by this Government. That is a fact.

It is  made,  I gather, completely clear to  those  in Changi

that if you want to be released, you  first apply to go to Pulau

Senang. If you are a very good boy  there for one year or 15 months,

then  you  go back to Changi for a short period and then you

are released.   These  are  matters  that   have   been officially

brought to my attention, and  I  do  not think I am in any way

misrepresenting them. Sir, if you say to me, "You will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>



be  a  prisoner for the rest of your life, or  else work,"

and  I volunteer to work, need I  add  that that is a curious

concept of volunteering which  is peculiar  to  the  P.A.P.?

But  one  other  matter, Sir - apart  from this volunteering

aspect  that  the Minister has introduced - is that there are

some  who are  not allowed to volunteer. I wonder if I  might

be permitted to mention it under this heading. That is,

the non-Malayan citizens have no hope of  over being  released,

because they are  not  allowed  to volunteer for Pulau Senang.

Mr Speaker,  it  is  a very unhappy position we have been reduced

to, that Government can, at its pleasure, do more  than  our Judges

and keep a man in prison for longer than his own life Time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not sure the Government

has the power to detain a person for ever.  I  think there is a

limit to the  period  of detention,   I   think,  to   five

years.   Well, nevertheless, I will check that up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, first the canteen facilities for the detainees.

The  detainees  do  have  canteen facilities  to  purchase  cigarettes

and  tobacco, toilet  articles, confectionery and groceries.

The suggestion  by  the  Member  for  Anson  that   the detainees

should  be able to  purchase  meals  and drinks is, in fact, receiving attention now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as to the suggestion that the detainees should be

allowed to receive their families on  the island,  this  question has

been  gone  into  since 1961.  There  are  a  number of difficulties

quite apart  from  the difficulty of getting launches  to convey  the

families of these detainees  to  Pulau Senang  Island.  There  is  also

the  question  of security  and  also the construction  of  a  jetty.

Until  the  jetty is constructed, it  is  just  not possible  to  make

a  start and,  in  fact,  if  I recollect,  we  have, since the end of

last  year, managed to secure a launch for this purpose and  we are  now

just  waiting for the completion  of  the jetty   to  commence  conveying

the  families   of detainees to Pulau Senang. I must emphasise that as far

as these detainees are concerned, work is of  a voluntary nature, regarded

and accepted as part  of their training



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>



and rehabilitation process. In their case, work has a  therapeutic meaning,

and wages are  a  secondary matter. What they receive is regarded as a means

to provide them with a few extra amenities of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the Member for Anson's dispute that their work is voluntary. Sir, I do agree with the

Member for  Anson that detainees have been told, or it  is more  or less

indicated to them, that if they  want to  secure  their early release, they

must  go  to Pulau  Senang. That is accepted. Because how do  we assess

whether  a detainee is fit for  release  to society? How do we observe whether

the detainee has changed  his attitude towards society, has  decided to

reform and to make an honest living  if  he  is given a chance outside?

The only way, I suggest, is through the work that he does in Pulau Senang,

his behaviour  in  Pulau Senang; then  we  can  observe whether he has really

reformed. Therefore, work is, shall  we  say,  necessary, and,  in  fact,  it

is recommended by the ad hoc committee on Pulau Senang scheme - that is, rehabilitation

through work.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think there is some political

motive. We hear from the  Member for Anson that the detainees in Pulau Senang

should be  paid  the  rate for the job according  to  good trade union principles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson has even gone so far as to suggest

that the Government  is guilty  of employing slave labour in Pulau  Senang.

May  I, with  respect, suggest to the  Member  for Anson that this is completely

sanctimonious humbug. Let us view the concept of Pulau Senang in a proper light.

This  is  a  scheme to rehabilitate  secret society gangsters. It is not a matter

of the wicked P.A.P.  Government  catching  innocent  people  and putting  them

to do some slave work for the benefit of  the P.A.P. or the Government. Now. Sir,

let  us suppose  that  the  Government  is  so  absurd,  so ridiculous, as to

accept the proposal of the Member for  Anson and pay these detainees in Pulau

Senang the  rate for a job - let us say, $4.50 for unskilled labour,  going  to

$8.50 for masons,  and  so  on. Surely, he will understand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>



that  if this were the case,  then  there would  be a standing invitation to

members  of  the public to join secret societies and thereby to  get a remunerative

career in Pulau Senang with food and everything thrown in. The purpose of the work

that they do is not for the Government to make money out of  it. If they rear poultry

and collect eggs,  the eggs  do not come to the Ministers on the breakfast table;

the  benefit goes back to the detainees  in the  form of more amenities for them.

But the  main thing is to impress upon these people that work  is creative  and  is

of  value  to  society  and   to inculcate in these unfortunate young men  pride  in

work and a sense of social responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one matter connected with the

scheme which has not been mentioned, that is the follow-up work  on detainees in Pulau

Senang. After they have had   a  good  record,  shown  responsibility   and leadership,

they  are given a trial  in  the  Work Brigade  camp  where I must say that many  of

them have  proved  to  be very creditable  members.  The particular camp which graduates

of Pulau Senang  go to, I think, is the most efficient camp in the Work Brigade.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, the courteous effort of the Minister for Home

Affairs  to  answer   my criticism had, for a moment, made me forget that we were

in  a  Chamber dominated by the P.A.P.  I  am indebted  to  the  Minister  for

Finance  for  his Alibanesque   contribution  to  the   debate.

The "sanctimonious humbug" of which he speaks  is  very apt  to those who can

speak of pride in work  being paid  30 cents a day whilst your family starves

on social welfare pittances. That is the kind of pride in  work  that the P.A.P.

can speak about. That  is the kind of men they say they produce, men who take a

sense  of  social responsibility - whilst  their families starve, they sweat at

hard labour  in  the sun  with  pick  and shovel and get  paid  by  this beneficent

Government 30 cents a day. Mr  Speaker, what  kind  of  self-respect do you think

you  can build  in  a  human being like that? What  kind  of attitude  do  you think

you can build  in  a  human being like that towards a society which treats  him in

that fashion? The Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>



for  Finance  refers  to  them  as  secret  society gangsters. I would remind him that

not one of those men has been convicted by an impartial Judge.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson again expressed great

sorrow and sympathy for  the  families  of  these  detainees  in  Pulau Senang; he

said that they are neglected by society. May  I  ask  him  one question?

How  many  hundred dollars  does he suggest the Government should  pay to the

families of these detainees who he says have lost their livelihood as a result

of detention?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The answer, Mr Speaker, is that, if their detention

is necessary for the welfare of the country   according   to  this  Government,

their families should be maintained by this Government if they  have  not  been imprisoned

by a  court.  They should  be  permitted to earn enough to  give  them self-respect  so

that  they  can  maintain   their families. It is a very simple matter and it is  not beyond

our means.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> How much?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> This is all about

self-respect,  Sir, I must say I spent a rather exciting evening  at  the Aftercare

Association one  evening when  the Superintendent of Pulau Senang put  on  a concert

with  these gentlemen who posed  as  choir boys,  bandmasters, a seven-piece band, iron

drums and the rest of it. One of them is quite a maestro. He  is better than Walter Mitty,

Danny Kaye. All  I can tell the Member for Anson is that my experience of  these gentlemen

is that they are not lacking in aplomb. What they lack is the opportunity to do the right

thing  for themselves and for  society,  and perhaps  if  he would spend some Time  giving

some patronage   to   this   very  deserving   Aftercare Association to which other members

of the Bar



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



subscribe from time to time, he might help a few to come round the bend. After all,

I know it is always his  fervent belief that if you can get a man  off, he is innocent;

but if he is in, well then, that is too  bad, because that means he could not  pay

the lawyer  enough to get him off. However, I  hope  he will  make some effort in getting

real self-respect into  these men because I think they have got  good stuff  in  them.

I promise the Member  for  Tanglin that  we will put on Pulau Senang at the next  T.V.

show  and  that there will be no P.A.P. symbols  on the drums.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, most of the

Malaya. In fact, they were down for banishment.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would ask of the

Minister:  if they are to be banished,  whether  in

fact  it  takes  more  than  four  years  for   the

machinery  of banishment to take effect.  That  can

hardly be the explanation. And whether it is really

the policy of this Government that a person who  is

not  a  citizen of the Federation or Singapore  and

who  is suspected of being a gangster should remain

in prison indefinitely.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the delay is

not on the part of the Government. In fact, all the

necessary procedure is completed and the difficulty

is  with  the recipient country. If the Member  for

gone in no time.

<hr size="2" noshade>



* Questions 6 and 7, standing in the name of Mr David Marshall, reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr David Marshall asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the detainees at

Pulau Senang are required to work; what are the hours and nature of work; and

whether and at what rate they are paid for such work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr David Marshall asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether all or

only selected prisoners detained under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions)

Ordinance are sent to Pulau Senang, and what are the principals of selection.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Anson  is perhaps unaware that the  Government

had  appointed an ad hoc committee to inquire  into

the  existing  arrangements for  the  detention  of

persons   under   the   Criminal   Law   (Temporary

Provisions)   Ordinance.   1955,   and   to    make

recommendations for their rehabilitation. Since the

submission of this Report in 1960, except for  some

minor modifications, the Government has implemented

the  scheme for the rehabilitation of criminal  law

detainees recommended by this ad hoc committee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detainees who go to Pulau Senang, as I have

said   just   now   during  the   debate   on   the

Supplementary Development Estimates, volunteered to

go there and also voluntarily agreed to work there.

Detainees  who  are eligible at present  to  go  to

Pulau   Senang  are  Singapore  citizens,   Federal

citizens, and Federation born persons. They have to

be medically fit to proceed to Pulau Senang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detainees under 17 years of age or over 50 years

of  age  or  persons suffering from, say,  leprosy,

would  not be sent there. Provided they are willing

to  go  and  their conduct and behaviour at  Changi

Prison  have been satisfactory, eligible  detainees

proceed  to Pulau Senang in turn according  to  the

date  of  their arrest. Those who are  citizens  of

other  countries  are not sent to Pulau  Senang  at

present  but  remain at Changi. Those of  them  who

voluntarily request permission to return  to  their

country  of  origin  are free to  do  so,  and  the

Government is prepared to pay for their expenses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pulau Senang is not big enough to accommodate all

criminal law detainees at the same Time. The number

of  detainees to be rehabilitated is large  and  as

long as there are Singapore born or Federation born

detainees  waiting to be sent to Pulau Senang,  the

Government policy is to rehabilitate them first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our duty towards these misguided, embittered, and

maladjusted secret society gangsters is  to  return

them as better and more useful members of society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Pulau Senang detainees go to work from 7.30

a.m. to 11.30 a.m. and from 12.30 p.m. to 4.30 p.m.

on  week days; and from 7.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. on

Saturdays.  They do not work on Saturday afternoons

or  on Sundays or public holidays except for normal

domestic  maintenance.  Certain  projects  such  as

jetty  construction are dependent on the tides  and

it  may  be necessary for detainees to work outside

the   above   hours  for  which  they   are   given

compensating  time off. No detainee is  allowed  to

work  in  excess of 44 hours per week  without  the

written authority of the Director of Prisons.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All detainees at Pulau Senang are paid 30 cents a

day which is higher than the rate paid to convicted

prisoners. The Government is considering a  further

increase  in the rate of wages of these  detainees,

but, as I have said just now, it must be emphasised

that  as far as these detainees are concerned, work

is  of  a voluntary nature and accepted as part  of

their training and the rehabilitation process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When detainees have gone through the

rehabilitation  process  at  Pulau  Senang,   which

averages  about  18 months to two years,  they  are

released from detention and are sent on supervision

orders to the Work Brigade Camp at Jalan Damai  for

the   final  rehabilitation  stage.  So  far,   394

detainees  have successfully been rehabilitated  at

Pulau Senang. At the Jalan Damai Work Brigade Camp,

they live, work, receive board and lodging and  pay

like  other  members of the Work Brigade  and  have

access to the community as a whole. They return  to

their families at weekends. After a period of three

to six months, their stay at the camp is officially

ended,  but a number of them so like their new  way

of living that they volunteer to continue to remain

as  Work  Brigade  members at the  camp.  The  rest

return  to their homes and to society free to  come

and  go, subject to easy supervision conditions for

a  short period as a final test as to whether their

rehabilitation is complete. And they are now better

and more useful members of society.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> May it please you. Mr Speaker, many

matters  are  raised by the reply of the  Minister,

but  could  I  start  with the  question  of  other

nationals? Do I understand this correctly to be the

true position, that those who are not Singapore  or

Federation citizens have no hope of ever getting to

Pulau   Senang   because   of   the   pressure   of

accommodation there. Shall we put it that way,  and

that, therefore, in view of the policy indicated by

the Minister that he cannot assess their fitness to

be  released  unless they go to  Pulau  Senang,  it

means   that  those  who  are  not  Federation   or

Singapore  citizens have no hope of being  released

at all? Is that the position?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, they can

choose  to go back to their country of origin,  and

the   Government  is  prepared  to  pay  for  their

expenses.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I do wish the Minister would give a

straightforward reply. The answer  is,  "Yes,  they

have no hope of being released in Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the second question is this: Are they all

individually  informed and do they understand  that

"payment  for  labour" the Member is  referring  to

payments for work done by the detainees as part  of

their rehabilitation scheme. If so, the amount paid

out  in this respect up to 31St December, 1962, was

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to move

the motion standing in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly views with concern the progress

made  by the Singapore Government in its talks with

the   Federation  of  Malaya  Government   on   the

financial   arrangements  relating   to   Head   17

(Finance) of Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961.*



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The same motion also stood in the name of Dr Thio Chan Bee.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to take this opportunity to thank the

Prime  Minister for allowing me the opportunity  to

move  this  motion at this particular  juncture.  I

would  not like to say that this is indeed  a  very

tactical move on his part having this motion to  be

considered at this Time so that some Members of the

Opposition  would  have  less  Time  to  think  and

prepare  their  speech  for the  main  debate -   the

Budget speech of the Minister for Finance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of elucidation. The

tactical  objective, Mr Speaker, Sir,  is  not  to

deny  the Member for Cairnhill Time to prepare  for

his   Budget  debate  but  in  order  to  get   his

unqualified  support  in my negotiations  with  the

Minister for Finance in Kuala Lumpur.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I have said that the

tactical move could not be aimed at me because I am

ready  for the Budget even if it were to take place

now  before Time, but I did say that it could react

to   the  disadvantage  of  some  Members  of   the

Opposition  who are new to this parliamentary  move

on  the part of the Government. Be that as it  may,

let me come to my motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the operative word here is "progress", and I

can  understand that there is a divergence of views

on the meaning of "progress". English, Sir, is such

a difficult language to understand that sometimes

a  word can have two or three meanings. The meaning

that  I  want  to imply in this word "progress"  is

not,  shall  we say, the terms of an  agreement  or

disagreement  that have taken place in  the  Inter-Governmental Committee. What I mean to imply by  my

motion  is  the  rate of progress,  to  come  to  a

finalisation  on such an important issue  on  which

hangs the coming into existence of Malaysia on 31st

August, 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister in his statement this

afternoon disclosed that there has been  a  lot  of

hard bargaining going on, and we do sympathise with

him  that there has been this hard bargaining.  But

what we find it difficult to forgive him is the way

in   which   he  hoped  to  circumvent  this   hard

bargaining. He did say earlier this afternoon  that

he felt that it would not be appropriate to mention

in this House the discussions that have taken place

between the Singapore Government and the Federation

Government  on the financial talks that  have  been

taking  place since February. But what  I  fail  to

understand  is  this.  Why,  if  he  considers   it

inappropriate,  should he find  it  appropriate  to

give  statements  to  Press reporters  whenever  he

comes  back after his discussions in Kuala  Lumpur,

and  why  should he find it appropriate during  his

visits  to  the rural constituencies  to  tell  the

people what he thinks should be the right thing for

Singapore  and  what the Federation  Government  is

trying  to  do  to  Singapore  in  regard  to  this

financial arrangement. That is something  which  we

find it difficult to understand.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have great respect for the intelligence of

the  Prime  Minister, but we find it  difficult  to

appreciate  this  intelligence  when  he  tries  to

negotiate on matters of national issue through  the

Press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will remember that the Prime Minister has

been giving statements to the Press on matters that

have been discussed in Kuala Lumpur. The statements

at Times prove very confusing reading. At one Time,

we  read that the Prime Minister was going to fight

to the bitter end and the very next morning we read

in  the papers that the Prime Minister said, "There

is  nothing  wrong.  Things can  be  settled  quite

amicably." This brought confusion in the  minds  of

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one of the things I want to focus attention on

is  this:  the  Prime Minister  is  very  adept  at

propaganda,  while the Minister for  Culture  says,

"What  is  wrong, if we are good at this particular

game  to  knock out the Communists?" I  agree  with

him.  There  is nothing wrong there.  But  what  is

wrong  is  this:  the  Prime Minister  is  fond  of

indulging  in  propaganda hoping to reap  political

capital  out of propaganda based on something  that

is not correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us take the most important Press

statement which he gave some months ago. I think it

was  after the March or April sitting. He gave  the

impression -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I have the date and Time

of  the  Press report? I have got all the  cuttings

here.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there have

been  so  many  Press statements, one contradicting

the  other, that I find it difficult to  quote  any

Press  statement at all, but I can  give  here  the

impression  that  the  Prime Minister  intended  to

create in the minds of the people of Singapore.  If

he  felt  that  the  people in  Singapore  were  so

foolish  as  to swallow his propaganda, hook,  line

and sinker -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir, I

think  you have made it a rule once on a  point  of

order  that  when a Member quotes from a newspaper,

he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



must  produce it and give the page and the date.  I

am  sure  that if the Member for Cairnhill  is  not

prepared  with  Press cuttings.  I  have  here  the

complete set since the arguments began, and I  will

be  obliged  if he points out to me the  particular

passage which offended him.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am not aware that the Member for

Cairnhill was actually quoting from a newspaper. He

was actually talking from memory.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> He was guessing!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I do not wish to quote any

words of the Prime Minister which I consider to  be

misleading, but what I do wish to say here  is  the

effect  of the statements of the Prime Minister  on

the minds of the people of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On the S.P.A.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Prime Minister has all

the  Press cuttings and he can go through them  and

show  where  I  am wrong. The most important  Press

statement he gave was this, "Ah, that monster,  the

Minister of Finance in Kuala Lumpur, wants to  take

all  the money from Singapore and to creep  in  and

milk  Singapore  in order that our social  services

will  go  abegging."  That was the  impression  the

Prime Minister created. We got that impression,  so

much  so  that  we  even swallowed  that  wonderful

propaganda.  We felt, "Oh, God, our Prime  Minister

is  right.  There is no reason why  the  Federation

Finance Minister must take all the Federal  tax  in

Singapore  and  control us from Kuala  Lumpur."  We

felt  sorry for him and we took that line. We  said

that  he was right. The Federal taxes collected  in

Singapore must remain in Singapore. We felt that he

was right, but we -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on a point of

clarification.  I  think the Member  for  Cairnhill

will  save Time in this debate if I were  to  refer

him to page 1 of my statement, the first memorandum

on  the 18th March. If he will look at page 2, sub-paragraph   4,  the  sum  total  result   of   that

memorandum was that we owed the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



Federation money. At the end of the accounting,  as

a  result  of  this process, we found ourselves  as

debtors  to  the  Federation  Government  and  they

generously   waived  the  debt  and   our   surplus

disappeared. I am not a financial expert.  I  think

the  Minister for Finance can take the  Member  for

Cairnhill  through all the various  intricacies  of

the arguments. But the sum total result is that  we

owed the Federation money.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  assure the Prime Minister that I can  never  be

confused by any attempt on his part to try to bring

up  irrelevant matters. I have mentioned  that  the

impression he meant to create in the minds  of  the

people  was  that the money collected in  Singapore

will remain in Kuala Lumpur.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, the first proposal.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Is that not so?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> He wanted to give that

impression.  But  the  actual  truth,  as  in   his

statement   here,  was  that  all   Federal   taxes

collected in Singapore shall remain in Singapore in

a  neutral fund. That was what was decided, was  it

not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That was after quite some

time.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the very capable Minister

for  Finance, who has been a very obedient listener

of  "His Master's Voice" shall have his opportunity

to  reply to me or enter into this debate when  the

time  comes.  Just  because  His  Master  has  said

something,  he  keeps on saying "After  some  time,

after  some  time." He need not  have  to  nod  and

repeat His Master's Voice so obediently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the impression given to the public was that,

and  that we now find is the wrong impression,  but

what  was  more objectionable to us was  this:  the

Prime  Minister went out saying, "You  know  it  is

because  we  have a P.A.P. Government that  we  are

fighting the Finance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>



Minister in Kuala Lumpur. Had this Government  been

an  Alliance Government, the Alliance Government in

Singapore would have sold the rights of the  people

of  Singapore  to  the Alliance Government  in  the

Federation." This is what he said, but I  say  this

in   all  seriousness,  had  it  been  an  Alliance

Government in Singapore, we would have got a better

deal,  because  we would know how to negotiate  and

how   to   present  the  case  of  the  people   of

Singapore - not in the way the P.A.P. Government  has

been presenting the case of the people of Singapore

and  not  in  the  way the Minister for  Culture - in

spite   of  all  the  culture  that  he  tries   to

indoctrinate into the people of Singapore - keeps  on

talking  about,  something which I could  not  even

catch,   although  he  knows  that   he   has   the

opportunity  to say what he wants  and  I  have  an

opportunity of replying, because this is  a  motion

in my name. I would invite the Minister for Culture

to  say  what he wants when the time comes, but  he

should  not  be  so uncultured as to  try  and  say

something  which I cannot even hear  and  reply  to

him.  That is what he said, had it been an Alliance

Government,  we would have sold the rights  of  the

people  of  Singapore.  Had  it  been  an  Alliance

Government,  we  would have got a better  deal.  In

fact,  it  could  be proved when the  next  general

elections  take place and the Alliance takes  over.

Then we will see whether we get a better deal or  a

bad deal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I said in my speech on Friday that the name

of the P.A.P. stinks worse than manure. But because

the  P.A.P. Ministers are so conceited, they refuse

to see the truth of the situation. They do not know

that  they  stink. They think that by  laughing  it

off, people can forget that the P.A.P. stinks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance seems to think that

what we think is wrong. May I therefore ask him  to

have  a by-election in Sembawang tomorrow? Do  not

laugh it off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We cannot have two Members standing

up. Let us hive some order. Is it a point of

elucidation? Will the Member give way?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Have the Sembawang by-election

tomorrow? The Member had been the Chief Minister of

Singapore.  Surely he knows that  there  are  legal

processes - nomination day, polling  day,  notice  of

contested  elections, and so on. I mean, cannot  we

have  some sense from the former Chief Minister  of

Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, as I have said, the English

language  is difficult to understand. When  I  said

tomorrow,  I  mean  right away, and  if  he  cannot

understand  what tomorrow means, perhaps  he  could

consult  the Minister for Culture on what  tomorrow

means.  It  means that there shall  be  no  further

delay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance says surely there are a lot of other technical obstacles. What technical obstacles there

are, have  been  created  by  the P.A.P. Government for ten months!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then again the impression given by the Prime

Minister,  who  has  taken  upon  himself  to  give

statements  on  the discussions  on  the  financial

talks and brush aside his Minister for Finance, and

the Minister for Finance has accepted that brushing

aside   so   tamely  and  so  quietly.  The   other

impression given was this: Au, the surplus. The pre-Malaysia  surplus, not the surplus after  Malaysia,

but  the pre-Malaysia surplus. 1959, 1960, 1961 and

1962. That monster, the Minister of Finance of  the

Federation, wants to grab it all. But that  is  not

the  position. What is disclosed by this  statement

is  that the Finance Minister wants to grab it all.

But that is not the position. What is disclosed  by

this  statement  is that what the Finance  Minister

wants to grab is the surplus after Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> "Grab" - that is the right word

for it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We must have some sort of

order from the Government Front bench, otherwise we

will  never  get on. And I would suggest  that  the

Member for Cairnhill look at Mr Speaker.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> That is what he said, "wants to

grab".  Grab  is the impression he created  in  the

minds  of  the people, so I gave what my impression

was. We felt it was wrong too. We felt that Federal

taxes collected in Singapore should not be taken to

Kuala  Lumpur. We felt that pre-Malaysia  surpluses

should  be  the absolute property of the people  of

Singapore. We felt it so much that we went to Kuala

Lumpur  and  made representations. The S.P.A. made

representations that such things,  if  right,  were

wrong.  But  we were told there had  been  no  such

intention  at  all to take pre-Malaysia  surpluses.

There  is  no  intention at all that Federal  taxes

collected in Singapore should be sent up  to  Kuala

Lumpur and then the Singapore Government would have

to  go  to  the  Federation  Finance  Minister  for

dishing  out Singapore's proportion of the  revenue

for   its  own  budget.  Therefore  the  impression

created was all wrong. But then when we found  that

the  impression created in the minds was wrong,  we

began  to realise that this was nothing but  P.A.P.

first-class propaganda. They wanted to make it  out

to  the  people  of Singapore that they  fought  so

hard,  they  fought  so bitterly,  they  fought  so

consistently   that   money  from   Federal   taxes

collected in Singapore would remain in Singapore in

a  neutral  fund  and  that pre-Malaysia  surpluses

would  be  the absolute property of the  people  of

Singapore.  Why  did they play that  game?  Because

they  wanted  to make it appear to  the  people  of

Singapore, with an eye to the general elections  in

1964, that they were the champions of the people of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I do not blame the Prime Minister for

indulging  in  that kind of propaganda,  but  I  do

blame  him for this. That if we are a party to  any

negotiation,  it  is  the  first  requirement  that

either  party  should  not  do  anything  to  cause

embarrassment to the other party, so that there can

be  better  understanding, better co-operation  and

better  working  out of a solution  to  the  mutual

advantage  of  both parties. Instead of  which  the

Prime  Minister went out tearing hard at the  other

party,  that  is  to  say, the  Government  of  the

Federation of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>



Malaya,  making out that he was a great  hero.  And

could  we  say  that  it  was  as  expected,   that

retaliation   came   almost  forthwith   from   the

Federation side that the Prime Minister was talking

Out of turn, that the Prime Minister was trying  to

negotiate  through the Press, that what  the  Prime

Minister said was wrong; and not only that but they

went  so far as to let out a few skeletons  in  the

cupboard?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, that method of negotiation is all wrong

and  it is because of the manner in which the Prime

Minister  has indulged in trying to negotiate  with

the  Federation  Government that  I  have  felt  it

necessary  to  bring this motion to  the  House  in

order to put the Prime Minister on the right track.

You  can  only  negotiate in the quietness  of  the

conference  room,  each party giving  his  case  as

effectively and as forcefully as he can muster, but

not   to   come  out  in  the  Press   before   the

negotiations  were concluded one way or  the  other

and try to label the other party as a big bad wolf.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the statement given by the Prime Minister

today did not disclose that there was any intention

whatsoever on the part of the Federation Government

to  want  to  take over the pre-Malaysia surpluses.

And one more significant point in this statement of

the  Prime Minister is this. He kept on saying that

the   other  party  was  the  Government   of   the

Federation  of  Malaya,  but  in  all   his   Press

statements,  what  did  he say?  The  Minister  for

Finance,  the President of the M.C.A. But  here  he

did  the right thing. He had been negotiating  with

the  Government of the Federation of Malaya and not

with the Minister of Finance, Mr Tan Siew Sin, the

President of the M.C.A.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this statement also discloses the fact that

the  very  first  plenary  session  of  the  Inter-Governmental  Committee  took  place  on  the  28th

February, 1963, and then there were a few  meetings

in  March, then in April, and then again in May and

June.  Let  us  come  to  the  April  meeting.  The

Government  gave,  as  an  excuse  to  shorten  the

sittings of this Assembly last April, the necessity

of  the  presence  of the Prime  Minister  and  the

Minister for Finance in inter-governmental



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>



talks  in the Federation.  On  the  9th  of

April,  while  the debate was still raging  on  the

motion  in  connection  with  the  action  of   the

Government against subversives, the Prime  Minister

left  for Kuala Lumpur that evening. The very  next

morning, while the Member for Queenstown was  still

on  his  feet  talking right up to 6  a.m. in  the

morning,  the  Prime Minister was  safely  away  in

Kuala  Lumpur. Not only was he safely away, but  he

was  actually  engaged in a game of golf.  We  were

told that the reason why the Prime Minister and the

Minister  for Finance had to go to Kuala Lumpur  on

the  10th of April was that crucial talks  were  to

take place between the Government of Singapore  and

the  Government  of the Federation of  Malaya,  but

then because of the war that had been engendered by

the  Prime  Minister,  the war  in  the  newspapers

between  the  Prime  Minister  and  the  Federation

Minister  of  Finance, it led to a lot  of  unhappy

disclosures, so much so that a disclosure was  even

made - and that has not yet been denied - that  on  the

10th of April, the date that the Prime Minister was

to have a meeting in Kuala Lumpur on crucial talks,

he  was absent on the grounds that he was too tired

after  having  played  a game  of  golf  the  whole

morning.  I  did  not say it. But  it  was  in  the

papers. I will not quote it. The Prime Minister can

get  all  his  assistants to read it.  He  did  not

attend that meeting on the 10th ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I just would like to be

referred to the newspaper  - the cutting - because  I

have never on any occasion remembered my being  too

tired  to  attend a meeting because of  a  game  of

golf.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it the Member for Cairnhill

will  be  able to point out the exact news item  in

the newspaper.

Prime  Minister is confused. What I was saying  was

that  because,  of all this verbal warfare  between

the  Prime  Minister  and  the  Federation  Finance

Minister, a lot of awful disclosures



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>



came to light. It was said openly that  on

that  particular  day the Prime  Minister  did  not

attend  the conference as fixed because  he  had  a

game  of  golf  the whole morning. Of  course,  the

Prime  Minister  is free to deny  that.  I  am  not

speaking for the veracity of it. It has been said ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir. The

Member  says  it has been said. Where has  it  been

said? Show it to me and I will clarify. Please show

it to me.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think a Member is entitled to say

there   has   been  a  rumour  and  he  takes   the

responsibility for repeating that rumour.  If  that

rumour  happens to be wrong, then he becomes liable

for spreading a false rumour. That is all there  is

to it. Tun Lim.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It has been said and I say it

here. Of course, the Prime Minister can deny it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Bar, bar!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Is the Prime Minister going to

have a glass of beer that he wants to go to the bar

with me?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Let us come to the point - on

whose side are you?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Prime Minister wants to know

on whose side we are on. There can be only one side

for  any  political Party in Singapore - the side  of

the  people of Singapore. But it all depends on the

way that any political Party implements that vow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not going into the details of what has been

said  by the Prime Minister, what has been demanded

by  the  other side, and what has been demanded  by

this  side.  That is still left for  the  Singapore

Government to negotiate with the Government of  the

Federation of Malaya. But what I do urge  upon  the

Prime  Minister is this. It would be  most  foolish

and  suicidal  to  try  and negotiate  through  the

Press,   and   the   sooner  he   understands   and

appreciates  that,  the sooner a better  atmosphere

will  prevail in the Inter-Governmental  Committee.

Remember, Sir, about that meeting last April?  What

happened?  Nothing came out of it - it blew  up.  The

Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>



Minister,  according to Press reports,  - if  not  on

the 10th, then it must be the 11th or the 12th, you

can  see  it - the  Prime Minister according  to  all

that,  it was agreed that there should be no  Press

releases  other than an agreed Press  release.  The

agreed Press release was duly issued, but when  the

Prime Minister came home and after having been  met

by the members and reporters of the local Press, he

went  to town. He started calling names. He started

saying that this was wrong and that was wrong.  For

all  we  know, he may be right in saying all  those

things. But what I say is that it is wrong for  him

to  say  all those things. After having  reached  a

solemn    agreement   in   the   Inter-Governmental

Committee,  there should be no Press  releases,  he

gave  a  Press  interview. Then  there  followed  a

counter-attack from the Federation, and this  makes

sad   reading.  Sad  reading  to  the   people   of

Singapore. And what makes matters more sad was that

it   even  brought  the  Chairman  of  the   Inter-Governmental Committee, Tun Razak, to give a  Press

statement  rebuking our Prime Minister. Of  course,

the  Prime Minister can read that particular  Press

statement.  We all did see in it the  local  Press;

and   whether  that  rebuke  administered  by   the

Chairman  of  the Inter-Governmental Committee  was

deserved by him or not we have not as yet read  any

statement  from him denying that, or accepting  the

rebuke.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Sir, the Prime Minister is very

fond  of negotiating in public is this. Every  week

he goes round baby-kissing in the rural areas. That

does  not matter. He can go and kiss as many babies

as  he wants. Nobody minds that. But at every visit

of  his  to  the  rural constituencies,  he  starts

blaring  out "the trend of negotiations"  in  Kuala

Lumpur. Does he consider that it is a wise thing to

do? Or is he doing that with a particular political

purpose?  Surely,  Sir, as our Prime  Minister,  we

expect  him  to be more circumspect in  his  public

utterances; that, in so far as a national issue  is

concerned, he should try to represent the people of

Singapore  in  the  best possible  manner,  without

giving the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>



other side the opportunity nor the right to run him

down,  to  say that what he was trying  to  do  was

nothing but a political stunt. That is what he  did - going  round kissing babies and  disseminating

political propaganda. He visits the rural areas  as

Prime Minister. But in all his speeches it was  the

Secretary-General of the P.A.P. that was going  out

spouting political propaganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry, Sir, if I spent a little time going

through my notes, because ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Because you had nothing to

say.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> --- we did not expect that this

motion  would  come  up. But anyway,  what  we  are

against  is  not  what has been  discussed  by  the

Government, but rather the way in which  the  Prime

Minister has been handling this situation. Sir,  it

is now agreed, even the Prime Minister has said it,

that what is left to be settled is the question  of

apportionment:  how much to go to  the  Federation,

how much to go to Singapore. And also the ratio  of

distribution of post-Malaysia surplus. That is what

I  understand  from this statement.  In  regard  to

apportionment, Sir, I would like the Prime Minister

to  make a categorical statement in this House.  In

November  1961,  when  the  Prime  Minister  tabled

Command  Paper  33 for debate, he told  this  House

that  it  had  been  agreed  between  him  and  the

Federation  Prime  Minister that the  apportionment

would  be  on  the  basis of 25 per  cent  for  the

Federation, 75 per cent for Singapore. But it would

seem  from  this  statement here  today,  that  the

apportionment ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order, yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the exchange of letters

were  tabled in this House in which the phrase  was

carefully used, "that we shall keep more than three-quarters of our revenue." I think that paraphrasing

me  when documents have been produced in this House

does not help the debate. The motion is, "That this

House  expresses concern with the progress," and  I

cannot but join in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>



concern.  The  motion  is not  concerned  with  the

manner in which we have negotiated but is concerned

with  the  progress. And I would like to raise  two

points.   First,  that  the  Member  for  Cairnhill

confines himself, when he quotes from authority, to

the documents that have been produced at that Time;

secondly, that he confines himself to this motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I did more or less anticipate

all  these  difficulties and  I  did  hint  that  I

considered  that  the debate  on  this  motion  was

premature. The Prime Minister said he would produce

a  White Paper in due course. The debate could take

place  on  the  White  Paper. But  the  Member  for

Cairnhill  insisted, and now he  finds  himself  in

these difficulties. The Prime Minister, I think, is

correct  when he says that if there is to  be  some

reference  to a document specifically,  a  specific

quote should be made from that document, and not  a

mere  paraphrase. On the other point as to  whether

or not what has been said is relevant. I suppose it

is relevant in passing. That is all.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am not quoting from a

document, Sir,I said that was what he said  during

the  sitting  in November 1961. I do not  have  the

Time  to go through the Hansard. In fact, if I  had

wanted,  I  could  have the  Hansard  here  and  go

through  it  for five or ten minutes and  still  be

standing  on the Floor. But I do not want to  waste

the  Time of this House. That is what he said. That

was the impression we got: that the Tunku agreed to

an apportionment of 25 and 75.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No; I do not want to labour

the point, but I must raise a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> These documents are really the

subject   of  controversy  between  the  Federation

Minister  for Finance and us. And we  say  that  in

these  documents are set out the bases  upon  which

financial arrangements are to tie up Singapore with

the  Central Government. They are contained in  the

White Paper and in the exchange of letters. What it

means is there; its words are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>



very  simple  words. There has been a  considerable

amount of debate on that openly, which I think  has

been  to  the advantage of everybody. Now I suggest

that if the Member for Cairnhill wishes to talk  on

the  terms of the financial arrangements,  he  goes

back to the exact words which are contained in  the

documents produced in this Chamber.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I do not know whether I

find  it a pleasure that I have got under the  skin

of the Prime Minister, but it is no pleasure to me.

The  issue is of greater importance than the  Prime

Minister  or myself, than the P.A.P. or the  S.P.A.

or  the Alliance. The issue is that the interest of

the people of Singapore must be protected.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> If the P.A.P. comes out to

protect the people, we are with them, but we  would

not  be  a  party  to any political manoeuvring  in

order   to  embarrass  the  other  party   to   the

negotiations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said that this motion was brought in

aimed more at the manner in which negotiations have

taken place, but if the Members of this House  wish

to  take  this opportunity to have it out with  the

Government   for   the  terms   of   agreement   or

disagreement,   I   cannot   prevent   them;    but

fortunately  I shall have an opportunity  to  reply

when such matters are brought up. One thing we want

to  make  clear  in  this House  is  that  whatever

agreement  that the P.A.P. Government reaches  with

the  Federation Government must be guided  by  this

important  factor - the interests of  the  people  of

Singapore come first and foremost, and if  they  do

that we are with them.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly views with concern the

progress  made by the Singapore Government  in  its

talks  with the Federation of Malaya Government  on

the  financial  arrangements relating  to  Head  17

(Finance) of Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask Members now to be relevant to the motion

which is concerned over the progress made, and  the

progress  made is, as I understand it, detailed  in

the  statement  made  by the  Prime  Minister  this

afternoon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

before  I make any comments on this motion, I  want

to make it clear that discussion of the motion does

not mean that we accept the financial talks between

the two Governments. We want to say that ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You do not want to say.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- so far as the people of

Singapore are concerned, the White Paper is a sell-out  and the Referendum on the 1st September. 1962,

never  gave the people the right to say "No". Under

those   circumstances,  especially  when   it   was

conducted with deceit, coercion and intimidation by

the Government ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Are

these   proper  words  in  respect  of  a  proposal

approved  by this Assembly? Are these proper  words - "deceit", "coercion" and other adjectives?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I understood the Member for

Queenstown  to  allege that the machinery  for  the

referendum had some deceit in it. The proper  thing

for him to have done at that moment was to have the

matter referred to the High Court.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And therefore, Sir, the

referendum  at no Time reflected the will  and  the

desire of the people freely expressed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> But you thought you were going

to win.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Prime Minister talks very

glibly  about  the  referendum. Let  him  give  the

people  of  Singapore a true plebiscite where  they

can say "Yes" or "No". Let him do that and then  he

will not laugh any more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> What should be done for the

Barisan?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You can arrest all of us ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, no.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You have already put us in ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would suggest to Members on

the  Front Bench of the Government side to  refrain

from interjections as far as possible if we want to

get  on with this motion. The Member for Queenstown

is  trying  to  address  the  Speaker,  but  he  is

interrupted by interjections.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> As I say, Sir, discussion of

this  motion  here in no way means that  we  accept

these financial merger talks. And so far as we  are

concerned, the referendum surveys of Tanjong  Pagar

and  Kreta  Ayer fully reflected the views  of  the

people,  and that is on a straightforward  question

demanding an answer of "Yes" or "No". As in Tanjong

Pagar, ninety per cent of the people said "No", and

as in Kreta Ayer when the questions as were finally

posed  in the referendum were posed to the  people,

ninety-seven  per cent of the people put  in  blank

votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill has brought this

motion  up not because he thinks there is something

wrong  as regards the actual terms of the financial

arrangements,  but  because he wants  to  deny  the

P.A.P. an opportunity of playing politics.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of elucidation, yes, if

the doctor will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Member for Queenstown seems

to have failed to grasp what I have been saying.  I

said,   insofar  as  the  terms  of  agreement   or

disagreement are concerned, these are  matters  for

the Government to solve.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> But when it comes up for a full

debate  in  this  House, so long as  the  agreement

reached  by  the  Singapore Government  is  in  the

interest  of the people of Singapore,  we  will  be

with  them,  and we will be with them  too  in  any

fight on their hands to protect the interest of the

people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You may be sacked for doing that!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see, Sir, the Member for

Cairnhill, as I said yesterday, is fighting for the

same  piece  of  bone with the P.A.P.  He  is  only

annoyed because the Prime Minister makes statements

at  the  Airport  and  because he  makes  political

propaganda  during  his rural visits;  whereas  the

Member for Cairnhill could not do that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Very difficult.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And he is merely complaining

that the Prime Minister is very adept at propaganda ---



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> You said so yourself.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And he would not mind if he was

adept   at   propaganda   against   the   so-called

Communists,  but he would object if the  propaganda

was directed against people with whom he is on very

friendly  terms. The Member for Cairnhill  has  his

loyalties  towards the Federation  Government,  the

U.M.N.O. Alliance Government, and because  of  that

he is ready to support the U.M.N.O.-M.C.A.-Alliance

at  any  Time. It does not matter whether Singapore

has  a  good  deal  or  a bad  deal.  If  you  will

remember, Sir, he is only saying that if he was the

Government he would be able to offer a better deal,

but  not  an  equal deal, namely, a deal  based  on

equality and justice - only slightly better ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Or Barisan justice.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And, therefore, all he is

concerned about is the manner in which negotiations

have been carried out. He does not care whether, in

actual  fact,  the  terms  are  good  or  bad   for

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, on a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order, yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Is it in order for a Member to

paraphrase  another Member for the last  10  to  15

minutes  when  we  have suspended Standing  Orders.

Many of us have not had our dinners and we want  to

get  on  with this job. Is it in order for a Member

to  spend 10 minutes paraphrasing a speech  lasting

nearly one hour of another Member's speech?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I suppose any Member is entitled to

an  exordium and an exordium also, I suppose,  does

paraphrase previous speeches. I wonder whether  the

Minister  who  has just spoken is hinting  that  we

should  stop  for  dinner. I will give  it  another

quarter of an hour and see how it goes and  then  I

probably will have to suspend the sitting,  because

the Speaker himself has not had dinner Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will take quite some time,

Sir. [Laughter].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I suggest to the Member for

Queenstown that he review what he is going  to  say

because  we  are  only concerned with  this  motion

which  asks this Assembly to view with concern  the

progress made by the Singapore Government, and  the

progress is set out in this statement by the  Prime

Minister made earlier on today. Well, I had  better

stop  at  that,  because I am going  to  be  rather

strict  upon relevance and irrelevance. The  Member

for Cairnhill was irrelevant perhaps for about half

his speech, but I think I owe it to Members of this

Assembly to be very, very strict upon relevance and

I  think  that  perhaps we should adjourn  now  for

three-quarters  of an hour. Is it  satisfactory  to

adjourn for three-quarters of an hour for dinner? I

will take this Chair again at a quarter to ten.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>

<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 9.45 p.m.</i></div>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I was saying, Sir, that the

Member   for  Cairnhill  does  not  bother  whether

Singapore  surrenders  in  toto  or  not;  he  only

bothers about the revelation of the talks which are

in  progress.  He has informed many of  us  outside

that  it  is  a case of cheap sale but because  the

S.P.A. and  U.M.N.O. are  fighting  against   the

P.A.P., he therefore, has to support the Federation

side.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us see what the statement of the Prime

Minister  has revealed tonight. On reading  through

the  whole statement, it shows one thing. It  is  a

report  of  the different stages towards  surrender

and  finally of abject surrender by the P.A.P.  The

Prime  Minister talks of the quantum of Singapore's

contribution and the responsibility for  collection

of  national  taxes in Singapore after merger,  and

these  talks are important enough to have  affected

quite  a  number  f  services  ill  the  Government

departments.  For  example, you might  have  heard.

Sir,  that there are already strikes in the  Police

Department.  You  might also  know  that  they  are

threatening a strike in the P. & T. Department. All

these  are Pan-Malayan departments and who controls

the   money   and  pays  the  salaries   in   these

departments  will  have a great  hearing  on  these

strikes.   The  Parliamentary  Secretary   to   the

Minister  for Culture, of course, understands  this

very  well, and he is responsible for many  of  the

demands  that  are  now  conveyed  to  the   P.A.P.

Government.  But  this  statement  by   the   Prime

Minister has revealed certain other things which we

never  knew before. You see, Sir, all the Time  the

P.A.P. has been giving the impression to the people

of Singapore that the differences between Singapore

and  the  Federation  are only  on  the  matter  of

surpluses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a forum in the Nantah about a week or so ago,

we  exposed  this so-called surplus  angle  of  the

P.A.P. But I will come to this later. The two other

important  points which the statement has  revealed

are:  there  is  a new thing called Pan-  Malaysian

expenditure;  and  there is another  new  thing  of

payment to the Borneo territories of $50 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I have run through the White Paper very, very

carefully, Sir, with a tooth comb, but nowhere have

I been able to find the word "Malaysian" - common Pan-Malaysian expenditure. This is something  which  is

entirely new and which the people of Singapore have

so  far not been told of. The other one is this $50

million.  All  this merely shows  that  the  money,

which  is  the  bone  of  contention  between   the

Federation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>



and  Singapore,  will ultimately be  used  for  the

expansion  of the armed forces for the  suppression

of  the people in this region. The money which  the

Federation   wants   will  be  spent   on   capital

improvements  in fighting-ships, fighting-vehicles,

fighting-equipment,  all in order  to  prevent  the

realisation of the hopes and aspirations  not  only

of  the  people of Singapore but also of the Borneo

region.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order. I am not

sure  whether, on this motion, it is  in  order  to

speak  on  the  merits  of  the  proposals  in  the

Malaysian  discussion between the two  Governments.

It  seems  to me that the Member for Queenstown  is

wide of the track, because he seems to have assumed

that  the  proposals, all made  by  the  Federation

Government,  have  been accepted by  the  Singapore

Government  in all respects. It seems  to  me  that

very little purpose will be served now - before  all

the   documents   have  been  published   and   the

agreements in detail recorded - to discuss the merits

of the different items. I thought the object really

is  to express anxiety on the progress made in  the

talks.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The difficulty, of course, the

Speaker  has is to draw a line somewhere.  I  think

the  comments so far are comments on the  statement

itself,  and  I  have not as yet decided  that  the

Member  for Queenstown is in any way irrelevant  at

the moment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I intend, Sir, to confine

myself to the progress of the talks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, Sir, the Government account given tonight

is, let us say, slightly different from the account

that has been given to the newspapers, and that  is

why  I  say  that there are certain  things  which,

until  to-night,  have not been  revealed.  I  have

mentioned those two points, and I am sure that when

all   the  facts  are  told,  there  will  be  more

skeletons in the cupboard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All along, Sir, the Government have been talking

about surpluses. When the Prime Minister came  back

from  his  trips  to Kuala Lumpur he  talked  about

surpluses and how he wants to make use



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>



of these surpluses for the benefit of the people of

Singapore. In his visits to the constituencies,  he

tells  everybody  that that money is  the  people's

money  and that therefore he is going to keep  that

money  for the people of Singapore, thus hoping  to

give the impression that he is really fighting  for

the  interests of Singapore, whereas, in fact as  I

have  already pointed out from the very  beginning,

he has already sold Singapore right down the river.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> How?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> "How, how?", he asks. Are we

not  controlled  as and when the Federation  likes?

The facts of this financial talks agreement tell us

that there is complete surrender on the part of the

P.A.P.  Now all control will be from Kuala  Lumpur,

and   yet   we   do  not  even  have   proportional

representation. The Prime Minister  himself  admits

in  the newspapers - if he wants me to quote. I  will

quote every word of it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Do.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - that the whole thing is one

sided,  completely one sided. These are  the  words

used  by  the  Prime Minister, Sir,I am  sure  the

Minister  for  Finance will not dare  say  anything

against what the Prime Minister has said.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of elucidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Is the Member suggesting that we

have  agreed  to  the  agreement  put  up  by   the

Federation   Government?  In  particular,   is   he

suggesting  that  we have agreed to  surrender  the

surplus?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is not for us to say, Sir.

I  am  only going on what we have been told and  on

what  we  have read in the newspapers. I  hope  the

Prime  Minister and the Minister for  Finance  will

tell us straightaway in this House to-night whether

they have surrendered or not.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have indicated my views as

to  how  the debate should go. The motion asks  the

House to view



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>



with concern the progress made by the Government in

its  talks relating to Head 17 of Paper Command  33

of  1961.  The Prime Minister has set  out  in  his

statement the progress made so far, and the  debate

now  should  be as to whether or not  the  Assembly

should  view with concern the progress as  detailed

in the statement of the Prune Minister. That is all

we are debating to-night.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But it would be enlightening,

Sir,  that whilst we go by what the Prime  Minister

has  revealed to-night, we should also go  by  what

the Prime Minister has said to the Press. Unless we

do  that,  Sir,  we shall not be able  to  see  the

deception which the Prime Minister has practised on

the  people of Singapore. It is pertinent  at  this

point that we bring out certain facts to show  that

the  P.A.P. is not above-board in all its dealings.

Here,  in this statement, the Prime Minister, first

of  all,  reveals that on 21st March the Federation

Government proposed that Singapore should bear 21.2

per    cent   of   certain   common   Pan-Malaysian

expenditure  such  as defence,  internal  security,

external  affairs,  Parliament,  etc.  As  I   have

already  said,  this is something which  we  cannot

find  in  the  White  Paper. But,  of  course,  the

Government may have another story to tell.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which the Government of the

Federation insists on is that the total revenue  of

Singapore should be collected and controlled by the

Federation   and  that  only  certain  revenue   be

assigned to the State to enable Singapore  to  meet

her  obligations  in  the State itself.  Therefore,

this  question  of the so-called surplus  does  not

come in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a letter to the Straits Times on 25th of

May,  the  Deputy  Controller of Supply,  Malaysia,

from the Treasury in Kuala Lumpur, revealed that it

is  not  a  matter  of surplus or deficit,  as  the

Government  of  Singapore has  all  the  Time  been

trying  to  tell  the people of  Singapore,  but  a

matter of percentage to be apportioned between  the

two  Governments.  And he revealed  that  it  is  a

matter  of X per cent to the Federation and  Y  per

cent  to  Singapore. Once the percentage  has  been

assigned, it is entirely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>



a matter of State budgeting, whether there is  a surplus or deficit. That was the position from  the very  beginning, as insisted upon by the Federation Finance Minister, Mr Tan Siew Sin. But, of course, as   revealed  in  this  statement,  the  Singapore Government objects, and it objects because of  one, two  and three reasons. But, if you will look, Sir, at  No. (ii) - I will pick on No. (ii) , which is on

3 - it  means that the Singapore Government  in

effect had already accepted in principle the matter

of  percentage to be contributed to the  Federation

Government.  The  P.A.P. merely  complains  of  the

percentage  being too high. That is  all.  But  the

principle  of percentage had already been  accepted

by   the   Singapore   Government,   although   the

Government  of  Singapore insist  on  a  couple  of

conditions,  namely,  the  representation  in   the

Central Parliament and the population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have all along been saying that

representation in the Central Parliament is a  very

important thing, and we are glad to note  that  the

P.A.P.  Government has at last admitted  this  very

fact.  I wish also to draw your attention, Sir,  to

what the Prime Minister has been telling the people

in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 23rd of March in the Straits Times, he

said,  "We  must  collect and  keep  and  pay.  The

Federation Government understand this. I  think  we

have  been  sufficiently articulate." This  is  the

very  firm  stand  of the Government,  for  in  the

headlines  in the Straits Times it says, "We  stand

pat."   Yet   whilst  saying  that  the   Singapore

Government   must  collect  and  keel)   and   then

contribute,  the  Prime Minister in  his  statement

here  reveals  that  the Singapore  Government  had

already   accepted  the  principle  of   percentage

contribution.   He   only   complained    of    the

contribution of 21.2 per cent being too  high.  But

other  than  that,  the whole  principle  has  been

admitted and everything agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then whilst talking about these three factors on

page   4,  namely,  representation  in  Parliament,

population and economic growth, the Government also

revealed that any percentage payment to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>



the  Federation would mean a built-in  increase  in

payment to the Federation and, therefore, so far as

Singapore is concerned, something which the  P.A.P.

could  not  agree to. Mr Jek Yuen Thong, Political

Secretary to the Prime Minister, wrote in a  letter

to  the  Straits Times that this built-in  increase

would   arise   from   the  natural   increase   in

consumption, from the large number of taxes over  a

wider  range of commodities, and from the  increase

in   the   actual  level  of  taxation.  Therefore,

although it says that a percentage payment is  very

disadvantageous   to  Singapore,   the   Government

nevertheless accepted this principle of  percentage

payment to the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 4, it says the payment should be based on

actual  expenditure. But what  difference  does  it

make  whether the actual expenditure should  be  in

the  case of 1961 or 1962? Because, as revealed  in

the  Prime  Minister's  statement,  the  amount  of

future expenditure will be unpredictable; in  other

words,  the  expenditure will be mounting  and  the

contribution  from  Singapore  will  similarly   be

mounting. They try to save face over the fact  that

actual  expenditure must mean that the  Accountant-General  submits audited accounts.  This  does  not

mean  anything  except to show  that  even  in  the

matter  of  Government to Government  negotiations,

the  P.A.P. clearly does not trust the  Federation

Government.  Otherwise, why insist on this?  Unless

there  is  fear that everything is not above-board,

you  need  not  insist  on  the  Accountant-General

submitting his accounts of actual expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then these three factors, namely representation in

Parliament,  population and economic growth - in  the

newspapers a fourth factor is added, i.e. the  size

of   the   area  to  be  defended.  The  Government

nevertheless,  when it comes to the agreement,  has

clean  forgotten these factors other than  economic

growth  which the Government equates with  the  so-called  common market. Representation in Parliament

is  forgotten. Population factor is forgotten.  The

little  bit  of  face-saving  that  the  Federation

Government gives the Prime Minister is this talk of

so-called  limited common market. But  we  must  be

careful about this common market



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>



business, Sir, because, as far as we know, the

form   of  common  market  which  the  P.A.P. had

originally  envisaged is that there must  be  joint

consultation  at the top as regards how  industries

should be sited and assigned. Only then would  the

interests of Singapore be adequately looked  after;

otherwise it amounts to surrender. A's it  is,  the

only form of common market arrangement that we know

the  Federation Government will agree to is one  in

which the Federation has complete control.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> How do you know?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Well, would you let us know

then, if that is not the case! [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I might inform the Minister for

Culture   that  only  yesterday  the  Minister   of

Commerce  and Industry, Dr Lim Swee  Aun,  in  the

Sunday  Mail,  in  answer to a question  about  the

common   market   as  to  whether  the   Federation

Government  would  review  their  whole  policy  of

industrialisation or not, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It's the other way round. The Government will

first   consider  the  [Rueff  Malaysia]  Mission's

report, and if it feels a review is necessary  this

will be carried out.'



<br><br>This  alone shows, Sir, that the interests  of  the

Federation  must  come  first,  and,  whatever  the

Report  of  the Rueff Commission may  be,  it  must

tally  first  with  the policy  of  the  Federation

before  consideration  will  be  given  as  to  any

possible review.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have been trying my very

best  to  understand what the Member for Queenstown

is  driving  at vis-a-vis the motion before  us.  I

will  try  and explain exactly what is in my  mind.

The  motion asks this Assembly to view with concern

the  progress  made by the Singapore Government  in

its  talks with the Federation of Malaya Government

on  the financial arrangements relating to Head  17

(Finance)  of  Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961.  Head  17  of

Paper  Cmd. 33 of 1961 was accepted by this  House.

To  refresh the memory of Members, I will read  the

resolution  of  this House dated the 6th  December,

1961 [Vol. 15, No. 16, col. 1525]:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That as an immediate practical step towards the

ideal  goal  of complete merger this House  accepts

the  heads of agreement set out in the White  Paper

Cmd.  33  of 1961 agreed to between the Governments

of  the  State  of Singapore and the Federation  of

Malaya  as  a working basis for a reunification  of

the two territories.'



<br><br>From that base then, this Assembly having agreed to

Head  17  of  Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961, the  Singapore

Government  have  made  certain  progress  in   the

financial talks under that head and the progress is

detailed  in  the  statement  made  by  the   Prime

Minister, and this House, as I say, has been  asked

to  view with concern that progress made. I do  not

know whether the Member for Queenstown accepts  the

position that progress of some sort has to be made,

and   he  is  criticising  the  progress  that  has

actually been made. If that is so, he is in  order.

If,  on the other hand, he will have none of  these

heads of agreement, he will not agree to this  Head

17, as in fact he did not agree to Head 17 of Paper

Cmd.  33  of 1961, then he will have none of  these

negotiations.  I do not understand  at  the  moment

what  the Member for Queenstown is speaking to  in

this motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am merely

criticising the statement which has been issued  by

the  Prime  Minister. As I have  said,  we  do  not

accept  anything about the negotiations because  it

is only part of the White Paper and we have already

rejected the White Paper.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. But the motion does not ask

Members  to criticise the actions of the  Singapore

Government   as   to  how  they  negotiated   these

agreements  or  these steps towards agreement.  The

motion does not ask us to do that. The motion  asks

the  House to view with concern the actual progress

that  has  been made, and the actual progress  that

has  been made is detailed in the statement by  the

Prime  Minister.  That  is  the  position.  Is  the

progress  too little or too great or not enough?  I

should  imagine  that  is  how  the  debate  should

proceed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is a bit difficult, Sir, to

confine   ourselves  exactly  to  lust   the   word

"progress".  There are other incidental  happenings

which are part of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>



this Progress, and unless they are brought out, you

will  not  be  able  to  see  how  the  P.A.P. has

completely  surrendered in these negotiations  with

the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just bring out one little point to prove

what  I want to convey to the House. A little while

back, for example, the Prime Minister said that  he

has  never  said  that 25 per cent  of  Singapore's

revenue  would be given to the Federation.  I  have

here a statement issued by the Singapore Government

which  says  that  25  per cent  is  all  that  the

Singapore Government would be contributing. I  will

read  this little bit from the statement, and I  am

sure, Mr Speaker, Sir, you will appreciate that to

confine  myself  strictly to the  progress  at  the

present moment would be quite difficult. This is  a

statement issued by the Singapore Government on 7th

February, 1962, and Dr Goh Keng Swee was answering

Mr  Chan Chiaw Thor, who is now being detained  in

the Federation ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> What date?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- and the statement reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Minister explained that a certain sum was meant to meet the cost of two items, namely, the contribution to the Federation Government and (1) certain departments which are now run by the Singapore Government but which, on merger, will be run by the Central Government. For example, Police, Post Office, Telecommunication, Civil Aviation,

Prisons,  the Audit 0ffice and the Defence  Forces.

The  recurrent loss of the department is about  $62

million,  the  development  expenditure   about   8

million a year; and (2)  Singapore will have to  pay

for  its  share of Pan-Malayan Defence Forces,  the

Foreign Office and certain State institutions  such

as  the  Central Parliament. Dr Goh estimated  the

annual  share at $8 million. This makes a total  of

$78  million  a year or nearly one-quarter  of  the

estimated revenue for 1961, which was $345 million.

This  is  the reason why the contribution Singapore

makes  to  the Central Government has been  put  as

about 25 per cent.'



<br><br>Further down, the statement reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The real additional expenditure to Singapore will

be  around $8 million a year only representing  the

cost  of  Singapore's share in the Malayan  Defence

Forces  and the Foreign Service. As this amount  is

less  than  the  budget surplus in the  last  three

years,   it   will  not  be  necessary  to   reduce

expenditure on education and health.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Goh at that time, Sir, was answering a revelation by Chan Chiaw Thor that Singapore will be contributing at least $40 million a year to the Federation Government. As revealed in this statement, the defence expenditure is only $8 million extra. But we can see here from this

statement given by the Prime Minister tonight  that

it  is  much  much  more than $8  million.  We  are

already  asked to pay $50 million to the Federation

Government  and  we  have  also  agreed  to  pay  a

percentage   to   the  Central  Government   which,

according  to the Political Secretary to the  Prime

Minister, Mr Jek Yuen Thong, would mean a built-in

increase. In other words, the amount that would  be

given  to  the  Federation would  be  mounting  and

mounting and mounting ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You are quite right.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And the only consolation that

the people in Singapore can ever hope to get is the

establishment of a common market which, as  I  have

already explained, is a common market completely to

the  advantage of the Federation and will not  help

the Singapore Government in any way ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> How do you know what the U.N.

recommended?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> This is what we read and this

is  our  interpretation. Of course,  if  the  Prime

Minister  wishes to enlighten us,  I  am  sure  the

House will only be too happy to listen to him ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Give me a chance.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If you like to enlighten us, I

can sit down and let you say ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Let us carry on with this

debate. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see, Sir, what we are

unhappy  about is that while we have bean  told  we

would be merely contributing to Federal services in

Singapore all along ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point

of order. In this House in November 1961 we tabled

certain  documents  which  were  solemnly   agreed

between the two Governments-in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>



White Paper and in the exchange of letters - and I

suggest if Members on the opposite side wish to

debate progress, they have to start off with these

arrangements as a yardstick. What paragraph 17

stated, with respect to this particular aspect of

the financial arrangements, is as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The present machinery...'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is not a point of order.

I  have  already indicated the trend of this debate

and I am watching the situation very carefully. Dr

Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But anyway, Sir, whatever the

Prime  Minister may like to say, he cannot tell  us

how  we have this cost of common Malaysian services

plus the cost of Federal departments in Singapore ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order. That is

exactly the point I want to explain to him ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This is not a point of order.

The  Prime  Minister will have his  opportunity  of

explaining. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> From the talks, we also learn

that   the   Singapore  Government  may   have   to

contribute from Singapore's Development Fund to the

Federation  Development Fund to cover the  cost  of

capital   expenditure  on  defence   and   internal

security ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Those are all the words of

your friend Azahari.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see, Sir, the Prime

Minister is very quick about Azahari and what-not.

But whom does he help? Is he not a colonial stooge

[Interruption] trying to help the British

Government ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would suggest that the

Government Front benchers do not intervene. Because

once they start intervening and interjecting, I

suppose the Member for Queenstown must reply. Dr

Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, Sir, from this

statement the whole thing can be summarised like

this - that the Singapore Government has surrendered

complete control to the Federation ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Over security, yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> In spite of the Prime Minister's

brave words about collecting and keeping and paying

the  taxes  and  in  spite  of  his  assurance   of

retaining basic control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote from a televised panorama broadcast

on  6th May in London. The Prime Minister was asked

questions and he answered certain questions. I will

just quote a couple of questions which he answered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Lee Kuan Yew stressed at the beginning of the

interview  that Singapore would be responsible  for

State   services  except  Defence,   Security   and

External  Affairs. He continued: "We  have  got  to

collect revenue to be able to spend it the  way  we

want."'.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Quite right.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And the question goes. "So

that  control  over  finance  would  be  a  minimum

condition  for you going into the Federation?"  And

the Prime Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"Oh, yes, absolutely basic."'



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Quite right. We are telling

you that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not know whether these

documents  here  reveal  that  he  has  surrendered

control or not. He was asked another question:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Some people have said that it is Malaya that has

made all the conditions and Singapore that has made

most of the big concessions.'



<br><br>Then the Prime Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I think we have made considerable

concessions", he says.'



<br><br>Considerable concessions! Now he recognises that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"We have been making concessions and concessions

all the Time. I think the Federation would like us

to  make  more concessions, you know, and give  up

control of finance and a few other things.  But  a

contract  has been made and Singapore  understands

this, If von sell rubber short, and the price goes

up, well you miscalculated," he says. "We came  to

hard  and  fast arrangements. They now  feel  that

they  were a little bit too harsh on the financial

arrangements,  and so on. Well, they  should  have

thought of these things.".'



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Firstly, the Prime Minister

has   admitted  that  Singapore  has  been   making

considerable concessions; all the time  concessions

which  he  never admitted until now.  Secondly,  he

says  that  control of finance is  basic.  But  the

Finance Minister of the Federation has already said

that  control  must  go  to  the  Federation.   Who

controls?  According to the statement that  we  see

tonight,  the Government of Singapore  has  already

surrendered control.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Where?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Even the Minister for Finance

himself has said so. I can show him if you want. He

himself said ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member has referred

to the statement. Let us have the paragraph.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, go on. [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I can even quote the page

where  Lee  Kuan  Yew was supposed to  have  played

golf!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have asked the hon. Member

for  Queenstown to indicate the paragraph which  he

alleges  states  that the Singapore Government  has

surrendered  control to the Federation  Government.

Let us have it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is not in this statement.

But ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Withdraw.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister for Finance

himself   said,   "There  is   nothing   wrong   in

surrendering control to the Federation."



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of

order,  Sir. This is misrepresentation of  what  I

said. I never said anything like that.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Queenstown must be

careful  about  what he says. He is  a  responsible

man.  He  is an honourable Member of this Assembly,

and  if  he makes an allegation he must be able  to

prove that allegation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see, Sir, I can find the

page and the line and show you. But it just happens

that I cannot lay my hands exactly or the spot now.

If  he  denies it, I will bring the quote here  and

show  it  to you tomorrow because the Minister  for

Finance is quoted in the Straits Times to have said

that   he  admitted  control  should  go   to   the

Federation.  He even said.. "What's the  difference

of a few millions between friends?".



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Point of order, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Minister has

already denied that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If he keeps on denying, then I

suppose I will have to bring the quotation when the

time comes. Then he will never be able to deny that

any  further. The main thing is this Sir:  that  at

the  present moment we have been told that we  will

have   to   pay  and  contribute  to  Pan-Malaysian

services  and  an extra $50 million to  the  Borneo

territories. We do not know what the final  outcome

will be.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We want to know on whose side

you are.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We are always on the side of

the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Which people?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Of course, the Prime Minister

thinks that the people, in his case, are the people

who  control the guns in London and maybe in  Kuala

Lumpur.  That  is  why he is so  keen  to  increase

Battalions  in  Singapore.  Even  clerks   in   the

Ministry  of Home Affairs have complained that  the

Government  is  using the police to interfere  with

the strikers today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No relevance.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No relevance? But relevant

enough  in that there are lots of things which  the

P.A.P. has  not yet told the people of  Singapore.

[Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There again I have indicated

to  the  Government Benches not to interpolate.  We

will never



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>



finish   this  motion  tonight.  The   Member   for

Queenstown  must now try to come to the  point,  be

relevant, and address his remarks to the Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, the main thing about these

negotiations  is that it is no use trying  to  play

politics  by telling the people that the P.A.P. is

fighting  for  their interests when, in  fact,  the

whole  of Singapore has already been sold down  the

river.   We   have  repeatedly  said,   Sir,   that

negotiations  of  the  finer  points  of  financial

arrangements mean only worrying about itches on the

toes and fingers when, in fact, the head is already

in  the noose. The only way to serve the people  of

Singapore  and to really fight for their interests,

is  to throw away the White Paper and once more  go

back to the people. Only then ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It now transpires that the

Member  for  Queenstown is not  interested  in  the

progress of the financial talks. He is against this

White  Paper, and all his remarks really  would  be

relevant  if  he  moves  a motion  to  rescind  the

resolution of the House which I have read, that is,

the  resolution of the House accepting these  heads

of  agreement.  Unless and until he  does  that.  I

cannot see how he can speak to this motion with any

degree of conviction.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> There is a reference here to

the   Barisan   Sosialis  regarding   what   amount

Singapore would be paying to the Federation  if  it

was  a  case  of  complete merger. As  far  as  the

Barisan  Sosialis is concerned, we want  a  genuine

reunification with the Federation, not this present

so-called  partnership, with Singapore becoming  an

inferior  and junior partner and Singapore citizens

becoming second-class citizens. If it is a  genuine

reunification,    we    want   real    proportional

representation ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown is

doing  exactly what I have said he cannot do unless

he  moves a motion to rescind the decision of  this

House accepting those heads of agreement. He is now

speaking to that motion. He has not even filed that

motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I merely wanted to answer a

couple  of points since the Government has referred

to us in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>



statement here. But I want to impress on this House

that if any negotiations are to lead to success and

be  supported by the people of Singapore, then they

must  be  negotiated on the basis of  equality  and

justice. Only then will the Government get  support

from  the  people. Otherwise it is all a sham,  and

the  P.A.P. will not be able to convince the people

that   the   P.A.P. today  is  fighting  for   their

interests.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we

have  been very forbearing, both with the mover  of

the  motion  and the Member for Queenstown,  and  I

want to be brief and to the point. I agree with the

motion  moved by the Member for Cairnhill  that  we

are   concerned  with  the  progress  made  in  our

financial discussions. We are concerned because all

that  was  necessary, after we had agreed the  main

framework  of the arrangements for merger,  was  to

work out the apportionment. The words are contained

in paragraph 17 of the White Paper. May I read it:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The present machinery for the collection of taxes

in Singapore will be retained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proceeds of the national taxes will be used to

pay  the cost of Government and Public Services  in

Singapore  and  the  contribution  to  the  Federal

Government for Federal services. The details of the

apportionment  will  be worked  out  by  the  Joint

Working Party.'



<br><br>All that remained to do since November 1961 was  to

work  out the details of the apportionment, and  we

are  concerned that it has taken us all this length

of time to really get down to brass tacks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the exchange of letters I set out clearly what

we  envisaged  in this apportionment.  Finally - this

was  an exchange of letters dated 11th November  - we

have  agreed  that Singapore would keep  more  than

three-quarters of her revenue for the discharge  of

her  responsibilities on education, labour,  social

welfare, health and all the other matters  set  out

as  State  or  concurrent responsibilities  in  the

schedule  annexed to our memorandum and be entitled

to  15  seats in the Central Parliament of the  new

Federation. Now, in our estimation then,  in  broad

outline, being entitled to 15 seats on merger which

was on very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>



special conditions, we envisaged that we would keep

more  than three-quarters of our revenue, and  that

is still the position  - unchanged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not for me to comment on the tactics of

an Opposition leader whose Party headquarters is in

Kuala  Lumpur.  But  I  must  thank  him  for   the

compliment  he  paid  me in my absence  on  Friday,

namely,  that he wanted - in fact he was anxious  for

an occasion - to confront me. In other words, he, the

agent  of the principal in Kuala Lumpur, was  going

to confront me today, and I waited 45 minutes as he

waffled on and on for that moment of confrontation.

On  whose side is he? He says he is on the side  of

the people of Singapore. What else could he say? If

he  were on the side of the people of Singapore, he

should be prepared to stand up to his principals in

Kuala  Lumpur,  as we have done, and  say  to  them

exactly  where they get off. I know that in  saying

this,  we become unpopular with people who will  be

in   authority   over  Malaysia,   which   includes

Singapore, after 31st August. There will have to be

a  settlement on fair and honourable terms based on

the  White Paper before the 31st. It will be tabled

here in detail, and adopted after proper debate. We

adjourned  after our meeting in April in  the  hope

that  we would achieve agreement before the  Deputy

Prime  Minister of the Federation went off  on  his

tour  of the United States and Britain, which  tour

was  expected  to take a month. Unfortunately,  our

plea  for  a  meeting was construed as  a  sign  of

weakness. Therefore, for reasons which I thought to

be in the interests of the people, I did not attend

a  particular meeting in Kuala Lumpur and chose  to

stay  in  Cameron Highlands with the Prime Minister

of the Federation who was golfing with me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golf is a very necessary asset in Malaysia, and a

lot  of  valuable  and  important  information  was

imparted   and   analysed  in  the  leisurely   and

sometimes  enlightened and rarified  atmosphere  of

the  highlands.  On  many  an  occasion  I  thought

perhaps  if  only Members on the other side  played

golf, they would not have made some of the colossal

blunders that they had.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to move an amendment to this motion,

and  the amendment is to add at the end "Paper Cmd.

33  of  1961" the words "and expresses  its  desire

that  there should be an early settlement fair  and

just to both sides on the basis of the terms of the

White  Paper  which  has  been  approved  by   this

Assembly."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> "Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961" instead of

"the White Paper"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> So be it, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment is, at the end, to add -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"and expresses its desire that there should he an

earls settlement fair and just to both sides on the

basis of the terms of Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961 which

was approved by this Assembly."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is correct.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I stress

the  operative words "on the basis of the terms  of

Paper  Cmd. 33 of 1961 which was approved  by  this

Assembly"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to dwell at length on the

tortuous  course of negotiations.  Clothed  in  the

officialese language of financial negotiators was a

plan  by  which we were, in fact, not only to  lose

all  our  surplus,  but  to be  owing  the  Central

Government money at the end of it. I refer to pages

1  and  2.  We have moved away from that  position,

fortunately, not least because we decided to  stand

up  and talk up, I think, with as much courtesy  as

the  situation merits. There will have  to  be,  if

need be, more harsh words, but at the end of it, it

is our duty to see that we produce to this House an

agreement which is in accord with the principles of

the  merger which we approved in this Assembly  and

which we placed before the people. We debated it at

great  length and in great detail over a period  of

nearly a year. There was no misunderstanding as  to

the intent, nor as to the language that was used in

these  solemn  documents. A departure  from  or  an

amendment  in  any respect to these  documents  can

only be if it is on a quid pro quo basis.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would not wish to prejudice the future

course  of  our negotiations, but I  would  like  a

categorical  assurance from Members  on  the  other

side  that  they  are with us in this,  because  it

helps.  If the agents or parties whose headquarters

are in Kuala Lumpur are with us, then obviously  it

will  be easier to persuade the principals in Kuala

Lumpur that it is unwise in the long run to try and

alter  terms  which  may in the  end  work  to  the

detriment of the whole of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are for a strong Central Government, and we

believe  that the most important element in  making

any  government  of  the Federation  strong  is  to

command the loyalty of its subjects, in this  case,

the 1.7 million people of Singapore. They have been

told for over a year, two years now, by people like

the  Member for Queenstown that they were sold down

the  drain, finished, enslaved by the Malays in the

Federation,  and that what really  was  wanted  was

complete   merger.  We  fought  them,  because   we

believed  that  what we were doing  was  right.  If

conviction  was lacking in what we were  doing,  we

would  have faltered before the cohorts  that  they

were  able to marshal. I promise this Assembly that

we  shall  produce that document in which all  that

was  agreed will be enshrined, and if there is  any

alteration, it must be on a quid pro quo basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill says that we have been

untruthful.  Have we? Right at this moment  we  are

asked  to  pay $50 million as a grant.  From  what?

From  our surpluses. How can we pay if we have  not

got the money? I am not going to say whether we are

or  we  are  not.  At this moment  I  think  it  is

impolite to reply in this Assembly. This debate has

been triggered off by the tactics of the Member for

Cairnhill.  He  raised the question.  He  wanted  a

statement. He put a motion down. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

he  said that he wanted to confront me. Well, I  am

here  to be confronted, and we never run away  from

any  confrontation. We say this, you can bundle  up

Singapore  on  a military plate, hand  it  over  by

military  government, as it, is the  right  of  the

British Government to do as a sovereign power. But,

if it is to be with our consent, if we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>



expected  to  justify and defend this  Constitution

and  work it, then we must believe that it is  fair

and  just. If we are going to find our cream soaked

up,  then I say that at the end of three years,  if

none of the houses go up, none of the factories  go

up   to  give  jobs,  schools,  education  for  the

children, jobs for the growing boys, then  you  can

have  all the army you like in the world,  but  you

cannot  keep this place down. That is why we  fight

for  it  because we believe it is right  that  this

place  should  expand. If it expands because  of  a

common  market  on terms which do not  destroy  our

entrepot  trade, then it is our duty to share  that

prosperity - additional    prosperity,    not    past

prosperity;  not a $50 million grant. "Grab",  that

was the word used by the Member for Cairnhill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have quite rightly kept the Federation

Prime  Minister out of my discussions on  this  for

specific reasons, because I do not believe for  one

moment  that  it  is either his  intention  or  his

desire to depart from what has been agreed.  But  I

do  believe that the M.C.A. in Kuala Lumpur, one of

the   principal  associates  of  the   Member   for

Cairnhill,  played politics and they  thought  that

this  was  a  clever way in which  they  could  fix

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1964 there will be elections. Everybody knows

that.  This  Assembly will have  run  out.  Between

August  1963  and July 1964, if the funds  dry  up,

then  the election results can be fixed, like  they

were  in  Kelantan and Trengganu. You can dismantle

the  bridge halfway, pack it and bring it home; and

the  State Government can rusticate. But  that  was

not what we agreed. What we are fighting for is not

for  a  P.A.P.  Government but for  any  government

elected  by  the people of Singapore. Whoever  wins

that  election  next year will find  in  the  kitty

nearly  $400  million which was not there  when  we

took  office. That money will not disappear between

now  and  next  year.  Some will  be  expended - more

houses, schools and community centres  - but it  will

be  there. The reason why the Member for Queenstown

finds the ground cold  -  he keeps getting these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>



fainting  fits, and I was worried for him  when  he said  that

he was going to take a long  time  this evening - is  that there is

euphoria on  the  ground. Where is the wrath of the masses? [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You want to know?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Member for Queenstown believes he would. Excellent. We will see.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Have the elections now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said,

this is a Government that does not seek  any easy way out to

prolong its life. This Assembly  is evenly split with 25 Members on

either side. It  is within  the  power of the Opposition to bring

this Government to a halt tonight, if they so  will  it. And  the

constitutional processes must work out  to their logical conclusion.

We are prepared for it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> To face the electorate?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We are prepared for it. And there will be ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Go ahead.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Never the Member for Queenstown

fear this. But if I were him,  I  would look  beyond  the 31st of

August,  into  the  wider unknown. We have done so. And I know that

by  doing this,  we are tempting the gods. But I say,  it  is our

duty  to the people that we stand up to  self- made  Senators, and

that they understand the mettle of   Singapore,  that  whoever

wants   to   govern Singapore must first understand the basic

forces at work.  And the first basic force is that the Member for

Queenstown is just a little bit of ice on top of  an  iceberg,

a little bit of fluff. It  is  the iceberg    that    we    are

concerned     with. [Interruption] - No  I have met the  iceberg,  and

I have a healthy respect for it. They made very grave errors of

miscalculation, misjudgment, for which no doubt  they  will pay

bitterly. They blotted  their copybook. But as for us, we are quite

clear that in this piece of -  may I in a small way call it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>



brinkmanship - we all know that on the 27th of June  a document

must  be  signed  at  least   on   broad principles, or Malaysia

cannot conic about  on  the 31st of August because the legislative

processes do not  allow time for it. Tun Razak is in Manila.  He will

be back on Friday. My colleague, the Minister for  Finance, will have

sent his reply  before  his return.  He  will be in Kuala Lumpur on

Monday;  I hope  to  be there on Tuesday. By the end  of  next week

we may have to be in London. And I have  said this  publicly,  not

because we like  to  bare  our chest  on these matters, that in

Singapore  we  are accustomed  to  living  under  high  stresses

and strains. And when Senators tell us that they intend to  go on

without Singapore, and hope thereby  that we  will  succumb and our

knees will buckle  in,  I think it is our duty to make it quite clear

to them that,  grave as the consequences may be for all  of us,

including ourselves as a Government and  as  a Party,  rather than

breach basic concord, we  would face  the awful consequences.

For them, once  again Pandora's  Box  is  open. They may  think

Malaysia could  be  formed  without  Singapore.  Maybe   the Senators

believe it. I wonder  how  it  is  to  be defended  without the bases

in Singapore,  which  I have  no  doubt  will vanish in a very  short

Time without Malaysia ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You will have to defend yourself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Quite right. We intend to see that there is a

power balance here. And we have  no intention  of allowing this

country to be  over-run by  outside  powers.  And we  are  not

Lackeys  to foreign imperialist powers. We intend to stand up.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And to keep the base, is it not? How foolish.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Play lackey, and echo to foreign powers?

Foreign  Ministers  meeting   in Manila.  And  here  is  the great

anti-colonialist revolutionary, sending a telegram to foreign powers

asking  them  to  stop Malaysia on his  behalf.  He cannot  stop  it, Mr Speaker, Sir.  He  tried;  he flopped.  Now he wants others to stop

it.  However, enough of this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>



All I want from this Assembly now, and whether  we get it or we do not really does not matter, because we  know  quite  clearly  in  our  minds  what  our responsibilities are - namely, that there must be  an agreement which spells out in detail the principles which  we  have agreed If they want  a  percentage which  was  never  agreed, which means  a  built-in increase,   quite  rightly  as   the   Member   for Queenstown pointed out - three ways: (1)  by  increase

in   consumption;  (2)   by  increase  in  rates  of

taxation; (3)  by increase in the spread of taxation

over commodities as Malaysia industrialises, then I

say  there  must be a quid pro quo, there  must  be

common  market terms which make it worth our while.

Otherwise  we  go back to dollars and  cents  every

year.   After  all,  we  have  15  seats   out   of

159 - taxation  and representation  go  together.  We

said  so.  And  therefore I ask  the  House,  fully

confident  that whatever the inner compunctions  of

the  Member for Cairnhill about what his principals

will  tell him, he will find it difficult  to  vote

against  this  amendment to his motion.  It  is  so

eminently  reasonable, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  that  he

would be put to great trouble to find a way out  of

this.  In the interests of the people of Singapore,

something that they voted for, something  that  the

Member  for Cairnhill voted for, I say,  "Vote  for

it",  and we will go back next week to Kuala Lumpur

renewed,  more stout-hearted, because we  have  got

even the local branch of the Grand Alliance backing

us. What more assurance of success? By the Time the

agent  is  prepared  to tell the  principal  he  is

wrong,  surely  we who are not agents  have  got  a

right  to  tell the principal that he  has  got  to

settle this on fair terms.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly views with concern the

progress  made by the Singapore Government  in  its

talks  with the Federation of Malaya Government  on

<br><br>Since which an amendment has been moved, at the

end, to add ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"and expresses its desire that there should be an

early settlement fair and just to both sides on the

basis  of the terms of Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961  which

was approved by this Assembly."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to be

added, be there added."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim)</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Hong Lim wishes to

speak on the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of

order.  Is it possible to range from the motion  to

the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We will first deal with the

amendment.  If  that is accepted, or otherwise,  we

will go back to the original motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the motion

before this House and the subsequent amendment  are

nothing but an exercise between the S.P.A. and' the

P.A.P. to  outmanoeuvre  each  other,  win   more

support, and capture more of the Right-wing  votes.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, that was all the exercise we had

the  whole of today from the Time the Committee  of

Supply  closed  its business. We  are  against  the

White  Paper  in principle. We know that  all  this

talk   about   so-called  financial   autonomy   is

something like a farce. Therefore we would  abstain

on the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. has staged this drama of a fight for so-called autonomy in finance for reasons best known to itself. However, this drama is coming to a close although the final chapters are still not yet concluded. But the farce has been exposed and the plot to deceive the people

unmasked,  and  the P.A.P. now lays bare  with  the

naked  truth  exposed. It finds that  it  has  been

cornered   and  it  must  find  a  reasonable   and

honourable way out of its quandary. Sir, the P.A.P.

Government  took a very short Time to  bring  about

its phoney sell-out merger.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member is out of order on

two counts. One is the reference to this merger  as

a  phoney sell-out merger which has been agreed to,

or  the terms of which have been agreed to by  this

Assembly.  He  is  out  of  order  by  using   that

expression.  Secondly, I cannot  see  how  that  is

relevant to the amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am coming

to  the explanation that this amendment is only  an

attempt to hoodwink the people. By and by,  I  will

explain the position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, you will see from the White Paper that

the  broad principles of this so-called merger took

such  a  short Time to draft out and formulate  and

which  the P.A.P. Government accepted. We therefore

cannot understand why it has taken so much time  to

finalise  one small item amongst tens of  items  in

the White Paper. We cannot understand what game the

P.A.P. is playing when it has sold out more  basic

rights of the people of Singapore - for instance, the

citizenship  rights and our representation  in  the

Central Malaysian Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government claims that it is fighting for us to obtain financial control, financial autonomy and that the delay in the progress of the talks is due to the stumbling block from the Federation side. Whatever it is, Sir, from what we know, the words "financial

autonomy"  were never mentioned at all  during  the

referendum, and they were first quoted by the Prime

Minister only in the Chinese Press during  a  visit

to  Bukit  Panjang on Sunday, the 3rd March,  1963.

Now, these words "financial autonomy" only appeared

in  the Chinese Press, but in the English Press and

in  official announcements in this House,  we  hear

the    words    "financial    talks",    "financial

arrangements",    "negotiations    on     financial

arrangements". In the Chinese Press, they  appeared

as  "financial autonomy". We cannot understand  the

purpose  of this double talk by the P.A.P. and  we

must clarify this to understand the motion. We know

that  the  Chinese Press is read  by  most  of  the

voters, three-quarters of whom are Chinese, and  it

is  believed  that  most  of  the  leaders  of  the

Alliance  Government read only the  English  Press.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, in the Nanyang Siang Pan on  4th

March, 1963, there were headings in the paper which

read - may I translate:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Prime Minister Lee makes speech in welcome party

at  Mandai. "After merger, this State of  Singapore

will  have autonomy in finance. Therefore, we  have

only 15 seats in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>



the  Central Parliament although Sabah and  Sarawak

together have 40 seats. But finance comes under the

control of the Central Government."'



<br><br>Sir, this theme of financial autonomy was played up

by  the Chinese Press every Time the Prime Minister

visited  the  rural constituencies,  but  it  never

appeared  in the English Press. When he  speaks  in

Mandarin   and  Hokkien,  he  speaks  of  financial

autonomy. But when he speaks in other languages, we

never hear of financial autonomy but just financial

arrangements and financial negotiations. But,  Sir,

the  people  cannot be easily deceived.  They  know

that  all  this  talk of financial  autonomy  is  a

bluff.  The  White  Paper has  stated  clearly  and

plainly  under Item 7 of the Annexure that  out  of

the thirteen powers relating to finance, eleven are

completely under Federal control and two items  are

concurrent  powers  which  mean  nothing  much   to

Singapore.  Sir, where is the autonomy in  finance?

That  is why we cannot understand the delay in  the

talks  on  finance.  Under  the  White  Paper,  the

control of financial and monetary policies has been

given   almost   completely   to   the   Federation

Government.  We  cannot  understand  what  is   the

meaning  Of  financial autonomy. Now, if  financial

autonomy  means not the control of policies,  which

basic  right the P.A.P. Government has sold to  the

Federation Government, but a difference of  pounds,

shillings and pence, of dollars and cents,  then  I

wish to remind the Minister for Finance of a speech

he  made  at  the Singapore Airport on 16th  April,

1963,  contained  in  the Sin  Chew  lit  Poh.  The

Minister for Finance, returning after a meeting  in

Kuala  Lumpur, said, "Between friendly states  what

is  a  few  million dollars?" Sir, if that  is  the

genuine difference between the Minister for Finance

and  the  Federation Government,  then  we  do  not

understand why there should be delay in the  talks,

unless   it   is   meant   for   the   purpose   of

electioneering,  for  capturing   votes   and   for

outmanoeuvring the S.P.A. Alliance in  winning  the

votes of the bankers, the insurance companies,  the

big  bosses  in  town, the colonial  merchants  and

firms and industrialists.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the statement made today by the Prime

Minister  said that there had been no agreement  or

that  the  Singapore and the Federation Governments

could  reach no agreement on two matters;  firstly,

the apportionment of expenditure and the quantum of

Singapore's  contribution for Federal  expenditure;

and  secondly,  responsibility  for  collection  of

national taxes in Singapore after merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this was the position on the 28th of February,

1963,  and is the position, as far as I know,  now.

If  that  is the position, then the Prime  Minister

must  have  been  guilty of deceiving  the  people,

because a few days after that, during his visit  to

Bukit Panjang constituency, he said this and it was

in  the  Sin Chew Jit Poh of 4th March,  1963.  He

said  on and again in many of his speeches on  that

day,  which  was  only three days after  the  First

Session  of the Inter-Governmental Committee,  that

the  Federation  Government had  agreed  after  the

establishment  of  Malaysia  that  Singapore  would

collect  its  own  taxes.  Other  than  fairly  and

reasonably   allocating  a  part  to  the   Central

Government   for  defence,  external  affairs   and

internal  security, the balance would remain  under

the  control of Singapore. If you will  excuse  me,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I repeat the words  in  Chinese

which  he said himself, "Ta mah chern lee  ho  lian

her pang chern pooh ee tong yee."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know what the object

of  that  is, because that will not appear  in  the

Official Report.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the

Minister   or  the  Government  later  decides   to

challenge my translation, then I will read  it  out

in  Chinese.  On  the same day, he  said,  "If  our

finance  is controlled by the Federation,  we  must

listen  to them. The White Paper has stated clearly

that  we run our own finance; each year we  give  a

quarter of our revenue to the Federation Government

so  that  they  can run external affairs,  defence,

etc."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, either the statement given to the House by the Prime Minister contains errors in facts, or the speech made by the Prime Minister at Bukit Panjang on the 3rd of March, 1963, was deceiving, because, according to the statement today, no decision had been reached at that Time

either on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>



responsibility for the collection of  taxes  or  on

the apportionment of expenditure and the quantum of

Singapore's  contribution for Federal  expenditure.

Sir, this is another example of the P.A.P.'s double

talk.  Who  can  trust  the P.A.P.  Government  any

longer? So, now the P.A.P., having played out  this

episode  of  so-called autonomy in  finance,  found

itself  in  a  quandary and  the  whole  thing  has

boomeranged against it. It has already gone back to

the  Federation compromised on the  issue,  and  in

order to cover up its sins, it has tried to deceive

us  by another method by saying that it has reached

agreement   in   principle  with   the   Federation

Government on this so-called common market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, unless and until the P.A.P. Government

announce  the  details of the common market,  which

they say have been agreed in principle, we are  not

sure  whether it is another sell-out of the  P.A.P.

Government. Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said at the

beginning  of  the  speech,  today's  exercise   in

pushing item 20 from the bottom of the agenda paper

to  the  top  is nothing but a test of intellectual

capacity between the S.P.A. leaders and the  P.A.P.

leaders and to see who will come out best from this

exercise.  Therefore, on this  motion  and  on  the

amendment, we will abstain because in principle  we

oppose the White Paper.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Tun Lim, on the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one can excuse

the Member for Hong Lim for feeling that there is a

game  being played by the P.A.P. and the S.P.A. on

this  vital national issue concerning the lives  of

the  people of Singapore. I can understand  why  he

takes  that line. It is because the Prime  Minister

in his speech tried also to play a game of politics

with  us.  He  asks,  what kind  of  tactics  am  I

indulging in? He thinks that by amending the motion

he  has got me where he wants me. Let me assure him

in  this House that the motion I put in is aimed at

telling  him  that the way he has been going  about

things is wrong and has caused concern. He wants us

now  to give him added strength in his negotiations

with  the  Federation Government.  Let  me  at  the

outset say this to him. The interests



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>



of  the people of Singapore come first, and so long

as  the  Government is guided by that principle  in

its negotiations with the Federation Government, we

are  with  it  and  to that extent  we  accept  its

amendment.  But what we resent and resent  strongly

is  the  way he tries to sneer at us. He  tries  to

point  out  that we are the agents of our principal

in  Kuala Lumpur. What is he trying to say?  We  in

Singapore  are autonomous insofar as the  interests

of the people of Singapore are concerned, but where

it  concerns the whole of Malaysia, it will he  the

policy of the Grand Alliance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the tone of the speech of the Prime Minister,

it  would  seem that he would feel very  happy  and

strengthened  in his resolve if we would  give  him

support  on  this  amendment. It  is  just  like  a

confession  that he has been having  heavy  weather

and  that heavy weather was as a result of the  way

he went about these negotiations. If he had gone on

the   right   lines  talking  to   the   Federation

Government  in  a sober and dignified  manner,  all

this  would  not have come up in public  and  there

need  not  have to he this motion before the  House

this  evening.  But no, he wants to  play  politics

P.A.P. style.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While supporting him on that amendment, we want

the  Government to understand this, that we do  not

support  the  Prime Minister in his antics  in  the

Press  nor in his antics during his visits  to  the

rural  constituencies. We want him to be  a  sober-minded  responsible Prime Minister going  to  Kuala

Lumpur  to  discuss  the  terms  of  the  financial

arrangements  in  a manner that  is  befitting  the

Prime  Minister of the State of Singapore. We  hope

that  in giving this moral strength to him,  as  we

have  been giving moral strength to the P.A.P. even

before  the P.A.P. came to power, if we can  inject

into  the Government some moral strength to  enable

them to present the case of the people of Singapore

more effectively, we are always prepared to do  so.

I  must  repeat, Sir, that the Prime Minister  must

not  make  use  of  our support  to  indulge  in  a

political  game. He must play it fair  and  square,

otherwise he will have to give an account to us  in

this Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister was carried away in his

speech  just now and he retorted to an interjection

by the Member for Queenstown. This is what he said,

"It  is within the power of the Opposition to bring

the  Government down." Sure it is within the  power

of the Opposition, but as is typical of the P.A.P.,

the  P.A.P. would not pair off with the Member  for

Bras Basah who is indisposed. I would then ask  the

Prime  Minister if he really means business - give  a

pairing off to the Member for Bras Basah and let us

see whether the Prime Minister will stand up to his

brave words in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason why we give this support to the

amendment is that we feel that the interest of  the

people of Singapore must come first. But we are,  I

must  confess,  very concerned  that  this  support

which we solemnly give them in this House would  be

manoeuvred  by them for their own ends.  The  Prime

Minister  is  capable of this. Even in this  House,

where  truth must he said, the Prime Minister  said

this  in reply to what I said earlier in my speech,

that the Prime Minister did not attend a meeting of

the  Inter-Governmental Committee because he played

golf and said that he was too tired. And the clever

propagandist in the Prime Minister came  up  saying

that at one particular Time he considered it to  be

k the interest of the people that he did not attend

the  meeting in Kuala Lumpur and chose to  stay  in

Cameron  Highlands golfing with the Prime Minister.

Look   at  that.  The  people  who  know  the  true

situation can nail him in his distortion.  The  day

he  was in Cameron Highlands, so was I. He did  not

attend the meeting in Kuala Lumpur when the Finance

Minister  did,  because he agreed  with  the  Prime

Minister of the Federation of Malaya that no useful

purpose  could be served for a meeting to be  held.

He  tried to say that he did not attend because  it

was in the interest of the people of Singapore, and

so  he went out golfing. What kind of distortion is

he  trying to indulge in in this House? Let us  not

play  that  kind of a game. I would urge the  Prime

Minister  and  the  Government always  to  remember

this,  in  this solemn hour, with 31st August  just

around the corner - play the game straight, play  the

game  clean, play the game without trying  to  gain

political



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>



credit for the general elections  that  will

take  place next year. If they will just  do  that,

they   will   have  us  with  them  in  all   their

discussions with the Federation Government. This is

typical  of  the culture of the P.A.P.,  that  they

want our support and yet they ridicule us. They say

we  are the agents, we always dance to the crack of

the  principals.  But let me tell them  here - repeat

this  here - that  as  far as Singapore  politics  is

concerned, we are free to look after the people  of

Singapore  in the context of Malaysia, and  if  the

P.A.P.  Government  is  having  difficulty  in  its

negotiations  with the Federation Government  as  a

result  of  the  .way  it has been  handling  these

negotiations,  and  now  wants  support  and  moral

strength from us, we are prepared to give it in the

interest  of the people of Singapore. But  we  must

repeat  our warning again. Play it clean,  play  it

straight  and play it in the best interest  of  the

people of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Lee, on the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On the amendment. The Prime

Minister  plays very tough these days. He wants  to

give  an appearance to the people of Singapore that

he  is really holding on, fighting for the interest

of  the people of Singapore. But who does not  know

that  the  P.A.P. has  always  been  fighting  for

personal  and selfish interest? The Prime  Minister

has   referred  to  my  telegram  to  the   Foreign

Ministers'  conference  at  Manila.  He  says,  "Of

course, we cannot stop Malaysia." But the point  is

this,  the P.A.P. today plays tough for one special

reason.  It  is  not because the  P.A.P.  Ministers

really  have the interest of the people  at  heart,

but because they know that there are hitches in the

formation of Malaysia. The fact that the Tunku  had

to  go to Tokyo and that there are Ministers now in

Manila  show  that there are a lot of hitches.  The

newspapers  have already suggested  that  there  is

every  possibility,  and a very strong  possibility

too, that Malaysia cannot be formed in time.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown is

making  another speech on the main motion.  We  are

now on the amendment asking the House to express



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>



its   desire   that  there  should  be   an   early

settlement,  fair and just to both  sides,  on  the

basis  of  the terms of Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961.  The

Member  cannot  make  another speech  on  the  main

motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, why is the Prime Minister

taking  such a tough line? He does this  hoping  to

give the impression to the people of Singapore that

because  of  the P.A.P., Malaysia may  have  to  be

postponed.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must rule the Member out. He

must  speak on the amendment. He has had his chance

to  speak on the motion, and he is now speaking  on

the  motion. He must speak on the amendment  if  he

wishes to speak again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No other Member wishes to speak on the amendment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the words proposed to be added,

he there added," put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original Question, as amended, again proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will try to

be  brief.  There  are, it seems to  me,  two  very

strong impressions that persist in the minds of the

people  of  Singapore. I am sorry  that  the  Prime

Minister  is  not  here, but  I  hope  the  Finance

Minister will give the answers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of dates is important. On

Saturday, 13th April, when the Prime Minister  told

the  Press that there was a merger crisis and  that

anything  could happen, could the Finance  Minister

please enlighten us on these two points?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, whether on that date agreement had

already been reached that surpluses accumulated  in

Singapore  before 31st August, 1963, would  not  be

touched  by the Federation? Sir, this is  important

because  the  impression gained by  the  people  in

Singapore arising from Press reports was  that  the

Federation  was  going  to  raid  the  pre-Malaysia

surpluses  which  have  been  accumulated  by   the

Singapore Government for development purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second wrong impression, it seems to me, is

that on that date when the Prime Minister made  his

Press  statement,  the  Federation  Government  was

still trying to get agreement with Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>



that they should control the Federal  revenue

collected in Singapore and keep it in Kuala Lumpur.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these two impressions are very important

because unless they are clarified they will cause a

great  deal of misunderstanding. When we  heard  of

these  impressions, we realised that,  as  a  Party

that  stands for the people of Singapore, it  would

be difficult for us to agree to this sort of thing.

Therefore, some of us went to Kuala Lumpur to  seek

personal clarification. There we were told on  28th

April, I think ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> By whom?



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> --- that there had already been

agreement   that   the  surpluses  accumulated   in

Singapore  before 31st August, 1963, would  not  be

interfered  with  by the Federation,  and  that  if

there was any impression that had been given to the

people  of  Singapore  to the contrary,  then  that

impression was wrong. Further, the national revenue

collected in Singapore and reported to be deposited

in  Kuala  Lumpur would be deposited in  a  neutral

pool  in Singapore. Sir, if what we learnt in Kuala

Lumpur  was  correct,  then somehow  or  other  the

impressions   given  through  the   newspapers   in

Singapore to the people of Singapore were wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am now quoting from the Straits Times of

Tuesday, 16th April, 1963 - on page 1, col.  1:  Here

is the text of Tun Razak's statement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As Chairman of the Inter-Governmental Committee

on  Merger  of  Singapore with  the  Federation  of

Malaya,  I  have kept quiet for the last  two  days

because it has been the agreed practice that at the

end  of  a  conference we issue a  joint  statement

agreed  by both parties and neither side makes  any

further statement to the Press. However, since  the

Prime  Minister of Singapore had made a  number  of

statements  in  the  Press  which  were  not  quite

accurate, I feel it is my duty to put things  right

in order to avoid any wrong impression of what took

place at the Inter-Governmental Committee talks."'



<br><br>Then he went on further:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Singapore Government, in an official

statement,   has   now  practically   accused   the

Federation  Minister  of Finance,  which  means  in

effect the Federation Government, of trying  to  go

back on the Singapore White Paper.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>



This  is  completely untrue,  and  it  is  not  the

practice of the Federation Government to go back on

its word, written or unwritten."'



<br><br>Then he went on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"I regret very much the attitude taken by Mr

Lee.  I do not know what is his aim. The talks have

been delayed because of this," Tun Razak said.'



<br><br>Sir,  we ourselves were surprised that in the midst

of negotiations the Prime Minister should have come

out  with  A Press statement causing people  to  be

unhappy. On a bigger issue than this, that is, over

confrontation between Indonesia and Malaysia, which

could  have  led to a world conflagration,  we  are

glad that there has now come about a spirit of good-will  and  reconciliation in Tokyo. The  people  of

Singapore and in this part of the world ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member now seems to

be  far away from the motion. The motion is  not  a

motion criticising the action of the Prime Minister

or  the Minister for Finance or their dealings with

the  Federation Government. The motion  deals  with

the  progress made. Let us see whether  the  Member

speaking agrees that the Assembly should view  with

concern the progress made - with the addition of  the

amendment, of course - and expresses the desire  that

there should be an early settlement.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, it is because I feel the

people in this part of the world are so eager  that

there   should  be  less  confrontation  and   more

progress  towards  co-operation that  we  urge  the

Prime Minister to have less Press statements making

agreement more difficult.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I suggest to the Member

for  Tanglin that he file a motion criticising  the

in   one  of  his  concluding  paragraphs  in   his

financial statement, the Finance Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We are likely to prosper in Malaysia and it is

only  right that the additional prosperity  brought

about  by Malaysia should be made available to  the

under-developed parts of Malaysia.'



<br><br>Then he went on in the next paragraph, Sir:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It will be wrong.to adopt a selfish and grasping

policy  after  Malaysia and try to  hog  the  whole

prosperity   for   ourselves.   This   will   bring

resentment in other States of Malaysia and  in  the

end this will rebound to our disadvantage.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This applies to surpluses after 31st August, 1963,

I believe,  Sir,  because  it  says  here   about

prosperity  after Malaysia. But what we would  like

to  have  clarified, Sir, on the date  quoted  13th

April,  was it a fact or not a fact that there  had

already   been   agreement   that   the   surpluses

accumulated before Malaysia would not be touched by

the Federation?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It seems to be irrelevant, but if the

Minister  for Finance wishes to answer, he  can  do

so.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at this late

time  of  the night after a very busy  day  at  the

office,  I may be excused if I find some difficulty

in  giving all the details asked for by the  Member

for Tanglin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to know, if I understood him right,

whether  on  Saturday, 13th April, there  had  been

agreement   between   the  two   Governments   that

surpluses accumulated before ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> 31st August, 1963.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> --- surpluses accumulated before

merger   day  would  not  be  taken  over  by   the

Federation  Government. The  answer  is  that  this

point  never arose at all. The point is  completely

irrelevant. I remember seeing something  like  this

in  the  newspaper,  but the  point  is  completely

irrelevant,  because  if it means  that  they  will

share our accumulated surpluses, then it means that

we  have to pay out of our reserves. That was never

discussed,   never  thought  of,  either   by   the

Federation Government or our Government. But if the

Member  for  Tanglin will look at  page  5  of  the

statement made by the Prime Minister, in  fact  the

last line says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore retains half her surplus, based on 1961

calculations, instead of surrendering the whole.'



<br><br>That  was  the proposition discussed at the  Inter-Governmental  Committee on the  10th  and  11th  of

April.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Subsequent surpluses.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, in other words, they

wanted  subsequent surpluses. No, no, that  is  not

correct.  It is a curious method of calculation.  I

think  I shall find great difficulty in using words

to  get  across  the  approach  of  the  Federation

Government. I shall try my best to explain. It is a

very complicated idea.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it necessary?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think the Member for Tanglin

is rather looking forward to it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is it necessary in this

context?  I am just wondering whether it is  really

relevant.  If  it is not relevant to  this  motion,

then  I  suggest the Minister send a memorandum  to

the Member for Tanglin.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It is not really necessary. The

second   question   is  that  he   understood   the

Federation Government to have agreed [pause] ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister may take his

seat. Perhaps the Member for Tanglin would like  to

repeat his question.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> The second impression gaining

ground   was   that  Federal  taxes  collected   in

Singapore  would  be kept in Kuala Lumpur,  whereas

apparently on the date of the Press statement,  the

agreement had already been that such taxes would be

collected and kept in a neutral pool in the central

bank in Singapore and not in Kuala Lumpur. Was that

correct?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Page 3 of the statement gives the

reply.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That is correct. But that is

not  the main point at issue at all. The main point

at   issue  is  who  is  to  control  the   Revenue

Department?  We say Singapore controls the  Revenue

Department, and they say no. And at that Time there

was still a dispute on that point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I did not intend to speak on this subject, but

I  felt  that I must not allow a statement made  by

the  Member  for  Queenstown  to  go  unchallenged.

Referring to the terms of merger, he said it  is  a

matter of a cheap sale, but we, the S.P.A., had  to

support  it  because  of  our  relations  with  the

Federation Alliance. He went so far as to say  that

the Member for Cairnhill had said this. Now this is

untrue. I would like to put it on record that  this

is  untrue,  because we have always  said  that  we

support  the  terms of the White Paper  because  we

felt  that  the P.A.P. was not able to  get  better

terms  and  that we the Alliance, when we  come  to

power,  would  be able to get better terms.  Accept

the  crumbs  now and fight for the loaf  later  on.

That  has  always been our motive. And to say  that

the  Member  for  Cairnhill had told  him  it  was

because   of  our  relations  with  the  Federation

Alliance that we were forced to accept a cheap sale

merger is completely untrue.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> resumed her seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Member for Cairnhill told

the Member for Upper Serangoon exactly what I said.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can

assure   him   the   Member  for  Upper   Serangoon

misunderstood. I am quite sure. I am sure that even

the  Prime  Minister today must be very  surprised

that we are accepting the amended motion. But,  for

his  information, Sir, it has always been our  firm

stand  that  we  are on the side of the  people  of

Singapore  and their welfare is our first  concern.

As  a matter of fact, that was what inspired us  to

send   our   representation  to  Kuala   Lumpur - the

representation   mentioned  by   the   Member   for

Cairnhill.  We actually made the decision  that  if

the  P.A.P. - P.A.P. or no P.A.P. - is  on  the  right

track fighting for the good and the welfare of  the

people, we would be on their side. But today,  Sir,

things  are a little different. We have  found  out

that  it is because the whole thing has boomeranged

on them. Because all their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>



clever  tactics  of  playing politics  and  calling

names  and so on for electioneering purposes on  an

important   national   matter   like   this    have

boomeranged  on  them, they  now  come  to  us  and

deceive or grab rather - I think it is right  to  use

the  word "grab" - the opportunity of this motion  to

amend  it so that they will get our support and  go

back  to  Kuala Lumpur, as they put  it,  with  the

added  figure. In spite of knowing that,  Sir,  but

because  it is for the good of the people that  the

Malaysia talks are finalised and completed, we will

still support the motion, but we hope they will not

play too much politics and exploit the situation.
