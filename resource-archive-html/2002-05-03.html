<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>BILATERAL ISSUES WITH MALAYSIA</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Prime Minister if he

will  give  an update on the on-going talks with Malaysia  on

the various bilateral issues currently under discussion.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime

Minister has asked me to reply on his behalf.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I may start by recalling that after Senior Minister

Lee's  visit  to KL in September 2001, he wrote to  Malaysian

Prime  Minister Dr Mahathir to set out the areas of agreement

and issues which had to be resolved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 18th October 2001, Dr Mahathir replied to Senior

Minister indicating, among other things, that Malaysia  might

end  the  KTM  train  service  in  Johor  Baru  and  was  re-considering  its  proposal to build an undersea  rail  tunnel

linking  Johor  and  Singapore and a bridge  to  replace  the

Causeway.   As  this  was  a  departure  from  their  earlier

discussion in Kuala Lumpur, Senior Minister Lee wrote  to  Dr

Mahathir  on  10th  December 2001 to seek clarification.   We

requested  Malaysia to set out its position  on  the  various

issues  so  that  there would be a clear  framework  for  the

officials,  led  by the two Foreign Ministers,  to  meet  and

discuss the details.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 4th March 2002, Dr Mahathir replied to Senior

Minister  Lee  enclosing Malaysia's latest proposals  on  the

various issues, including the price of water.  Some of  these

proposals  were completely new and different  from  what  had

been  discussed  during the meetings between Senior  Minister

Lee  and Dr Mahathir and in previous correspondence.   Senior

Minister Lee replied on 11th March 2002 that Singapore needed

some  time  to  study the new Malaysian proposals  and  their

implications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 11th April 2002, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong wrote

to Dr Mahathir to set out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



Singapore's responses to the Malaysian proposals.   The  next

step  would  be  for the officials, led by  the  two  Foreign

Ministers, to meet in Kuala Lumpur at a mutually agreed  date

to  discuss  the  details.  I have written to my  counterpart

Foreign Minister Syed Hamid proposing a set of dates for this

meeting.  I am awaiting his reply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said in Parliament last September, that is, the

previous  Parliament,  Singapore believes  that  reaching  an

agreement  with  Malaysia on the package of issues  would  be

mutually  beneficial to both countries.  We are committed  to

forging  a  long-term  relationship with  Malaysia  based  on

mutual  respect  and sovereign equality to realise  the  full

potential  in  our bilateral relationship.   While  I  cannot

predict the outcome of the negotiations, which I believe will

begin soon, let me state that Singapore will continue to take

a  constructive approach with the aim of finding a  `win-win'

solution to these bilateral issues.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, may I ask

the  Minister whether it is possible for him to disclose some

main  details  of  the  contents of  the  counter-offer  from

Malaysia,  and  also whether it is possible for  us  to  know

about  Singapore's position, because I think  the  public  is

interested  in this matter.  And if it is not possible,  then

at  least he could let us know what kind of tack we intend to

take   with   regard  to  Malaysia's  request.   Because   we

understand that the offer of price for water is exorbitant.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can understand the

desire of the Member to obtain the details.  But, at the same

time,  I am sure the Member will appreciate that I would  not

be  able  to  disclose  at this stage the  details  of  those

proposals   and   our  response,  in  that  the   nature   of

negotiations, I think, it is premature for us to divulge  the

details when the first round of discussions has not yet taken

place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the broad approach, let me say that Singapore will

naturally want to advance our interest.  We have heard the

Prime Minister speak in this Chamber of the position we  will

take   on  water,  so  that  we  will  increasingly  distance

ourselves  away  from  dependence  on  water  and   rely   on

alternative  sources.   The  issue  now  is  not   on   broad

principles any more.  Both sides have to get down to details.

And  on  water, for example, we have to get down on  details,

such  as  the  amount, the quantum, the mix between  raw  and

treated  water, and on pricing.  But these will  have  to  be

sorted out together with a host of other issues when we first

meet.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> May I ask the Minister,

with  this wavering of decisions by the Malaysian side,  will

this  be the last time that these changes will stop?  We have

to end these changes so that we can come down to some serious

discussions and settle these issues.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> It will not be possible for me to give

a  guarantee that there will not be further changes in  their

approach  or  changes  in their proposals.   But  as  Foreign

Ministers,  I  hope Minister Syed Hamid and I will  be  able,

after  so many years, to get down to brass tacks at our first

meeting, together with our officials.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Can

the  Minister  give  us  an update on  the  progress  of  the

alternative search for water source?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I thought the Prime Minister had

already  sketched  in broad outlines our approach  in  moving

towards  developing alternative sources,  both  in  terms  of

NEWater and desalination.  As Foreign Minister, I do not have

the details of this, but if he were to file a Question or use

the  opportunity during the Committee of Supply to direct his

request  to  the  appropriate Minister,  which  will  be  the

Minister for the Environment, I am sure he will get a  fuller

answer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, I want to ask about water as

well,  but in a different context.  Since the Prime  Minister

has mentioned that Singapore intends to be self-sufficient in

water, especially with NEWater and other water supplies, how



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



did  the Malaysians react so far in their communication  with

us, ie, whether they have a particular response?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is in the same line of questioning.

The  Malaysians  had  mentioned  the  disagreement  over  our

reclamation of the shores between Singapore and Malaysia.  We

said  that  we  want  to  wait for  a  third  party  official

communication  from  Malaysia.   So,  has  there   been   any

communication from the Malaysians on this matter?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Leong Horn Kee asked two questions.

The  first part of his question was: what was the Malaysians'

response  to  what we have said about developing  alternative

sources?   There  has not been any official response  because

this  was a statement made by the Prime Minister.  But  I  am

sure the Member as well as other Members would have noted  in

the  media, some of their leaders have made statements to the

effect that this is up to Singapore.  But there has not  been

any  official  response.  Whether we will  take  this  up  in

detail  during  the  first round of  discussions  is  another

matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reclamation is not an issue as part of the package. But

since  the  Member has raised the question,  let  me  recall,

first, what we have said in this Chamber - that Malaysia  had

previously sent us two notes.  And these notes were  on  28th

January  and  2nd  April.  But those  first  two  Notes  were

confined  solely to their claim that our reclamation  in  the

Tuas  area  had  encroached on their territorial  waters  and

jurisdiction,  which  is not true and we  have  categorically

refuted those claims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, Malaysians have sent us a note on 30th

April protesting our reclamation works around Tekong and Ubin

on broad grounds of trans-boundary environmental impact.  But

I  should  say  that  neither the latest  Note  nor  the  two

previous  Notes in any way contain the detailed  facts  about

their concerns of how the reclamation has affected them.  You

will recall that Singapore has consistently



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



said  that  the Malaysians ought to send us a note  itemising

their  concerns.   And  this was requested  by  Deputy  Prime

Minister  when he visited Malaysia in March.  The  Malaysians

have  said that they will send us such a note.  What we  need

really  is  not itemisation of general allegations  or  broad

complaints.   What we need are details of how our reclamation

has adversely affected them, then only we can reply.  We have

to-date  not  received such a note itemising and setting  out

the details of their concerns.  They have said that they will

send  us  that  note.  Members would have read in  the  media

comments by their leaders that they are preparing such a note

and  it may take a few months.  We await that note.  When  we

receive  that  note and we have the details of their  claims,

not broad allegations, we will study them and give a reply.

<div align="center"><b>GENERAL ELECTION</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Prime Minister whether

for  the  next General Election he is willing to (i)  release

the  report of the Boundaries Review Committee at  least  six

months  before the dissolution of Parliament; (ii) limit  the

number  of  candidates in a Group Representation Constituency

to  three or, in any case, to not more than six; (iii) reduce

the   election  deposit  from  $13,000  to  $3,000  for  each

candidate; (iv) have more than one designated rally site in a

single-member  constituency; and (v) increase the  number  of

days for campaigning from eight to fourteen days.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, electoral boundaries

are  reviewed from time to time, following population  shifts

arising  from  housing developments.  It is the  practice  of

every  Electoral Boundaries Review Committee to  release  its

report  in the form of a White Paper, as soon as it is  ready

and  without  undue  delay.   The  date  of  dissolution   of

Parliament is not decided by the Electoral Boundaries  Review

Committee.  Parliament is dissolved by the President  on  the

advice  of  the  Prime Minister.  In any  case,  if  the  new

boundaries were to be used, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



Electoral  Boundaries Review Committee's  Report  has  to  be

released before the dissolution of Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of number of GRC candidates, the law

already   limits  the  number  of  candidates  in   a   Group

Representation Constituency to between three and six.   There

is no intention to change this now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of electoral deposit, the law

specifies  that  the  deposit is 8% of the  total  allowances

payable  to an elected Member of Parliament in the  preceding

year.   This  is necessary, to confine elections  to  serious

candidates.   Reducing the deposit way below an MP's  monthly

allowance would attract frivolous candidates who would  stand

for  election with no serious hope of getting elected.   They

would  try  their  luck as there is less  to  lose,  and  our

election would end up like a lottery and be demeaned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the 8% figure is not something that we conjured out

of  thin  air.  There is a basis for this: it is roughly  the

equivalent  of an MP's monthly allowance.  Historically,  our

election  deposit  has  always been  pegged  to  the  monthly

allowance  of an MP.  When the deposit was fixed at  $500  in

1954, the monthly allowance of a Legislative Assemblyman  was

$500.  The deposit was raised to $1,200 in 1973 and $1,500 in

1978 when the monthly allowance of an MP in 1973 and 1978 was

$1,136 and $1,483, respectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Parliamentary Elections Act was then amended in

1988  to provide a formula to automatically change the amount

of  election deposit whenever the MP's allowance  is  varied,

without  any  need  for periodic reviews.  Nevertheless,  the

principle has remained the same, which is that the deposit is

pegged at an MP's monthly allowance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any serious candidate should be able to raise this

amount.   In  the recent general election, 35 (including  the

five  disqualified  for documentary defects)  opposition  and

independent  candidates presented themselves for  nomination.

This shows that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>



raising  money  for the deposit was no deterrent  to  serious

candidates.   In  any  case, practically all  candidates  can

reclaim their election deposit.   What they have to do is  to

poll  at least one-eighth of the electoral votes.   It should

not be difficult for any candidate with a serious platform to

secure this minimum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of rally sites, election rally

sites  are  selected by the police, based on  law  and  order

considerations  as  well  as the  need  to  avoid  causing  a

nuisance  to  the  residents.  As Singapore has  become  more

built-up, it is getting more and more difficult to find  many

sites  suitable  to hold election rallies, especially  fields

and  other open areas.  We may have no choice but to  confine

rallies  to be held in enclosed areas like sports  stadia  in

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also especially difficult to find suitable

multiple sites within a single-member constituency because of

its  smaller geographical size.  In time to come, the  police

may  conceivably  not  be able to find even  one  rally  site

within some constituencies.  It may then be necessary to zone

electoral  constituencies and have some  of  them  share  the

rally sites in the area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the question of number of days for campaigning,

Sir, in 1960, the minimum period of election campaign was set

at eight days to bring our legislation more in line with what

was current in other parts of the British Commonwealth and in

the  United  Kingdom.   It  was also  because  the  Elections

Department  had  by  then  gained sufficient  experience  and

machinery to conduct an election more expeditiously.  We have

not varied much from this minimum period for the past general

elections.  Between elections, political parties are free  to

communicate to the population their political agenda and  air

their  views  on  national policies.  Unlike  a  large  rural

country,  in a small but highly urbanised country like  ours,

fully  served  by  roads and public transport,  coupled  with

universal access to all manner of communications media, there

is really no need for a more prolonged campaigning period.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, the Minister

says  that  the  report  of the Electoral  Boundaries  Review

Committee shall be published as soon as it is ready.  Between

elections,  there is a period of about three,  four  or  five

years.   Why is it that at the last election, the report  was

only ready one day before Parliament was dissolved?  They had

plenty of time.  Why should they choose to release it one day

before  the dissolution of Parliament?  Perhaps, the Minister

could explain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the number of members in a GRC, the purpose

of  a  GRC  of  course  is to ensure  that  there  is  ethnic

representation  in Singapore.  But I would like  to  ask  the

Minister  whether or not ethnic PAP candidates are  confident

if  they  have  only one non-ethnic candidate to  hold  their

hands  to  get into Parliament.  Or do they need two,  three,

four  or  five  candidates to get them into Parliament.   The

number  of  six  is more for PAP electoral purposes  than  to

ensure  ethnic  representation in  Singapore.   Perhaps,  the

Minister would like to comment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I agree that the timing of the

publication  of  the  Electoral Boundaries  Review  Committee

Report  was rather short.  It was an unusual occasion because

it  was  just  after  September 11 and with  the  economy  in

recession,  the  Government has to deal  with  urgent  issues

facing  us.   The Electoral Boundaries Review Committee  took

quite a short time - I would say about three or four weeks  - to complete its report, although the officers might have done

some  work  resulting from the changes in the  population  as

well  as  the  shift  in the voters.  Immediately  after  the

report was ready, it was published.  The Prime Minister  then

decided that it was necessary to go to the people to  have  a

mandate  to  deal  with very urgent problems confronting  the

country  and  we found out that, indeed, the decision  was  a

correct one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam asked why do we need three, four or five non-minority candidates to be in the GRC. Is that the question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> To bring them into Parliament.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> The purpose of the GRC is to ensure

that   Parliament   has  the  representation   of   all   our

communities, including the Malays, Indians and other minority

communities.   So  we have in the provision  of  the  law,  a

minimum  of three candidates in a GRC, but no more than  six.

That has been the practice all along.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> That is the purpose behind the law.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> That is right. So we have that, and

we  have  achieved  the  purpose.  I do  not  understand  the

purpose of his question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, if I understand the Minister

correctly, the delay of the publication of the report of  the

Electoral  Boundaries Review Committee was due  to  September

11.   Can he explain what has September 11 got to do with the

preparation of the report of the Electoral Boundaries  Review

Committee?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point about the GRC is that you want to ensure

minority candidates.  The rationale behind it is that if  you

have  a  Chinese candidate and a non-Chinese candidate  in  a

single-seat  constituency, the PAP thinks  that  the  Chinese

candidate  will win against a non-Chinese candidate.   So  to

ensure  that  the PAP ethnic candidate gets into  Parliament,

they  must have some non-ethnic candidates to come along with

them, to bring them into Parliament.  My point is: why do you

need  five  other  non-ethnic candidates to  get  the  ethnic

candidates into Parliament?  I think one is enough.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> That is where I am confused by Mr

Chiam's question.  Firstly, he did not hear me correctly.   I

did not say that the publication was due to the September  11

incident.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> You mentioned it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Please check the record. I will

repeat  it here again for his benefit.  What I have said  was

that the Committee was already doing its work and when it had

finished, the report was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



published.  Because of the September 11 incident as  well  as

the  urgency  to  deal  with the economic  problems  we  were

facing, the Prime Minister decided on a quick election.  That

is  what  I said.  The results bore themselves out  that  the

decision  was  correct and the people gave  the  PAP  a  very

strong mandate to ensure that we would deal with the problems

we are facing now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of minority candidates, we all know that

in  all our constituencies, the racial distribution is  quite

even.   We have explained before that the purpose of the  GRC

is   to  ensure  that  we  have  minority  representation  in

Parliament and that is why we decided to have GRCs.   It  has

served  our  purpose that we now have minority candidates  in

Parliament.  Whether we need three, four or five  others,  it

depends  on the configuration of the constituency.   In  some

areas, it may be more convenient to group them in three, some

maybe  four,  some  maybe five, and  some  maybe  six.   From

experience, this has borne out to be correct.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, as regards the election

deposits, the rationale is that the Government wants to  keep

out   frivolous   candidates.   The   average   thinking   of

Singaporeans is that $13,000 is definitely too high a figure.

The  non-PAP candidates, most of them, are not well off.   In

fact, personally, I know that many serious candidates who are

in the opposition would have stood for the elections, but for

this  $13,000.  It is not only the candidate himself who  has

to worry about the $13,000 ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, could you ask your supplementary

question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am coming to it. The candidate

will  also  have  to discuss, being Asians, with  members  of

their family, their wives, and most of them feel that $13,000

is  too  much,  and they do not allow the serious  opposition

candidate  to  take part.  The other rationale  is  that  the

deposit is pegged to the MP's allowance.  Why do we not  have

two categories then?  For incumbent Members who want



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>



to  stand  again, they can take this standard of one  month's

allowance.   But those who are coming in for the  first  time

and  who  are not MPs, we can reduce it to $3,000.  I  wonder

whether the Minister will allow two categories of deposits.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I do not know about the average

thinking of Singaporeans.  That is what Mr Chiam said.  I  am

just  quoting  him.   I  know  of  the  thinking  of  average

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the candidates think that $13,000 is too much and

fear  losing their deposit, then they really do not have  the

confidence that they can even get the support of 1/8  of  the

voters  and  they should seriously think again  whether  they

should  contest.  There are examples of this.  Dr  Tan  Cheng

Bock  will probably know.  The voters there hardly  saw  that

opposition candidate who lost his deposit.  Mr Tan Kim Chuang

probably  did  not appeal to the voters in Bukit  Timah  and,

therefore, also lost his deposit.  But any serious candidate,

anyone   with  a  good  platform,  should  have  no   problem

convincing 1/8 of the electorate to vote for him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of two categories of candidates is, I think, a

very  amazing  one.   I  cannot see  the  logic  behind  this

suggestion:  that  new  candidates  pay  less  and  incumbent

candidates or MPs who have retired and want to contest  again

pay more.  Why do we discriminate between different types  of

candidates?  They are all candidates.  After all, if he is an

elected  MP, he is an elected MP.  There are no differentials

in  rights for the MPs if they are elected.  So why does  the

hon.  Member  want  to  have different  classes  of  MPs  and

different classes of candidates?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, the Minister, in his

main answer on the question of rally sites, says that law and

order is the main consideration as to why the number of rally

sites is reduced and why some rally sites are not even within

the  constituencies themselves.  Does the Minister agree that

public  rallies during elections are probably the only  links

that the Opposition could reach out to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>



voters  effectively?  Thus, by reducing the number  of  rally

sites or moving the rally site far away from the constituency

itself  will  reduce the influence that the Opposition  could

have  to persuade the voters to vote for them.  Does he  also

agree  that  the same argument of law and order applies,  ie,

would  there  be  a day when we have elections  but  have  no

public  rallies,  because law and order is  a  concern?   And

would there then be that, somehow, elections will cause  some

problem  of  law and order and, thereby, there  shall  be  no

elections because of law and order?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I think Mr Low is trying to string A

+  B  =  C,  which  need not necessarily be so  in  his  last

question,  ie,  that  because we could  have  law  and  order

problems,  and  therefore better not have rallies.   I  think

that is a stretch of the imagination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rallies are not the only ways that candidates reach out

to  their voters.  On that I disagree with him.  Rallies  are

just  one  of  the ways for candidates to reach  out  to  the

voters.  In fact, if he says that because the rally sites are

far  away from residents and therefore may affect the voters'

decision to vote for a particular candidate, the results will

bear  themselves out.  One would find it quite  strange  that

very few people attended the PAP rallies and yet thousands of

them  turned  up at the Opposition rallies.  Those  who  have

attended rallies would know that.  So I would say that as far

as  rally  sites are concerned, it is no deterrent to  people

who  want  to attend a rally.  In the case of Mr  Chiam,  for

example,  on  his last evening at the Lavender  Street  rally

site,  he  had  13,000 people turning up, with  quite  a  few

hundred of them spilling onto the streets.  So I do not quite

agree  with  this argument that because rally sites  are  far

away  and therefore voters would not turn up.  In fact,  they

will  turn  up  if  they think that there is  a  show.   Some

consider  this  to  be  a  show  because  they  like  to   be

entertained, and we are not good entertainers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> The Minister has agreed that

the short period given



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



in  the last election is unusual.  Can the Minister give  the

assurance that this kind of short one-day notice between  the

Electoral   Boundaries  Review  Committee  Report   and   the

dissolution of Parliament would not happen in future?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I cannot guarantee that it would

not happen but I would say that we will try not to do it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Why not the Government call the

Electoral   Boundaries  Review  Committee   to   review   the

boundaries  much earlier, way before an election?   Why  wait

until  so  late and then suddenly decide to call an  election

only one day after its Report is released?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> There is not much use if the

Electoral  Boundaries Review Committee is convened two  years

before an intended date of election because between then  and

the  time of the calling of the election, there will be a lot

of  population shifts.  In fact, many thousands of people  do

change  addresses  every month and if we  have  an  electoral

boundary  fixed on a particular day and yet the  election  is

held,  say,  two  years or a year, or even six  months  after

that, many voters would be inconvenienced to have to go  back

to the place where they stayed to vote.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the Minister mentioned Mr Tan

Kim  Chuang.  Is he saying that Mr Tan Kim Chuang  is  not  a

serious  candidate?  I am very certain that he is  a  serious

candidate, although he lost his deposit in the process.  So I

do  not  know what his rationale is in mentioning Mr Tan  Kim

Chuang.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I think Mr Chiam did not quite

hear  me correctly.  I said the opposition candidate in  Ayer

Rajah  did  not seem quite serious because he  did  not  even

bother to turn up and, in the case of Bukit Timah, the voters

did not find Mr Tan Kim Chuang's platform appealing.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, as regards the report of the

Electoral Boundaries Review



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>



Committee, I think releasing its report six months earlier is

definitely not too early.  Even assuming there are changes of

addresses within the six months, and normally there are,  and

even  if you look at the Electoral Register, there is  always

that  yellow section where you will find all the persons  who

have  moved within the last three, four, five or six  months.

So this can be done.  I cannot understand why the Minister is

mentioning  that  six months is too long.   I  just  want  to

remind the Minister that I am not asking for two years or one

year.  I am only asking for six months for the results of the

Electoral Boundaries Review Committee to be announced  before

the  dissolution of Parliament.  In case he has forgotten  my

request, it is six months, not two years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the deposit, I do not see any discrimination

if  there  is  a  two-tier deposit.   I  wonder  whether  the

Minister is willing to rethink and give us an answer  or,  at

least, say that he will consider and not brush it off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the increase in the number of days for

campaigning,  increasing it from eight to  14  days  is  very

reasonable, and I hope the Minister will at least say he will

consider,  because  this  is  definitely  in  line  with  the

remaking of Singapore.  If we want to have more vibrancy  and

ideas, the longer the election period, the more ideas will be

thrown up.  It is not a show.  Let us get on with what we are

going to do for Singapore.  So will he also reconsider this 8-14 days request?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, one cannot really say whether

there  will  be  a  minimum period of six months  before  the

publication  of  the  Electoral Boundaries  Review  Committee

Report and the dissolution of Parliament.  That decision  has

to be taken later by the Prime Minister, and I would not want

to  encumber  him by telling Members that that would  be  the

case.  But I am sure the Prime Minister will take all factors

into consideration when deciding on the date of the election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot find any logic to the argument to provide for a

two-tier deposit for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>



different types of candidates.  They are all candidates, they

should  all  be paying one rate of deposit.  If not,  then  I

think   we   could   quite  rightfully  say   that   we   are

discriminating against the old candidates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the days of campaigning, I cannot make the connection

between  how this ties up with the Remaking of Singapore  and

the  throwing up of ideas.  Ideas should always be thrown  up

if  they  are good ideas, and they should be communicated  to

the  people  and, at least, they should try to  convince  the

people that these are good ideas for acceptance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I should let the House know too, Sir, that in

the  UK,  for example, they used to have a time of not  later

than nine days between Nomination Day and Polling Day.  Then,

in  1981, they amended it to no later than 10 days, in  other

words, between Nomination Day and Polling Day, it must be  no

later than 10 days, and the reason then was that Saturday was

no longer a working day for election officials and the period

was  extended by a day.  And in 1985 they changed  it  to  11

days  because  they wanted to give more time for  the  postal

ballots  to  come  in.  So even in a large country  like  the

United  Kingdom, the campaigning period after Nomination  Day

is only no more than 11 days.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the Minister has cited the UK

example.  If I am not mistaken, normally, in England,  before

an  election  is held, they give at least one month's  notice

that an election will be held on a certain day, at least  one

month.   So  there is a preparation period.  At least  people

can  go around and do their campaigning one month before  the

election  is held.  But, in Singapore, nobody knows when  the

election  is  going to be held.  It is such  a  good  secret,

state  secret, that not even, I think, their own PAP  members

know of it, except the Prime Minister himself.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, we do better than that. We give

people  a  5-year notice period, that immediately  after  the

election is over, please prepare for the next election.

<div align="center"><b>MIDDLE EAST SITUATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Singapore's position)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Dr Ong Chit Chung</b> asked the Minister for Foreign

Affairs  if he would inform the House of Singapore's position

on   recent  disturbing  developments  on  the  Middle   East

situation, including the position Singapore has taken in  the

United Nations Security Council.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Middle East issue

is  one  of  the most complex and intractable issues  of  our

time.  We are fully aware that there are no easy solutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's position on the Middle East has been guided

by  our  support  of  the  principles of  international  law,

observance of the United Nations Charter, and compliance with

the  relevant  resolutions  of the  United  Nations  Security

Council.   These  include opposition  to  the  use  of  force

against the territorial integrity or political sovereignty of

any state, and respect for the principles of equal rights and

self-determination of peoples.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have good relations with Israel as well as with

the  Palestinian  Authority.   Singapore  has  supported  the

aspirations  of  the Palestinian people,  and  has  voted  in

support  of  all United Nations General Assembly  resolutions

pertinent to the Palestinian question.  At the same time,  we

recognise  the  right of Israel to exist  as  an  independent

state  within secure and recognised borders, but  Israel,  in

turn, must recognise the inalienable right of the Palestinian

people to a homeland of their own and must comply with United

Nations  Security Council resolutions on withdrawal from  the

occupied territories.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision of a region where two states, Israel and

Palestine,  live side by side, within secure  and  recognised

borders,  has  been  enshrined in  the  UN  Security  Council

Resolution 1397 of 12th March 2002, for which Singapore voted

in favour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent deteriorating crisis in the Middle East is a

matter  of  grave concern.  This escalation of  violence  has

continued



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>



unabated for far too long, resulting in a senseless  loss  of

lives  of  so  many innocent people.  In the  United  Nations

Security  Council, we have joined other members in expressing

outrage that innocent civilians have been targeted and killed

for  military and political reasons.  In particular, we  have

expressed  our  concerns over alarming  reports  of  what  UN

officials have described as a horrific devastation and a dire

humanitarian  situation in the Palestinian cities.   We  have

deplored in the strongest terms all acts of terror, and  have

called for an end to the extreme acts by both sides.   As  an

elected  member of the Security Council, we have worked  with

the 14 other members and voted in support of four resolutions

in  the  recent two months to demand an immediate end to  the

violence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we believe that there must be a withdrawal of

Israeli  forces from the Palestinian cities, accompanied,  at

the   same  time,  by  genuine  efforts  of  the  Palestinian

Authority  to  take action against acts of terror.   In  this

regard, Sir, the UN Security Council has supported the  joint

statement  of  10  April 2002 of the  quartet,  ie,  the  US,

Russia,  EU  and  the UN Secretary-General, which  called  on

Chairman  Arafat  to  use the full weight  of  his  political

authority to persuade the Palestinian people that any or  all

terrorist  attacks against Israelis should  end  immediately.

This  is  in the interests of the Palestinians, for,  as  the

joint  statement  also  said, "Terrorism,  including  suicide

bombs,  is illegal and immoral, and has inflicted grave  harm

to  the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people, and

must be condemned, as called for in Resolution 1373."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been claims and counter claims as to the

nature  and  extent of the humanitarian situation, especially

in  the refugee camp in Jinin.  At the UN, we have said  that

the  only way to objectively assess the situation is  for  an

independent  and  impartial  body  to  establish  the  facts.

Therefore, we and other Council Members voted unanimously  on

19th   April   to  support  Secretary-General  Kofi   Annan's

initiative to despatch a fact finding team to Jinin.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that it was in Israel's interest to have a

full and public clarification of the situation in Jinin.   It

is  therefore unfortunate that the Secretary-General has  now

been  forced  by Israel's continued rejection  of  the  fact-finding   team   to  disband  the  team.   In  the   informal

consultation  at the Security Council, we have joined  others

in expressing deep regret at Israel's rebuff of the Secretary-General's  efforts.  We hope that the Secretary-General  will

continue  to collate all available information on  Jinin  and

keep  the  Council  informed as accurate information  becomes

available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore supports the immediate relief efforts to

address the humanitarian crisis.  Israel's obligation and the

international  laws are clear.  It must allow and  facilitate

immediate  access by humanitarian agencies to mount emergency

rescue operations in the affected areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, decades of tragic violence have clearly

demonstrated  that there can be no military solution  to  the

conflict.   We support all efforts to bring about an  end  to

the  violence and the resumption of the peace process.  These

include  Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah's Arab peace initiative,

the  efforts of the quartet involving the US, EU, Russia  and

the  UN  Secretary-General, and all these efforts  have  been

supported by the UN Security Council.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also welcome the latest news that the siege on

Chairman  Arafat  has been lifted as a result  of  diplomatic

efforts  undertaken by the US and UK.  Sir, we  believe  also

that  the UN Secretary-General has a vital role to play.   We

have  responded  positively  to his  proposal  to  deploy  an

impartial and robust multi-national force to the region,  and

we   have   urged  the  Council  to  consider  the  situation

seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, let me say that the immediate priority now

is  to  break the cycle of violence.  What is urgently needed

is  a  political will to end the violence and  implement  the

ceasefire which would pave the way to the resumption of peace

talks.  But the primary responsibility, Sir, clearly falls on

the parties themselves.  Nonetheless, Singapore will continue

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



work with other members of the Security Council to adopt  the

constructive approach to assist the parties to reach a  just,

lasting and comprehensive peace.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong):</b> Sir, I would like to say

that I am personally satisfied that we, Singapore, are equal,

fair  and  impartial.  But I would like to ask  the  Minister

whether he cares to elaborate that in our position in the  UN

Security Council, of which we are a member, whether we  could

draw  any lessons from this very difficult situation and very

difficult time, because we are a very small nation.   And  if

the  impasse  continues in the Middle East, could  we,  as  a

small  country, together with other nations, take any further

steps to improve the situation?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, to deal with the second part of

his  question  first,  yes, we are in the  Security  Council.

And  for this month, in May, we have the Presidency   of  the

Security  Council.  We will do our part as a  member  of  the

Security  Council and, for this month, as President,  working

closely  with the other members of the Security  Council  and

the  Secretary-General,  to facilitate  the  discussions,  to

reach  whatever constructive solutions that can  be  had  for

this  very difficult problem.  It is a problem that has  been

in  the  world  and the region for decades.  Many  a  leading

statesman has been involved in offering good offices.   There

have been many accords and peace plans; the Mitchel Plan, the

Tenet  Plan,  Oslo Accord, Madrid Accord and so on,  but  the

crisis  has not eased up.  We have a sense of realism  as  to

what  Singapore can do because, as I said in my main  answer,

really  it  calls  for political will and a  resolve  of  the

parties  themselves.   Clearly also  that  there  can  be  no

military solution to the conflict.  But to the extent that we

can,  we  will  play  our part as a member  of  the  Security

Council,  but  I would not want to overstate  it  because  it

essentially falls on the parties themselves and the permanent

members   of   the  Security  Council;  the   United   States

particularly plays a very important role in this process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What lessons can we draw? I would say that this

situation underscores the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



importance  of  observance and compliance with principles  of

international  law, compliance with United  Nations  Security

Council, respect for territorial integrity, avoidance of  the

use  of  force and violence and, above all, I think it  shows

that  for  a small country, it is important for us,  on  this

situation or any other crisis situation, to show support  for

the United Nations and to show support for initiatives by the

United Nation's Secretary-General.

<div align="center"><b>CONTRACT WORKERS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mdm Halimah Yacob</b> asked the Minister for Manpower,

with the increasing use of contracts for services in engaging

workers when they are obviously employees, what more can  his

Ministry  do  to prevent employers from denying such  workers

their  benefits  under the Employment  Act  and  the  Central

Provident Fund Act.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen) (for the Minister for Manpower):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me answer

the  Member  by  briefly  sketching  the  scope  of  contract

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contract workers fall into two broad categories. One

where  contract  workers are supplied  to  a  company  by  an

employment  agency  or  manpower  supplier.   Such   contract

workers,  including  part-timers,  temporary  staff  have  an

employee-employer  relationship with the agency  or  manpower

supplier.   They are covered by the Employment Act and  other

legislation  such  as the CPF Act and Workmen's  Compensation

Act.    Hence,  their  employment  terms  and  benefits   are

protected  by  these  laws.   The second  group  of  contract

workers are those engaged on contract for service such  as  a

plumber,  painter or private tutor to do a specific task  for

an  agreed  fee.   Persons under a contract for  service  are

independent    contractors    with    no    employer-employee

relationship  with  the service user.  Hence,  they  are  not

covered by labour laws as the end users of the services  have

no obligation to provide welfare and benefits to them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a person is indeed engaged as an employee and is not

given  the benefits as stipulated in the labour laws such  as

CPF contribution or statutory benefits in the Employment Act,

the  person  should  approach the Ministry  of  Manpower  for

advice and assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry recently conducted a study on more than

2,000  contract  workers employed by 14 labour  suppliers  or

agencies  and  deployed  to work at clients'  premises.   The

study revealed that the majority of the labour suppliers  and

agencies  do  provide benefits under the Employment  Act  for

their  contract workers. Only a very small number  of  labour

suppliers  failed to provide the statutory benefits  such  as

sick leave and hospitalisation leave. The study also revealed

that  the  labour suppliers and employment agencies had  paid

CPF  contributions for their contract employees.  My Ministry

will  continue  to  conduct checks on  companies  and  labour

suppliers to ensure that contract employees are provided with

the   benefits  under  the  Employment  Act  and  their   CPF

contributions are duly paid.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, I would like to ask

the  Minister  what  is the assessment  of  the  Ministry  of

Manpower  as to the extent of the problem.  I think the  real

issue  here  is that people are being employed on a  contract

for  service when actually they are employees.  The  Minister

has  mentioned that a survey was done among 2,000  employment

agencies.   I  would like to know what is the extent  of  the

problem  in the Ministry's assessment and whether he foresees

that this will be an increasing problem, bearing in mind that

there are now many more people employed as contract workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is: what measures are being taken to

educate people, both the employers as well as the workers  on

their rights and obligations under the law?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I mentioned, the

extent  of  the problem is not large from our  survey.   With

regard  to the question on what we intend to do in  terms  of

extending  the  protection  for those  who  are  employed  on

contract for service, when indeed they should be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



employed for contract on service, let me just state that  any

person who feels he is not given the benefits, regardless  of

the  terms  of  the contract, should approach  the  Ministry.

There  are clear guidelines where a worker would be  entitled

to  benefits, in the sense that he would be employed under  a

contract  of  service.  My Ministry has provided conciliation

services before, and this has been quite successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question of what the Ministry would do to

inform  both  employers and workers of their obligations  and

duties, we have done this together with the unions.  In terms

of  informing  workers  of their rights,  the  Ministry  will

continue  to  work with the unions to inform  them  of  their

rights under the Employment Act and the benefits due to them.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN WORKERS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mdm Halimah Yacob</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

what steps are being taken to ensure that foreign workers are

not  unfairly repatriated by employers before they  can  make

their claims for unpaid wages and other benefits.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen (for the Minister for Manpower):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  employers of foreign workers are  responsible

for  repatriating their employees when their Work Permits are

cancelled, terminated or not renewed.  The employers are also

required  to settle all outstanding wages due to the  foreign

workers.   The  employers must also pay for the  workers  air

ticket to return home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a foreign worker lodges an employment claim with

the  Ministry,  his employer would not be able to  repatriate

him until the claim has been settled.  The Ministry will take

firm  action against the employer by disqualifying  him  from

future application of work permit for foreign workers  if  he

deliberately  sends  back  the worker  to  prevent  him  from

pursuing his claims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, should a foreign worker be repatriated and he

has outstanding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>



salary  claims  against his employer, he may  still  lodge  a

written complaint with the Ministry.  The Ministry will  help

him  pursue  his  claims with his employer.  Wages  recovered

from  his employer will be remitted to the foreign worker  in

his home country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign workers should seek help from the Ministry if

their  employers have not been paying their salary  promptly.

By  alerting the Ministry early, the amount in salary arrears

would  be limited.  The chances of recovering the owed salary

would be better.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, the difficulty most of the

foreign  workers  face after they have  been  repatriated  in

making claims is that they are no longer in Singapore.  So  I

think  this  question of putting up evidence, filing  claims,

calling for witnesses will not be available to them.  Can the

Minister  give  a  little  bit more information  on  how  the

Ministry is helping the foreign workers to make their claims,

bearing in mind that these are difficulties that they face?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, foreign workers are

advised of their rights at the start of their employment.  To

the  extent that this has been successful, let me just  state

some figures.  Last year, we had about 7,000 complaints,  the

majority  of these cases from the construction industry.   My

Ministry  helped to settle 75% of these claims of about  $6.5

million involving 5,000 workers.  In other words, each worker

received  about  $1,300.   We will continue  to  do  more  by

advising  foreign workers, at the start of their  employment,

their rights and their avenues for redress.

<div align="center"><b>A BUDGET FOR A DIFFERENT WORLD</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><b>PART I  INTRODUCTION</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweeping changes of the last five years have

fundamentally  re-shaped  the  world.  In  1997,  the   Asian

Financial  Crisis  overwhelmed our  region,  abruptly  ending

three decades of peace, stability and economic development in

Southeast   Asia.  The  economic,  political   and   security

consequences  of the crisis have yet to work themselves  out.

In  2001,  economic  conditions  world-wide  grew  even  more

difficult as the world's three largest economies - the United

States (US), Japan and Germany - experienced sharp,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



synchronised  downturns. Singapore was  directly  exposed  to

these external shocks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the September 11 terrorist attacks on the US.

Fortunately, the initial fears of major economic  dislocation

and loss of confidence have not materialised. However, we  in

Singa-pore  have  learnt  how real  and  close  to  home  the

terrorist danger is, rooted in the region and threatening our

security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, our GDP shrank by 2%, the worst decline since

independence. Many Singaporeans lost their jobs. Fortunately,

our strong social cohesion helped us to weather the storm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are entering a very different world. Conditions are

uncertain  and  volatile, competition is intense,  change  is

faster  than  ever. Our ability to adapt nimbly  and  quickly

will  give us a valuable edge. In our personal lives too,  we

must  expect  change  and disruption. Lifetime  learning  and

training  will be the norm, while a life-long career  in  one

job will become less and less common.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot prevent the changes from happening. Instead,

we  must  act  decisively  to restructure  our  economy,  and

prepare for the challenges ahead. We have the resources to do

this,  but  we  must start early. This is our  best  hope  of

staying  ahead in the race, and creating jobs for our people.

This Budget is constructed with these objectives in mind.

<br><br><b>A Different World</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent performance of the global economy and our

economy  reflects increased uncertainty and  volatility.  The

business  cycle  has shortened and swings  have  become  more

extreme.  For example, global chip sales enjoyed a boom  year

with  37%  growth in 2000, but crashed in 2001, shrinking  by

32%.  Before 1997, Singapore enjoyed a decade-long boom  with

annual growth averaging 9.2%. Since then, our economic growth

has  averaged  a very respectable 4.7%, but  it  has  been  a

roller-coaster ride*.



<hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>

*Singapore's economic growth (1997-2001): 1997 (8.5%); 1998 (-0.1%); 1999 (6.9%); 2000 (10.3%); 2001 (-2.0%).

<hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recession last year, all the external engines of

our  economy sputtered. The fall-off in global demand quickly

filtered   through  to  all  sectors  of  our  economy.   The

electronics  industry  was  the  worst  hit.  Export-oriented

activities,  such  as  the entrepot trade  and  trade-related

services were also badly affected. As a result, nearly 26,000

workers  were  laid  off last year, and unemployment  reached

4.4%  by  the  end of 2001. 88,000 Singaporeans were  out  of

work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help our businesses and workers through the downturn,

the   Government  responded  promptly  with  two   off-budget

packages  last  July and October, that together  amounted  to

$13.5 billion. We brought forward infrastructure projects and

reduced  business costs. We distributed New Singapore Shares,

focusing   on  helping  lower-income  citizens.  We  expanded

programmes  to  retrain workers and get those  who  had  lost

their jobs back into the workforce. We drew on the savings we

had built up in good years to tackle the crisis in a way that

few other countries could.

<br><br><b>Uncertain Outlook</b>

<br><br><i>Global</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The external environment has picked up in the last few

months.  The  US economy grew by a robust 5.8% in  the  first

quarter  of this year after growing 1.7% in the last  quarter

of 2001. Business confidence seems to be improving in the US,

European   Union  (EU)  and  Japan.  The  global  electronics

industry is also bottoming out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's economy has improved in tandem with these

developments.  After  three  successive  negative   quarters,

quarter-on-quarter growth in the fourth quarter of  2001  was

plus  5.6%.  The  initial estimate of q-on-q growth  for  the

first  quarter  of  2002 was plus 3.5%.  This  has  now  been

substantially revised upwards to plus 7.7%. As a result,  MTI

is more optimistic that the economy will grow faster for 2002

as  a whole. The original projection for 2002 was between  1%

and  3%  growth. This has now been revised up, to  growth  of

between 2% and 4%.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we are not yet out of the woods. The strong growth

of  the  US  economy  in  the first quarter  masks  signs  of

weaknesses.  For example, US March orders for  durable  goods

fell  0.6%  after  3  months of growth, and  profit  warnings

caused US stocks to fall despite the strong growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the global economy is vulnerable to political

and  security  risks. Recovery does not just  depend  on  the

confidence  of US consumers, or how strongly the  US  economy

picks up. The whole world is anxiously watching the ferocious

war   of   terror  and  reprisal  between  Israel   and   the

Palestinians. If this escalates out of control into  a  wider

Middle East conflict, the consequences will be unpredictable.

So  too  if  the US moves against Iraq in its continuing  war

against global terrorism. The disruption of oil supplies  and

prices is only one of the possible side-effects. Already Iraq

has  stopped  its  oil production and called  on  other  Arab

producers to cut their oil production by half.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sharp rise in oil prices would adversely affect our

markets  in  the  developed economies, as well  as  Singapore

directly.  Even if oil prices do not spike, the  prospect  of

war   and  instability  will  put  off  investors  worldwide,

undermine confidence, and set our economy back again.

<br><br><i>Regional</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prospects for Southeast Asia are clouded. Economic

conditions  in  these countries are reasonably  stable,  with

some opportunities for profitable investments. But the region

has  yet  to  regain  the full confidence  and  attention  of

investors,  who  are concerned about political  and  security

risks.  Extremist and terrorist groups in the  region,  which

are  linked to global terrorist networks, seek to destabilise

regional  governments and attack Americans and  US  interests

everywhere.  This  will further erode confidence  and  hamper

recovery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These factors make Southeast Asia less attractive than

Northeast Asia. China is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>



the  biggest  and  most important new player  in  the  global

economy.  South  Korea  is  restructuring  its  economy,  and

recovering   faster  than  the  crisis-hit  Southeast   Asian

economies.   Singapore  is  still  attracting  good   quality

investments  and  business  activities,  but  companies   are

feeling  the pull of Northeast Asia, and some are  relocating

their  activities northwards, particularly to China and  Hong

Kong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This global and regional backdrop makes it more urgent

for  us to make strategic changes now. We face an uphill task

to  bring  to  Singapore the economic  activities  that  will

provide  Singaporeans  with jobs. We must  also  attract  top

talent with their business ideas and activities to Singapore.

In  a  world  where knowledge and skills are key  sources  of

wealth, this is just as important as bringing in high  value-added  investments. Our challenge is to make  Singapore  best

for business and talent.



<br><br><b>Economic Roles of Government</b>

<br><br><>Macroeconomic Policies</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Review Committee (ERC) is fundamentally

rethinking  our  economic policies,  and  exploring  ways  to

promote enterprise and growth. It is the private sector  that

creates  wealth.  Hence, our strategy must be  to  develop  a

vibrant  private  sector:  entrepreneurial,  regionally   and

globally competitive, and profitable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must attract more global talent, while upgrading our

tertiary  education  system  and  maximising  our  own  human

capital.  We  must  develop  new  areas  of  growth  in  both

manufacturing and services. Outstanding domestic  enterprises

should  be  nurtured into significant international  players.

Internationally   competitive   local   companies,   led   by

entrepreneurial and innovative Singaporeans, will  complement

the  multi-national corporations and make  our  economy  more

resilient and dynamic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's role is to create a pro-business,

stable environment in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>



which companies can operate efficiently. We must pursue sound

macroeconomic  policies,  including  fiscal  policy   -   the

government  budget; and monetary policy - the exchange  rate.

The  tax  burden must be kept as light as possible.  We  must

rely  less  on direct taxes and more on indirect taxes.  This

will encourage people to strive and create wealth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On CPF savings, we need to review the balance between

its different uses - healthcare, housing, and retirement.  We

also need to study the specific problems faced by older, less-educated  workers, who have difficulty finding  regular  jobs

that  pay CPF. These are complex and sensitive issues,  which

affect many Singa-poreans. We will study them in detail,  and

have  not yet reached any decisions. Any changes we make will

be  done very carefully, after full consultations and without

causing  disruptions either to CPF members  or  the  property

market.



<br><br><i>Government-Linked Companies</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The macroeconomic functions I have just described are

common  to  governments  in  all free  market  economies.  In

addition, however, the Government in Singapore for historical

reasons  also participates in business through its  interests

in the Government-Linked Companies (GLCs), many of which have

played critical roles in Singapore's economic development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GLCs attract considerable attention, as well as a

fair  share of controversy, including from MPs. One  possible

reason for this is that the raison d'etre of the GLCs has not

been  explicitly  spelt out and accepted. Minister  of  State

Raymond Lim's ERC Sub-Committee on Promoting Entrepreneurship

and  the  Growth  and Internationalisation of Singapore-based

Companies has been reviewing the role of the GLCs. They  have

given  the  Government their views and ideas, which  we  have

taken into consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our philosophy is to have the GLCs operate as commercial

entities. The Government does not interfere with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>



operations of the GLCs. The companies are supervised by their

respective boards of directors, who are accountable to  their

shareholders, including the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will not favour GLCs with special

privileges or hidden subsidies; nor will it burden them  with

uneconomic "national service" responsibilities. The GLCs  are

expected  to compete on a level playing field, and frequently

in a global environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As global competition heats up, the GLCs, like other

Singapore  companies, will have to continually enhance  their

core  competencies. Temasek Holdings is the  holding  company

that  owns  the  Government's shares  in  most  GLCs.  It  is

therefore Temasek's responsibility to help the GLCs under its

charge grow into internationally competitive businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One issue of public interest is the Government's policy

on divesting its shares in the GLCs. Where the activities are

strategic and crucial to Singapore, such as aviation and  the

electricity  grid,  the  Government  intends  to  retain  its

majority   or   significant  stakes.  For   those   strategic

activities that are still wholly-owned, the Government  hopes

to  list them in future, if it makes sense to do so in  order

to help them grow and increase shareholder value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For other major businesses with global or regional

potential, Temasek will grow them to the benefit of Singapore

over  the  long  term. If growing a GLC into a  major  player

requires the Government to dilute its stake through new share

issues,  mergers or acquisitions, the Government is  prepared

to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the GLCs that are no longer relevant to the

Government's  or  Temasek's objectives, the  Government  will

divest  or dilute its shareholdings in a controlled  way.  It

will  take  a pragmatic approach, and pay close attention  to

prevailing industry and market conditions. For example,  once

the  electricity market is operationally ready,  we  plan  to

divest our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>



power-generating  companies: Power Seraya, Power  Senoko  and

Tuas Power.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often suggested that if only the Government would

sell  off  all the GLCs to somebody else, preferably cheaply,

Cinderellas  would  magically  become  beautiful  princesses.

Alas,  this  only  happens  in  fairy  tales.  There  is   no

effortless shortcut to upgrading and developing the GLCs, and

the  Govern-ment  cannot abdicate its responsibilities  as  a

major shareholder.  Temasek Holdings is currently working out

a  charter  with  MOF that will spell out Temasek's  mission,

role  and  responsibilities. Temasek intends to publish  this

charter  soon  to make it clear how the Government  sees  the

role of the Temasek companies in the Singapore economy.



<br><br><b>Restructuring Taxes, Creating Jobs</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC Sub-Committee on Taxation, Wages, CPF and Land

("the  ERC  Sub-Committee"), chaired by  Senior  Minister  of

State  Tharman  Shanmugaratnam, published a  report  on  11th

April  on  "Restructuring the Tax System for Growth  and  Job

Creation".  It  recommended  that  the  Government   make   a

significant  immediate  reduction in corporate  and  personal

income tax rates, and that it lower both to 20% within  three

years. It also recommended that the Government raise the  GST

rate  from  3%  to  5%  in 2003, and in  parallel  provide  a

comprehensive  offset package to help cushion the  impact  of

the  GST  increase  on Singaporeans, especially  lower-income

households.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government accepts these key recommendations of the

ERC  Sub-Committee. Our highest priority is  to  create  good

jobs  for  Singaporeans.  To do this,  we  must  continue  to

attract companies and talent to locate in Singapore and  grow

our economy. But companies and talent are highly sensitive to

the  taxes they have to pay, especially direct taxes on their

income.  We  have  to bring down our corporate  and  personal

income tax rates to make ourselves more competitive. However,

this  will  cause  a  large shortfall in Government  revenue,

which has to be made up one way or other. The most



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



effective way to do so is by raising the GST rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will lower the corporate and top personal

income tax rates to 20% by the FY 2004 Budget, as recommended

by  the ERC Sub-Committee. This is barring a major change  in

the  economic  and  political  climate,  which  unfortunately

cannot  be completely ruled out given the uncertain  regional

and global environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC Sub-Committee also made many other

recommendations on tax. Several of these have  been  included

in  this  Budget. Others are still being studied by MOF.  All

those  found  to  be feasible will be included  in  the  next

Budget.



<br><br><i>Reducing Corporate Income Tax</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reducing the corporate income tax rate from 24.5% to 20%

is  fundamental  to  strengthening our  competitiveness.  The

corporate income tax directly reduces the income of a company

operating in Singa-pore. When companies compare the  relative

attractiveness  of  investing  in  different  countries,  the

corporate  income tax flows straight through  to  the  bottom

line. If we set our tax rate too high, we make it harder  for

companies to make money, expand and create more jobs here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 15 years, the worldwide trend has been

towards  lower  corporate  and  personal  income  taxes.   In

addition, countries often offer generous tax breaks, so  that

the effective tax rate that their companies pay is much lower

than  the  nominal  rate. For example,  Germany  reduced  its

corporate income tax rate last year from 40% to 25%;  a  huge

15  percentage point cut. In the US, the corporate income tax

rate  is  nominally 35%, but various provisions and loopholes

reportedly enable some corporations to reduce their effective

rate  to only 11%. Ireland, one of our competitors in Europe,

plans  to cut its already low rate to a mere 12.5% next year,

supposedly without any tax breaks. Hong Kong's rate  is  only

16%. These examples show just how fierce the competition  is.

Unless we keep pace with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>



our  competitors,  we  will inevitably lose  investments  and

business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, we enhanced our competitive position by

granting tax incentives that reduced or removed the corporate

income  tax  on  certain qualifying companies.  For  example,

Pioneer-status companies enjoy a tax holiday  for  up  to  10

years,  while  companies  granted investment  allowances  may

deduct  up  to  twice  their investment expenses  from  their

taxable income. But this strategy has its limitations:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Firstly, it is harder to pick winners in a fast-changing economic environment. We need to encourage

enterprise  across  the  board,  and  not  just  in   certain

companies or certain sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Secondly, some sectors of the economy have

benefited more than others from tax incentives. For  example,

our  small  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs),  most  of  them

Singaporean-owned, often find it hard to qualify for the  tax

incentives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Thirdly, our tax incentives are gradually

becoming less effective. Our tax treaty partners are  seeking

to remove tax-sparing provisions from the tax treaties. As  a

result,  the  benefits  that companies  enjoy  from  our  tax

incentives  are  taken away by the other  tax  jurisdictions,

defeating the purpose of the incentive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will be rationalising the current system

of  tax incentives over the next few months. Later on  in  my

speech, I will describe improvements to our tax incentives to

encourage the development of certain industries. But we  must

complement these specific incentives with an across-the-board

reduction in the corporate income tax rate, in order to  make

the tax burden on businesses in general as light as possible,

and  make it worthwhile for companies to grow and create jobs

here.



<br><br><i>Reducing Personal Income Tax</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is equally important for us to lower personal income

taxes. The purpose is to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



reward effort and achievement, promote entrepreneurship,  and

attract and retain talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower personal income taxes allow Singaporeans to keep

more   of  their  hard-earned  income,  and  strengthen   the

incentive  for  people to strive, create wealth  and  improve

their lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower personal income taxes also encourage

entrepreneurship.  If  people  are  to  risk  their  personal

savings  on some business venture, then they must be  allowed

to keep more of the rewards of success. In business, the risk

of  failure is always there. What drives entrepreneurs to run

the  risk  of  losing  their last  dollar  by  launching  new

ventures? The creative urge and the personal drive to achieve

something  are certainly important. Beyond that,  it  is  the

prospect of large personal rewards if a venture succeeds. One

important reason, though not the only reason, why the US  has

more  entrepreneurs  than Europe is that US  personal  income

taxes are much lower.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, reducing the personal income tax rate will help

Singapore  attract  and retain talent. In knowledge-intensive

industries,  such  as  financial services,  the  business  is

really  the people in it. Where a business is located depends

on  where its key people want to live and work. If the people

refuse  to  move to Singapore, then the company  cannot  come

here.  And  when  such people consider where  to  live,  they

calculate  and compare how much tax they personally  have  to

pay  in  each  place.  A  low personal  income  tax  rate  is

therefore crucial for us to stand a chance of attracting such

people and businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal income taxes affect our home-grown talent too.

In the globalised economy, talent is highly mobile, and doors

everywhere  are  open to talent. If Singaporeans  find  their

taxes  too onerous, some of them will move elsewhere. Without

talent, whether home-grown or imported, our economy will  not

hum, new businesses will not start, and the prospects for all

Singaporeans will be bleak.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Raising Goods and Services Tax</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lowering corporate and personal income taxes will cost

the  Government a large amount of revenue. If we  reduce  the

tax rates to 20%, in all, the Govern-ment will lose 9% of its

annual revenue, or nearly 1.7% of GDP. We cannot afford  this

loss;  we  have  to make up at least part of  it  from  other

sources. That is why we must increase the GST rate from 3% to

5%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Singaporeans have asked why we cannot simply accept

this  loss  of revenue, and leave the GST rate at  3%.  After

all,  we have been enjoying comfortable surpluses, and should

be  able  to  accept smaller, but still large,  surpluses  in

future.  The  problem is we do not expect large surpluses  in

future.  Growth will be slower and more volatile than before.

Revenues  will be less buoyant. But demands on the Government

to  do  more and spend more are increasing. Even without  any

tax  cuts, our surpluses are likely to shrink. With the large

tax  cuts, we face a real risk of ending up with a structural

deficit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A structural deficit means we will have a deficit in

most  years, whether the economy is booming or in  recession.

This will have serious consequences. One key reason the Singapore  dollar has been strong, and inflation has been low,  is

that  we  have  run a prudent fiscal policy. The  Government

lives  within  its  means, and spends no more  than  what  it

receives. If the Govern-ment starts spending beyond  what  it

gets,  and borrows or prints money to fund its spending,  the

Singapore dollar would go down. Inflation would go up.  Then,

Singaporeans'  hard-earned  savings  would  be  worth   less,

including their CPF savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some argue that it is all right for us to run deficits

regularly, because we can always draw on the reserves to make

up  the shortfall. But that is not what the reserves are for.

The  reserves are to see us through rainy days,  to  be  used

only  in extremis, because Singapore produces no oil,  timber

or gold that we can fall back on. Furthermore, we must not be

misled by the fact that all our previous recessions have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



been  short-lived.  We cannot discount the  possibility  that

future  recessions will be prolonged and  deep  in  this  new

environment. If we draw on our reserves routinely, they  will

soon  be  gone. In any case, using the reserves requires  the

consent of the President, who will very likely say "No",  and

with good justification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that we will never run deficits. In

difficult  years we will end up in deficit, as happened  last

year.  But  over  the whole business cycle, we  must  aim  to

maintain  a  modest  surplus. This is  only  possible  if  we

accumulate  surpluses in good years to cover the deficits  of

lean years. The Government therefore cannot operate on a tax-to-spend  basis.  Instead, we should build  in  a  margin  of

savings,  especially  given the more volatile  and  uncertain

environment in the years ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third argument against raising GST is that the Government should instead cut back on its expenditure. We will

certainly  do our best to be thrifty, especially  when  times

are hard. But our government expenditure is already very lean

at  18%  of  GDP.  In  contrast,  government  expenditure  in

developed countries is typically much higher - 30% to 40%  of

GDP,  double ours.  Moreover, hard times are also times  when

Singaporeans  want  the Government to respond  with  generous

helping measures. Nevertheless, we will maintain a tight rein

on  the  cost of Government to ensure it stays below  20%  of

GDP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we examine the Government budget more carefully, we

will   see  how  difficult  it  is  to  make  deep  cuts   in

expenditure. Education is a priority area. It takes up 4%  of

GDP.  If  we  reduce  this, we risk  under-investing  in  our

children.  Even  if we could economise on  frills,  we  would

still  want to spend more on education. Indeed, MOE has  many

more worthwhile projects that it is keen to implement, if the

money  can  be  found.  These include  upgrades  to  schools,

polytechnics, the Institutes of Technical Education  and  the

universities. Our health spending will rise as our population

ages, and as they demand higher standards of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>



health  care. MOT has multi-billion-dollar plans  to  upgrade

our  public  transport infrastructure,  especially  the  rail

network.  Public  housing is yet another  big  area  where  a

serious cut-back would adversely affect our quality of  life.

Finally,  defence spending must be maintained if  we  are  to

continue  to  enjoy peace and security. These  five  critical

areas  - education, health, transport, housing and defence  - together comprise two-thirds of the Government's expenditure.

It is therefore not realistic to cover the deficit by cutting

government spending without any negative impact on the  lives

of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the ERC Sub-Committee recommended, and the

Government has decided, to raise the GST to make up  for  the

cuts  in  direct taxes. Increasing the GST rate  to  5%  will

raise  0.8%  of GDP, and make up just half the  revenue  lost

from the corporate and personal income tax cuts. Overall, the

Government will still end up revenue negative by 0.9% of GDP,

or  $1.2  billion  per year. This is a not  an  insubstantial

loss,  but  it should still leave the Government with  modest

surpluses  over the medium term, provided we are careful  not

to increase expenditures recklessly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for timing, the ERC Sub-Committee has recommended

raising  the  GST  in 2003. By then the economy  should  have

recovered  further from last year's recession.  But  whatever

the  state  of the economy next year, the fact  that  we  are

coupling  a comprehensive offset package to the GST  increase

means   that  the  increase  should  not  burden  Singaporean

households,  choke  off  consumer  spending,  or  impact  the

economy. Our approach is to help Singaporeans adjust  to  the

new  realities, so that we can make essential changes to  our

tax  structure  without delay, and forge  ahead  to  build  a

stronger economy.



<br><br><i>Offsetting the GST Increase</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singaporeans who pay income tax, the reduction in

income tax will offset, fully or partially, their increase in

GST.  However many Singaporeans pay no income tax at all,  so

the higher GST will increase their tax burden unless we do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>



something. In the longer term, they too will benefit from the

tax  changes,  because  the  changes  will  promote  economic

growth, create more jobs, and raise incomes across the board.

If  we do not bring down income taxes and raise the GST,  our

economy  may stagnate, unemployment may rise, and the  lower-income groups will be the hardest hit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it will take time for the restructuring to create

growth  and  prosperity.   Meanwhile,  the  Government   will

implement  a  comprehensive offset package that  will  ensure

that  most households - of all income groups - are  no  worse

off  during  a 5-year transition period. In other words,  the

package  will  offset completely at least 5 years'  worth  of

additional tax payable by most households. Indeed, we will go

further  to  promise  that all lower-income  households  will

receive  at  least 5 years' worth of offsets. No lower-income

household will be left out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will announce the details of this year's corporate and

personal income tax cuts, next year's GST increase,  and  the

offset package later in Part IV of my speech, when I set  out

the Economic Restructuring Package.



<br><br><b>Embracing the Future</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To thrive in the different world we are in, we must

confront and accept the new realities. We must quickly  adapt

ourselves  to  the  changed environment,  and  to  many  more

changes  to  come. This Budget introduces changes  that  will

help  the  Singapore economy to sustain growth over the  long

haul.  The  Government  will do  what  it  can  to  ease  the

transition,  but  Singaporeans must be ready  to  accept  the

changes. We have no other choice. At the same time,  we  must

continue  to look out for one another, and to strengthen  our

bonds  as  one  people. In an uncertain and  volatile  world,

these qualities are the best guarantee of a bright future for

ourselves and our children.



<br><br><b>PART II  THE FY 2002 BUDGET</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now turn to the Budget for the

Fiscal Year 2002.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><b>FY 2001 Revised Budget Estimates</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me recap the FY 2001 Budget. I refer

honourable  Members  to  the  second  column  of  the  budget

statistics table in Handout 1 (below).



<pre>

 Budget statistics for FY 2001 and FY 2002 (figures in $ bn)

                     FY 2001       FY 2001      FY 2002

                     Budget        Revised       Budget

                                  Estimates

Taxes and Fees        33.4           28.8         26.8

NII Contribution       0.9           2.7          2.4

Operating Revenue     34.3           31.5         29.2

Total Expenditure     28.1           27.7         28.3

Special Transfers      1.9           5.3           0

Surplus/(Deficit)      4.4          (1.4)         0.9

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dr Richard Hu presented the budget last year,

operating  revenue was estimated at $34.3 billion  and  total

expenditure  at  $28.1  billion. With  a  provision  of  $1.9

billion  for special transfers, the forecasted budget surplus

was a comfortable $4.4 billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as Members can see from the third column of the

table, the sharp economic downturn reduced revenue from taxes

and fees sharply by $4.6 billion to $28.8 billion. To make up

for  this,  we  raised the contribution from  Net  Investment

Income (NII) from the budgeted amount of $0.9 billion to  the

constitutional limit of $2.7 billion. Despite this, operating

revenue  still  fell  by $2.8 billion to $31.5  billion.  The

revised  total expenditure also fell, but by a  smaller  $0.4

billion   to  $27.7  billion.  Special  transfers,   however,

increased to $5.3 billion, mostly as a result of the two off-budget packages. Special transfers included $2.45 billion for

the   New  Singapore  Shares,  $500  million  to  the  Skills

Development  Fund,  $500 million to the Eldercare  Fund,  and

$200  million  to the Community Assistance Fund.  Even  after

tapping  all revenue streams, we expect a budget  deficit  of

$1.4  billion  for  FY 2001. However, this deficit  will  not

cause a draw on past reserves,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>



because   it  can  be  funded  entirely  from  the  surpluses

accumulated over the term of the previous government.



<br><br><b>Projected FY 2002 Fiscal Position</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the FY 2002 Budget proper, which

is summarised in the last column of the table.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operating revenue for FY 2002 is estimated at $29.2

billion, including a $2.4 billion contribution from NII. This

is  $2.3  billion  less than the operating  revenue  for  the

previous year. We expect taxes and fees to be lower than last

year,  partly  because  they will be  based  on  last  year's

earnings,  which were affected by the recession,  and  partly

because  of  the  rebates  and  tax  reductions  which   were

announced in the off-budget packages, but take effect in this

financial year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, operating and development expenditures are

budgeted  at  $19.5  billion and $8.8 billion,  respectively.

Total expenditure in FY 2002 thus comes to $28.3 billion,  or

$0.6 billion more than last year. Leaving aside, for now, any

provision  for special transfers and the impact  of  the  tax

changes to be discussed later, we can expect a modest  budget

surplus of $0.9 billion as our economy recovers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is therefore not cutting back on

expenditure even though revenue has fallen. This is  to  fund

urgently needed projects and services, and not because a  new

Minister  for  Finance has loosened the purse strings.  As  a

result,  the  budget  is  very tight.  This  underscores  the

critical  importance  of  spending only  on  essentials,  and

eschewing frills and extra-vagance.  My ministry has reminded

all government departments of these constraints.  I also urge

honourable Members to bear them in mind when you request  the

Government  to  be  more  generous  towards  your   cherished

projects in the Committee of Supply.



<br><br><b>Expenditure Priorities</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to the Government's expenditure

priorities.  I  refer  members to  the  chart  in  Handout  1

(below).



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20020503/20020503-HA-0740686.gif">Sectoral Shares of FY 2002 Budget</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in previous years, the largest share of the

Government's  FY  2002  expenditure  budget  goes  to  Social

Development,  which  accounts for 45% of  total  expenditure.

Education,  Health and Community Development and Sports  will

get  substantial  increases in their budget  allocation.  The

increases  support  the Government's emphasis  on  human  and

social  capital.  These form the foundations  for  a  strong,

cohesive  and resilient society. MOE will spend $2.6  billion

in  operating  subsidies  to  educate  our  children  at  the

primary, secondary, pre-university and junior college levels.

Another  $1.7  billion  will  be  spent  on  university   and

polytechnic  education,  as well  as  on  the  Institutes  of

Technical  Education. MOH will spend $1 billion on subsidised

healthcare  services  at  the 17  polyclinics,  64  voluntary

welfare  organisations and 13 public hospitals and healthcare

institutions.  These  expenditures  will  be  targeted   more

precisely  at  lower-income households through means-testing.

Means-testing will also be applied to social assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next largest sector is Security and External

Relations. The September 11 attacks have reminded us that  we

cannot  take our security for granted. Despite the defeat  of

the Taleban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, global terrorism  is

still  an  active  force, with numerous  cells  and  networks

endemic  in  many  countries, including in  our  region.  Our

regional  situation is complex and unpredictable.  We  cannot

afford  to  let down our guard. To preserve and  enhance  our

capacity to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>



defend ourselves, the Government will devote 38% of the total

expenditure  budget  for  FY 2002 to  Security  and  External

Relations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic Development is the third largest sector, at 12%

of  the  total  expenditure budget. Our expenditure  in  this

sector will enable us to invest in world-class infrastructure

to   strengthen   Singapore's  competitive  position   as   a

compelling hub for global and regional businesses.  MOT  will

spend  $1  billion  this  year on  road  upgrading  and  rail

projects, including the MRT Circle Line and the Sengkang  and

Punggol LRT.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to deregulate sectors of

the  economy  which  have  not been  fully  liberalised,  for

example,  the  electricity industry. This  will  sharpen  the

innovative  capacity of Singa-pore companies, and  make  them

more  efficient and competitive. We will help Singapore-based

enterprises,  including SMEs, to upgrade  their  capabilities

and  venture  abroad. We will also continue to encourage  new

investments  and economic activities in order to develop  new

growth  engines, and add depth and resilience to our economy.

At  the same time, the Government will outsource services  to

the  private and people sectors wherever it is cost effective

to do so.  Government expenditure in the Economic Development

sector  will  continue  to  emphasise  worker  training   and

upgrading. We have implemented many such programmes over  the

years.  The  second  off-budget package  last  year  enhanced

employment assistance and training programmes, including  the

Skills  Development Fund and the People-for-Jobs  Traineeship

Programme.  Continuous skills upgrading is the best  form  of

job security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will not stint in its support for workers

to  upgrade themselves. In preparing this Budget, I  reviewed

the range of training and upgrading programmes to see whether

more needed to be done. MOM and the trade unions told me that

there  was no shortage of money or training places. In  fact,

many places on the various training



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



schemes  still  go unfilled. For FY 2002, there  are  100,000

training places under the Skills Redevelopment Programme. MOM

has  also recently launched new retraining schemes,  such  as

the  WorkSkills  Training Programme and  the  Self-Employment

Training  Programme. These should be sufficient. However,  if

existing programmes are filled, and the training places  need

to  be  expanded, MOF will be ready to fund them,  the  tight

budget notwithstanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government Administration remains the smallest sector,

comprising  5.6%  of the total expenditure  budget.  We  will

continue  to keep this the smallest sector in line  with  our

policy  to keep the central administration lean and trim,  so

that  the  operational ministries can have the  bulk  of  the

resources to deliver public services. We will improve service

delivery through the E-government initiative. By the  end  of

this  year,  all  government services that can  be  delivered

through the Internet will be available online.

<br><br><b>PART III  TAX AND FEE CHANGES</b>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I outline

the  economic restructuring package, let me now turn  to  the

proposals  for tax and fee changes. I will start  with  motor

vehicle taxes.



<br><br><b>Motor Vehicle Taxes</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiscal disincentives have been a very effective means of

controlling car ownership and usage. They have kept our roads

smooth-flowing  and  congestion free.  However,  our  current

vehicle taxes are excessively skewed towards ownership



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



costs  rather  than  usage charges. Moreover,  the  ownership

levies  are a complicated mix of taxes and fees that are  not

fully rationalised. With the Certificate of Entitlement (COE)

system  in  place, the Additional Registration Fee (ARF)  and

excise duty (ED) on cars are higher than they need to be. The

road  tax  is  also heavily biased against cars  with  large-capacity engines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government agrees with the ERC Sub-Committee that

high  ownership cost is a blunt tool for controlling  traffic

congestion.   Moreover,  it  creates   significant   economic

distortions. Car taxes are currently the heaviest taxes  paid

by  upper-middle income households, far heavier  than  income

tax.  High ownership costs have also distorted usage patterns

by  encouraging  car  owners to drive frequently,  since  the

expensive car has already been paid for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government aims to strike a better balance between

the  ownership  and usage costs of a car, and to  rationalise

the various fees and charges. This will be done in stages, so

as  not  to  destabilise the market. In  the  long  term,  we

envisage  that  the  ARF,  ED and  road  tax  will  still  be

progressive, but less so than now.



<br><br><i>Reducing ARF and ED for Cars</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has decided to reduce the ARF for cars

from  140% of the Open Market Value (OMV) to 130% of the OMV.

The  ED  on cars will be cut from 31% of the OMV to  20%.  We

think that 20% is the appropriate long-term rate for ED,  and

do  not  expect to lower it further. However, the ARF can  be

gradually  reduced  further  as the  market  adjusts  to  the

changes.



<br><br><i>Pegging PARF to ARF</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Preferential Additional Registration Fee (PARF)

rebate  is  currently pegged to a car's OMV, instead  of  its

ARF.  This  was fine so long as the ARF rate did not  change.

But as we have progressively lowered the ARF, the PARF rebate

has become too



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>



large relative to the ARF paid. We have therefore decided  to

peg  the  PARF rebate to the ARF actually paid on  each  car,

instead  of the OMV. This way, the PARF will be automatically

and proportionately reduced whenever the ARF is lowered.



<br><br><i>Rationalising Taxes on Cars and Taxis</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxis, being higher end public transport, are similar to

cars,  and should be treated like cars in terms of ARF,  PARF

and  ED.  The new ARF and PARF rates for cars will thus  also

apply  to taxis. However, the ED for taxis is currently lower

than  for cars. We will increase the ED for taxis from 7%  to

10% of OMV. Nevertheless, the combined effect is to lower the

ownership charges on taxis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our eventual aim is to raise the ED on taxis to 20%, so

as  to  equalise it with the ED on cars. However we  will  do

this  in  step  with future reductions in the ARF,  so  that,

overall, the ownership taxes on taxis should continue to come

down.



<br><br><i>Reducing Road Tax</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road tax is part of the cost of owning a car, since

it  is  payable regardless whether or not the car is actually

used.  The  road tax for cars will be lowered,  typically  by

20%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxis already enjoy a significant concession on road

tax,  since their road tax is equivalent to that for a  1,766

cc  private  car  under the new, reduced rates,  whereas  all

taxis have at least 1,900 cc engines. There will therefore be

no change to the road tax for taxis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tables at Annex 1 (Cols. 727-728) shows these tax

changes for taxis and cars.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20020503/20020503-HA-0740727.htm">Annex 1 - Changes to ARF, ED and PARF for Cars and Taxis (Cols. 727-728)</a><br>



<br><br><i>Issuing More Certificates of Entitlement</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes to motor vehicle taxes will reduce the

cost of owning a car. However, unless we issue more COEs, the

savings  will feed through into higher demand for  cars,  and

higher  COE  prices, thereby negating the fall  in  ownership

cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government announced in 1997 that 15,000 to 20,000

additional COEs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>



could be released if the Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system

proved  effective in managing congestion. We have decided  to

release another 5,000 COEs in Quota Year 2002/2003 from  this

reserve.  5,500  COEs  from this reserve  have  already  been

released previously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes in ARF and PARF will apply to COEs obtained

from  the May 2002 bidding exercise onwards. The new ED rates

will  be effective tomorrow. The reduced road tax rates  will

take  effect from Sep 2002. The Land Transport Authority will

announce the details regarding the motor vehicle tax  changes

and the extra 5,000 COEs for QY 2002/2003.

<br><br><i>Revising Car Park Charges</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the cost of owning and using a car is the cost

of  providing a place to park it. At present, car park  space

in  land-scarce Singapore is not properly costed. Our parking

charges within the city are much lower than cities elsewhere.

Where  HDB  residential  parking is concerned,  the  existing

charges  do  not  cover the cost of building the  car  parks,

leaving HDB with a large deficit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not logical to levy charges on other aspects of

owning  and driving a car, while effectively subsidising  car

parking costs for motorists. We therefore need to rationalise

car parking charges progressively.  I do not have the details

today.  The HDB and the URA will announce the details later.



<br><br><i>Expanding Electronic Road Pricing</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As more Singaporeans own cars, the cost of using a car

will  have  to  go up, where required, to prevent  congestion

from  worsening  unacceptably. The ERP system  will  also  be

expanded  to  keep  our  roads  free  flowing.  Nevertheless,

because  the  ERP is an efficient and precise  instrument  in

controlling  congestion, if we rely more on ERP and  less  on

ownership  levies,  overall the  total  cost  of  owning  and

operating a car should come down.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Singaporeans must bear in mind that the number

of  additional cars that can eventually be put on  our  roads

will  be  primarily constrained by our lack of space.  Unlike

cities such as New York or London, Singapore does not have  a

large  hinterland  where city dwellers  can  use  their  cars

outside the city. We will reduce ownership charges and enable

more Singa-poreans to afford cars. But cars in Singapore  can

never  be  as  cheap, and ownership of cars can never  be  as

widespread, as in these other cities.



<br><br><b>Foreign Worker Levy</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Foreign Worker Levy was reduced in 1999 to help tide

companies over the 1998 economic downturn sparked off by  the

Asian Financial Crisis. This concession was extended in  2001

to  July this year because of the current economic recession.

Given  the uncertainty over economic recovery, the Government

has decided to extend the concession for a further six months

until  December 2002. We will review the matter again towards

the end of the year.



<br><br><b>Liquor and Tobacco Taxes</b>

<br><br><i>Raising Liquor Tax</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excise duty rates of certain liquors will be raised

with  effect  from today. This increase will help  discourage

excessive consumption of alcohol, and iron out some anomalies

in our liquor taxes. The new rates are at Annex 2 (Cols. 729-730).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in excise duty rates will yield $18 million

annually.



<br><br><i>Raising Tobacco Tax</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To discourage smoking, especially by our youth, I have

decided  to  raise the excise duty on tobacco  products  with

effect from today. Excise duty on cigarettes will go up  from

$180 per kilogram to $210 per kilogram. The excise duties  of

other  tobacco products at Annex 3 (Cols. 731-732) will  also

go  up.  The  estimated annual revenue  gain  is  about  $100

million.

<br><br><b>Promoting Philanthropy</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic restructuring will force us to make tough

pragmatic choices. But as we focus on upgrading ourselves  to

become   a   more   competitive  economy,   we   should   not

inadvertently  become  less public-spirited  and  more  self-absorbed  individuals. We must continue to show our care  and

concern for fellow Singaporeans, and to contribute as members

of  our  society to worthy community projects  and  services.

These  softer  aspects of life help to replenish Singa-pore's

social capital, and keep our society strong and cohesive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans who do well have a responsibility to help

fellow  citizens  who  are not as well off.  As  the  rewards

increase  for  the  most  successful Singa-poreans,  and  our

income  distribution stretches out, it becomes more important

that  those who do well contribute back to society. They need

to  show  they  care for, and are grateful to, the  community

which  nurtured  them, gave them opportunities,  and  enabled

them to succeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax measures are one way by which the Government

encourages  charitable acts by Singaporeans. In  the  current

uncertain economic environment, voluntary organisations  face

some  difficulties in raising funds. I have therefore decided

to  introduce the following measures to promote the spirit of

philanthropy in individuals and corporations:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) I will allow double tax deduction for donations to

Institutions of a Public Character (IPC).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Tax deductions for donations to IPCs can now be

carried forward for 5 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Some IPCs name their buildings or scholarships

after  their  donors. These and other donations with  similar

naming opportunities will now enjoy tax deduction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) To encourage the administrators of estates to

donate  a  part  of  the estate to IPCs, I will  exempt  such

donations from estate duty.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Qualifying charitable private foundations will

receive IPC status.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details of these measures are at Annex 4 (Cols. 733-734).

<br><br><b>Tax  Incentives  for  the  Financial  Sector  and  Enterprise Development</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen our financial sector and promote

enterprise  development,  I have  decided  to  introduce  the

following tax incentives.



<br><br><i>Strengthening the Financial Sector</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial industry is a key sector of our economy,

and  a  major basis for Singapore to be a business  hub.  The

current  range of financial sector incentives is sufficiently

broad to promote high value-added activities. We have already

made   good  progress  in  attracting  global  and   regional

financial activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, financial sector activities are highly mobile.

As  global  tax competition intensifies and drives tax  rates

down,  we  need  to provide more incentives  to  attract  and

anchor   cutting-edge  activities  to  Singapore.  We  should

therefore  streamline and update our existing  incentives  to

keep them relevant and effective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will therefore enhance the tax incentives for the

wealth-  and  asset-management industries to  encourage  more

funds  to be managed out of Singapore. There will be enhanced

incentives  to  promote the growth of the derivatives  market

and  bolster  Singapore's position  as  Asia's  treasury  hub

outside Japan. Changes will be made to broaden and deepen our

equity  capital  market.  I have also  decided  to  introduce

concessionary tax treatment for special reserves  set  up  by

general insurance companies for underwriting certain offshore

risks.  This will enhance Singapore's competitiveness  as  an

insurance centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the existing financial sector incentives will be

merged  into  an umbrella Financial Sector Incentive  scheme.

This will simplify the tax system and enable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>



high-growth  and  high  value-added financial  activities  to

enjoy concessionary tax rates.



<br><br><i>Promoting Enterprise Development</i>

<br><br><i>Improved Development and Expansion Incentive</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax incentives have long been an important instrument

for Singapore's economic development strategy. In particular,

the  Pioneer  Incentive,  which rewards  companies  with  tax

exemption  on all qualifying income, has become a brand  name

in  its  own  right.  Later, we introduced  the  Post-Pioneer

Incentive to further anchor these companies to Singapore.  In

1996,  this  was  replaced by the Development  and  Expansion

Incentive (DEI).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have decided to reduce the minimum tax rate under the

DEI from 10% to 5% with effect from today. This will give our

economic  agencies  greater flexibility in administering  the

DEI,  make it easier for companies to comply with the scheme,

and  provide greater certainty for companies when they invest

in Singapore.



<br><br><i>Enhanced Deduction for Research and Development Expenses</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, we grant tax deductions for R&D expenses only

for  R&D  that  is conducted in-house, or else outsourced  to

approved  R&D  organisations that conduct their  research  in

Singapore.  This  is  to  build up R&D capabilities  locally.

However,  companies in today's networked world harness  ideas

and  talent from all over the world. Furthermore, as the  ERC

Sub-Committee   noted,  companies  carrying   out   R&D   are

increasingly  collaborating with offshore affiliates  or  the

R&D outfits of other companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have therefore decided to liberalise the tax

deductions  for expenses incurred for R&D that leads  to  the

ownership of intellectual property in Singapore. With  effect

from  YA  2003,  single tax deduction  will  be  granted  for

expenses  incurred on R&D outsourced to any R&D organisation,

whether local or overseas. The scope of further tax deduction

for R&D expenses



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>



will also be extended to all services companies.



<br><br><i>Approved International Shipping Enterprise Scheme</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transport and logistics industry is an important

sector  in  our economy, accounting for about 8% of  GDP.  It

anchors  Singapore as a leading physical hub port for  global

trade.  This  is  due to a combination of factors:  extensive

connectivity, effective use of information-technology  and  a

pro-business   environment.  Nevertheless,   competition   is

intensifying, not only from the leading maritime  centres  of

the world, but also from lower-cost newcomers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of an integrated approach to sustain Singapore

as   a  competitive,  efficient  and  value-adding  logistics

centre,  we  will transform ourselves into a leading  supply-chain  management hub. We will go beyond providing  excellent

physical  port  infrastructure, such as  cargo  handling  and

terminal  services, to become the nerve centre for the  "mind

and   management"  driving  global  transport  and  logistics

activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To attract these shipping leaders, I have decided to

extend  the Approved International Shipping Enterprise Scheme

and  enhance  its  attractiveness for international  shipping

companies. The scope of the scheme will be expanded  and  its

eligibility criteria streamlined with effect from YA 2003.



<br><br><i>Other Incentives</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the above measures, I will also introduce the

following tax incentives:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) With effect from YA 2003, the Unilateral Tax Credit

Scheme  for  services income will cover all  services  income

remitted from all non-treaty countries;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Payments to international arbitrators will be

exempt from withholding tax with immediate effect;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) With effect from 1st January 2003, dividends

issued  by  companies with exempt income or income  taxed  at

concessionary  rates  will be tax-exempt  for  all  tiers  of

shareholders, regardless of shareholding level;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The gross income of non-resident professionals

will  be  subject to a final income tax of 15% with immediate

effect; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) The movable assets of non-domiciles will be exempt

from estate duty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details of these tax incentives are at Annex 5

(Cols. 735-742).



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20020503/20020503-HA-0740735.htm">Annex 5 - Tax Incentives for the Financial Sector and Enterprise Development (Cols.  735-742)</a><br>



<br><br><b>PART IV  THE ECONOMIC RESTRUCTURING PACKAGE</b>

<br><br><b>A Package for a Different World</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key changes in this budget are the corporate and

personal  income tax cuts, the increase in GST, and  the  GST

offset  package. These tax changes, together with the  offset

measures, form a single economic restructuring package.  This

package is a critical element of our strategy to make  Singapore more competitive, and to create more jobs and prosperity

for Singa-poreans.

<br><br><b>Corporate and Personal Income Tax Cuts and GST Increase</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC Sub-Committee recommended that the Government

cut  corporate  and personal income tax rates  to  20%  in  3

years.  For  this  year, it recommended that the  Govern-ment

make "significant immediate reductions" in both corporate and

personal  income tax rates. We have considered carefully  the

appropriate size of the immediate cuts, and the exact  timing

of  the  GST  increase. We had to strike  a  careful  balance

between  the need to make a bold move now, and the  need  for

fiscal  prudence in view of the uncertainties in the external

environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From YA 2003, I have decided to cut the corporate income

tax rate from 24.5%



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



to  22%. This 10% reduction will save businesses $700 million

a year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also with effect from YA 2003, the top marginal personal

income   tax  rate  will  be  cut  from  26%  to  22%,   with

corresponding cuts in all income bands. This will reduce  the

tax payable by most taxpayers by 13% to 16%, saving them $620

million every year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have decided to raise the GST rate from 3% to 5% from

1st January 2003. The increase in GST is expected to raise an

additional $1.3 billion of tax revenue per year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an annual basis, the combined revenue loss from

cutting  the corporate and personal income taxes to 22%  this

year  is  $1.32  billion, slightly more than  the  additional

revenue  of  $1.3  billion from raising  GST  to  5%.  In  my

judgement,  this  strikes the right balance between  boldness

and  prudence, and sets us on track to reduce both  corporate

and personal income tax rates to 20% by the FY 2004 Budget.



<br><br><b>Restructuring Corporate Income Tax</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction in corporate income tax will benefit all

companies.   With   the  partial  exemption   of   companies'

chargeable income since YA 2002, many SMEs already  pay  less

than  half  the  corporate income tax rate.  This  additional

reduction will result in the SMEs paying effective tax  rates

of  between 5.5% and 10%. Besides reducing the rate, we  will

also  restructure the corporate taxation system to  introduce

two  features  recommended  by the ERC  Sub-Committee:  group

relief and a one-tier tax system.



<br><br><i>Group Relief</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporations often organise themselves into multiple

holding companies, subsidiaries and associates to reflect the

structure   of  their  business  and  to  limit  liabilities.

Sometimes corporations are required by law to set up separate

companies  for  specific purposes. For  example,  to  protect

buyers, property developers are required to set up a separate

company for each residential development project that they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



undertake.  However, corporations are not allowed  to  offset

the  losses  of  one company against the taxable  profits  of

another  within the same group. Each company in a group  pays

tax  as  a separate, stand-alone entity. As a result, setting

up separate companies effectively raises the tax rate for the

whole group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC Sub-Committee has recommended allowing group

relief  to  help  reduce  the  cost  of  doing  business   in

Singapore.  Group  relief recognises  group  companies  as  a

single economic entity by allowing the unutilised losses  and

capital allowances from one company to offset the profits  of

a related company in the same group. This is already the case

in  most developed countries, including the US and the United

Kingdom (UK).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will accept the ERC Sub-Committee's

recommen-dation,  and  introduce a  loss-transfer  system  of

group relief with effect from YA 2003. A group consists of  a

Singapore  incorporated parent company and all its  Singapore

incorporated   subsidiaries.   Two   Singapore   incorporated

companies could also be members of the same group if  one  is

75%  owned  by  the  other or both are 75% owned  by  another

Singapore  incorporated  company.  Group  companies  will  be

allowed  to  transfer their current year  unutilised  capital

allowances  and  losses. However, investment  allowances  and

foreign losses may not be transferred.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of group relief will lower the tax

burden  on  companies,  and encourage  more  risk-taking  and

enterprise. It will also help companies during recessions  or

the early years of new ventures, when they are likely to make

losses.  Companies  which  set  up  subsidiaries  for   risky

ventures will be able to enjoy the limited liability  benefit

of    separate   subsidiaries,   and   still   offset   these

subsidiaries' losses against their own profits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change will cost the Government $170 million per

year.  As  for  the  ERC  Sub-Committee's  recommendation  to

introduce  consortium  relief and more complex  group  relief

measures, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



Government will study these more carefully before making  its

decision.



<br><br><i>One-tier Corporate Taxation System</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC Sub-Committee recommended replacing the current

full  imputation  corporate taxation system with  a  one-tier

corporate taxation system. It argued that the current  system

discourages  companies  with insufficient  dividend  franking

credits  from distributing dividends. Furthermore,  the  full

imputation  system  is  not  well  adapted  to  sophisticated

business  transactions,  such as share  buy-backs  and  share

borrowing and lending. MOF had to craft complicated tax rules

for  these transactions to meet concerns about tax avoidance.

This increased compliance costs for companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has accepted the Sub-Committee's

recommendation.  We  will introduce  the  one-tier  corporate

taxation system with effect from 1st January 2003. Under this

system,  the tax collected from corporate profits  is  final.

Singapore  dividends are exempt. This will  greatly  simplify

our   tax  code  and  reduce  the  cost  of  compliance   and

administration for companies. The one-tier system  will  work

in  tandem  with group relief and the lower corporate  income

tax  rate to make more profits available for distribution  as

dividends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many companies will not be able to make full use of the

dividend franking credits that they have accumulated  by  1st

January  2003.  I  will therefore allow a  5-year  transition

period  from  1st  January 2003 to  31st  December  2007  for

companies  to  pay  franked dividends out of  any  unutilised

dividend  franking  credits as of 31 Dec  2002.  During  this

period,  shareholders will still be able to receive dividends

with credits attached.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-tier system will have the desirable consequence

of allowing the unlimited flow-through of exempt dividends to

all  tiers of shareholders, regardless of shareholding level.

However,  companies that are still on the  imputation  system

during  the 5-year transition period will not be able  to  do

so.  I  will  therefore allow these companies to flow  exempt

dividends paid out of concessionary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>



income  to  all tiers of shareholders without restriction  on

shareholding level.



<br><br><b>Restructuring Personal Income Tax</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction in personal income tax rates will benefit

all  taxpayers. It will also help attract and retain  talent.

The  Government  has  also accepted the  ERC  Sub-Committee's

proposals to introduce a new category of taxpayer called  Not

Ordinarily  Resident  Taxpayer and  refine  our  current  tax

treatment of stock options. I have also taken the opportunity

to  streamline,  and in some cases increase, personal  income

tax  reliefs, and to simplify the tax structure  by  reducing

the  number of income bands. Let me deal first with  the  new

tax structure.



<br><br><i>Personal Income Tax Structure</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the significant reduction in the top personal

income  tax  rate,  we no longer need as many  tax  bands  as

before. I have therefore decided to simplify the structure by

consolidating the existing 10 bands to 7.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, $250 of the $500 GST-related income tax

rebate was incorporated into the individual tax structure  by

exempting  the  first  $7,500 of an  individual's  chargeable

income  from tax. This year we will incorporate the remaining

$250  GST-related income tax rebate, as well  as  the  $3,000

personal relief, which is enjoyed by all taxpayers, into  the

personal income tax structure. With these changes, the  first

$20,000  of  an individual's chargeable income  will  not  be

taxed. The new bands and rates are attached at Annex 6 (Cols.

743-744).



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20020503/20020503-HA-0740743.htm">Annex 6 - New Personal Income Tax Structure and Rates (Cols. 743-744)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These income tax changes will not affect the rebates

that  were  given  out  as  part of  last  year's  off-Budget

measures.



<br><br><i>Not Ordinarily Resident Taxpayer Scheme</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC Sub-Committee has recommended favourable tax

treatment for persons who have not lived in Singapore for the

preceding 3 years, but are currently based in Singapore. This

is to attract



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



talent  to relocate to Singapore. The UK and Ireland  already

have such schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has accepted the ERC's recommendation. We

will  create a new class of taxpayers called "Not  Ordinarily

Resident"  (NOR) taxpayers.  An NOR taxpayer will  be  exempt

from  tax on income earned before he came here. A non-citizen

NOR  taxpayer will also be exempt from tax on his  employer's

contribution to his overseas pension fund, to compensate  for

the  fact that non-citizens do not enjoy CPF tax relief.   In

addition, an NOR taxpayer who spends at least 90 days a  year

outside Singapore on business will pay tax only on his  total

Singa-pore  employment income based on  his  number  of  days

here. This is subject to a floor tax rate of 10% on his total

employment  income.  It will help us to  attract  the  senior

management  of companies to use Singapore as their  base  for

regional activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NOR scheme will take effect from YA 2003. The

details of the scheme are at Annex 7 (Cols. 745-746).



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20020503/20020503-HA-0740745.htm">Annex 7 - Not Ordinarily Resident Taxpayer Scheme (Cols. 745 - 746)</a><br>



<br><br><i>Stock Option Schemes</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock options are effective in encouraging

entrepreneurship. This is why more companies are using  stock

options  to recruit, motivate and retain talent. Although  we

already  grant  favourable tax treatment for  some  types  of

stock  options,  the  ERC  Sub-Committee  has  proposed  some

improvements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have studied the proposals, and decided to make the

following changes:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) To exempt from tax stock options granted for non-Singapore employment even if they are exercised in Singapore.

To  be  consistent,  gains  from stock  options  granted  for

Singapore employment will be taxed no matter where  they  are

exercised;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) To tax stock options and restricted share awards

at the end of their moratoriums;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) To extend the scope of existing stock option

incentive  schemes, such as Company Stock Option  Scheme,  to

include other forms of employee share ownership plans; and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) To require Singapore companies to collect the

taxes  on  gains  from  employees who  exercise  their  stock

options after leaving Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details are at Annex 8 (Cols. 747-748).

<br><br><b>Other Changes to the Personal Income Tax</b>



<br><br><i>National Service Reliefs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year marks the 35th year of National Service. Our

NSmen  spend precious time away from their work and  families

each  year to build up their operational readiness, and  keep

Singapore  safe  and  secure.  This  is  a  heavy  commitment

especially during an economic downturn. To further  recognise

the  contributions of NSmen, I have decided to  increase  the

current  NS  reliefs by 50%. The amounts will  increase  from

$2,000 to $3,000 for Active NSmen, from $1,000 to $1,500  for

Inactive  NSmen,  and from $500 to $750  for  the  wives  and

parents of NSmen. This will take effect from YA 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will cost the Government $17 million per year.



<br><br><i>Procreation Tax Rebate</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procreation tax rebate was granted to encourage

parents  to  bring up their children in an intact family.  We

therefore set the rules to disallow parents who divorce  from

continuing  to  claim the rebates. However, we have  received

appeals  from  divorcees with children,  whose  rebates  were

discontinued after they divorced. They pointed out that  they

too needed support, perhaps more so than other parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government continues to uphold the value of

maintaining strong families. However, we also recognise  that

withdrawing  the  rebate  from divorcees  can  add  to  their

already  difficult burden. I have decided to allow  divorcees

to  continue  to  claim their procreation  tax  rebates  with

effect  from YA 2003. Divorcees whose procreation tax rebates

have   already  been  terminated  may  apply  to   IRAS   for

reinstatement  of their rebates if their claim  periods  have

not expired.  It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>



not a lot of money but it is a matter of fairness.

<br><br><i>Handicapped Parent Relief</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our life expectancy lengthens, more and more Singaporeans will find themselves looking after aged and

handicapped  parents.  The  Government  strongly   encourages

families  to look after aged parents in their own homes,  and

only  use old-age homes as a last resort. But this can  be  a

considerable  financial burden on the family, especially  for

families with few children to share the burden.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore introducing a handicapped parent relief

of $3,000 on top of the normal parent relief with effect from

YA 2003. Including the normal parent relief, the total amount

of  relief granted to taxpayers taking care of their  parents

will  be:  $8,000 if the taxpayer is living with the  parent;

and $6,500 if the taxpayer is not living with the parent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will cost the Government $2 million per year.



<br><br><i>Double Child Relief for Children Studying Overseas</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents may currently claim double child relief ($4,000)

in  respect  of  a child who studies overseas.  The  original

purpose   was   to  subsidise  the  overseas   education   of

expatriates' children. It was later retained because  of  the

limited   opportunities  to  pursue  tertiary  education   in

Singapore.  However, the number of places in  local  tertiary

institutions  has  grown greatly over the  years.  It  is  no

longer  necessary or justified to subsidise overseas tertiary

education.  I have therefore decided to withdraw  the  double

child relief with effect from YA 2003.

<br><br><i>Allowance for Members of Parliament</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of Parliament (MPs) currently enjoy a tax

remission on the MP allowance. Now that the MP's allowance is

regularly  revised  in  step with  a  private  sector  salary

benchmark, this remission is no longer relevant. Instead, the

MP  allowance should be regarded as taxable income, just like

other employment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



income.  I  have  therefore  decided  to  withdraw  the   tax

remission for the MP allowance with effect from YA 2003.

<br><br><b>Offsetting the GST Increase</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the ERC Sub-Committee recommended the GST increase

some  three weeks ago, the public has been reassured  by  the

Government's promise that, if we raised GST rate, there would

be  offsetting  measures.  The Government  will  introduce  a

comprehensive package of measures to offset the  increase  in

the  GST.  These offsets will be enough to cover the increase

in  tax  for  most households, and certainly for  all  lower-income households, for at least 5 years.

<br><br><i>Offsets  for  Healthcare, Education and Service & Conservancy Charges</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans worry that a higher GST will increase

their  medical bills, because hospital bills are  subject  to

GST.  In  fact,  they  do  not  need  to  worry  because  the

Government  provides  the hospitals  and  polyclinics  direct

grants  to offset completely the GST they have to pay on  all

subsidised healthcare services. With the increase in GST, the

Government   will  increase  these  grants  to   restructured

hospitals  and  polyclinics. Charges for  subsidised  medical

care will therefore not be affected at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will similarly absorb the GST payable on

education,  by increasing its subsidy to the state  education

system.  And  it  will increase the subvention  to  the  Town

Councils  to  offset the GST payable on Service & Conservancy

Charges (S&CC).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total annual cost of the increased subsidies is

estimated at $29 million.

<br><br><i>Public Transport Fares</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Transport Council (PTC) is currently

evaluating proposals from the transport operators  to  revise

fares.  PTC  is only considering revisions to catch  up  with

operating and maintenance cost increases over the past year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public transport operators have raised with the PTC

the  issue  of the GST increase next year. After  considering

their  views,  the  likely increase in GST  to  5%,  and  the

proposed cut in the corporate income tax, the PTC has decided

that there is no need to raise fares next year as a result of

the  GST increase. The transport operators have accepted this

decision.



<br><br><i>Public Assistance and Singapore Allowance</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the offset measures, very low-income

Singaporeans  may  need  more  help  to  cope  with  the  GST

increase.  The  Government will help  these  Singaporeans  by

increasing  the  Public Assistance rates, and  the  Singapore

Allowance paid to Government pensioners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCDS and PSD are currently working out the proposals,

and will implement the revisions in time for the increase  of

the GST rate next year.

<br><br><i>Committee to Combat Profiteering</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the GST was introduced at 3% in 1994, it had

minimal  impact on prices. The inflation rate rose marginally

from  2%  to 3%, but it fell below 2% after 1994, and  stayed

there.  This year, inflation is projected to be zero or  even

negative.  In  this benign price environment, I am  confident

that  the  2  percentage  point  increase  in  GST  will  not

significantly raise prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, I appreciate the public concern over the

possibility  of  undue  price  increases.  To  address   this

concern,  the  Government will set up a Committee  to  Combat

Profiteering. The Committee will be chaired by  Mr  Chan  Soo

Sen,  Minister  of State in the Prime Minister's  Office.  It

will  deal with any complaints of profiteering or unjustified

price   increases.   It   will  work  with   the   grassroots

organisations  and their advisors in all the  constituencies,

and  especially  with the market committees and  shopkeepers'

associations,  to monitor the situation on  the  ground,  and

encourage hawkers and shopkeepers to act responsibly.

<br><br><i>Rebates for Service & Conservancy Charges and Rent</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current package of S&CC and rental rebates for HDB

households was implemented last November to help lower-income

Singaporeans  cope  with the recession.   This  package  will

expire  in  March 2003. As part of the GST offsets,  we  will

grant  S&CC  and  rental rebates for 5 more years,  from  1st

April 2003 to 31st March 2008. The rebates will be maintained

at   their  current  levels  in  the  first  year,  and  will

thereafter  taper off gradually.  The Government  will  spend

$340  million on this 5-year package. Further details of  the

package are at Annex 9 (Cols. 749-750).



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20020503/20020503-HA-0740749.htm">Annex 9 - Rebates for Service & Conservancy Charges and Rent (Cols. 749 - 750)</a><br>



<br><br><i>Economic Restructuring Shares</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When GST was introduced, the Government introduced tax

cuts and a range of rebates, including income tax rebates, to

offset its impact. However, the tax cuts over the last decade

have  resulted  in  the  majority of Singaporeans  paying  no

income  tax at all. Therefore, the Government has decided  to

give   out  Economic  Restructuring  Shares  (ERS)   to   all

Singaporeans as the major part of the GST offset package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERS are meant to help Singaporeans adapt to the

structural changes in the economy, especially the increase in

the  GST  rate.  They will be similar to  the  New  Singapore

Shares (NSS) distributed last November. The shares are  worth

$1  each. They will earn annual dividends over 5 years,  from

2004  to  2008. The dividends will be paid each year  on  1st

March. The dividend rate will be a guaranteed minimum  of  3%

per annum. In addition, bonus dividends equal to the real GDP

growth rate of the preceding year, provided it is above zero,

will  be declared annually. The dividends will be in the form

of bonus shares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, unlike the NSS, the ERS will be more evenly

distributed   among   all   Singaporeans,   since    economic

restructuring affects everyone. Those who live in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



properties with Annual Values (AV) not exceeding $10,000 will

get a basic allocation of 1,200 shares. This includes 90%  of

households.  It covers all HDB flats except for a  few  units

which  are  exceptionally large, as well as  smaller  private

homes  such  as  walk-up flats and flats in shop-houses.  The

remaining  10%  of  Singaporeans staying  in  larger  private

properties,  with AVs above $10,000, will receive  a  smaller

basic allocation of 600 shares. They are likely to be earning

higher incomes, paying higher personal income tax rates,  and

enjoying  significant savings from the  personal  income  tax

cuts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERS are meant to tide Singaporeans over the next 5

years.  But  the Government will be giving ERS out  in  three

annual allocations starting from 1st January 2003.  In  other

words, the distribution is front-loaded.  We are getting them

early.  Adult Singaporeans who have contributed at least  $50

to  their  own  CPF  accounts between 1st  January  and  30th

November this year will get their first allocation of  shares

on 1st January 2003. Those who do so in December will receive

their shares on 1st February 2003. This is similar to the NSS

arrangement last year.  For each subsequent share allocation,

Singaporeans  will similarly have to make a $50 contribution.

This  is not a co-payment for the shares, but a way to ensure

that the shares are not given to inactive accounts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NSmen will receive bonus shares for their contribution

to the security of Singapore. Active NSmen will get 200 bonus

shares, while Inactive NSmen will get 100. NSmen will receive

all  their bonus shares in the year they qualify.   In  other

words, if you qualify in the second year, or the third  year,

as  an  Active NSman, at that point, you will still get bonus

shares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizens can cash in the shares with the Government for

$1  per  share. They may cash in all the shares at any  time,

even as soon as they are issued. There will be no requirement

to hold part of the shares for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>



a  minimum  period, unlike the New Singapore  Shares.  But  I

encourage  Singaporeans to keep their ERS until maturity,  in

order to earn the maximum amount of dividends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total cost of the ERS scheme is over $3.6 billion,

or $1.2 billion per year over the next 3 years*.



<hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>

*Assuming  that all eligible citizens take up  their  shares,

and all then hold their shares until maturity.

<br><br><i>Overall Impact of Economic Restructuring on Households</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now refer members to Handout 2 (Annex 10 (Cols.

751-752)).   The  GST  offset package,  comprising  the  S&CC

rebates,  rental  rebates,  and the  ERS  shares,  should  be

sufficient  to offset the net increase in taxes  a  household

will  pay  over  the next 5 years, at least. It  fulfils  the

Government's promise that most households will not  be  worse

off  during the 5 year transition period. The table at  Annex

10   shows   examples  of  the  overall  impact  of  economic

restructuring on representative households.  If you  look  at

the  Handout,  you will see some examples.  Take  the  2-room

flat.   Household  income  per year, 22,300;  additional  GST

payable per year, estimated $373; there is no income tax,  so

no  saving there; $373 extra GST; the rental and S&C  rebates

$228,  Economic  Restructuring Shares for two adults  divided

over  the  five years come to about $520 per year;  so  total

annual benefits, $748, compared to additional tax of $373  it

is  almost  double, which means that in fact, the package  is

enough to pay for 10 years' worth of the 2-roomers' extra tax

burden.   Similarly, for the others, for the 4-roomer,  seven

years; for the Executive HDB, six years.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20020503/20020503-HA-0740751.htm">Annex 10 - Impact of Economic Restructuring Package on Households (Cols. 751 - 752)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see, the offset package will cover at least 5

years' worth of additional tax payable for all flat sizes. In

fact,  those  living in one- or two-room HDB  flats  will  be

covered for the next 10 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing how anxious Singaporeans are to find out how

this budget benefits



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>



them,  my  ministry has created an online benefits calculator

at             the             following             address:

http://www.budget2002.gov.sg/offset.

<br><br><i>Lower-income Households Guaranteed No Worse Off</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comprehensive as the offset package is, it may not cover

everyone.    Each    household   has    slightly    different

circumstances. A few households may find that the package  of

offsets,  rebates  and  ERS is insufficient  to  cover  their

increase in the GST. To help such households, we will have  a

Citizens' Consultative Committee (CCC) Assistance Scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this scheme, any household with an income below

the  median household income of $3,600 can apply to their CCC

for  assistance,  if  their package of S&CC  rebates,  rental

rebates, and ERS shares does not fully offset their extra tax

for  at  least 5 years. If the CCC confirms that the  offsets

indeed  fall short of the extra tax burden on that household,

it will top up the difference.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will set aside $3 million per year for 5

years  for  this scheme.  The scheme will be  overseen  by  a

Committee, to be chaired also by Minister of State  Chan  Soo

Sen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this CCC Assistance Scheme, we can promise that all

lower-income  households will not be  worse  off  during  the

transition period, at least five years.

<br><br><b>Overall FY 2002 Fiscal Position</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the entire package of offsets, rebates

and  ERS will cost the Government $1,226 million in FY  2002.

Taken  together with the other tax changes, we expect the  FY

2002 fiscal position to turn from a modest budget surplus  of

$900  million  to  a  small  deficit  of  $190  million.  The

Government is able to finance this deficit from FY 2001 funds

and therefore does not need to draw on past reserves.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><b>PART V  CONCLUSION</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Budget lays the basis for our

economic  restructuring. The intensity of global  competition

is  unprecedented. Our restructuring process will be  neither

easy nor painless. But the world has changed, and we have  no

choice.  Hence,  the Economic Restructuring Package  includes

both  the tax changes to gear us for the future, and  also  a

comprehensive  set of offsets to help Singaporeans  adapt  to

the changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures will put the Government in a tight fiscal

position  over the next few years. We can afford the  package

only  because  we  have been consistently prudent  in  fiscal

matters.   Many  countries  find  themselves  in   this   new

competitive  environment,  but  few  are  in  a  position  to

restructure  their taxes, offset the impact on their  people,

and  prepare themselves systematically for the trials  ahead.

We  must continue to save in good years, and be prepared  for

difficult years every now and again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot predict how the global situation will develop,

or  how quickly Southeast Asia will regain its stability  and

confidence.  Not all the external trends are favourable.  But

let us make funda-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>



mental changes now, so that we sustain economic growth,  stay

ahead of the competition, and create jobs and prosperity  for

our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. [Applause.]

<div align="center"><b>MEGA STORES IN HDB ESTATES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development,  with  NTUC  FairPrice  planning  mega

stores  in Housing and Development Board (HDB) estates,  what

will be the impact on small HDB shop owners in these affected

areas, especially those who have just bought their shops from

HDB.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB shops have not been spared the problems that the

local  retail sector has faced over the past few years.   HDB

shop-owners are today faced with keen competition,  not  just

locally  but also overseas.  Since the eighties, new suburban

shopping malls and mega stores have entered the local  retail

scene,  and NTUC Fairprice's mega stores are but the  latest.

These  stores  provide the convenience of one-stop  shopping,

usually  in air-conditioned comfort, within HDB estates,  and

are hence popular with HDB residents.  Many Singaporeans also

travel   to  Johor  Bahru,  Kuala  Lumpur  and  other  nearby

destinations to shop for their groceries, personal  wear  and

other   items  at  lower  prices.  In  the  current  economic

downturn,  domestic demand has also been  depressed  by  wage

cuts and fear of job losses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against such a backdrop, it is inevitable that some HDB

shop-owners  and  tenants will see a drop in their  business.

To  assist  them to tide through their current  difficulties,

HDB  has  implemented various assistance measures,  including

rental  rebates,  passing on property tax  savings  to  them,

exercising  greater  flexibility  in  granting  approval  for

change  of use and trade, and allowing shop-owners to convert

to  shorter leases or sublet their shops.  But in the longer-term,  HDB  shop-owners and tenants will have to  continually

upgrade  their  business operations and  adapt  to  lifestyle

changes  and consumer preferences to survive.  They  need  to

focus  on  areas  such  as the use of  IT,  customer  service

management,   inventory  control  management   and   cashflow

management  in  their  business operations.   The  Standards,

Productivity  and Innovation Board (SPRING)  and  the  Retail

Promotion Centre have in place various schemes to help  them.

Ultimately,  whether a shop survives and thrives depends  not

on  how much assistance the Government gives, but whether the

shop can attract and retain its customers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, not all is gloom and doom. It is not

difficult for HDB shops to find their own niche and develop a

base  of  loyal  customers,  because  there  will  always  be

residents  who,  for reasons of convenience  or  familiarity,

still  prefer  to  patronize  HDB  shops  rather  than  large

shopping  malls  and mega marts. Due to  the  size  of  their

operations, it is also easier for HDB shopkeepers to  provide

personalized  services  to  their  customers.   Sheng   Siong

Supermarket  is an example of a HDB shop which  has  upgraded

its  business  operations and done very  well,  despite  keen

competition from bigger players like NTUC Fairprice and  Cold

Storage.  HDB shops should also consider banding together  to

form   "commercial   streets"  to  attract   shoppers.    The

shopkeepers in Marine Parade Town Centre, Chong Pang City and

Toa  Payoh  Town Centre who have worked so, have demonstrated

that this is a worthwhile and workable idea.

<div align="center"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>PROTECTION FOR REMITTING MONEY OVERSEAS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

and  Minister  for  Finance (a) how his Ministry  intends  to

protect  the  interest of the public when  they  remit  their

money overseas through licensed remittance companies and  (b)

whether  his Ministry will review the existing rules  with  a

view to bring those rules in line with those made for banks.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) took over the

licensing  of  remittance  agents  from  the  Controller   of

Exchange Control in 1971.  When exchange controls were lifted

in  1978, remittance agents continued to be licensed  by  MAS

under  a  new  Money-Changing and Remittance  Businesses  Act

(MCRBA).  The  object of the licensing  regime  is  aimed  at

excluding   undesirable   persons   from   conducting   these

businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remittance industry has grown over the years, but it

remains  a  traditional  business, with  many  small  players

operating on the basis of relationship and trust.   Many  are

sole   proprietorships  or  family-owned  partnerships  which

cannot  institute the same degree of internal  controls  that

larger financial institutions like banks insist upon.   Also,

remittance   houses  often  use  parties  such  as   friends,

relatives, employees and unregulated overseas agents  instead

of   banks  to  deliver  funds  to  designated  beneficiaries

overseas. Such is the nature of the remittance business. This

is  why  it  is  difficult to introduce measures  to  enhance

significantly the safety and soundness of remittance  houses.

Many  countries  have  chosen not to regulate  this  type  of

business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After careful study, MAS has concluded that introducing

new  measures or raising the statutory deposit could give the

public  a  false  sense  of confidence in  remittance  houses

without  significantly improving their safety and  soundness.

In  the event of losses, a higher statutory deposit would not

guarantee  recovery of a significantly larger  proportion  of

the  losses.   It is therefore important for  the  public  to

understand the nature and process of the remittance business,

and  weigh the benefits and risks of using remittance  houses

against  safer but perhaps less convenient channels  provided

by banks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS will continue to conduct background checks on

applicants  before it grants them remittance  licences.   MAS

will  also  continue to monitor remittance houses' compliance

with  existing  rules and regulations, and, where  justified,

will  impose fines on errant licensees.  In serious cases  of

irregularities or non-compliance, MAS will consider  revoking

or  not  renewing licences. MAS will also refer  cases  where

fraud occurs or is suspected to the Police for investigation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a cash business, the remittance industry should

ideally  be  required to have control structures  similar  to

banks.   As  far  as is practicable, the MCRBA  does  require

remittance  houses to institute some basic control  features,

eg,  audits  performed by an external auditor, submission  of

audited   accounts  and  auditors'  findings  to   MAS,   and

separation  of  remittance  funds  from  other  accounts   of

licensees.   However,  it is not feasible  to  require  these

often small, one-man or family-owned operations to adopt most

of  the  important control features found in banks, including

corporate  governance  structures or  sophisticated  internal

control systems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons cited earlier, MAS has, after a review,

decided  not  to  amend  the  MCRBA.  Nonetheless,  MAS  will

continue to review its regulations on an ongoing basis.

<div align="center"><b>ROAD SAFETY FOR MOTORCYCLISTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  whether  there  are  plans  by  the  Traffic  Police

Department  to  work  with motorcycling  clubs  and  interest

groups to improve rider skills and defensive riding, with the

aim of promoting better road safety.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic Police has been working in partnership with

various organisations to promote motorcyclists' safety and to

improve  road safety.   These organisations include  the  ITE

Ang Mo Kio Safe Riding Club, Harley Davidson, National Safety

Council,  tertiary institutions and organisations with  large

fleets    of   motorcycles   such   as   TRICON   Restaurants

International.   A  good example of such a programme  carried

out  jointly  by Traffic Police and the various organisations

is  the  Motorcyclists' Safety Carnival organised with Harley

Davidson.  Another example is the Road Safety Awareness  Talk

organised with Ang Mo Kio ITE Safe Riding Club.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These safety programmes focus on rider skills, defensive

riding  and  the attitudes of a safe motorcyclist. Techniques

such  as  case  studies,  simulated riding  training,  riding

demonstrations  are used to help participants understand  the

different  aspects of motorcyclists' safety. In  addition  to

these,  there  are  ongoing public  education  efforts  which

stress the need for drivers of motor vehicles to give way  to

motorcyclists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic Police has also incorporated new training and

testing  initiatives in the Class 2B training  curriculum  to

better  equip motorcyclists with the challenges faced on  the

roads.  These  include emergency braking on wet  surfaces  as

well  as  night training where learner riders are exposed  to

riding conditions at night.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development  if the Housing and  Development  Board

(HDB)  will  remove restrictions on the rental of  whole  HDB

units  to  allow  aged parents who opt  to  stay  with  their

children, to earn extra income.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB flats are meant for owner-occupation. Hence,

subletting  of  whole  flat is approved  only  under  certain

approved conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since September 2000, HDB has allowed elderly lessees to

sublet their entire flats for additional income, on a case-by-case basis.  To ensure that such subletting is neither abused

nor  fuel  excessive demand for HDB flats, HDB has restricted

the scheme to applicants who:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Are 65 years and above at the point of application;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Own a 3-room or smaller flat;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Have occupied the flat for at least 25 years; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Have no outstanding mortgage loan with HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-date, 131 cases have been approved. HDB will

continue  to monitor the response to the scheme and fine-tune

it if necessary.

<div align="center"><b>EARLY SECONDARY SCHOOL LEAVERS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mdm Cynthia Phua</b> asked the Minister for Education,

from  1997  - 2001 (a) what is the number of early  secondary

school leavers who did not complete their education; (b) what

are  the reasons causing them to leave school early; and  (c)

what  is  the number of students falling within each  of  the

reasons.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of students who dropped out of our schools

between  Secondary 1 and Secondary 4 has been on  a  downward

trend over the years.  It has decreased from 1,656 in 1997 to

1,059 in 2001.  In percentage terms, it has dropped from 3.3%

of the Primary 1 cohort to 2.7% over the same period of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students drop out of school for a variety of reasons,

including  loss of interest and financial or family problems,

or  they may have found employment or are seeking employment.

The  number of students falling within each of these  reasons

is given in the table below.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When students show signs of dropping out, principals and

teachers  will  dissuade them from doing so.   Their  efforts

include counselling the students, monitoring their attendance

and  contacting  their homes when they are  absent,  inviting

parents  to  school, and making home visits  to  discuss  the

matter  with the parents.  Where the reason for dropping  out

is financial, schools are prepared to extend financial aid to

the students.
