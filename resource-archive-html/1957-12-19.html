<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 42 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Speaker, Sir, I

rise to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 42 be

reduced by $36,240 in respect of subhead 8

therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to this item, we are asked to provide

$36,240  for  fees for an adviser on  land  titles

and, according to the explanation in the footnote,

I   see   he  is  required  to  draft  rules   and

regulations  and to prepare a textbook  explaining

the  law and practice of the Land Titles Ordinance

(No.  21 of 1956). Sir, it is very surprising that

there  are no experts within the Ministry to draft

rules  or  regulations  and to  prepare  textbooks

regarding  the  Land  Titles  Ordinance.  In   the

Ministry,  I do find that we have one Commissioner

of  Lands,  one Deputy Commissioner of Lands,  one

Registrar of Titles and one Examiner of Titles. We

have  four senior officers who are well conversant

with  land titles and so forth, and yet  they  are

not  in  a  position  to  prepare  a  Land  Titles

Ordinance  or  to draft rules and  regulations.  I

cannot  see why, Sir. What are they for? We employ

senior  officers for the purpose of  running  that

Ministry. All of them have qualifications on  land

titles and so forth, yet they cannot prepare these

draft rules and regulations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3229</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my memory serves me right, Sir, I think

sometime  last  year  or so we  sent  our  former

Commissioner of Lands, who is now, I  understand,

the  Permanent Secretary, to Australia  to  study

this question of land titles. He is back with us.

What  has  he done and why cannot he prepare  the

draft rules or regulations? Is it necessary  that

we  should  now  appoint  a  special  adviser  to

prepare  them  at  a cost to Government  and  the

public  of $36,240? Will this not be a  waste  of

funds?  If  the senior officers in  the  Ministry

cannot  prepare them, they are not fit to  remain

in   office.  I  am  rather  surprised  that  the

Minister is not aware whether officers in it  can

or  cannot prepare such rules and regulations  in

respect of land titles.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, it is not the Minister who  is  not

aware  of something happening in his Ministry,  I

think it is the hon. Member for Queenstown who is

not aware.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I cannot be.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> We still do not have a

Registrar  of Titles although we have  advertised

for  the post; there have been interviews by  the

Public Service Commission - four times, I think - yet

we are still without a Registrar of Titles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These rules and regulations with regard to land

titles, Sir, are for a new system of land tenure.

We  are  using this system in Singapore  for  the

first  time and I am afraid that the officers  in

my  Ministry  do  not have the  expert  knowledge

which is required for such a system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I have anything further to say.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the

Minister  tell  us  what  experience  our  former

Commissioner  of Lands gained whilst  he  was  in

Australia to learn this question of land  titles?

He  was  sent there for a particular purpose - to

learn  the Ordinance or to learn something  about

land  titles.  He  is back, and  I  am  sure  the

Minister  cannot  say that he  does  not  have  a

Commissioner of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3230</b></font><br><br>



Lands or that he has no one to whom to give  this

appointment. He went to Australia at our  expense

and  what  has  the  Ministry  or  the  Singapore

Government benefited? We sent him there to  learn

all about the subject yet he is not in a position

to prepare draft rules and regulations.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Permanent   Secretary  was  sent   to   Australia

sometime  back  to study the new system  of  land

titles.  He  is partly responsible for  the  Land

Titles Ordinance which was passed in 1956.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

to  a  layman it may seem easy to formulate rules

for the proposed title to land under the intended

registration system but to those who know,  as  I

do,  it  is  a  difficult job.  It  needs  expert

advice, otherwise when the regulations are  made,

they may either not be applicable or, if they do,

may  lead to misunderstandings under the proposed

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $276,690 for Head 42 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1955 the

Government   set  up  a  Working   Committee   to

investigate  and report on the question  of  land

clearance  and  resettlement.  This  report   was

tabled  in this Assembly in 1956 and adopted.  It

is  now  more  than  1½ years but  what  has  the

Government done to the recommendations  contained

in  that report? The only scheme so far realised,

as  far as I am aware, is in the resettlement  of

the slum areas of Queenstown and Henderson Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these two areas, what has the

Government done? Can the Minister tell this House

how  many other areas he has in mind to carry out

this   resettlement  scheme?  And  another   most

important  question is, if he has any other  area

in  mind, will these future areas be concentrated

on a communal basis?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3231</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my memory is correct, Sir, when the Minister

stood  for  election in 1955 he  stood  under  the

Alliance banner, with the support, may I  say,  of

the  Labour Front. He approached the Labour  Front

for  support and he was elected. When he stood for

election,  one  of his platforms  was,  'If  I  am

elected, I will strive for the betterment  of  the

attap  dwellers. I will do all I can for the attap

dwellers -'



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> I never said so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Well, that is one of his

platforms and that of the Labour Front as well. At

that  time  I was in the Labour Front and  I  know

what its platform was. Sir, may I say that this is

one  of  those election pledges that  a  candidate

puts  to the public just as a vote-catching  stunt

but  is never fulfilled. A promise was made during

the  last elections but its fulfilment has yet  to

come.



<br><br>10.15 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Member is now a Minister of the Labour

Front  Coalition  Government  today,  and  it   so

happens  that he has been made Minister for  Local

Government, Lands and Housing, which gives him all

the  power  to  do  what  he  can  for  the  attap

dwellers. What has he done, Sir, during  these  2½

years  in  office? As for as I can see, there  are

still plenty of slum areas in the Colony. What has

he  done after all his promises to the electors in

his  division,  Ulu Bedok, and  to  those  in  the

Colony in general? He has practically done nothing

at  all.  I  do  not  know how he  will  face  his

electorate  when he goes back to the country  next

year.  I would like to see how he tells them  when

he goes back.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point, Sir, is on the question of a

housing  authority. This subject has been  brought

up  in this Assembly time and time again but do we

have a housing authority yet? There is none. May I

refresh  the Minister, Sir, that when  he  assumed

office  he  said that he would set  up  a  housing

authority.  Has he forgotten that?  He  said  that

within a very short time he would certainly set up

one. May I refresh his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3232</b></font><br><br>



memory  by  reading from Volume 1, No. 1,  of  the

Official  Report for 22nd April, 1955, column  40?

When he assumed office, he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, it is proposed to tackle the

housing problem more vigorously and efficiently by

setting  up a statutory Housing Authority,  solely

responsible to Government, to replace the  present

Singapore Improvement Trust. It is hoped that such

a   Housing   Authority  would  be   able   in   a

comparatively short time to bridge the  increasing

gap  between  public  housing programmes  and  the

needs of the people."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he says "a comparatively short time". May I

ask  the  Minister,  Sir, how short  is  a  "short

time",  or it may be how long? I do not know  what

he  means by it. It may mean the time from the day

he  assumed office until the day he is no more  in

it.  That would be from three-and-a-half  to  four

years;  would that be a "short time"? May  I  also

remind the Minister, Sir, that life is also short.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to refer to my question on

16th  October,  1957,  on  the  progress  of   the

establishment  of this housing authority.  I  will

refresh his memory by reading what he said (column

2656):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not quite sure whether the hon. Member

wants  a report or a statement on the question  of

the  progress  of the establishment of  a  Housing

Authority. He has asked me to make a statement.  A

statement  can  be in one sentence  or  in  twenty

sentences.  I  have  made  my  statement  in   one

sentence."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made his statement very, very short in - one

sentence - and I think that is what he  meant  by  a

"short time". In his reply, I may say - if I may  be

allowed  to  continue  on  this  subject - he  said,

"there  is  no  delay  in the establishment  of  a

Housing Authority." I will read again, from column

2656:



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Is the Minister aware of the

concern of the public in the long delay in setting

up this Housing Authority?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> There is no delay, Sir."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, he has been two-and-a-half years in

office  and  he  has promised this House  that  he

will,  "in a comparatively short time", set  up  a

housing  authority. Two-and-a-half  years  is  not

enough for the Government to set it up! Every time

this question is brought up in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3233</b></font><br><br>



House,  the  reply  is that  it  is  still  under

consideration and that 'we will submit  a  report

very  soon,  or  "in due course,"  which  is  the

normal  term  of the Government'. How  long  more

will  this delay be? Is it going to be  until  he

leaves  the  Ministry or until he is no  more  in

office?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as long as this Housing Authority is not

established, there will be no proper authority to

take   over  the  S.I.T.  The  Minister   himself

realises  that  the  housing  authority  is  most

essential  to  take over from the S.I.T.,  as  he

stated  on  22nd April, 1955, column  40  of  the

Official Report. Yet, after two-and-a-half  years

we  do not have a housing authority to take over.

And what is the result? - there are still thousands

and  thousands  of  outstanding applications  for

S.I.T. accommodation. They are still waiting  and

waiting. Is it the function of the S.I.T. to keep

people  in  suspense,  waiting  and  waiting  for

accommodation? How long will it take? May  I  say

that  it is a real shame for the Minister to say,

in  reply  to  a  question of mine sometime  this

year, that so far in 1957 not a single house  has

been  allotted to the public. What a  shame!  And

what  a  government  which states  that  it  will

provide  houses and so forth and yet has not  one

single  house or one single flat allotted to  the

public this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I remind the Government or the Labour Front,

Sir, that on its posters during Election time, it

was   stated  in  Chinese,  "Clothing,  food  and

housing:  If elected, if we come into  power, we

will   provide  the  public  with   these   three

essentials.  Number  one  is  clothing;  we  will

provide  the public with clothing. Next, we  will

provide  the public with food; and next, we  will

provide  the  public with housing." This  is  the

poster put up by the Labour Front at that time. I

was  lucky that I did not use these Labour  Front

posters  for my election purposes - I  had  my  own

posters - and I am therefore not responsible  or  a

party  to that statement. Housing is of the  most

important  platforms of the Government or  Labour

Front, yet after all these years it cannot find a

house for the public!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3234</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this, Sir? Is this what the Government

is  trying  to do, to neglect its duty and  delay

and delay? When are we going to have houses? When

do  we  expect to have the slum areas cleared?  I

would like to ask the Minister: when can he  make

a  final decision on this housing authority? I am

quite  sure  his reply again will be,  'Within  a

very short time'. But I would like a definite and

a specific 'short time' - is it to be a matter of a

day,  a week, a month or in another l½ years when

he may be no more in office!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next point I would like to refer to is

the  decision  made by the S.I.T. on  citizenship

and  eligibility for houses, which is  now  being

referred  to  the Government. The  Board  of  the

S.I.T. has decided that only Singapore  Citizens

can  apply for accommodation and that no one else

can. Prior to this decision, aliens who have been

here  10 years and more could apply. What is  the

S.I.T. going to do with the applications now  in

its  hands  from aliens? The reply  may  be  that

since they are aliens, they are not considered to

be  local  people, and will not be provided  with

S.I.T. accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I remind the House that I asked a question:

what  would  be the fate of those who  wanted  to

become  citizens  but could  not  get  themselves

registered  by 31st January, 1958?  I believe  my

question was ruled out as being hypothetical  and

I  could not press the matter further. Now is  it

the fault of these aliens? Is it that they do not

want  to become citizens? It is not their  fault.

They  are anxious to become citizens of Singapore

but  just because of the rush, the crowds and the

long  queues  lined  up at all  the  registration

centres  they  cannot  have  a  chance   to   get

themselves  registered in  time.  Is  the  S.I.T.

going to deprive them of a house? Is it going  to

scrap   all   applications  from  these   aliens,

applications submitted long ago? Some might  have

submitted their applications five years  ago,  or

even  10  years  ago. Yet today  the  S.I.T. has

decided, and the Government may decide, that they

will  be  removed  from the register  or  waiting

list. Is it fair, Sir, that after



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3235</b></font><br><br>



waiting  in  suspense for five to ten years,  and

with  no fault of not wanting to become Singapore

citizens, they will have to be chucked out of the

register?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Government will take note of all

these  points and I would like to hear  what  the

Minister has to say in reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  endorse  the  remarks of the hon.  Member  for

Queenstown,  particularly  those  concerning  the

housing authority. The delay in the establishment

of  this  housing authority, up  to  the  closing

stages of the life of the present Government, has

thrown  the whole housing programme, particularly

those  of  private  builders, completely  out  of

gear.  With  no central authority  to  deal  with

plans,  and with plans having to be submitted  in

seven  copies  to different bodies - the  Singapore

Improvement Trust, the City Council or the  Rural

Board,  the Health Department and others - and  the

insistence that everything must be cleared before

being passed from one body to another, plans have

taken over a year to be approved. Sometimes  even

after  a  year,  plans  are  sent  back  and  the

architects who sent them in are asked  to  submit

new  ones, because new ideas have come  up  about

the siting of roads and their standards. This has

caused  such delay that, instead of building  the

3,000 houses which I anticipated two companies in

Singapore   could  have  done,  they  have   only

completed about 1,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unfortunately this delay has now caused the

collapse  of all private development  because  of

the   money  tightness  and  the  disinflationery

squeeze.  No loans can now be obtained  from  the

building societies. Therefore, you are not  going

to  get  any  more  houses built  by  the  public

investing people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have always advocated that housing should

be  the  work not only of Government, but private

developers as well, private developers  to  cater

for  those  who  earn more than $400  or  $500  a

month - particularly senior Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3236</b></font><br><br>



servants  who are about to retire,  who  can  buy

their own houses and when the time for retirement

comes have a house of their own - and the S.I.T. to

house  people with smaller incomes who are unable

to buy the houses, and of course some unfortunate

people  who  always have to be helped by  subsidy

from  Government. But all this now, Sir, has been

thrown  completely  out of gear  and  I  do  urge

Government  to bring this housing authority  into

being as soon as possible, so that we can get  on

with the work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another very important aspect of this housing

authority  is in the provision of factory  sites,

as  we  are now striving for secondary  or  light

industries.   If   we  are   to   encourage   the

establishment of industries, we must  not  insist

on standards of building which make it impossible

for a small man with a capital of, say $10,000 to

$20,000,  to  start a factory.  You  have  to  be

realistic. You have to provide sites quickly  and

allow  them  to  put up their  own  buildings  as

cheaply  as  possible consistent with  safety.  I

have   seen  plans  being  refused  because   the

standards of building are not high enough.  Well,

in the past, nearly 100 years in Singapore, not a

single factory has collapsed on the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we must get plans for

factories  for  light industries approved  within

three months at the latest; not when you sent  it

in,  it is sent back again and the reason  it  is

asked  to  be  withdrawn is because it  does  not

conform  to the requirements of the Master  Plan.

They  put  it  very nicely of course;  they  say,

'Will  you do this and that?' But all that  takes

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure if Government wants to help, it can be

done.  And it must be done, otherwise we will  be

burdened with more and more unemployment.



<br><br>10.30 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I   strongly  endorse  the  remarks  made  by  my

colleague, the hon. Member for Paya Lebar, on the

establishment   of   a   Housing   Authority   in

Singapore. We have allotted large sums  of  money

to the Singapore Improvement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3237</b></font><br><br>



Trust  and what has been done with all of it?  No

houses  have  been built and, as the  Member  for

Queenstown has said, there is a long waiting list

of applicants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can inform the Hon. the Minister for Housing

that at the moment, if he were to pay a visit  to

the office of the Planning Section of the S.I.T.,

he   will   find  piles  and  piles   of   plans,

development plans, lying idle there. Those  plans

have  been  there for months and months,  yet  no

action  has been taken. Why? The Planning Section

was  formerly  run  by four officers  but  now  I

understand that one of the officers is on  leave,

one   has   been  boarded  out  and   the   third

transferred to be Acting Chairman of  the  S.I.T.

(because  the  Chairman of the  S.I.T. has  been transferred  to  be adviser to the  Minister  for Local  Government, Lands and Housing). Why cannot

more  officials be put in the Department in  view

of  the  fact  that those development  plans  are

essential for this country? People want to invest

money  in  this country. They submit their  plans

but  what  has the S.I.T. done? It  has  done  no

work! It is really a shame.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  would like just to comment on the speech  made

by  the  hon.  Member  for  Queenstown  regarding

citizenship   registration.  I  understand   that

500,000 application forms have been given out  by

the  Department concerned. I read  in  the  Press

this   morning  that  166,000  people  have  been

registered  by now. I think it is high  time  the

Department    looks   into   the   matter    very

carefully - how  many persons it  expects  will  be

registered, how many have registered and what  is

the  balance  of expected registrations,  and  to

appoint    more   registration   teams.    Surely

Government can appoint more teams because  people

are  finding  difficulty. When  they  ask  for  a

registration  team, they are given dates  further

and  further off and the people are not sure that

they can be registered within the period. I agree

that  the  registration period  should  never  be

extended  but the opportunity should be taken  of

having more teams so that people who want to  get

registered can be satisfied.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, it is really gratifying to note

that  all  Members of the Opposition support  and

endorse the housing authority which is one of the

principles  of the Labour Front and  not  of  the

Opposition.  I am glad to note that they  endorse

something which they never even thought  of  when

they stood for election.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> In reply to that, the housing

authority  was  thought of and was  planned  long

before the Front came into being.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Sir, it is also very fine to

see  that the Liberal-Socialists have now got new

friends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the report of the Working Party

on land clearance in 1956. I think we have done a

lot,  but  in  so  far  as  this  Government   is

concerned, we do first things first, and  amongst

the things that we have done was the resettlement

of the squatters in Queenstown and other parts of

the   city  from  areas  primarily  required  for

Singapore Improvement Trust schemes. I  think  we

have   done   a   wonderful  job,  although   the

Opposition does not think so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Self-praise!



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> There are at the moment 70

areas  for resettlement under investigation which

will comprise almost 2,600 farm lots.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the allegation by the Member for

Queenstown  that I have made promises  during  my

election  campaign to attap dwellers and  so  on,

may  I  remind  the Member that I  made  no  such

promises?  All I did say was that I would  do  my

very   best   for   the  people   of   Singapore,

irrespective of whether they lived in  Ulu  Bedok

or Queenstown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the housing authority,

Members of the Opposition seem to think that  you

can put up a housing authority within a matter of

months,  and  even within a matter  of  weeks  or

days.  Well, Sir, the legislation for  a  housing

authority  is a very complicated one. I  know  we

have taken two and a half years but I did promise

at an earlier sitting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3239</b></font><br><br>



of  this  Assembly  that a Bill  for  the  housing

authority  would be introduced at the  very  first

opportunity  during  the  next  session   of   the

Assembly.  I  hope to have it introduced  for  its

First Reading at its very first sitting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the allegation that the S.I.T. has been

sleeping and has not been building any house,  may

I  remind  Members that, at the time I replied  to

questions in this Assembly to the effect  that  no

housing  units  had  been completed  or  allocated

between August 1956 and April 1957, there were  no

less than 4,000 houses under construction? By  the

end  of 1958, most of these houses will have  been

completed - and probably allocated as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the other allegation, about delay in

passing  plans. Here again, Sir, I have  explained

to  the  House  that the S.I.T. is  not  the  only

authority  responsible  for  passing  plans.   For

instance, you have also the City Council,  and  I ,

as  Minister, cannot in any way interfere with the

workings of the City Council. Similarly, you  have

the  Rural Board, probably the Ministry of  Health

and other departments, whose "chops" you must have

on  the  plans  before you can  proceed  with  the

building.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Do something about it!



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> But if I may say this, if

there are any members of the public who feel  that

they have been let down very badly by the Planning

Department of the S.I.T., I shall be only too glad

to  be of any assistance to them, particularly,  I

think, to the Member for Paya Lebar.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, I

think  this  House will agree that  the  Hon. the

Minister  for Local Government, Lands and  Housing

has  failed to answer the allegation raised by the

hon.  Member  for  Tiong Bahru about  shortage  of

staff  in the Planning Department of the Singapore

Improvement Trust. Of course we accept that it  is

quite  a  complicated matter for a  plan  to  pass

through the Rural Board, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3240</b></font><br><br>



City  Council and other bodies, but I think it  is

generally  known that the S.I.T. is the main  body

causing all the delay in passing plans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is that this House has yet to be

informed  by the Minister when he can  promise  it

that  the housing authority can be set up to  take

over the S.I.T.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to add my last point for the Government

to   consider.   Since  under  the  Master   Plan,

satellite towns are going to be set up,  I  wonder

why  Government insists on building multi-storeyed

houses to house what I should say are middle class

people able to pay at least $30 per flat. But  how

about those who live in cubicles and pay from  $10

to $20 for a single room? Does the Government ever

consider  building more low-cost housing to  house

those  who  are  really poor? These people  cannot

afford  to  pay  the lowest rent  charged  by  the

S.I.T.,  i.e. $30. I suggest that there  are  many

vacant  pieces  of  land in  the  rural  areas  or

outskirts of the city on which we can build  cheap

houses  (especially as we have an expert on houses

with us - I mean the hon. Member for Paya Lebar, Mr

Lim  Koon Teck, who can build low-cost houses) and

charge a very low rent. This will enable the  poor

to enjoy the fresh air and sunshine as others do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the S.I.T. in its planning has

studied  the  surveys made by the  Social  Welfare

Department of the average income of the people  in

Singapore,  and  considered how  many  people  can

afford  to  pay the rent it charges.  Many  people

cannot  pay the rent by themselves and are  forced

to  invite  relatives or friends  to  share  their

flats, which is against the regulations, and  they

are  asked to quit. But does the S.I.T. not  know

that  these  people would like to have  the  whole

flat  to  themselves as much as do those  who  can

afford  to pay? As they cannot afford to  pay  the

rent  themselves, they therefore  have  to  invite

relatives,  friends  or even  strangers  to  share

their  flats.  Yet the S.I.T. rules that  this  is

against regulations. In order, therefore, to  save

all  the trouble to be to visit the Courts, I wish

and  strongly suggest that Government will  follow

the summoned in and summoned out, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3241</b></font><br><br>



principle of setting up satellite towns and build

many,  many more low-cost houses in them for  the

poor.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is it not the

duty   of   the  Hon. the  Minister  for   Local

Government, Lands and Housing to pay a  visit  to

the Planning Section of the Singapore Improvement

Trust? He will find there the cause of the  delay

in the approval of the development plans. In that

small office, all around, even in the corners, he

will  find piles and piles of plans, plans  which

have lain idle for months and months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want prosperity in Singapore. If you have

those  plans passed, we will create it. They  are

development plans; they are essential. They  will

create employment for our people. They will  lead

to  the building of more factories. Why then  are

there delays?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister responsible, it is his duty to

pay a visit to this office. I understand that the

department is understaffed. Before, its work  was

done  by four officers, as I said earlier  in  my

speech,  but  it  is now being run  by  only  one

officer.  Why should there be delay?  It  is  his

duty to check it up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, I want to make a

few comments in reply to the Minister. I think he

said  that he has 70 areas comprising about 2,600

farm  plots for clearance and resettlement. I  am

not clear whether he has already cleared these 70

areas,  or that there are 70 areas in all in  the

Colony  to  be cleared. If it is 70 areas  to  be

cleared, I would like the Minister to tell us how

many has he cleared so far.



<br><br>10.45 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point is that he said he made no promise

during  his  election campaign to provide  better

conditions  of living for attap dwellers.  May  I

call it a tradition, Sir, for promises always  to

be  made by candidates during election time,  but

when  they  get  into  power,  they  forget   the

promises?  So I will not blame him for not  being

aware  now  or not being able to remember  having

made  such  a promise. As a member of the  public

who  was at his election rallies, I think  I  can

remember better.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3242</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is on the housing authority. He

said  that  at  the  first opportunity  he  would

report  to this Assembly on its establishment.  I

do hope sincerely, Sir, that the next time we sit

here,  he  will place legislation for  a  housing

authority  before this House, and that after  the

next  sitting  we  will in fact  have  a  housing

authority to take over the S.I.T.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth point is that he said I accused him or

the Government of not having built any houses. My

accusation was that the Government had so far not

provided   a  flat  to  the  many  thousands   of

applicants   on  the  waiting  list  for   S.I.T.

accommodation. He had clearly stated in his reply

to  me some time earlier that so far this year no

houses  had  been  allotted  to  members  of  the

public. Is it not a shame for the Government that

not even one single house has been allotted while

the  main posters of the Labour Front - may I quote

again - promise  three main items  "clothing,  food

and -"



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Sir, point of order - the

Member is repeating.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Under Standing Orders I can of

course  stop  tedious repetition, but  I  do  not

think  the hon. Member has become tedious at  the

moment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, I am not repeating but

just quoting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also said that by 1958 he would have all these houses, as planned by the S.I.T.,

completed. Is the Government going to wait  until

the  end  of 1958 to allocate houses? He has  not

said in his reply that he will commence forthwith

to  allot houses to those on the waiting list. He

only said that he was quite confident that by the

end  of  1958  there would be quite a  number  of

houses completed. Is the Government going to  wait

until  all those houses are completed before  the

S.I.T starts any allocation?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the figure

I  gave  for  1958 was 4,000 units but  I  should

mention  that  by the end of 1957,  approximately

the same number of houses will have been completed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3243</b></font><br><br>



The  allocation  of  houses  is  not  the

responsibility  of the Minister but  that  of  the

S.I.T., as the Member for Queenstown knows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the 70 areas which I mentioned are

for  resettlement, I would refer the Member to the

Annual  Report of the Commissioner for  Lands  for

1956, page 13, last but one paragraph.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the "piles and piles of plans" in the

S.I.T., I think, Sir, the fault there lies not  so

much  with the insufficiency of the present  staff

of the S.I.T.; it has in fact not been able to get

enough  qualified men although it has a number  of

Asians.  Many  of  the posts were  advertised  but

there was no response.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> It may be rubbish, Sir, as the

Member for Tiong Bahru thinks, but I feel if we do

not  get  enough  staff for our  public  services,

whether in the Government, the S.I.T. or the  City

Council,  then there will be a total breakdown  in

the administration of the Colony of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this subject

of  housing  is  a very important  one,  with  our

population growing day by day. The reply given  by

the  Hon. the Minister for Local Government, Lands

and  Housing means that he is not the only  person

concerned,  but that there are other  bodies  like

the  S.I.T.,  City  Council, Rural  Board,  Health

Department and so on. Am I to understand from  him

that during his 2½ years in office he has not been

able  to  get proper co-ordination and co-operation

from  these  other bodies so as to hurry  up  with

this important project of housing?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr

debate  on  a  proper  level, but  if  provocative

speeches  of the nature attempted by the  Minister

for Health are made, I think my job will be made a

little more difficult. Let us be relevant. Let  us

carry on with the debate in the right spirit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Hear! Hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> We are not deaf.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, no one is as anxious as the

present Government to provide homes for the people

of  Singapore.  Members  of  the  Opposition  have

accused  us  in  these terms: What have  we  done?

Where are the homes built? But I have yet to  hear

a  true  appreciation of the problems in  housing,

and  no  expression  has been  made  to  show  the

gravity  of the situation except allegations  like

this:  Where are the houses? What is the  Minister

doing  about  it? Has he not been working  in  the

Ministry for 2½ years? Sir, if Opposition  Members

are  to  look  around in Queenstown and  the  old

Kallang Airport, they will find homes being  built

there. If they realise that these houses are being

built  by the Government, they will not be  saying

all the things that they have said today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true, Sir, that for a few days now Members

of   the  Opposition  have  been  suffering   from

election  fever,  and in view of  that  fact,  the

Government  will try to see whether some  medicine

can be administered to clear them of this disease.

I  think probably their election fever will, stop

by the 20th of this month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Paya Lebar. Sir, said that

the  delay  in  the  establishment  of  a  housing

authority  has  a  relation  to  the  loans  being

granted by the housing societies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3245</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> No, Sir, I seek elucidation.

That  was  not my point at all. I never  mentioned

that. I said it was unfortunate that this delay in

the  passing  of  plans had coincided  with  loans

being discontinued.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> I do not think that the delay in

building  houses  has any relationship  whatsoever

either  with  the delay in passing  plans  or  the

delay   in   giving  loans  by  the  Malaya-Borneo

Building Society. The delay in building houses  is

due  to  the reasons given by the Minister and  to

the various implications of the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think that any other Government in

Singapore will be so humane as the present one  in

dealing  with human problems. It is true  that  in

dealing with housing matters, in cases of eviction

this  Government has been particularly careful  to

avoid  causing  any difficulty  to  the  poor  and

unfortunate people being evicted, and in trying to

help  them,  there has been delay. But  I  do  not

think  that it is true to say that that  has  been

the reason for the delay in building homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Tiong Bahru said that he has

seen  piles  and  piles of plans in  the  Planning

Section of the S.I.T. Sir, if I am a blacksmith and

if  I start talking about carpentry, what does  it

mean? I am in some profession and I can only speak

with authority on that profession. Planning? - I  do

not know planning -



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Shut up!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member for Tiong

Bahru will please withdraw that expression.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> I withdraw it, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> I think it is very bad to make

accusations without knowing the true facts.  These

accusations,  Sir, will cause the  morale  of  the

staff  to  fall, and thereby cause more delays  in

the Planning Section. I hope, Sir, that in dealing

with these matters we will realise that we have to

be tolerant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think there is a real test coming very

soon  to  all  Members of this  Assembly  and  all

members of all Parties.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3246</b></font><br><br>



Let  us  face  this test. Opposition Members  have

said  the  Government is causing delay in building

homes.  Sir,  nearly 18 months ago, the  Singapore

Improvement  Trust  planned the  redevelopment  of

Covent  Gardens.  In Covent Gardens  there  are  a

number of tenants facing eviction. Government  has

offered them alternative accommodation. The S.I.T.

has  taken  care to offer all of them  alternative

accommodation.  There have been some  difficulties

on  the part of the tenants which were brought  to

the  attention of the Minister, and  the  Minister

has  done  all  he can to relieve them.  And  very

soon,  some of these people will have to give  way

for the redevelopment of Covent Gardens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I have received reports that

political  Parties  are very active  in  the  area

trying  to  tell the people, 'You don't go  unless

you  get  a  house for $10 a month. You  don't  go

unless  you  get  a  house plus compensation.  You

don't  go  until something substantial is received

by  you.' What are these "substantial" things? The

S.I.T. has   already  offered  them   alternative

accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do hope, Sir, that the Members of the

Opposition  who want more homes will advise  those

people to take advantage of the offer of new homes

made  by  the  S.I.T. and so help  Government  to

redevelop Covent Gardens. This is a test  for  the

Opposition. Let us see whether they will share the

job   of   providing  homes  for  the  people   of

Singapore,  whether they are true and  sincere  in

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think that anyone in Singapore can

accuse this Government of trying to delay building

homes for the people. I say it, and unless I  have

proof  otherwise, I cannot for one moment  believe

that those allegations are true.



<br><br>11.00 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, no one has ever suggested

that  the  Government  is  trying  to  delay   the

building of homes for the people. What we  say  is

that it has not been done, that is all. Apparently

the Minister for Local Government,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3247</b></font><br><br>



Lands and Housing has not tried to justify

the  number  of houses that have been built,  but

the Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary now

tries  to justify it. On what grounds? I  do  not

know  whether  he was here when I mentioned  that

only  3,000 houses had been built within the last

two   and   a  half  years - the  life   of   this

Government -  out of a total target of  well  over

10,000. If he mentions those which are now coming

up  beautifully in the Kallang Basin  I  have  to

tell  him that out of the 3,000 houses that  have

been  completed in these two and  a  half  years,

1,500 have been a carry-over from 1954. So  I  do

not think there is anything to be proud of if you

read the figures and think of them carefully.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I think we must forget the idea

that  in  Singapore we can at any  time  build  a

certain number of houses each year. There  is  no

question  of building 4,000 or 5,000 houses  each

year. The capacity for building and various other

incidental factors make it difficult  to  have  a

certain  quota  per year. The  cost  of  building

materials,   the   cost  of   labour,   and   the

availability   of   both   these    items,    are

contributory factors in building, and  I  do  not

think  for a moment that I need remind  the  hon.

Member  for Paya Lebar of all these difficulties.

What we would like to hear from the Opposition is

an appreciation of the housing problem in general

in   Singapore  and  the  part  played   by   the

Government  in solving that problem.  If  anybody

can  challenge  us  and say  that  there  are  no

difficulties in building houses in Singapore  and

that  the  Government has not taken any steps  to

build  them,  then  we  will  bow  down  to   the

Opposition and we will say we have failed. But if

nobody  can  do  that and yet they  want  to  say

things as they like, well, Sir, we are not  going

to give in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Sir, I find that

right from the beginning of this debate until now

we have not got satisfaction from the Government.

I  would  say to the Government that only  a  bad

workman quarrels with his tools.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3248</b></font><br><br>



Faced with difficulties, the Government seems not

to  be  able  to  do anything  at  all.  We  want

results. We do not want plans. We do not want  to

hear  of  all the efforts that have been made  by

Government being wasted. I was teaching some boys

in physics the other day, and I told them that if

they  started pushing a pillar and wasted a whole

day  sweating  all over pushing it  and  yet  not

moving it an inch, then they were doing no work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard from the Assistant Minister to the

Chief  Secretary that there is an election  fever

and that he is trying to put over a cure. All the

little pills that he has prescribed in the matter

of explanation will not cure it. The best cure is

to  quit  and, when the Government quit, I  think

that  will  be  the greatest cure for  all  these

grouses.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, for the first time I

have  heard  in  this House  the  leader  of  the

Liberal-Socialists  suggesting  to  us  that   we

should  quit.  If  the hon.  Member  can  form  a

government, I will quit. [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I just want to point out

to  the Hon. the Assistant Minister to the  Chief

Secretary  that  if there is a breakdown  in  any

particular  year,  I  have no  quarrel  with  the

Government.  I am taking an average  which  is  a

fair  picture. I would suggest to the  Government

that,  when  they  meet with an obstacle  in  one

direction,  they  should look for  an  outlet  in

another  direction. In this case, I suggest  that

they cut up small plots of land and sell them  to

people  with small means so that they  can  build

their  own huts. But instead of doing this,  they

just  run around in circles and nothing has  been

done.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, nobody on this side has

suggested that we want to form a government. What

we  want  to  see  is  this:  that  the  minority

Government,  which  is undemocratic,  should  not

continue  to  hold  office.  It  is  not  in  the

interests  of the public. They are not fulfilling

their promise. What we want



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3249</b></font><br><br>



is  a  caretaker  All-Party  government  till  the

elections  next year and they should  not  be  the

tools of the colonial power.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, some time

ago   the   hon.  Member  mentioned  a   caretaker

government of all Parties in this Assembly. I have

asked  him whether that is his Party's policy.  If

that  is  so,  say  so  and this  Government  will

consider it.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, when this was asked the

last  time, I replied that the leader of my  Party

would  reply to it. But what I wish to say now  is

this:  it is much more honourable for the  present

Government  to  quit, since their elected  Members

are   not   in  the  majority.  But  an  All-Party

government  which can co-operate  together  should

form   a   caretaker  government  or  a   national

government, but the present Government should  not

be holding office on an undemocratic basis.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

indeed  very  sorry that the debate on  this  item

should  have  developed to this extent.  The  hon.

Member says that we are a minority Government.  He

declares   himself  to  be  a  believer   in   the

democratic  principles  of government.  Surely  he

understands  that in a democratic  setup,  he  can

topple  the Government at any time if he  can  get

sufficient support to pass a vote of no confidence

in  this Government. But he is still debating  the

issue,  Sir. I asked him whether his  call  for  a

national  government - by  that  he  meant  that  it

should  be a caretaker government composed of  all

the   political   Parties   represented   in   the

Assembly - is  a  Party call and the leader  of  the

Liberal-Socialists said that if we cannot do a job

we  should  quit, to which I replied  that  if  he

could  form  a  government I would  give  him  the

undertaking that I would quit. Will the leader  of

the  Liberal-Socialist Party  please  declare  his

Party's stand?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Answer, Answer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3250</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think

anybody  who  has undertaken to do a job  and  has

failed  to  do it should realise that himself.  It

needs  no prompting from any quarter. You  realise

what  you have done. You see the results. You know

what  you are heading for. And it is up to you  to

make your move. We in the Opposition are not going

to  put  up  suggestions  for  the  Government  to

consider.  Not  at all. We are in the  Opposition.

Our  duty  is to make sure that the Government  do

their  job, and if the Government do not do  their

job,  it  is  for us to criticise them,  to  bring

public opinion to bear on them, and make sure that

they justify the position they hold.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think we have had enough

of  irrelevancies  and, unless  any  hon.  Member

wishes to come back to the subject of the Ministry

of Local Government, Lands and Housing, Head 42, I

propose to put the Question now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I once thought this room was very cold,  but

now  it is so hot! What I am going to say is this:

one  thing  that Government can do to  ease  their

burden is to buy up land, cut it into small  lots,

and let the people build houses according to their

means. This is in support of what my colleague the

Member for Paya Lebar has said.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> There is just one small

matter,  Sir. I can give the Member for Queenstown

the  exact  figures in 1957. There will  be  under

construction  and completed in 1957 6,321  housing

units.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I mentioned last year that I am  one

of  the oldest Members in this House and also that

I  am not a firebrand. My point in taking part  in

this  debate  is to urge the Government  to  build

more  cheap houses in the rural areas, because  it

is  there that we can get cheaper land. One  thing

that  I  am  not happy about is that in the  rural

districts, when people want to build a house, they

have  to submit plans to the Rural Board and these

plans are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3251</b></font><br><br>



then  passed on to the S.I.T. for final approval,

and  then  the people have to build according  to

the  building regulations laid down for the  City

area.  I  suggest  to  the  Government  that  the

building  of rural dwellings need not follow  the

same regulations as for the City area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on one occasion I approached the Building

Surveyor's  Office  for  permission  to  build  a

mosque  about one mile away from the  main  road.

They  demanded the building plans. We  gave  them

the  plans.  They  then turned  round  and  said,

"Well, this matter has to go to the S.I.T." So  I

approached  the S.I.T. The Town Planning  Officer

told  me, "Mr Goh, I am very sorry. These  plans

cannot  be approved." I asked, "Why?" He replied,

"Mr  Goh,  you know very well you must  have  36

feet  of road reserve." I asked, "Why do you want

36  feet  of road reserve when the land does  not

belong  to the people who are going to build  the

mosque?  The mosque is not for living  purposes."

So  he said, "Mr Goh, suppose there happened  to

be  a fire. How could the Fire Brigade get to the

scene?" I said, "Why do you want to have 36  feet

of  road reserve just in front of the mosque?  Is

there no other place to get in? Where is the fire

hydrant  for  the Fire Brigade? Is it  not  utter

rubbish?"  One mile from the main road  and  they

must  still follow all the regulations laid  down

by the City Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I just do not know what to say. How can you expect poor people to build a house which

must   adhere   to  the  City  Council   building

regulations?



<br><br>11.15 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been to the Building Surveyor's

Office several times, and they make all sorts  of

trouble for the poor people. I am not blaming all

the  government departments, but I  suggest  that

the  Minister look into such matters,  especially

where they affect the poor. The overseer will not

go  to the rich people and worry them because  he

knows  such  people could get legal advice.  They

have  plenty of money. But in the case  of  these

poor  people, it has happened that some  of  them

have  been  served with a notice that  they  must

demolish their house in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3252</b></font><br><br>



14  days.  My God! The house may have  cost  them

$2,000  and it may have taken them five years  to

save  all that money. If a man builds a new house

without  a  plan, or a permit to do so,  and  the

Government gives notice that he must pull it down

within 14 days, that is some reason. But to  give

notice  to  pull down a house that is  not  newly

built - that is ridiculous. There was such a  case.

It  was  the  work  of  the  Building  Surveyor's

Office.  I approached the Chief Surveyor.   I  do

not  want to mention his name, because I  do  not

know  whether  it  is right or wrong.  If  it  is

right,  I  will mention it. I said, "Sir,"- and  I

called him "Sir" because he was a tuan besar - "you

have  asked  this  poor  man  to  pull  down  his

building  in 14 days. Why?" He replied, "Oh,  you

know,   this  man  put  up  a  building   without

submitting  a plan to the Chairman of  the  Rural

Board."  I said, "Do not be stupid. His house  is

not  a  new one. It is an old one." Then he said,

"The Cable and Wireless has written to us to  say

that it is a new building." So I said, "Because a

European officer has written to you, you are  now

frightened?" He replied, "But you do  not  follow

the  law." Then I said, "Send for the Inspector."

The  Inspector  came in. He said, "Mr  Goh,  you

must  not  trust your men." I said, "I  must  not

trust my men? What are you talking about? I  have

seen  the place myself. It is not a new building.

Why do you people cause the poor so much trouble?

What  have  you  done  for  the  poor?"  Then   I

challenged  him,  "Well,  tomorrow,  or  the  day

after, or any day, I will go with you to see  the

building, to find out whether it is a new one  or

an old one."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am a poor man. I was a

contractor once but I am now retired. I  have  no

car.  I had to hire a taxi to go to the house  in

question  because I stay about  two  miles  away.

When  we  reached it, the Inspector said,  "Well,

you  see that the floor has been newly rendered."

I  asked him, "You mean to say that rendering the

floor  will  make  this  house  a  new  building?

Suppose  the floor of your own house is  full  of

cracks,  will  you not render it?  Naturally  you

will.  You  do  not expect these poor  people  to

sleep on a cracked



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3253</b></font><br><br>



floor? Now that you are here," I continued,  "can

you  prove  that  this  is a  new  building?"  He

replied, "Oh, Mr Goh, you see those pillars? Are

they  not  new?" I said, "Yes, they are new."  He

then asked me, "You see this wall? Is it new?"  I

said,  "Yes,  it is new. Is there anything  more?

What  about the roof?" He said, "Mr Goh, it  has

been put up for over a year?" I told him, "I  was

born in an attap house and lived there till I got

married.  At that time I was 24. So I have  lived

in an attap house for 24 years. I am an expert on

attap dwellings." [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member has

given  the House a very interesting story, but  I

would  ask him, in view of the fact that we  have

only  until 11.30 a.m. for this item, to come  to

his point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I mention

all this because the Inspector might think me  to

be  a fool or a man living in a bungalow all  the

time  and  therefore do not know what  an  attap

house  is.  So he said, "Mr Goh, it is  now  one

year  since the roof was repaired?" I  said,  "You

mean to say that an attap roof lasts for only one

year - should it not last at least seven years?  It

is  now  one  year,  but you can  see  the  holes

through which the rain water will come down.  How

can you say this house is rebuilt? It is not.  To

rebuild  a house means you have to take down  the

roof,  pull  down everything and  put  up  a  new

building. That will require a lot of workmen." So

at  last  we came back to see the Chief  Building

Surveyor,  and he said, "All right, Mr  Goh,  we

know  it  is  not  rebuilt." Sir,  all  sorts  of

unnecessary trouble took place because the  Cable

and Wireless Manager happens to be a European, so

the  people in the Building Surveyor's Office are

scared. "Banyak takut!"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we the P.A.P. will support the

government when the government is right,  but  we

will   strike  when  the  Government   has   done

something wrong. But we know the difficulties  of

the  Government too. How much can you expect them

to  do?  To  build better houses  for  all  these

people? I just want



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3254</b></font><br><br>



to  urge the Government to build cheap houses for

the poor people in the rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I think, Mr Speaker, Sir, we all

welcome  this most helpful contribution from  the

Member  for Ponggol-Tampenis, a refreshing change

from  the  irrelevancies of the Liberal-Socialist

Party  and  the  inaccuracies of the  Independent

Member for Queenstown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to make one little point about the

remarks  of one of the more practical Members  of

the Liberal-Socialists, the hon. Member for Bukit

Panjang. He suggested that the Government  should

buy  up land and then cut it up into small  plots

and hand them out to people to build on them.  If

I  remember his words rightly, they are:  "houses

according to their means."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week I was asked to go to the house of a

widow.  Her husband, a hawker, had suddenly  died

and  she was left with an aged mother-in-law  and

six  young children, the youngest being only five

days  old. She was under notice to quit from  the

house  she was occupying. I am happy to say  that

the  company, which had acquired the  land  where

her house was and which proposed to evict her, is

taking  a  most generous view of her lot  and  is

prepared to give her a site for a new house free,

and she would also be getting some money from the

company towards the cost of a new building. But I

was  advised by a representative of that  company

that  the minimum amount she would need to  build

the  lowest quality of house for herself and  her

family would be at least $3,000, after getting  a

free  site.  Of  course, she had not  a  hope  of

getting  that money from her own resources.  Even

if  her husband had been alive, and living  as  a

hawker, I cannot imagine how he, with very  heavy

transport cost from his residence to his place of

work  in  the centre of the city where he  had  a

stall,  could  by  his own efforts  have  secured

$3,000  to  put up a house even if  he  had  been

given a free site.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore I am afraid that the hon. Member's

proposal  that the Government should simply  give

out  plots of land to all comers to build  houses

according to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3255</b></font><br><br>



their  means would mean that those who had  means

would get houses and those who really are in need

of  houses would not; and I think that suggestion

is one which the Party had better reconsider very

carefully  before  they put it  into  their  next

election programme, unless they wish to subsidise

the middle class and not to help the poor.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am much

obliged to the Minister for providing me with the

figure of 6,321 houses now under construction and

which  will be completed by the end of this year,

that is another 12 days. Is that correct?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> On a point of clarification,

Mr Speaker, Sir. I did not say that all would be

completed  in  1957. Some would be  completed  in

1957  and some in 1958, but all of them are under

construction in 1957.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I am much obliged, Mr

Speaker, Sir. Now out of this figure, I believe a

certain  percentage will be completed by the  end

of  this year. I wonder if the Minister will look

into  the  matter and give an assurance that  the

S.I.T. will commence allocation forthwith,  that

is  in  January 1958, and not wait until December

1958.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the whole

morning we have debated housing, and the fire was

all  concentrated on the S.I.T. who, I suppose, are

building  multi-storeyed  concrete  houses.  Sir,

there  is  one  most important point -  how  about

attap  houses? Many a time I have been approached

by  the poor farmers and fishermen. They have had

trouble   with   the   Rural   Board   Architects

Department  regarding the passing of their  plans

or the repair of their attap houses. Sir, I think

it is high time for the Government to consider  a

classification  of  the various  types  of  attap

houses  into  the $500, or $800,  or  $1,000,  or

$1,500 category. The Rural Board should also have

plans drawn up of all these types of attap houses

ready  for any farmer who can afford to pay $1.50

to  buy  a plan and build an attap house, instead

of having to engage a contractor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3256</b></font><br><br>



to draw up plans and the Rural Board architect to

take a long time to pass, them. Sir, I think this

is  another  way to solve the housing problem.  I

wish the Minister for Local Government, Lands  and

Housing would give me a reply to this suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are

many types of plans in the Rural Board which  are

for  sale to the public. They cost about a dollar

each.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I just wish to inform

the  Minister for Communications and  Works  that

the  resettlement houses at the 9th mile Tampenis

are now being built at $1,000 each.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Sir, I do not dispute the hon.

Member's figures at all; I was merely quoting the

figures  given to me by a private enterprise  man

who was concerned with resettling people when his

company  were  clearing land for development  and

were  resettling them elsewhere on  a  site  they

were providing. I quoted the figure which he gave

me,  which  is another private enterprise  figure

again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I wish the Minister would

inform me also whether it is still necessary  for

the  squatters to apply for permission to  repair

their attap roofs?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister  has not given me the assurance  that  I

called  for, that is, whether he will see  to  it

that  the  S.I.T. will  commence  allocation  of

houses in January 1958.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have to

repeat again that the allocation of S.I.T. houses

is not my responsibility. It is the

responsibility of the S.I.T.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $276,690 for Head 42 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3256</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 43 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 43 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3 therein.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3257</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subhead 3 refers to clearance and redevelopment

of  Crown reverted properties and I find  there

is an increase of $15,340 in the vote as compared

with that of last year. The reason given in  the

footnote says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Increase due to additional staff for the new Re-housing Section."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, would the Minister elaborate on his rehousing section and say why he requires the

additional staff to run that department?



<br><br>11.30 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

administration  of Crown reverted properties  was

handed  over  to the Singapore Improvement  Trust

from  1st  April,  1953 to 1955 and  the  average

annual  expenses charged by the  Trust  for  such

administration  for  this  period  was   $52,300.

Towards  the end of 1954 it was decided  that  it

would  be wasteful and uneconomical for the Trust

to  exercise elaborate management control of  the

whole  Crown  reverted properties.  Such  control

included   the  taking  of  a  complete   census,

maintaining rigid control against new occupation,

and effecting eventual clearance, including court

action  and  execution  of  warrants.  From   1st

January,  1955,  it was decided  that  the  Trust

should retain management of only certain reverted

houses  in  areas  scheduled  for  clearance  and

redevelopment  and  properties  declared  by  the

P.W.D. as  being  in a dangerous  condition  for

which   new   housing  would  be  required.   The

remainder of the properties would revert  to  the

management of the Land Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $35,340 represents the estimated cost

of   the   Trust  in  the  management   of   such

properties.   If  I  may  give  a   little   more

information,  Sir: there are approximately  2,500

families living on these properties and the rents

payable by them are $250,020 per annum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, am I

to take it that the additional staff required are

employed by Government and seconded to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3258</b></font><br><br>



S.I.T.,  because,  as  the Minister  himself  has

clearly  stated, it was decided sometime in  1953

to    hand    over    the   responsibility    for

administration  of Crown reverted  properties  to

the  S.I.T.?  I  may  also  point  out  that  the

expenditure during the period from 1953  to  1955

was  around $52,000. Why is now an additional sum

of $35,340 required?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Because there has been an

increase  of  Crown  reverted  properties  coming

under the jurisdiction of the Trust.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this

point is clear, but the Minister has not answered

my  first point - whether the officers employed  in

this  department  are,  in  fact,  government  employees  and seconded to the S.I.T.,  or  whether

they  are employed by the S.I.T. direct.  And  if

this is so, why should we bear the expenses then?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Because we are responsible

and we get revenue from the Crown reverted

properties. The S.I.T. are merely acting as our

agents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,482,340 for Head 43 ordered to

stand part of the Schedule.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3258</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 44-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,135,310 for Head 44

ordered to stand part of the Schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 45 -



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 45 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 7 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are extremely

perturbed  that thousands of students,  who  have

completed the primary stage of education, have no

facilities  for further education afforded  them.

If you look at the Development Estimates you will

find that there is provision for the building  of

66  primary  schools  as  against,  I  think,  19

secondary schools and one technical school, or 20

in  all.  Students who leave at  the  Primary  VI

stage  are virtually unemployable at that  stage.

They  have  that  little  learning  which  is   a

dangerous thing.  Only one out of three or four



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3259</b></font><br><br>



students in the present circumstances can  go  on

to  secondary education after the age of about 13

or  14.  To  put it in another way, in Government

schools alone, I think I am right in saying  that

at  the present time 2,000 to 3,000 children  out

of  6.000 have to be turned out into the streets,

as  it  were, each year with little prospects  of

further  education  of any practical  value,  and

therefore of getting a job. As the Minister  must

know,  there are thousands of worried parents  in

Singapore  today whose children  have  just  been

refused promotion to secondary schools next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the ways to combat this very

alarming   situation  is  to  institute   evening

classes  on  a much larger and more comprehensive

scale than is being done at present. Such classes

as  have  been organised seem to us to be totally

inadequate   and   are  not  of  lasting   enough

duration - they  last  only  an  hour  or  so  each

evening - and  therefore  we  consider  that   this

increase  of only $20,000 under this  subhead  is

insufficient. It means that the Minister  is  not

getting  sufficiently  to  grips  with   a   very

alarming situation. Sir, we do ask what is  being

done and is going to be done to tackle this state

of affairs. An unemployable student after Primary

VI  is  virtually told that he cannot be  catered

for. As each school year comes to an end, year by

year this problem becomes more and more acute and

more  and  more  vital for  the  future  of  this

country.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it

is  not true to say that the Government have  not

provided adequate facilities for children who are

not   found   fit  to  profit  from  a  secondary

education.  The evening classes as they  are  now

cater, I think, for all such children, but it may

be  a  surprise to the House to learn  that  they

have  not made full use of these evening classes.

We  have vacancies this year and this shows  that

some  parents are not sending their  children  to

the   evening   classes  which  Government   have

instituted.  In  spite of that,  Government  have

increased this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3260</b></font><br><br>



vote to $360,000, as we are going to increase the

number of evening classes to cater for those  who

need  them. It is also not true to say that  only

one  out  of four pupils gets into the  secondary

school.  We  will be promoting to  the  secondary

level next year slightly over 60 per cent of  all

those   who  have  sat  for  the  Primary  common

examination this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening classes we are giving education

in   subjects   which  will  make  these   pupils

employable, but if they do not want to  make  use

of  these facilities, I cannot go to their  homes

and  force them to do so. It is up to the parents

and  the  children to make use of the  facilities

that are offered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our estimate for next year for these evening

classes is slightly over $390,000, but in view of

the  fact  that the facilities offered this  year

have  not  been  fully taken  up,  we  have  only

provided  for $360,000; but if the  need  arises

that  more money should be found, I will have  no

hesitation  in coming to this House  to  ask  for

more  money  to  run  these evening  classes.  In

addition, I would also like to say that there  is

a   grant  to  the  Adult  Education  Council  of

$500,000   which  will  provide  some   sort   of

education for those who seek it.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am certainly

surprised to hear that these evening classes  are

not  being taken up as perhaps they should be.  I

wonder  what the reason for it could  be.  Is  it

that  they  are  not sufficiently attractive  for

some  reason  or  other and that they  should  be

advertised?  Or are they in certain  areas  which

may  be too far away for some of the students  to

get  there  inexpensively? As  the  Minister  has

mentioned, unless there are alternatives for this

40 per cent who hope to get further education, it

does   seem  to  me  that  something  should   be

done - maybe a drive of some kind to make it  clear

to  the students that they will be given a chance

of  further  education. There must  be  something

wrong somewhere which needs looking into.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I am glad that the hon.

Member for Tanglin has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3261</b></font><br><br>



brought  up the point. I really do not  know  the

reason  why all the places in the evening classes

are  not being taken up. Sufficient publicity has

been  given  to these evening classes  which  are

housed  in  strategic centres. For  instance,  we

have them at Outram Road, Siglap and Beatty Road.

They  are  all scattered about in order to  cater

for people coming from the rural areas. Frankly I

do  not  know the reason why they have  not  been

taken  up, but we will do our best to tell  these

people  that the education provided  for  in  the

evening   classes  will  make   them   at   least

employable.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Lim, Sir, it is indeed a

surprise  to hear the Minister for Education  say

that  there  is  no  shortage of  facilities  for

secondary  education,  but  to  me  the   biggest

surprise   is  the  news  that  there  are   many

vacancies in the evening classes. Sir,  I  wonder

if  everyone who follows local news closely knows

that  Mr  Yap Pheng Geck, a well-known community

leader, has concerned himself very much with this

problem  of  secondary education, especially  the

over-age   students.   I   wonder   whether   the

Government  have ever tried to inform the  public

that  they are providing adequate facilities  for

these  over-age  students. I also wonder  whether

these evening classes provide the same curriculum

as  in the daily schools and what is the position

regarding    the    fees   and   the    teachers'

qualifications. I wish the Government would  make

it  clear  to the public that there are  adequate

facilities for secondary education. I  also  wish

the  Government to make a statement regarding Mr

Yap  Pheng  Geck's proposal to form a  subsidiary

educational body.



<br><br>11.45 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on

Friday  last I said in this House that I welcomed

the  efforts made by community leaders  like  Mr

Yap  Pheng Geck and others who are trying to help

solve   the   education  problem   and   I   have

instructed the officers in my Ministry  to  give

all assistance they can to such voluntary bodies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3262</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I want to stress to the hon. Member for

Changi  that education in the evening classes  is

not  secondary  education. These evening  classes

are for those who have been found unfit to profit

from   a   secondary  education.  Therefore   the

subjects given in these evening classes  will  be

of  a  commercial nature to make them employable.

No  country can provide a secondary education for

every  child who wants it. If this were  done  in

Singapore,  it would cost more than $100  million

to   provide   every  child  with   a   secondary

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to inform the Member for Changi that

the   teachers   in  the  evening   classes   are

qualified.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, in view of the

explanation given by the Minister, I beg leave to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 45 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 33 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to make this quite brief as I have a

further  amendment  to move shortly.  I  wish  to

enquire  the  reason for the reduction  of  about

$300,000 in this vote to provide for the teaching

of  English to Malay school pupils. The reason as

given in the footnote says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Decrease due to reduction in the number of

hours for teaching English."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I should have thought that, if anything, the

vote  should have been increased. Malay  students

in  increasing numbers are, I think,  anxious  to

gain  entry  to secondary schools and  to  higher

education. There may be some other reason for the

reduction of which we are unaware, and  we  would

like to have an explanation from the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

main  reason for the "reduction" is actually  the

absorption   of  temporary  teachers   into   the

Pensionable  Establishment, thereby  incurring  a

transfer  of the emoluments of these teachers  to

another  head.  There  is actually  no  reduction

whatsoever.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3263</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg leave to

withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 45 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (1) of  subhead

52 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My intention in moving this amendment is to

obtain  from  the Minister what, so far  as  I  am

aware,  has never been disclosed, and that is  the

Government's intention in this first venture -  and

a welcome venture it is - as patron of the arts. One

of  the  most exciting things in modern  Singapore

has   been  the  spontaneous  growth  of  cultural

societies - the   Arts  Society,  the   Photographic

Society (to mention but two) which are post-war in

origin, and perhaps I might mention in all modesty

the  Singapore Musical Society, which is 55  years

old  and with which I have been actively connected

for  many years, particularly now that it is being

malayanised,  so  to  speak, by  the  return  from

overseas  of many talented and well-trained  young

people.  The  other societies are, of course,  the

China  Society,  the Indian Fine Arts  Association

and so on. At the same time, a group of about nine

of the leading cultural societies, including those

I  have  mentioned,  have  now  banded  themselves

together as members of the Singapore Arts  Council

which  is planning, among other things, a Festival

of the Arts to take place very soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question arises: What are going to be

the  duties and functions of this Grade G Cultural

Affairs  Officer, and how is the grant of $100,000

for the promotion of cultural matters going to  be

spent?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

must  apologise  for not having  publicised  fully

enough this new department in my Ministry when  it

was  decided to set it up. I am glad that the hon.

Member  for  Tanglin brought it up so that  I  can

make use of this opportunity to do so,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3264</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of the Singapore Cultural Advisory

Council  is to co-ordinate and assist the  various

cultures  represented in this colony  and  develop

these cultures along the right lines. In the past,

it  has  been  known that a number  of  worthwhile

projects  in the arts had to be abandoned  because

voluntary  bodies  which wanted to  sponsor  these

projects  had  to give up because of nothing  else

but lack of funds. Government have therefore given

the  task of co-ordinating cultural activities  in

Singapore to the Ministry of Education. In  future

the  Singapore  Cultural Advisory  Council  will,

firstly, consider and make recommendations to  the

Minister  on  cultural  matters  with  a  view  to

providing  a  stimulus to the development  of  the

various   cultures   represented   in   Singapore;

secondly, to  co-ordinate and  encourage  private

efforts in any field of the arts; and thirdly,  to

educate the ordinary citizen towards a more active

appreciation of the arts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The composition of the Cultural Advisory Council

will be the Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of

Education  as  ex-officio Chairman.  I  intend  to

appoint  a Vice-Chairman and he will of course  be

elected  from  among the members of  the  Council.

They will be the Director of Information Services,

the  Director of Raffles Museum, the  Director  of

Broadcasting,  the  Director of  Raffles  National

Library,  four  nominees from the  Singapore  Arts

Council, one representative from the University of

Malaya,   one  representative  from  the   Nanyang

University,  and  the Chairman  of  the  Singapore

Council  for Adult Education. The Cultural Affairs

Officer will, of course, be the Secretary to  this

Cultural Advisory Council. I intend to make  these

members  hold office for two years, or any  lesser

period as the Minister may direct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the duties of this Cultural Affairs Officer.

He  will  be  the Chief Executive Officer  in  the

Ministry  dealing  with  fine  arts  and  cultural

relations. As I have mentioned earlier, he will  be

the Secretary of the Cultural Advisory Council and

will  also  deal with all cultural matters  on  an

international level. Because of the scope  of  his

duties, this officer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3265</b></font><br><br>



should  have a sufficient status. That is why  we

intend  to appoint a superscale G officer because

we  expect him to deal with international  bodies

and  to  be  able to co-ordinate all the  private

efforts that are floating about in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of a block grant of $100,000 is

subject  to the sanction of the Treasury.  It  is

difficult  to estimate now exactly how much  will

be  spent  on matters relating to fine  arts  and

cultural  relations, because this is an  entirely

new  field. We have no precedents to guide us  in

this  matter. However, the system of working will

be that the Cultural Advisory Council will advise

the  Minister from time to time on how this money

should  be  spent.  If there is any  organisation

that  has a worth-while project relating to  fine

arts  or  culture, but which has not been carried

out  for  lack  of funds, it can  apply  to  this

Cultural Advisory Council for consideration of  a

grant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also hoped that expenses for meeting the

reception  of cultural missions from abroad  will

come from this block grant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only an experiment, as I say, and it is

to be undertaken after very careful consideration

of  how  to  co-ordinate and channel  the  various

cultural  activities in Singapore in  the  proper

direction. For this reason, the Cultural Advisory

Council  is  to  consist  of  as  many  interests

representing  the  various  cultural  bodies   in

Singapore as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I only rise, Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  to  correct one very small point  from  the

Member  for Tanglin's remarks. He said  that  the

Arts  Society was post-war in origin. It is  true

that the Arts Society itself came into being post-war, but it was developed from a seed which  was

sown back in 1936 and nourished through the years

thereafter - the Inter-School Art Exhibitions.  The

present  Chairman  of the Arts  Society  was,  in

fact,  originally a school-boy who won prizes  in

these Exhibitions. He went on to organising  them

and  is  now an admirable Chairman for  the  Arts

Society; just as the former Secretary of the Arts

Society   was   also  a  schoolboy   who   became

interested in arts and continued his interest for

many years and helped to lay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3266</b></font><br><br>



the  foundation. I only want to  give  credit  to

those  who did the work before the war from which

the Arts Society finally emerged post-war.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> I thank the Minister for Communications

and Works for correcting me. I would not want  to

be  wrong on a point like that. I would  like  to

say  how  much  we welcome the statement  of  the

Minister for Education, and I do hope that  there

will be no voices raised that $155,300 should not

be  spent  next year. There might be  people  who

say, "Who wants difficult plays or ballets or art

exhibitions  or  expensive  additions  to  museum

collections?" The answers to objections  of  this

sort,  I  feel,  never vary. The  lives  of  most

people are badly in need of illumination. One  of

the  ways  in  which this can be achieved  is  by

showing  as  fully as possible what can  be  done

when  the imagination of our multiracial  country

is  stirred. The scientist benefits from this  as

much as the artist, and the shopkeeper as much as

the aesthete.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A feeling of quality is indispensable in a

competitive world, and quality in one field  soon

gives a taste for quality in another. Money spent

on   promoting  this  taste  is  well  spent  and

encouragement of this kind should come  from  the

state. I would plead, however, that there must be

continuity  in  a  project of  this  kind.  Money

granted  one year and withdrawn the next will  be

money wasted. If a cultural project or a cultural

society  is to thrive and produce results,  there

must  be  the  confidence that  finance  will  be

forthcoming  for  more than a year,  or  it  will

wither  and  die  and the grant  will  have  been

thrown   away.  Nevertheless,  this  Government's

recognition  of  the importance of  the  arts  is

greatly  to  be welcomed, as I have said.  All  I

would  plead  is  that there should  be  as  much

imagination  put into the administration  of  the

$100,000  grant as has been put into the creation

of  it.  The words "Subject to Treasury sanction"

in  the  margin  have an ominous ring,  as  if  a

painting   might  be  equated  in  value   to   a

typewriter or a symphony to "filing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3267</b></font><br><br>



cabinets,  two."  I  make this  point  because  a

previous  imaginative project was ruined  by  the

ineptitude of the Department of Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four professional musicians, each an expert in

their   instruments,  were  engaged   on   3-year

contracts  a  few  years ago  to  play  in  Radio

Malaya's Orchestra and to teach their instruments

to pupils in the schools. They arrived and played

in  the Orchestra, but were unfortunately ignored

by  the  Education Department for a  considerable

period  of  time,  because  nobody  got  down  to

arranging  the teaching periods, and  when  these

were  finally  arranged,  it  was  realised  that

instruments such as bassoons and oboes, horns and

so  on  cost  money and there was no  grant  from

which to buy such instruments on which the pupils

could  play and practise. So after two years  the

musicians  had  their  contracts  terminated  and

hardly  a  single student had learnt  to  blow  a

note.



<br><br>12 Noon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only mention this because I do feel that one

has to be very careful, through this new Advisory

Council, to see that this amount is imaginatively

administered.  With  that  there  must   be   the

realisation  that results cannot appear  at  once

but   will   only  come  through   patience   and

persistence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I am sure the House

will  join me in extending hearty congratulations

to  the Minister for Education, but I would  also

like to remind the House that he is very lucky to

have  a  most cultural-minded Permanent Secretary

who  will  be  taking  a great  interest  in  the

creation of this new department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House has heard the speech delivered by the

hon.  Member  for Tanglin, but I  would  like  to

point  out that this department is not only going

simply  to  promote culture. Culture  in  certain

people's  minds  or in some other  place  may  be

regarded  as  a  luxurious hobby.  But  Singapore

today is much in need of this department, because

we are faced with the possibility of racial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3268</b></font><br><br>



conflicts, which is especially very obvious  when

we  merge with the Federation of Malaya. Who  can

solve this problem? Who can meet this danger? And

by  what method? I am sure this Cultural Advisory

Council  should  take  full  responsibility   for

solving   this   problem.  Unless   we   have   a

unification  of all the cultural streams  of  our

own people, we cannot escape the danger that will

arise - cultural conflict and racial conflict. So I

sincerely wish this new department will carry  on

with   the  job  of  bringing  together   Chinese

culture,  Indian culture, European  culture,  and

Malay  culture,  help  them  to  understand   and

appreciate one another to their mutual interests,

and unify these four cultures into a true Malayan

culture  with loyalty towards a Malayan  culture.

The   responsibility  of  the  Cultural  Advisory

Council  is  very great. The unification  of  the

various cultures into a true Malayan culture  can

be  termed  as  a  political  necessity  of  this

department.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I just want to make one or

two  further points. I can assure the hon. Member

for Tanglin that the phrase, "Subject to Treasury

sanction" does not have an ominous ring at all. I

think  I  can  speak for the Hon. the  Financial

Secretary when I say that it is only designed  as

a  check to see that money will not go down  the

drain and produce no results. We want every grant

that  is made to be scrutinised and it will  only

go   to  the  Treasury  for  sanction  after  the

Cultural  Advisory Council has fully  considered

the  matter  and  after I have satisfied  myself

that it is proper to give it. In this connection,

an  application for assistance has actually  been

received  from the Singapore Arts Council,  which

is  planning a Festival of the Arts, in order  to

enable  it  to carry out its plan. The Government

have  considered  that such a Festival  of  Arts,

depicting  the arts and cultures of  the  various

races  in Singapore, is one which should  receive

support. It is thought that $20,000 might  be  an

adequate  sum for the Singapore Arts Council  and

it  might  well  come from this  block  grant  of

$100,000. Of course, we have to look



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3269</b></font><br><br>



into  the merits of each case. I can also  assure

the  hon. Member for Tanglin that whatever grants

made will, if found necessary, be continuous  and

not just abandoned halfway.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if I may

correct  the  Minister on one  small  point.  The

$20,000  which he has mentioned has already  been

sanctioned by this House under the previous head,

Contributions and Charitable Allowances. That  is

an entirely separate head from the $100,000 under

discussion at the moment. However, I do not  want

to  labour that point. I would like to say  that,

in  moving the reduction of $10, I was only using

the  time-honoured  method of procedure  in  this

House.  I would now like to beg leave to withdraw

my amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon.

Member for Tanglin is of course quite right  when

he  says that we have already included the sum of

$20,000 for the Singapore Arts Council under Head

25, Contributions and Charitable Allowances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 45 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 53 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this item "Miscellaneous" $4,000 is

required  for  next  year,  but  in  the   column

"Approved Estimates 1957" I see a blank. There is

no    money   provided   there   for   the   item

"Miscellaneous".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provision of $4,000 as a block vote is

most   undesirable.   I   would   not   mind    a

miscellaneous item of $500 or $1,000, but a block

vote  of $4,000 may be subject to misuse.  It  so

happens  that this item is "Subject  to  Treasury

sanction".  The Minister has, however,  explained

that  every  detail will have to  be  scrutinised

before  money is granted. Whatever it may  be,  a

block  vote  has  been given and  it  is  at  the

pleasure  of  the  Ministry to spend  at  random,

though  the  details may be scrutinised.  Sir,  I

would like to have a breakdown of this block vote

of  $4,000 because, as I have said, it covers too

wide a scope. Going



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3270</b></font><br><br>



through  the  Budget, I find that in  most  other

Ministries  there  is also a miscellaneous  item,

but  under  that item, the vote provided  for  is

only between $500 and $1,200. I feel there should

be  a breakdown of this $4,000 and if there is  a

balance  after  the breakdown,  it  can  then  be

provided for under this miscellaneous item.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, in answer to the question of the

hon.  Member,  nothing is  shown  in  the  column

"Approved  Estimates 1957" because the department

was  not in existence in 1957. The sum of  $4,000

shown  in the column "Estimated 1958" is a  block

vote   to   cover  such  matters  as  stationery,

purchase    of   publications,   transport    and

travelling,    and    maintenance    of    office

equipment - in  fact, all the items which  normally

appear under the head "Administration Charges" of

a  department. We have entered the block vote  in

the  Estimates this year because it is impossible

at the moment, in advance of the operation of the

department, to say what precisely it  will  spend

under   these  various  items  of  administration

expenses.  For  that reason, we  have  entered  a

block  vote  of  $4,000  which  should  give  the

department,  and the Treasury which controls  the

vote, sufficient latitude to enable it to operate

efficiently next year. In 1959, Sir, we  will  of

course  have  had some experience of  expenditure

and in the Estimates for that year we will detail

the  administration expenses, as is customary  in

the  case  of  other departments at  the  present

time.  I  hope  that  the  hon.  Member  will  be

satisfied with the explanation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on

the explanation given by the Financial Secretary,

I  am  happy  that  in  next year's  estimates  a

breakdown of the vote will be shown. May  I  have

the  permission  of  the  House  to  withdraw  my

amendment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $65,220,520 for Head 45 stand

part of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

after  talking  about the fine arts  of  life.  I

think we must come down



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3271</b></font><br><br>



to  the  hard facts. There is about two or  three

minutes left and I think I will have to put  over

our grievances in the form of short questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we find that children living in one area

are  unable to go to the school nearest to  their

homes.  In  many cases, they have to travel  long

distances. In many cases, too, you will find that

one brother may be in one school, another brother

in a different school, and a sister may go to yet

another different school. It all boils down to  a

great  loss  of time, much inconvenience  to  the

people  concerned, congestion of traffic,  and  a

waste of money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point, Sir, there is a dearth of

technical training for secondary schools. Many of

our   youths  are  able  to  benefit  from   such

teaching,  but  because  of  limited  space   and

limited  facilities for training,  many  of  them

have  to forgo technical training. Some fortunate

youths with rich parents may find that they  will

be able to get such training overseas, but by and

large  it  leaves us with a lot of good  material

that   is   not  being  made  use  of.  In   such

circumstances,  would  the  Government  think  of

increasing the teaching of technical subjects  in

all schools?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point, Sir. The University of Malaya

came into being after the war. Before the war, it

was  a college, a much smaller one. We find  that

there  is a limited take-in by the University  of

students  who  want to join it.  There  are  many

capable people, hard-working people, people  with

initiative,  who would like to have a  university

education. The Singapore Polytechnic is no  doubt

coming   up.   But   would  Government   consider

assisting the University of Malaya in order  that

it  might give evening classes based on the lines

of  the London University so that it could  grant

degrees in that way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, we have vernacular education each

heading  its  own  way. We want  to  cultivate  a

Singapore  loyalty. What would Government  do  in

such circumstances?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3272</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $65,220,520 for Head 45 ordered to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 49-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 49 be

reduced by $29,990 in respect of item (1) of

subhead 1 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I moved the same amendment last year,

the  Minister promised me that he would look into

the  matter. May I quote his remarks which appear

in column 983 of Hansard, Volume 2:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reason why this vote remains in the

Estimates  is  because I am not so sure  what  is

going  to transpire in February. As hon.  Members

know,  if  this time we go again and  we  do  not

succeed  in our mission. Singapore will  have  to

find a new Minister for Labour and Welfare."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, since February 1957 up till now nothing

actually has transpired. Everything is as what it

was and I think that this appointment should have

been  filled  by  now. This post today  is  still

vacant and I cannot see why it should remain  so.

The Assistant Minister for Labour and Welfare has

been  in  office, I think, for roughly two  years

and  by  now  he  should be fully  qualified  and

experienced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3273</b></font><br><br>



to be promoted as Minister for Labour and Welfare.

I  am  quite  sure  that in  the  absence  of  the

Minister himself from that Ministry, the Assistant

Minister  has  been handling all  the  ministerial

work.  Sir,  if  the  Minister  can  give  me   an

assurance  that this post will be filled,  then  I

will allow that $30,000 vote to go through because

it  serves no purpose to have a vote of $30,000 in

the  Budget  and nothing coming out  of  it.  That

money is shown as a sum carried over from the  old

Budget  and I believe that is the reason why  this

sum  again appears in this year's Estimates. I  am

against this, Sir, but I am not trying to take the

whole vote away. The purpose of my amendment is to

allow  a  token vote so that in case the  Minister

feels that the Assistant Minister is really fit to

be  promoted, then he may come back here  and  ask

for  a  vote  of  $29,990 to make up  the  sum  of

$30,000 as salary to the Assistant Minister.  Sir,

if  the  Minister for Labour and Welfare gives  me

that assurance, I may withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I

reply  to  the  points raised by  the  Member  for

Queenstown, may I seek clarification  on  what  he

means  by  an assurance. Does he want an assurance

from  me that there shall be a Minister for Labour

and Welfare?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is

exactly  what I mean; not the same Chief  Minister

or    another    Chief   Minister   holding    two

appointments. As clearly stated in his last year's

speech,  the Chief Minister does not draw  a  dual

salary. So why then have the $30,000 vote  in  the

Estimates?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the vote of $30,000 for

the  salary for a Minister for Labour and  Welfare

is  there not because that vote can be used by me.

I  have  to explain again that I do not get double

salary  but from the debate this morning the  hon.

Member  may  feel that there might be a  different

Minister  for Labour and Welfare. So  I  think  it

would be advisable to let that vote remain in  the

Estimates.  Moreover, the general  elections  have

been planned to take place in September next year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3274</b></font><br><br>



So  by then, I think there will be a Minister  for

Labour  and  Welfare. I do not know  whether  that

Minister for Labour and Welfare will want to  take

another  Ministry  but just for that  eventuality,

the vote is there. To reduce it by $29,990 is just

negligible.  It is so immaterial in a  deficit  of

about $8 million.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe

that  the  Hon. the Chief Minister is anticipating

that  after  the  general elections  the  Liberal-Socialists  will take over the Government  as  has

been challenged this morning and that by then  the

$30,000 will be required but for a matter of  only

three months. As I said, I am not taking the whole

vote away. I am still leaving a $10 token vote  in

but  in  case the Liberal-Socialists do come  into

power  by September next year, they can very  well

come   back  to  this  Assembly  and  ask  for   a

supplementary  vote  to cover  the  three  months'

salary of the Minister for Labour and Welfare.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> I do not know whether the hon.

Member  is speaking for the Liberal-Socialists.  I

say that there will be a new Government. I did not

say  that the Liberal-Socialists will be the  next

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $427,760 for Head 49 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad

that  there  has  been a vast improvement  in  the

labour situation this year. There has also been an

improvement  as  regards the strike  situation.  I

notice  that  the number of strikes this  year  is

very  much less than that of last year. The strike

situation has improved quite a lot but one thing I

am  quite  sure,  Sir, is that the Government  was

only prepared to deal with labour strikes and I do

not  think  that  the Government ever  anticipated

that  there would be hunger strikes. So Government

therefore   was   not   prepared   for   such   an

eventuality.  I  quote, Sir, this  instance  of  a

hunger strike. I went



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3275</b></font><br><br>



to  the Singapore Harbour Board Association  last

night  and  there I found about 200 employees  of

the Singapore Harbour Board on a hunger strike. I

was  there  at  about 10.00 p.m. and  I  remained

there  until  11.45 p.m. I understand  that  this

hunger strike started on Monday, 16th December at

8  p.m. and  when I arrived at the Association's

premises at 10.00 p.m. last night I was told that

about  nine of the hunger-strikers had  collapsed

and  had  been sent to hospital. From 10.00  p.m.

(the  time of my arrival) until about 11.45  p.m.

when  I left there were another three to four  of

the   hunger-strikers  who   collapsed   and   I

accompanied them to hospital. I believe  that  by

this  morning there may be a few more such cases.

When I arrived here this morning, I was told that

the  total number that collapsed from last  night

till  this  morning was 13. Out  of  this  13,  I

understand  that  10  have not  returned  to  the

Association's premises. They may or may not be in

hospital  now. I do not know. What has Government

done  about  this  hunger  strike,  or  what   is

Government going to do about this hunger  strike?

Have  they taken the trouble to investigate  into

this hunger strike? I understand that this hunger

strike is due to the refusal of the Harbour Board

to  accept the reinstatement of the employees  as

was  recommended by the report of  the  Court  of

Inquiry.  May I, Sir, with your permission  quote

paragraph 9 (5) from that report which appears in

Sessional Paper No. S 7 of 1957:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There may be a number of former employees of

the  Board still awaiting re-engagement. They may

have  been dismissed by the Board during  the  go

slow  and their place taken by new personnel.  We

feel  that  these men should not be too  severely

treated  for  following  an  industrial  practice

recognised  where trade unionism is in operation.

The  go  slow was a general movement and the  men

followed  the instructions of their  Union.  They

have  already  suffered  a  loss  of  wages   and

overtime benefits. However, the Port is again  in

full operation and for the promotion of improved

industrial relations, we are of the opinion  that

it  is  desirable  that any such  men  should  be

speedily  re-employed  as  the  Board  will  find

possible. We do not think that it would  be  very

difficult - at least



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3276</b></font><br><br>



not as difficult as it was submitted to us during

the  proceedings - to  convince  serangs  that  they

should  take back their former gang members,  and

to re-engage the remaining M.E. personnel."



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Court of Inquiry recommended that they

should  be  taken back as "speedily" as possible,

as  quoted in its report. This report,  Sir,  was

tabled  before  this Assembly on  6th  September,

1957.  Three  and a half months have  passed  and

Government has not stepped in to find whether the

Board has actually reinstated these employees  or

not.  If  the Government had done so, I am  quite

sure that these employees would not have gone  on

a  hunger  strike. Since the Government  did  not

take  the  trouble to do so, and since the  Board

refused  to reinstate them as was recommended  in

the  report,  there was no other alternative  for

these men but to go on a hunger strike. There  is

no more question of a strike because they are not

employed now. So to show their protest, they  had

to  go  on  a hunger strike. This is one  of  the

legitimate  weapons of trade unionists.  So  they

have  resorted to the legitimate weapon of  trade

unionism  and  they are now on a  hunger  strike.

Sir,  if  they  have no work now, what  else  can

these  men  do? Can they support their  families?

Their  families have to go hungry  because  there

are  no wages and there is nothing at all  to  be

brought  home to feed their families. The  report

says  that  they  have  already  lost  wages  and

overtime  benefits. Sir, is the Government  fully

aware  of  all  this? Why has the Government  not

stepped in again? Is the Government going to wait

until some death occurs before it will step in? I

understand, Sir, that there was also a strike  in

the  Singapore Harbour Board in 1955 and at  that

time the then Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall)

put  heavy pressure on the Harbour Board and  all

the strikers were reinstated. This, I understand,

is  quite  reliable and at that time I think  the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar,  the  leader  of  the

P.A.P., was also interested and assisted in  some

way  or  other to get them reinstated. I  believe

that the present Chief Minister could also do the

same thing and if he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3277</b></font><br><br>



were  to do so he would be fully justified because

he  is  only accepting the recommendations of  the

Court  of Inquiry. He would be fully justified  to

put  heavy  pressure on the Harbour Board  to  see

that all these men are reinstated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said, quite a number of the strikers

have  collapsed and I do not know whether  any  of

them  will die through hunger. If any one dies,  I

will put the responsibility on the Government  and

on the Singapore Harbour Board. I suggest that the

Government should step in rightaway to  see  that

they  are reinstated and the hunger strike  called

off. Both employers and employees were prepared to

submit their case to a Court of Inquiry and  since

the  recommendations  have  been  published,  both

parties should honour those recommendations rather

than have the position where one party is prepared

to  honour them and another party is not  prepared

to do so. In order that lives may be saved, may  I

then,  Sir,  ask the Government to take  immediate

action  and step in to intervene in this  case  so

that we will have an end to the hunger strike  and

the men reinstated?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are now

on   Head  49 - Ministry  for  Labour  and  Welfare.

Firstly,  on the subject of welfare activities,  I

would  like to congratulate the Government on  the

improvements we have witnessed since last year but

there  are  still many suggestions and  criticisms

put  forward  by hon. Members of this House  which

have  not been carried out or met. One of them  is

the   decentralisation  of   social   centres   in

connection with public relief distribution. Sir, I

mentioned last year the case of a poor man  living

in the island of Pulau Tekong who asked for public

assistance. The sum was about $5 or $10 and he was

asked  to  travel a distance of over ten miles  to

the  Social  Welfare Department  to  receive  this

allowance.  Sir, I think that is quite  ridiculous

because the whole of the allowance would be  spent

on  transport. Therefore I wish the Government  to

take note of this point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3278</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, secondly, on the labour situation, all of

us  have  been very pleased to witness a stability

in  the labour affairs of this colony with no more

labour  unrest and riots but I am still  not  very

happy  about  the  so-called stability  of  labour

relations  between  employer  and  employee.   The

position  is still not very firm. One thing  which

we  witness is that many trade unions seem to rely

upon  the  advice of politicians or men  from  the

legal   profession   in  connection   with   their

activities. Sir, I think that is a great  mistake.

I think that trade unions should invite economists

to  advise  them in their activities  rather  than

politicians. May I put forward to the Government a

suggestion  whether they would consider sponsoring

a  training  class  for union leaders?  There  are

economists  now  available in  the  University  of

Malaya  and  in  the Nanyang University  who  know

exactly the economic position in Singapore. It  is

time  that  all  workers and their  union  leaders

should   realise  that  a  one-sided  demand   for

increased   wages  would  not  be  beneficial   if

industrial output is not increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I wish to endorse the statement made by

the Member for Queenstown about the hunger strike

in  the  Singapore Harbour Board. Sir, it happened

that I was there at about 9.00 p.m. last night and

I  spent  until  1  o'clock this  morning  in  the

General  Hospital.  The latest report  I  received

from  a clerk in the hospital (Mr Chew) was  that

the   eleven  workers  sent  by  the   union   for

observation  and  treatment  were  discharged   as

outdoor  patients. Sir, I learned from  the  Union

Secretary,  Mr Jamit Singh, who also  accompanied

me  to the hospital to look into the plight of the

workers  who collapsed, that the Singapore Harbour

Board  is totally ignoring the recommendations  of

the  Court of Inquiry which was appointed  by  the

Government. I wonder how it is possible  that  the

Government can allow a semi-government  body  like

the   Singapore  Harbour  Board  to  ignore   the

recommendations   of   the   Court   of   Inquiry.

Repercussions will result, Sir. In future  if  the

setting up of a Court of Inquiry is suggested, the

union will say, "Six months after the recommendations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3279</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Court of Inquiry  into  the  trade

dispute  at the Singapore Harbour Board have  been

published,  yet  they have not been  implemented."

Sir, the attitude of this semi-government body  is

most  regrettable and the Government's neglect  of

duty is also most regrettable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to support the Member for Queenstown

and  would  ask  the Government to take  immediate

steps to call off the hunger strike. I would  like

an  official  statement from  Government  in  this

House on this question.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall

reply  to  the various points raised  by  the  two

previous speakers but the most important one  they

raised was in regard to the hunger strike - as  they

call  it - that  is  taking place in  the  Singapore

Harbour Board Staff Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my sympathies go out to these hunger-strikers. My sympathies as a trade unionist too go

out  to these people and as a trade unionist I  am

indeed  sorry  that they should have been  foolish

enough to follow evil advice from people who claim

to be trade union leaders.

interested   myself  in  trying  to  bring   about

industrial peace, in the settlement of strikes and

in  the prevention of strikes and every time being

a conciliator, I have avoided taking sides. Today,

I  am  indeed  in  a very unhappy position  to  be

forced  in  this  Assembly to say something  which

will be against, shall I say, my line of action in

that  I  should not try to defend one side against

the  other  side or to decry the misdeeds  of  one

side  so that the other side can take courage  and

go ahead and do some further damage.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a Court of Inquiry was set up. A report was

submitted, and in regard to this particular  group

of  workers, the Member for Queenstown has read to

us the relevant paragraph. What has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3280</b></font><br><br>



recommended, Sir, by the Court of Inquiry is this,

and these are the words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are of the opinion that it is desirable that

any such men should be speedily reemployed."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to what my Ministry knows and what I

personally  know,  the  Singapore  Harbour   Board

attempted  to  implement this recommendation.  The

Singapore  Harbour Board wrote  to  all  employees

concerned  asking  them to report  to  the  Labour

Office;  the  Singapore Harbour Board  would  then

consider reemploying them. Some went - I do not know

how  many  because  I  do  not  have  the  figures

available  to  me  here - and  when  they  went,  of

course,  they were asked by the Singapore  Harbour

Board  labour officer certain questions. The trade

unionists,  I understand, took umbrage  that  such

questions  should have been asked.  The  Singapore

Harbour Board, when questioned by me, told me that

surely they had a right to ask an employee or even

an  ex-employee who had been going on a "go  slow"

for so long and causing so much economic damage to

the   country  whether  he  would  work  and  work

properly for the Singapore Harbour Board. It would

appear  that the workers resented that; that  they

should not be told that they should work and  work

properly  for their wages. They took umbrage.  The

Union   or,  I  should  rather  say,  the  General

Secretary  of the Union advised these workers  not

to report - "not to report" - and surely can one blame

the Singapore Harbour Board for not considering re-employing  people who did not make  an  appearance

and declare that they wanted re-employment? Can we

blame  the  Singapore Harbour Board? I  am  indeed

very  unhappy  to  have to take sides  as  I  said

earlier.  The workers did not report.  They  said,

"We must go in as a body." Did they say that? I do

not  think  they  said that. It  was  the  General

Secretary of the union saying that, in order  that

he was not going to suffer any loss in prestige or

the respect of the workers who were led by him for

whatever damage he had done. They stuck firm and I

got  in touch with the Board again and again.  The

answer  given to me was, "If they do not  make  an

appearance and if they do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3281</b></font><br><br>



declare  that  they desire to be re-employed,  how

can  we re-employ them?" So I said, "All right,  I

will  advise  the workers to go back and  register

and  then  I  will ask you to give  immediate  and

sympathetic  consideration to take them  back."  I

advised  the union accordingly but this particular

General  Secretary - this man who has led them  for

his  own good, I am sorry to say - tried to cash  in

on the situation and led all the workers as a mass

into the Singapore Harbour Board and said, "We now

demand  re-employment." I told them, "That is  not

the  way  to  go about it. There is no longer  any

fight.  You  want re-employment, go  and  register

quietly. Do not seek publicity. There is no reason

why you must feel that this man who has led you or

misled  you should have his own position protected

and should be given the opportunity to be able  to

tell  other workers and thereby mislead them,  'It

was  I  who  brought them back  to  the  Singapore

Harbour  Board.' " Surely, as an employer and  even

as  a  worker,  no organisation  can  give  in  to

intimidation  and  it  should  not  give   in   to

intimidation.  Even  if  the  employers  were   to

intimidate  any  trade  union  organisation,  that

organisation must resist to the bitter end in  the

same  way  as the Singapore Harbour Board resisted

by  saying, "If you want to get publicity and play

this  kind  of  a stunt with us, sorry,  boys,  we

cannot register you." Then they got in touch  with

the  T.U.C. The T.U.C. got in touch with me. Later

they  came  to see me and I told them that  things

could have been solved and would be solved if they

would just forget all about their prestige and all

about  the  desire, particularly  of  the  General

Secretary, to pull himself out of the fire.  Since

they got in touch with the T.U.C. and then myself,

I  went to the extent of saying, "I will undertake

to  have  it done." Many reports appeared  in  the

local  papers  condemning my inaction.  There  was

even  a  march  to my office when I was  away  and

there  was this Jamit Singh carrying a baby trying

to  get  publicity  and trying to  intimidate  the

Minister himself into trying to help him out of  a

difficulty  which he himself had  created.  I  too

will  not  tolerate intimidation and  I  too  will

never give in to intimidation. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3282</b></font><br><br>



T.U.C., the  Chairman of the  Harbour  Board  and

myself  had  a  discussion and  we  came  to  some

arrangement.  I felt that the sooner this  General

Secretary  was  kept totally away from  all  these

things the easier would it be for all things to be

solved but no, in spite of the discussion and  the

hope  of  a  solution,  the next  morning  it  was

reported in the same paper that they had  taken  a

vote to go on a hunger strike. Is that not another

method  of  intimidation?  We  have  assured  this

union,  "Please, I feel just as much as  you  feel

for  these  workers. What we want is to see  these

workers  get  back  to work."  You  can  call  the

Minister  a  rotten man; I will take it.  You  can

call  me  any names; I will take it but I find  it

very difficult to have to tell the press all these

things  that  have  been done by  this  so-called

leader  of  the workers. I did not wish to  expose

him  because  I  felt  in exposing  him  it  would

strengthen  the hand of the Harbour Board  and  it

would  make  things more difficult. We know  that,

although  it has not been officially said,  it  is

felt  that the clash between this and that is just

a  clash of personalities. That is unfortunate and

I do not like it. But then as a Minister, it is my

duty   to   try  and  make  personalities   forget

themselves  and  sink  their  differences  in  the

bigger  things. Every time we tried  to  pull  off

something, something else was being done  by  this

paper  to  damage what we had been doing  and,  in

spite  of  all that we have done, we now have  the

Member  for  Queenstown ask, "What has  Government

done? Is Government going to allow these people to

die  from hunger?" Government, particularly myself

as  the  Minister for Labour, wants to  do  a  job

quietly without hurting anyone because it does not

pay to hurt workers or employers in the scheme  of

things.   We  must  try  to  bring  about   better

understanding and in trying to bring about  better

industrial relations one must try not to run  down

one  organisation or the other. That should  never

happen,   and  now  it  is  suggested   that   the

Government  should call off the hunger  strike.  I

cannot  understand that and I say this again,  "If

this  so-called  trade union  leader  and  if  the

responsible leaders in the Singapore Harbour Board

Staff



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3283</b></font><br><br>



Association  will  just  keep  away  from  seeking

publicity and will just forget everything in order

that   these   people  can  be  re-employed,   the

Government will see that they are re-employed."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I  read the morning press with some interest

when  I  discovered that three leading politicians

had  suddenly  taken  an interest  in  the  hunger

strike at the Singapore Harbour Board and they all

happened by some strange coincidence to follow one

another into the union's premises: The Member  for

Queenstown  (Mr  Lee Choon Eng,  the  Member  for

Changi  (Mr Lim Cher Kheng) and the former Member

for  Cairnhill  (Mr  D.  S.  Marshall).  It  also

happens that Saturday is polling day for the  City

Council elections.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Nonsense.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, the Minister for Labour

and  Welfare  has only told half the story  and  I

want to tell the other half.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Tell the truth.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> If people like the Member for

Changi  and  the Member for Queenstown  knew  what

this  is all about, they would think twice  before

trying to make capital out of such situations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Like you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> You cannot win mass support by

cashing in on somebody else's roost.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the hon. Member is perhaps

skating  on  thin  ice.  He is  implying  improper

motive  which is of course disallowed by  Standing

Orders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, the motive of trying to

win  popular support, in my submission, is a  very

honourable motive. The manner in which it is  done

may  not be so honourable. What I hope to do today

is  to  explain how it should be done. You  cannot

hope to get other people to gather popular support

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3284</b></font><br><br>



you. The people who are there on the ground working

8  and  15 hours a day hold the loyalties of these

men  at the base, and you think that you can  come

in  for two hours, once in a year, and swing their

loyalties  over. It cannot be done on that  basis.

The  homing pigeon comes back because it has  been

trained  to come back. The first thing Members  in

this House and politicians must understand is that

if  you  want  mass  support, you  must  work  and

organise for it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Like you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Thank you. I am much obliged.

We do work a lot. Whether we are successful or not

is  another  matter as the City Council  elections

and subsequent elections will show.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> How long.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> But let me explain some of the

things  which the Minister for Labour and  Welfare

has not explained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story starts back in 1952 when I became the

legal adviser to the Singapore Harbour Board Staff

Association. That was some five years  back - and  I

have been in close association with it ever since.

Sir, in 1954, I introduced Mr Jamit Singh as  the

permanent   General  Secretary  of  the  Singapore

Harbour Board's Staff Association. He was a member

of  the  University  of Malaya Socialist  Club.  I

introduced him and was responsible for  him  as  a

result  of that. I believe at that time  that  his

energy and enthusiasm would be to the advantage of

the  workers. Sir, I have to weigh my  words  very

carefully     because    there    are    long-term

repercussions on whatever we say and do  in  these

matters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Tell the truth.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I must ask the Member for Changi

to  forbear from making unseemly interruptions. We

are  in Committee and the Member will perhaps have

a chance of replying, if he chooses to, later on.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3285</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The next part of the story

starts with the strike of the clerical and monthly-rated  sections of the Singapore Harbour Board  in

1955.  The strike went on for 60 odd days and  was

finally concluded to the advantage of the workers.

Then  in  late 1955, it was decided to expand  the

membership  of that union and take in  the  daily-rated  workers. There were 2,000 odd monthly-rated

workers  and there were 7,000 to 8,000 daily-rated

workers. Amendments were subsequently made to  the

constitution and the workers were to be registered

as  members  of the Singapore Harbour Board  Staff

Association. Mr Jamit Singh felt however that  it

might be better to have some other name and formed

a   union  called  the  Singapore  Harbour   Board

Workers' Union. He started registering workers for

that  union. This is the crux of the matter: there

is  a fight in the Singapore Harbour Board. In the

course of a fight, one makes use of every possible

source  of  support.  All expendable  material  is

used,  be it David Saul Marshall, whom the General

Secretary of the union denounced three nights  ago

on a P.A.P. platform in Jalan Besar. If David Saul

Marshall  thinks he wants to cash in  on  it,  the

General  Secretary quite rightly says, "Good,  you

want to play me for a sucker, I will play you  for

a  sucker." This is a tough game and those who are

not  tough, had better not try to play this  game.

There  was a real fight, and the fight was between

Mr  Chrimes, as Chairman of the Singapore Harbour

Board,  and Mr Jamit Singh. Mr Chrimes believed - and I am sure he still does to this day - and I have

heard  it  said in an aside during  the  Court  of

Inquiry  which  sat for days on  end,  "Mr  Jamit

Singh  is  a  saboteur  determined  to  wreck  the

Singapore  Harbour  Board,  to  bring  it   to   a

standstill and to ruin the economy of the country,

and  is  a person who should be put behind  bars."

That  is  Mr Chrimes' honest to God opinion.  Mr

Jamit  Singh,  on the other hand, thinks  of  Mr

Chrimes  as  a  so and so who should  be  properly

dealt  with before he is allowed to go  away  with

his pension.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3286</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if you want to break a man, you try to

take his support away from him. If you can get the

mass  to  yield  to you, then you break  him.  The

first thing Mr Chrimes did was to refuse to allow

the  premises in Cantonment Road to be used by the

Singapore Harbour Board Workers' Union. Of course,

there were a lot of technicalities. It was said in

the  Court  of Inquiry that the General  Secretary

never, in fact, made a formal application, and  so

on.  Thousands of formal applications  could  have

been  made  and the answer would have  been  'No'.

There  was  a  fight already on in  1956.  So  the

merger which was intended of the Staff Association

into the Workers' Union was stalled because merger

meant losing the union premises and in any massive

organisation,  premises are  important.  You  must

have  a  place where the workers can come together

and  when  workers  come together  then  there  is

effervescency. Therefore, things stalemated for  a

few  months. Both sides were sparring, looking for

a soft spot where one could knock the other fellow

out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early this year, the Tanjong Pagar by-elections

started. I think that Members will remember  that,

at  that  same  time, there was a go-slow  of  the

National Union of Railway Workers. Mr Jamit Singh

decided  that  there should be a  boycott  of  all

goods  which were intended for Port Swettenham  in

sympathy   with  them - a  legitimate  trade   union

practice.  Now,  Sir, I was  the  adviser  to  the

Association;  I  am  still  the  adviser  to   the

Association. I knew of that decision only after  I

read  it in the papers. However, that was  a  fair

and  legitimate trade union practice and then  the

fight  started. The Board retaliated  immediately,

looking for an opportunity to bring the matter  to

a  head  and  detain Mr Jamit Singh's  pass.  The

fight was on. Mr Jamit Singh squatted for one day

in  a police station as a gesture of protest,  not

comparable  to  what Mahatma  Gandhi  did,  but  a

laudable  local effort. Next day, a mass, meeting

was  called;  I  was  present. The  situation  was

weighed and a go slow



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3287</b></font><br><br>



was  called,  that  is, a slow  up  of  the  whole

operation  as  a  weapon of  pressure.  The  Board

retaliated by suspending more workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was just like when Hitler wanted to attack

Poland.  He  found all kinds of things  that  went

wrong between Poland and Germany. Of course,  when

you  find  lots  of things going wrong  you  apply

pressure  and  say,  "That  is  wrong."   and   if

something else happens you say. "Oh that is  wrong

too." and you do this and the other. Eventually  a

declaration  of  war must be made.  The  suspended

workers led to greater pressure on the union side,

greater  pressure on the union side  led  to  more

suspensions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that situation, the House will remember, I

tabled  a motion that the matter should  go  to  a

Court  of  Inquiry and the whole matter be  sorted

out.  Before  my motion came up, the Minister  for

Labour yielded and called a Court of Inquiry.  You

will,  I  think, remember that he said to me  then

when  he  was first considering it, "We must  make

sure  that  both sides will abide by it before  we

set  up  a  Court  of  Inquiry  otherwise  it   is

useless."  And by the time he called  a  Court  of

Inquiry,  both sides had agreed to  abide  by  its

findings  and we went before the Court of  Inquiry

and put the facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report was put before the House and the real

issue  was,  as  far as the Court  was  concerned,

whether  we  could prove the fight for recognition

of   either  the  Workers'  Union  or  the   Staff

Association as representing all the workers. Now,

for  reasons of the legal formalities, and so  on,

the  whole  of  the Workers' Union membership  was

brought   over   into   the   Staff   Association.

Backdating and other complications do not  concern

the  main point we are discussing. Sir, there  was

no  doubt that we had the majority of the  workers

in the Staff Association. And if a ballot is held,

as the Court report recommended, it will be proved

that  we  have  got the majority of  the  workers.

Throughout the whole of the Court of Inquiry,  Mr

Chrimes had to show his hand. Every time the Court

made a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3288</b></font><br><br>



finding,  he  blocked and stalled it  because  his

purpose was not to settle the dispute. His purpose

was  to  show the workers: Follow Mr Jamit Singh,

you  are  in  for difficulties and  you  will  get

nowhere;  so  discard  him. That  is  Mr  Chrimes

objective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have not always seen eye to eye with the

General  Secretary of the Singapore Harbour  Board

Staff  Association, particularly on the manner  in

which  certain  administrative  arrangements  were

done,  but  I say this: Mr Chrimes is  about  the

most vicious employer-type that one can ever meet.

He told me once, "I like a man who has got fire in

his  belly." and Mr Chrimes obviously  is  a  man

with  fire  in  his  belly because  he  must  like

himself.   He   is   determined,   whatever    the

consequences, to break Mr Jamit Singh even if  it

means breaking the union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not interested in Mr Chrimes breaking

Mr  Jamit Singh. But I am very interested to  see

that  Mr Chrimes does not break the union because

years  of work has gone into building it up.  This

is  another  aspect which the Minister for  Labour

did  not bring up. We are fighting to build up one

union in the waterfront and so is the T.U.C.  They

had   the   Waterfront  Workers'   Federation   or

Confederation.  There  are about  seven  or  eight

little   piddling  unions  inside  the   Singapore

Harbour Board, like the Stevedore something or the

other,  and others. We proved it in the  Court  of

Inquiry  that they were all hollow and  that  they

did  not  have  numbers.  Every  one  of  them  is

recognised by the Board as representing one sector

or  the  other of the daily-rated workers  in  the

Singapore Harbour Board. So the real fight is  the

fight  between the Singapore Harbour  Board  Staff

Association  on  the  one side  claiming  that  it

represents all the workers and Mr Chrimes of  the

Singapore Harbour Board on the other side  saying,

"No,  you don't. I will break you. If you say that

you  are  representatives of my  workers,  then  I

think  you are in for a lot of trouble." With  the

T.U.C. also saying, "That would be completely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3289</b></font><br><br>



wiped off if recognition were given to us". Now, I

have to oppose this and this is the basic issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister is right; he can

solve   this   matter.  In  fact,  he   gave   the

undertaking  in  the  presence  of  the   General

Secretary  of  the  union and of  myself  when  he

dictated  a  statement saying that he  would  take

full  responsibility to see that they were backed,

but that Mr Jamit Singh was not to interfere. How

could you expect Mr Jamit Singh not to interfere?

This  is a fight for survival. If he does not cash

in,  the workers will honestly believe that he  is

useless.  So he has got to be in the battle.  This

is  the technique of fighting for mass support. It

goes  on all over the world and those who  do  not

understand  this  should  go  and  read  about  it

because  these  things  have  happened  in   other

places. Now, Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister  was

prepared to solve this on his terms and his  terms

were:  No credit to you, credit to the T.U.C.:  no

credit to Mr Jamit Singh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No, no. Let me finish. There

are a few minutes more.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> I hope the hon. Member will

give  me  at  least one minute to  reply  to  this

allegation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Let us put it fairly and

squarely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Let me finish please. There

are  a few minutes more. The hon. Member can speak

on  other topics and I do not think what the  hon.

Member  has  to  say will make much difference  to

what I am going to finish up with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fight in which the 200 workers are

pawns  and that is a fact. They can go on a hunger

strike.  They can bear out all the sores and  say,

"Ah,  look  at my guts, they are coming out,"  The

real fight is Mr Chrimes out to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3290</b></font><br><br>



break  Mr Jamit Singh and the union if necessary,

the  union  determined to preserve its membership,

the  General Secretary determined to maintain  his

leadership  in the union, and the T.U.C. standing

by asking, "Where do I come in?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I think the Hon. the Chief Minister

deserves  or  the T.U.C. deserves full  credit  to

take the men back. We do not want credit for this.

Take  them  back.  But there is still  the  bigger

issue to be settled and the bigger issue is,  that

this  union  represents all the workers.  At  some

time  or other, the Hon. the Chief Minister  knows

that  there  is going to be a big debate  on  this

matter  and that there will be a final settlement.

Either the ballot will have to be taken, or  there

will  be  a  crisis,  or  there  is  a  compromise

solution.  I am suggesting a compromise  solution.

My  compromise solution is well known to the  Hon.

the  Chief  Minister and to his T.U.C. colleagues,

that  is, we get all these piddling little  unions

to come together with the big union, the Singapore

Harbour  Board  Staff  Association,  and  form   a

federation. The federation as such will  represent

all  the  workers in the Singapore Harbour  Board,

but  membership of the individual  worker  to  any

component part of that federation should  be  free

and  voluntary. In other words, there will be free

and  open competition between the component  parts

of that federation to hold the loyalty of the men.

Workers  all over the world are not loyal to  just

"isms"  and  principles. They  are  loyal  to  the

people who fight and work for them -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> For political reasons.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - and if the T.U.C. cadres are

prepared to work and fight for them, they will get

their loyalty. That is the real fact of the matter

and  I hope the Hon. the Chief Minister in his one

minute  reply  which  I have left  him  will  help

further to elucidate the situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I think we are quite

disgusted  with the rubbish, vague statements  and

lies told by the Member for Tanjong Pagar -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3291</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> There is just one more minute.

Sir,  I am sure that hon. Members are already  aware

that  in  doing this work, one must not try  to  get

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time has elapsed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $427,760 for Head 49 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3291</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 50 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 50 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 12 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This item is in respect of a lightweight motor-cycle for which a vote is required in the sum of

$650.  Sir,  this amount appears to be a very,  very

small  amount. But what I say is that there  was  no

such vote provided for in last year's Estimates. Now

going through the footnote, it reads: "Required  for

despatches  and  collections of mails  to  and  from

other  Government departments." Sir, may  I  enquire

from  the  Government  how was  mail  delivered  and

collected during all the months from January up till

now?  Now, if for the whole of this year,  mail  has

been  delivered  and  collected satisfactorily,  why

then  is  it  necessary that  a  vote  for  $650  is

required  to  purchase  a motor-cycle?  Can  we  not

maintain  and  continue  the  present  procedure  of

delivering  and collecting mails? I  would  like  an

explanation from the Government on that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposal

to   purchase  a  lightweight  motor-cycle  for  the

purpose of carrying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3292</b></font><br><br>



mails  between the department and other  departments

is  dictated  by  the desire to effect  the  maximum

economy   in  the  transport  expenditure   of   the

Immigration  Department. Whilst in  1956,  Sir,  the

Department  maintained  four  motor  vehicles,   the

number  has been reduced to only three in  1957.  Of

the  three vehicles, one of them, an Austin  station

wagon, which has already performed more than 140,000

miles has been certified by the Mechanical Engineer,

P.W.D. as  beyond economic repair. It is  therefore

necessary to replace one vehicle and the replacement

is  by  a  lightweight  motor-cycle  which  is  more

economical to use. It is also easier for a messenger

to  ride  on a motor-cycle to deliver mails  thereby

freeing the two station wagons for the transport  of

immigration officers in their duties.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the

explanation  from  the Minister,  may  I  have  your

permission to withdraw my amendment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $1,101,270 for Head 50 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hon. the Chief

Minister  mentioned in this House a day  or  so  ago

that the question of passports for Singapore has not

yet  been  finalised, and there is also the question

of  re-entry permits for Singapore citizens which  I

think is in the same state. Now these questions  may

not  have been finalised but no doubt the Government

has  a  definite policy on them. Would the  Minister

state  what the intentions of the Government are  in

this   respect  as  there  is  considerable   public

interest in this matter?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, if the hon. Member is

desirous  of knowing what the Government's intention

is  in regard to the issuing of passports for,  say,

citizens  of  Singapore, all I can say is  that  the

matter   is  at  present  under  consideration   but

citizens  of  Singapore who are  already  registered

will  have  re-entry into Singapore when they  leave

Singapore   for  countries  where   travel   to   is

permitted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3293</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I would like to raise three

points  on this immigration matter. Firstly,  many

aliens  seeking  to study abroad have  no  British

passports - of  course, they have only  certificates

of  identity - and  are  refused  entry  by  certain

foreign  countries  unless  they  have  a  certain

assurance  from  this  Government  that  they  can

return to Singapore at any time or at least  after

their  period of study. I wish the Minister  would

consider this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Sir, is with regard to the

stability  of  this region. I wonder  whether  the

Government  will consider loosening  some  of  the

immigration  regulations in order to attract  more

investors who can bring in "invisible capital."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, some of the local-born citizens of this

country  have been away without a re-entry permit.

Will   the  Government  consider  allowing - them especially  those who went to China and  who  were

local-born - to come back?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

experienced that the Immigration Department  takes

an  unduly long time to deal with applications for

entry  permits. There is one case  I  know  of.  I

think,  if it is a question of shortage of  staff,

Government must then provide the additional  staff

so   that   the  public  should  not   be   unduly

inconvenienced.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, the delay in considering

applications for entry permits, particularly  from

immigrants  from  China, is not mainly  due  to  a

shortage  of staff. It is due, in most  cases,  to

the   inability   of   the  sponsor   to   produce

satisfactory evidence. The Immigration  Department

cannot  accept  it as satisfactory  evidence  just

because  a sponsor states in the application  form

that  so  and so is his wife or his parent.  There

must  be  other  documentary  evidence  which  the

sponsor  has to produce and which can satisfy  the

Immigration Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point raised by the Member for

Changi  (Mr  Lim Cher Kheng) on the  question  of

certificates  of identity issued to  students  who

intend   to  travel  overseas  to  further   their

studies, one case has come to my notice, Sir. If



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3294</b></font><br><br>



these  students  who  intend to  go  overseas  are

citizens of Singapore, they should come and see me

or the Controller of Immigration and the necessary

assurance  to  the Government of  the  country  to

which the student intends to go will be given.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Thank you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,101,270 for Head 50 ordered to

stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3294</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 51 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $955,570 for Head 51 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must take

this opportunity of begging your pardon when I was

pulled  up  by  you  during  the  debate  on   the

Singapore   Harbour   Board   strike.   I   cannot

understand why certain facts have been hidden  and

why we cannot be told the truth. Firstly, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not know whether the

hon. Member is endeavouring to reopen the subject.

If he is, he is out of order. The subject has been

closed.  Of course, the hon. Member can  speak  on

other aspects of labour.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Yes, I have to abide by the

Standing   Orders.  On  the  question  of   labour

stability, I did put forward a suggestion  to  the

Minister for Labour and Welfare that we should now

sponsor   a  training  course  for  union  leaders

whereby  the  workers themselves can select  their

own  leaders instead of politicians. As  we  know,

some  politicians fully utilise the union movement

and  they can even put one of their own men  as  a

General  Secretary. In this instance, I wonder  if

the  Member  for  Tanjong Pagar can  answer  these

questions.  He  said  that  Mr  Jamit  Singh  was

selected  as  the General Secretary  to  lead  the

Singapore Harbour Board Workers' Union because  he

was a very enthusiastic socialist. Did he become a

member  of the P.A.P.? Is it in the best  interest

of  the  workers to establish a new union  knowing

very  well  that there is already  a  trade  union

existing? Did the legal adviser to the Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3295</b></font><br><br>



Harbour  Board Workers' Union advise them  that  they

should  join  the T.U.C.? If we allow politicians  to

appoint  their Party stalwarts into a  union  and  if

they  want  to grab power and make political  capital

out  of  labour, I think the stability of  the  trade

union  movement can never be achieved.  Therefore,  I

strongly  suggest to the Government to  consider  the

sponsoring  of  training  courses  for  trade   union

leaders.  There are economists and lecturers  in  our

Universities  who can give them the right  and  sound

advice instead of being misled by politicians who are

opportunists  and  so-called  trade  union   leaders,

seeking only political interest!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in supporting

the  Member for Changi regarding the setting up of  a

training  course for union leaders, I  would  suggest

that  it  should  be more a course  for  the  members

rather than the leaders themselves. As far as I know,

there  is  a  course for leaders of trade unions  who

undergo training in the management and administration

of trade union but I would suggest and emphasise more

strongly that a course or lectures should be given to

the members of trade unions and not to the leaders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been proved now, Sir, that most leaders are

nothing  else but politicians who really make capital

out  of  trade  unions and who give wrong  advice  to

trade unions, just as in the case that was debated  a

few  minutes  ago.  Now, it is only  the  members  of

political parties who penetrate into and make capital

out  of  trade unions and not Independents who belong

to  no  party  at all. The Member for  Tanjong  Pagar

said,  "It is the fight for survival," - the  fight  of

survival of his own political Party. Independents are

not  interested  at all. The Independents  are  only

interested  in the humanitarian side of trade  unions

and not in the survival of any political party. So  I

would strongly advocate that Government start a  sort

of  a course or get lecturers to advise or lecture to

trade  unions so that they will not accept the advice

of politicians who come into trade unions as supposed

trade union



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3296</b></font><br><br>



leaders.  Are they really trade unionists,  Sir?  Are

they really in the trade itself? They are nothing but

paid to penetrate or infiltrate into the trade unions

for  their  own political ends. I have been  a  trade

unionist myself as founder of the Army Civil  Service

Union - the biggest union in Singapore today - and I know

what   trade   unionism  is.  On  the   question   of

politicians  making capital out of  trade  unions,  I

think it reflects on members of political parties and

not on Independent politicians.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Sir, I just want to make one

comment  on  the  general remarks of  the  Opposition

about trade unions. To be a good organiser of a trade

union requires knowledge of organisation, ability and

experience and this, I think, is in short  supply  in

Singapore.  Not  only  are the  technical  skills  or

technological aids short, but also absent is the long

tradition of how to do things, how to negotiate,  how

to  strike a bargain, how to understand the  workings

of  an industry, and so on. The result is that unions

very often do not get the finest quality of people as

organisers, because such people have already gone for

more  remunerative  or  more  attractive  occupations

somewhere  else. They do sometimes get a man  with  a

chip  on  his  shoulder, a man  with  an  inferiority

complex - suffering  from a complex of  aggressive  and

defensive mechanisms which do not operate in a  fully

sane way. He may be inspiring on some occasions,  but

on  others he may be rather a menace. Such a man  may

get  things in a muddle. I think the idea to  improve

conditions by trade union courses and so on  is  very

desirable,  but the basic requirement  is  a  general

widening of organisational experience which can  only

come by a process of time and learning the hard way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, before I speak on what I

think is the more important aspect on this particular

head,  that  is, the  efficient enforcement  of  the

Ordinances   we   have  passed - the  Shop   Assistants

Employment   Ordinance  and  the  Clerks   Employment

Ordinance - I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3297</b></font><br><br>



would  say  this. When an expert holds a big  Samurai

sword,  it  is firmly held with two hands.  But  when

people like the Member for Queenstown (Mr Lee  Choon

Eng)  and the Member for Changi (Mr Lim Cher  Kheng)

use  a  Samurai sword the way a rapier is used,  then

some very odd gestures result.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Especially from you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, the first quality one needs

to be an organiser and a trade unionist is not as the

hon.  Mr Thomas said organisational experience,  and

so on. The first quality is drive and idealism. Trade

unionism  does not mean the occasional meeting  where

one harangues the member. It means sweating day after

day  in  your little office, running around attending

to  multitudes of little problems, and  the  drudgery

can  only  be  done by those who have got  sufficient

idealism and drive. That is the first quality and the

first  difficulty is to find a man with that idealism

and  that drive. Sir, if we could find more and  more

of  such people, there will be no danger. Then we can

make  such people work the democratic trade unionism.

Then  there  is  every  reason to  believe  that  the

democratic system in Malaya will flourish.  The  task

is  one  of  finding the men, and not one  of  giving

leadership grants to train people to be leaders. They

send  these people all over the world, but they start

with material that would never make leaders. I do not

yet know of a man who became a leader as a result  of

having undergone a leadership course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But coming to the main topic, it is an open

secret - one  which  must be very  well  known  to  the

Minister   for  Labour  and  Welfare - that  employers,

particularly  coffee-shop owners, are  not  observing

the  Shop  Assistants Employment Ordinance. I  myself

have referred several cases where there has been non-observance  by coffee-shop owners, to his department.

Although  it is only a few months since the Ordinance

was passed, it is time that he got down to getting an

inspectorate  to  see  that the  provisions  of  this

Ordinance are observed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3298</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a union is strong, and the overall labour

situation is one favourable to the worker as  against

the  employer,  the  services of an  inspectorate  to

enforce the provisions of the Ordinance do not become

so  important. But where the union is  still  in  the

formative  stage  and  gathering  strength,  and  the

employers  are able to gang-up and either  punish  or

otherwise   make  it  uncomfortable  for   individual

employees or union officials who try to get  them  to

observe   the   provisions  of  the  law,   then   an

inspectorate  which lends itself to the unions  where

employers are in breach is a very desirable thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are other difficulties also for which we

did  not  make  provision when we passed  the  Labour

Ordinance. For example, what happens when an employer

refuses  to engage doctors to certify that a  man  is

unfit for work before he can get his leave, and other

little  loopholes like that, which must have come  to

the  notice of the Minister's department. I  want  to

know  from  him whether he is making a study  of  all

these  deficiencies,  and  when  we  can  expect   an

Ordinance or an amending Ordinance to fill up all the

loopholes  which  by lack of experience  or  lack  of

anticipation were allowed to pass unnoticed.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> I believe, Sir, that we are on

this subject till 4 o'clock.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have only one minute left.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Thank you, Sir. I will give the

chance of speaking to the Hon. the Chief Minister.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, under this portfolio, I am

known as the Minister for Labour and Welfare and  not

the Chief Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point raised by the Member for Tanjong Pagar in

regard  to  the non-observance of certain  Ordinances

particularly by shops is that he has brought  to  the

attention of the Labour Department certain complaints

against  certain shops. I can assure the hon.  Member

that complaints whenever received from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3299</b></font><br><br>



the  workers concerned or their representatives  will

be  looked  into expeditiously and if it is necessary

to  strengthen the labour inspectorate, this will  be

done. I agree with the Member for Tanjong Pagar  that

there  are  certain loopholes in the Labour Ordinance

and  arising out of the Labour Ordinance in the Shop

Assistants   Employment  Ordinance  and  the   Clerks

Employment Ordinance but a study is being made  as  a

result of experience gained and as soon as the  study

is completed, an amending Bill will be put forward.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time has elapsed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $955,570 for Head 51 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3299</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 52 -



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 52 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to make it difficult for the Minister

for  Labour and Welfare, who is a good friend  and  a

very  old colleague of mine, but I would like to make

some enquiries regarding this department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, during the post-war period, this

department is very necessary and is useful. There  is

no doubt about that. I would like him to give me some

statistics now or tomorrow morning of the  number  of

people receiving help and the amount given yearly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, complaints have been made that if a person has

got to receive a very few dollars from the department

he may have to travel and spend bus money to and from

the  department. What arrangements have been made  so

that  these  people who receive a very  meagre  sum - a

family  may  receive more - should not  have  to  spend

money  to travel to the department and wait for  long

hours?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3300</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I do not know whether I am in order, but

I would also like to have statistics as to the number

of   those   labourers,   skilled   labourers,   shop

assistants,   and   so   on,  receiving   help   from

Government. What is being done for such people by the

Social   Welfare  Department  to  make   them   self-supporting? I believe that the duty of the Government

is to reduce the number of people dependent on public

dole  and  that  they should be made self-supporting.

They  must be given jobs; they must be taught certain

trades in small-scale industries, and so on, so  that

they can earn their own living.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the statistics

asked  for by the hon. Member for Telok Ayer  can  be

gathered from the Annual Report of the Social Welfare

Department.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I think community centres

and  community  centre  development  come  under  the

control  of  the Social Welfare Department.  I  have

brought to the attention of the department that  many

community  centres are being run by  advisory  boards

appointed by Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Moment of interruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the Assembly.
