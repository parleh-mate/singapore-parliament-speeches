<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE DOLLAR</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Prime Minister, in the light

of  the  Indonesian Government's decision to go ahead  with  the

currency  board, what steps would the Singapore Government  take

to  see that the Singapore dollar does not suffer as a result of

the fall in the Indonesian rupiah.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>DEPRECIATION OF CURRENCIES OF NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Effect on Singapore's competitiveness)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister how

the  relative  depreciation  of the  currencies  of  Singapore's

neighbouring countries will affect our competitiveness.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong) (for the</b>

<b>Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I will

answer Question Nos. 1 and 2 together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The depreciation of the regional

currencies  relative  to the Singapore  dollar  will  have  some

impact  on  our  export competitiveness.  But we should  take  a

broader   perspective.    First,  the   Singapore   dollar   has

depreciated  against the US dollar and most European  currencies

since  July last year.  On an overall trade-weighted basis,  the

Singapore dollar has been stable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we are not direct competitors with the ASEAN

economies  in  most product categories.  An internal  MAS  study

shows  that,  for both goods and services, our major competitors

in  the  region  are the NIEs, and within ASEAN, Malaysia.   The

Singapore  dollar has not appreciated against the Hong  Kong  or

Taiwanese currencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, what matters to our export competitiveness is the

real  exchange  rate, namely, the nominal rate,  which  is  then

adjusted for cost or inflation differentials between us and  our

trading  partners.   The  sharp  depreciation  of  the  regional

currencies  will  eventually  raise  domestic  prices  in  these

economies and erode the initial gains in competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fears that a fall in the Indonesian rupiah will drag the

Singapore  dollar  down  are at this  stage  hypothetical.   The

Indonesian  government has not yet decided to set up a  currency

board system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore dollar should not be unduly affected by

movements in the Indonesian rupiah.  Indonesia's exports do  not

compete  with Singapore's exports.  The weight of the rupiah  in

our  basket is small.  Furthermore, our exchange rate policy  is

not  mechanically  driven by the trade weights.   MAS  exercises

judgment  in managing the exchange rate, and takes into  account

exceptional market factors.  MAS will maintain confidence in the

Singapore dollar, by intervening in the foreign exchange  market

where necessary.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Deputy  Prime Minister, with the lowering of the currency  rates

in  our  neighbouring countries, like in Indonesia and Malaysia,

and therefore they have become more competitive and enjoy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



low  manufacturing  cost,  would the  promotion  of  the  Growth

Triangle concept be more useful?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes, indeed, the

Growth  Triangle  concept is useful and the lower  cost  in  the

neighbouring provinces of Malaysia, Indonesia, Johor  and  Riau,

should enable our businesses and companies which have operations

there also to benefit from this lower cost.  But, as I explained

earlier,  it  is  the  real exchange rate which  determines  our

competitiveness, not the nominal one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain the difference. If we trade with Indonesia

and  the  rupiah  goes down from 2,500 rupiah to 10,000  rupiah,

other  things being equal, Indonesian costs have gone down  four

times  and  therefore they are four times more competitive  than

us.  But other things do not remain equal.  When the rupiah goes

down,  imports cost more, people are unable to pay, they agitate

for  higher wages, and wages go up, inflation goes up.  And  if,

for  the  sake of argument, the rupiah has gone down four  times

but  prices have gone up four times in Indonesia, then  although

there  has been a nominal depreciation of their currency,  there

is   no   real   effect   on   our  competitiveness   or   their

competitiveness.  It will not completely work out like that.  It

takes  some time, and at the end of it, I think our neighbouring

countries will end up somewhat more competitive than we are, but

not to the extent as shown just by looking at the exchange rates

now.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, does the Deputy

Prime  Minister think that, in light of the fact  that  probably

there  will  be  a  real  exchange rate  devaluation  among  the

regional  countries, actually competitiveness will be  a  bigger

issue for us now and particularly in the medium term after these

Asian  economies recover than before, let us say, July  of  last

year?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I think it will vary from industry to

industry.   Overall, yes, it will be offset somewhat because  we

have   become  more  competitive  compared  to,  say,  developed

countries,  and  the developed countries were, to  some  extent,

competing  against us for investments and exports.  But  against

the neighbouring



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



countries, they will end up somewhat more competitive  than  us,

particularly  our more labour-intensive industries.   The  older

plants  which  have been here for some time -  mass  production,

very  low margins -  will be under pressure and adjustments will

have to be made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the upper end, the effect on us is not so much on the

cost as on the state of the markets, and some of those have been

affected  too, particularly where they export to the  region  or

where  the  region  has a big influence on  world  prices.   For

example,  with petrochemicals, when the region boomed it  was  a

big  consumer and now that the region is down, prices are  down.

Some  of  our  projects are going to see investors reconsidering

them, and maybe deferring them for some time.  But it is part of

being in an economic slowdown.

<div align="center"><b>RETRENCHED WORKERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Lim Swee Say</b> asked the Minister for Labour (a) how

many  workers were retrenched in 1997; (b) on average, how  long

these  retrenched  workers  took to  find  new  employment;  (c)

whether older workers take a longer time than younger workers in

securing  new  employment; and (d) how his  Ministry  will  help

retrenched workers, especially those who are unskilled and  not-so-young, to find employment.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng</b> asked the Minister for Labour what

is  the  current rate of unemployment and whether this  rate  is

rising  rapidly and, if so, how the Government plans to  address

this problem.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker,

with  your  permission, may I take both Question Nos.  3  and  4

together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, in 1997, 9,784 workers were

retrenched.   This  was 11% lower than the 10,956  laid  off  in

1996.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



However,  the  number of workers retrenched has increased  since

the  onset  of  the  regional economic crisis.   In  the  fourth

quarter  of  1997,  4,278 workers were retrenched,  compared  to

5,506 during the first three quarters of the year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total employment in Singapore increased by 122,800 in 1997

compared  with 102,600 in 1996.  The economy continued to  enjoy

full  employment  as reflected in the low unemployment  rate  of

1.8%  for the whole of 1997. However, the last quarter  of  1997

saw  higher  unemployment  rate of 2% reflecting  the  increased

retrenchments  during  that quarter. Fortunately,  for  most  of

1997, we experienced strong employment growth and a tight labour

market.  Many  retrenched workers found  alternative  employment

quickly.   Based  on  CPF's records, 79% of  the  local  workers

retrenched  during the first three quarters  of  1997  were  re-employed  by  December 1997.  The re-employment rate  for  older

workers aged 50 and above was lower at 66%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the workers who were re-employed, the average time

taken  to secure new jobs was 1.8 months after being retrenched.

There  was  no  significant difference in the average  time  for

workers in the various age groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the on-going regional economic crisis and a

less than vigorous rebound in certain sectors of the electronics

industry, we saw more retrenchments since the beginning of  this

year.   As  the economy is likely to grow at a slower pace  this

year,  we are also expecting more retrenchments for the rest  of

the  year.   My  Ministry has therefore  decided  to  set  up  a

Tripartite  Panel  comprising representatives  from  EDB,  NTUC,

SNEF,  PSB and the Ministry itself to assist retrenched  workers

seeking  re-employment.  Retrenched workers  who  are  older  or

lacking  in skills will have to make special efforts to  acquire

useful   skills  or  upgrade  their  skills  to  improve   their

employability.  The Tripartite Panel will also look into ways of

assisting such workers.

<div align="center"><b>EMPLOYMENT ACT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Compensation to long-service employees whose services are</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>terminated)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Labour

whether the Government will consider amending the Employment Act

to  require employers to pay compensation to employees  who  are

terminated by the companies that they had served for  ten  years

or more.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Encik Othman bin Haron</b>

<b>Eusofe) (for the Minister for Labour):</b> Sir, an employee's

service may be terminated for a variety of reasons such as  poor

work  performance, ill health or redundancy.  Under any of these

circumstances,  the  employer is  required  to  give  notice  of

termination or salary in lieu  of notice.  Notice of termination

is  usually provided in the employment contract.  In the absence

of  such a provision, the period of notice will be in accordance

with the Employment Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where an employee's service is terminated on ground of poor

work performance, he will not be given compensation. In the case

of  an  employee whose service is terminated on  ground  of  ill

health, his employer would usually grant an ex-gratia payment to

assist him financially. For termination on ground of redundancy,

an  employee who is covered by the Employment Act is eligible to

claim  for retrenchment benefit if he has a minimum of 3  years'

service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Act does not stipulate the quantum of

retrenchment  benefits payable. We have taken this  approach  to

enable  companies  and the affected employees  to  have  greater

flexibility  in determining the appropriate amount, taking  into

account the financial position of the company. Thus, the quantum

of  retrenchment benefit payable for a non-unionised employee is

subject to negotiation with his employer.  Where a non-unionised

employee  is dissatisfied with his compensation, he  can  always

appeal  to  my  Ministry for assistance.  My  Ministry's  Labour

Relations Department will, through conciliation, help the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



employee to pursue claim for retrenchment payment.   In the case

of  a unionised employee, the amount of retrenchment benefit  is

determined through collective bargaining between the  union  and

the company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prevailing retrenchment benefit payable to affected

workers  in  the non-unionised sector varies from  a  few  days'

salary  for each year of service to one month's salary for  each

year  of service.  In the case of the unionised sector, the norm

of  retrenchment  benefit payable is two weeks  to  one  month's

salary  for each year of service, unless the financial  position

of the company warrants a lower quantum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, the quantum of retrenchment benefit stipulated

in  collective agreements is higher compared to the quantum paid

to  those who are not unionised.  This in itself is an incentive

for workers to join trade unions.  It should also be pointed out

that  employees  with  less  than 3 years'  service,  while  not

eligible to claim for retrenchment benefit, are in practice also

paid some form of ex-gratia payment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the law already enables a retrenched employee with 3

years'  service  to  claim  retrenchment  benefit  and  affected

workers are paid such benefit based on the financial position of

the company or in accordance with the collective agreements, the

suggestion  by  the  Member  for  Hougang  that  employers   pay

retrenchment  benefit  to  employees with  at  least  10  years'

service, is not in the interest of workers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, is the Minister of

State  aware  that  there  are  employees  whose  services   are

terminated by the employer giving just one month's notice or  in

lieu  of  notice, paying one month's salary without any  further

compensation?   I  think such cases have been  referred  to  the

Ministry before.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, as I have stated, if

he  is a non-unionised employee and he is not satisfied with the

retrenchment payment, he can appeal and seek assistance from the

Labour  Relations Department of my Ministry.   In  the  case  of

unionised employees, it is based



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



on  the  negotiations between the union and the company.   As  I

have  mentioned  earlier,  in  most  cases,  the  practice   for

unionised employees is that they can at least have two weeks  to

one  month's  salary for each year of service  as  compensation.

But this depends on the financial position of the company.  I am

not  sure which particular case the Member is referring to.   In

the  case  where  a company has no money, there  cannot  be  any

retrenchment  payment.  So it depends on the financial  position

of  the  company  and  the  circumstances  of  the  retrenchment

exercise.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Generally, do employers need to specify

the  reason  for  termination in their letter of termination  or

they   just   say,   "Under  the  contract,  I  terminate   your

employment."?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, in the case of

retrenchment,  the  employer will mention to his  employee  that

because  of very poor business conditions or some other  reasons

there  has  to  be a retrenchment.  In the case of  a  unionised

company, the union will be informed of any retrenchment that  is

necessary because of these reasons.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> A clarification, Sir. I am referring

to  termination, not necessarily retrenchment.  The employer may

just  terminate an employee's services by giving him one month's

notice,  or in lieu of notice, paying one month's salary without

specifying  any reason.  Is there anything under the  Employment

Act  which could compel  an employer to specify the reasons  for

termination?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Under the law, the employer

has to give a notice of termination. But whether or not he gives

the  reasons for termination depends on the circumstances of the

case.   If  it  is  poor conduct or poor performance,  then  the

employer  may want to give that reason.  But it depends  on  the

circumstances of the case.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> In the case of an employer not stating

any reason at all, would the employee concerned be able to claim

any compensation?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, there is a termination

clause.   The  employee can also terminate his services  and  he

does  not  need to give a reason.  If he finds another  job,  he

just says, "Okay, I want to leave the company."  Since there  is

a  termination  clause and the employer wants to  terminate  the

services  of his employee, he can also exercise it on  the  same

basis.   So it is not necessary for him to give a reason  if  he

does  not  want  to, because it is on a reciprocal  basis.   The

employee  can also give notice of termination.  If  he  finds  a

better  job, he does not need to give a reason to the  employer.

Likewise,   it  is  up  to  the  employer.   In  the   case   of

retrenchment, and that was the Question filed, obviously in  the

case of a unionised company, the union would be informed and  it

will  then  negotiate  on  the type of retrenchment  benefit  or

payment  that should be paid, and this is based on the financial

position of the company.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Does the

Minister  of State appreciate that the present laws in Singapore

and  the  practices followed by his Ministry  leave  the  worker

entirely  on  the  charity  of  the  employer  as  to  how  much

compensation he is to be paid?  The Minister of State says  that

it  will  not  protect the workers to legislate for  payment  of

compensation for workers who have been employed for 10 years  or

more.   Why  will it not?  May I ask the Minister of State  when

will  this Government bring in an Unfair Termination Act so that

an  employee  who  feels that his services have been  terminated

unfairly  may  have it referred and reviewed by a  board,  quite

outside the Ministry, who will then decide what compensation  is

to be paid to the employee?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, I have already

explained   that  under  the  current  law  there  is   adequate

protection for all employees, and if an employee needs any  help

he  can  come to the Ministry.  Under the law, if a  worker  has

worked  for more than three years, he can claim for retrenchment

benefit.   He does not have to work for 10 years.  That was made

very  clear.  If there is any problem relating to the amount  of

compensation paid, he can appeal to the Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>



Labour,  but the amount of compensation payable is dependent  on

the  financial position of the company.  If the company is doing

well  and  retrenches its workers for reasons other  than  being

insolvent, then the Ministry will have to look at the amount  of

compensation that should be paid.  The norm is from two weeks to

one  month's salary for each year of service for companies which

are  able to pay.  So there is adequate protection under the law

and I do not think we need to make any changes at this stage.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I say to the Minister of State that I

was  not  asking  about retrenchment, but  about  workers  whose

services  are  terminated and the law, as I know  it,  does  not

require  the employer to give any reasons.  If he does not  like

the  man's face, he can terminate his services by giving  him  a

month's notice.  So what is the protection?  Why do we not  have

an Unfair Termination Board?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, first, I have mentioned

earlier  that  it  applies to both employer and  employee.   The

employee can also send in his letter of termination and he  need

not give any reasons.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> That is not an answer.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Second, if the employee

feels  that his services have been unfairly terminated,  he  can

appeal  to  the  Ministry which will look into the  reasons  for

termination.  He can appeal to the Minister who will ask for  an

inquiry  to be conducted.  Both parties will be invited  to  the

Ministry.   The  Ministry will study  the  reasons.   If  it  is

unfair,  the  Ministry will ask the employer  to  take  whatever

action  that is needed.  The law provides for this and I do  not

see why the Member is raising this matter.

of SilkAir MI185; whether there is any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>



evidence or suspicion of foul play; and whether families of  the

victims are fairly compensated.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Sir,

investigations on the crash by a team of Indonesian, Singaporean

and  American experts are in progress, both in the United States

and  Indonesia. The task is made more difficult by the  lack  of

useful  data from the two black boxes, despite extensive efforts

by  investigators from the United States National Transportation

and   Safety  Bureau  (NTSB)  and  other  expert  agencies.  The

investigation   team  is  headed  by  Indonesia   and   includes

representatives from Singapore, the US and Australia.   It  will

meet  in  Jakarta soon to review the status of the investigation

and  to  work out a plan for the subsequent investigation  task.

These  tasks include laboratory examination of wreckage  pieces,

reconstruction  of  parts of  the aircraft,  flight  simulations

using  computers  of  flight  simulators,  study  of  the  human

performance aspects, review of flight and maintenance  documents

and further analysis of data from the cockpit voice recorder and

flight   data  recorder.   We  hope  that  this  phase  of   the

investigation  will provide us some clues to the cause  of  this

tragic incident.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of foul play, so far, the team has not

uncovered  any evidence and there is no suspicion of foul  play.

On  the  matter of compensation, I am informed by  SilkAir  that

their lawyer is currently liaising with the legal next-of-kin of

the  deceased.  Compensation will be paid in accordance with the

contract of carriage under international aviation regulations.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

some of these issues.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, as I said in my reply just now, the

experts  will  be  reconvening in Jakarta some time  next  week.

After   they    have  formulated  the  next   phase   of   their

investigation, I will request them to hold a press  briefing  to

explain  the  status  of  the investigation  so  far,  from  the

experts' point of view, and also to brief the public on what  it

intends to do in the next phase.

<div align="center"><b>DIVESTMENT OF GOVERNMENT-LINKED COMPANIES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Minister for Finance, in

light of the fundamental dilemma of public accountability versus

entrepreneurial  risk-taking  which Government-Linked  Companies

(GLCs) face, as well as the Government's long-term intention  of

full  divestment of those companies with commercial  activities,

whether  the  Government  will consider  accelerating  the  full

divestment  of some GLCs or some of the businesses  of  GLCs  by

schemes such as Management Buy-Outs.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Sir, in

principle, the Government is prepared to divest fully its stakes

in  the  GLCs  other  than those of strategic  interest  to  our

defence or our economy.  Other than these strategic investments,

the  rest can be privatised in due course.  However, apart  from

the obvious considerations of market conditions, the pricing and

the capacity of the market to absorb the divestments,  there are

a  number  of  other considerations in deciding whether  we  can

accelerate  the  process  of  divestment.   In  particular,  the

Government  has put in much effort and resources to develop  the

GLCs,  and we would want to divest them in such a way  that  the

issue  of  management succession is properly addressed and  that

there  will  be  either  a  single shareholder  or  a  group  of

shareholders  with  a  significant stake to  provide  management

direction  and  to  grow the company.   This  is  important   as

Government  would  want  the GLC to remain  in  relatively  good

hands.   Government  has also to be fair to the  other  minority

shareholders  of the GLC and be mindful that its divestments  do

not  have  too  adverse an impact on the future of the  company.

This   requirement  will,  however,  slow  down  the  divestment

process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management Buy-Outs (MBOs) are not ruled out as a

divestment  method for GLCs where the Government  has  a  direct

stake.   MBO  is  possible if there is interest  as  well  as  a

willingness  to  take  the business risk  on  the  part  of  the

companies' management and agreement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>



on  reasonable terms of sale.   However, the size  of  the  GLCs

often  makes them beyond the financial resources of managements.

Nevertheless,  besides MBOs, other approaches of divestment  had

been,  and  will  be,  considered when the  terms  of  sale  are

reasonable.    Government   will   continue   to   pursue    its

privatisation and divestment programme in an orderly  manner  as

and when the opportunity presents itself.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b>Sir, in terms of the Government divestment

programme, does the Government also intend to divest management,

and  not  merely  corporatisation?  In other words,  is  it  the

Government's intention to have a full divestment, including that

of management?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I do not quite understand the

Member.   By divesting management, does she mean that Government

has  no  longer any responsibility?  You are talking  about  the

difference  between  corporatization  -

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Corporatisation and full divestment in

terms of management.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Yes, we have, in most cases, gone

the   route  of  full  divestment  without  residual  management

control.   I will give you a few examples of companies which  we

have fully divested and only retained a minimal control.  In the

case  of  Singapore Press Holdings, it has been fully  divested,

except  that  Government holds a golden share because  it  is  a

sensitive  area.  National Iron and Steel Mill has been  totally

divested.  It is in the hands of the public and it has  its  own

management.  The others are UIC, Phillips Petroleum of Singapore

and  so  forth.  So there are many areas where we  have  totally

divested.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, I may be wrong, but it would seem

to  me  that the shares of many of these GLCs belong to  holding

companies that are in turn actually owned by the Government.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> There are some. Can you name some

specific companies that you are concerned about?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> As far as I know, I think Temasek

Holdings actually holds a substantial number of shares  in  many

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>



the  companies that you have mentioned.  To that extent, Temasek

Holdings actually would have a substantial say in terms  of  the

management direction of the company.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> For those where it retains

significant shareholdings, yes.  But for those in which it  does

not hold substantial shareholdings, it would not.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> The Minister has

mentioned  that  the  Government has  still  got  some  residual

control of SPH.  Can I know what sort of control?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> No single person or company can hold

more  than  3% of SPH shares.  And Government holds  one  golden

share  to  ensure that no third party can take over the  company

because of the sensitivity of its operations.  That is all  that

is  controlled.   So  financially,  as  far  as  the  commercial

operations are concerned, Government has no control over it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> What does the Minister mean by "golden

share"?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> One nominal share, but that share

has  overriding powers over the management of the  company.   In

other words, it can determine the Chairman and the Board.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Does it also include the control of

editorial policies?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> No.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> In so far as there are holding

companies,  which are fully owned by the Government, would  also

the  full  divestment  policy of the Government  also  mean  the

relinquishment of control of some of these holding companies, so

that  for  the  GLCs,  for  which these holding  companies  have

substantial  shares, that these become truly  private  companies

where  the  Government  has no say in terms  of  management  and

control?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> What holding companies is the

Member  referring  to?  Temasek is a main holding  company.   In

Temasek's case, it is quite clear.  The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



Government,   through  Temasek,  manages  and   controls   those

companies  in  which  it owns substantial  shares.   What  other

holding companies is the Member referring to?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> This is where I think there is actually

not  very  much  knowledge regarding Temasek  Holdings  and  the

companies  that Temasek Holdings owns.  But as far  as  I  know,

Temasek Holdings actually does have substantial shares in  quite

a  number of GLCs, the extent of which I really do not know.  So

because  of  Temasek  Holdings' share, many of  these  companies

actually  are  seen as Government-linked.  I think  my  question

really  is:  is  it  possible  to cut  off  the  link  from  the

Government  so  that  these companies are no longer  Government-linked companies but become truly private companies?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I suppose that will take place if

Government shareholdings fall significantly below 10%  where  it

becomes  a  minority shareholder and therefore should no  longer

have  any  direct  say on its management.  So that  would  be  a

general  criterion that applies not only to Government companies

but to companies in general.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> In light of public accountability, would

the Government make the accounts of the holding companies public

and transparent, for example, Temasek Holdings?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Temasek does publish its accounts.

But  whether you have full access, it is a different matter.   I

think  we  will consider if it is necessary.  At the moment,  we

would like to preserve our present arrangements.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Why does the Minister say that we want

to  preserve the status quo by not divulging more information on

Temasek Holdings' shareholding position?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I think the number of companies in

which  Temasek Holdings has is, in fact, published  in  a  book.

There is a published book on Government-owned companies in which

all the Government-owned companies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



and  their  subsidiaries  are  published.   And  each  of  these

companies has its own balance sheet and therefore published.  So

you can quite easily aggregate the totals.  I can make this book

available to whichever Member is interested.  The published book

of  Government  holding companies, in which  all  the  companies

belonging  to Temasek Holdings are, in fact, set out,  with  the

Board of Directors, and so forth, and each of these companies in

turn,  particularly  if  they are public companies,  would  have

annual reports.

<div align="center"><b>(Rationale)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  what is the rationale for allowing developers  time

extensions to complete the sales and purchases of state land and

whether  he  will  provide a detailed  list  of  developers  and

particulars of sites that were granted such extensions from 1993

up to the current year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National

Development  (Mr  Koo Tsai Kee) (for the Minister  for  National

Development):  Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I would like to thank the

Member for asking this question to allow the Ministry to clarify

some points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The successful tenderer of a Government land sale site is

required to pay 25% of the land premium within 28 days from  the

date  of  award.  The balance 75% is to be paid within  90  days

from the date of award, or any further period as may be extended

by the Government subject to late interest charges.  These terms

are quite clearly spelt out in the tender conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions for time extensions are made in the tender

conditions  as the successful tenderer may sometimes  require  a

longer  time-frame to arrange financing for the full payment  of

the land premium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1993, a total of 33 cases have been granted extension

of time for land premium.  The breakdown is as follows: 2



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



cases in 1993; 3 in 1994 [these were boom times, I remember]; 16

in 1995; 2 in 1996; 2 in 1997 and recently 1998, 8 cases.  These

eight  cases in 1998 were fully reported in the press  recently.

The  tenderers  were  Centrepoint  Properties  Private  Limited,

Orchard  Terminal  Private Limited, Allgreen Properties  Limited

and  the  joint venture between Allgreen Properties Limited  and

Hoe  Seng  Company  (Private)  Limited.   These  tenderers  have

already made the initial 25% payment and have requested  for  an

extension  to  pay the remaining 75%, subject to  late  interest

charges.

view  of the fact that workers depend on their Central Provident

Fund  to service housing loans and build up savings for Medisave

whether  he will give an assurance that CPF cuts will be allowed

only as the last resort.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the regional economic

crisis  will  affect  Singapore's  growth  this  year.   Barring

further adverse developments, we can expect the economy to grow,

at  between  2.5%  and 4.5%.  This is significantly  lower  than

1997's growth of 7.8%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the situation is unlike in 1985 when we

experienced  negative growth and had to cut back  on  employers'

CPF  contribution  rate.  Arising from the 1985-1986  experience

and  with tripartite support, we had implemented a flexible wage

system.   Today,  76% of Singapore companies  practise  flexible

wage  system with variable components accounting for 16% of  the

total  annual wage cost.  The flexible wage system  was  put  in

place  in anticipation of a period of slow growth, such  as  the

current  situation.  This system enables a company to  trim  its

wage   cost   in  difficult  times  by  reducing  the   variable

components.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies encountering difficulties or poor performance

should first adjust the variable components in order to achieve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



wage  reduction.  They should also look into other cost  cutting

measures in their operations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has no plans to adjust the CPF contribution

rates.   I  would  like to assure the House that the  Government

would  consider the drastic measure of reducing CPF contribution

community improvement projects within their constituencies  they

want  to  support.   Since its inception, the  CIPC  scheme  has

benefited all the CCCs, including the hon. Member, Mr Chiam  See

Tong's area.  In view of the economic downturn in FY 98/99,  the

Government has trimmed  its expenditure on some projects.   CIPC

has  also carried out a review of its budgetary requirement  for

FY 98/99.  Under this review, useful projects from the CCCs will

still continue to receive CIPC funding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of CIPC funds allocated for this financial year,

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> At Potong Pasir. I am only interested

in  Potong Pasir.  I understand that they have been applying for

CIPC funds for two covered linkways.  Is it still on?

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry has not

received  a formal submission from the Potong Pasir CCC.   So  I

have  no record of a submission on the walkway.  But the  Potong

Pasir  CCC was given CIPC funds in financial year 1995 for  five

estate landmarks in the signposts in Sennett Estate, which is  a

non-HDB  common  area.  If the hon. Member for Potong  Pasir  is

asking whether his CCC has applied for a walkway, I have no such

record.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I wish to clarify. I have got no CCC

at  Potong  Pasir.   I am talking about the  only  CCC  that  is

existing in Potong Pasir and whether they have put in a  request

for  funds.  Because I know they have circulated notices  asking

whether  they  will get the support of the residents  there.   I

imagine that they would be putting in their case.

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> My Ministry has not received any formal

December 2001



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



and (b) whether there is any plan to build a secondary school in

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the Ministry of Education has plans to  build  33

new secondary schools over the next five years, ie, from now  up

to  year  2002.  These 33 new secondary schools are to implement

the single-session programme for secondary schools as well as to

meet  additional  secondary  school places  requirement  due  to

projected higher secondary school enrolment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no plans to build a secondary school within Bukit

Gombak Constituency.  This is because a secondary school site is

not available within the constituency.  However, a new secondary

school is being built at Bukit Batok East Avenue 3.  This is for

the  relocation  of Yusof Ishak Secondary School,  which  is  at

present at Clementi.  This new school will be completed  by  the

end  of 1998 and is well placed to serve the residents in  Bukit

Gombak  Constituency.  The school is less than 400  metres  from

the  housing  area at Bukit Batok East Avenue 2 in Bukit  Gombak

<div align="center"><b>POLYCLINICS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Costs of operation)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Health by

how much have the costs of operating polyclinics gone up in 1997

over 1996.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Aline K. Wong)</b>

<b>(for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the operating

cost  of  the polyclinics is estimated to increase by  9%,  from

$59.9  million  in  FY96  to $65.3 million  in  FY97.   This  is

comparable  to  the average rate of increase of  8.7%  over  the

previous three years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in operating cost is mainly due to manpower

cost  increases  as  well as higher prices paid  for  drugs  and

vaccines,   x-ray  and  laboratory  tests  and  maintenance   of

equipment and polyclinic premises.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister of State: was it not

possible to find



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



savings  from the other Ministries to meet this increased  cost,

rather than pass the increase on to users of these polyclinics?

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> If it had been possible, we would have done

it.   But our policy is to implement small but regular revisions

in  our fees in order to catch up with the rise in cost.   Costs

have  risen across the board.  So this is to catch up  with  the

rise  in  costs as well as to reach closer to our cost  recovery

targets.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister aware that in the

Supplementary  Estimates that are to be debated this  afternoon,

the Government was able to find something like $400 million from

other Ministries to meet the shortfall in defence?

be  considered for its own funding and for primary health  care,

we have been giving it the kind of resources that we require.

any  action will be taken against any of the directors of Keppel

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee)</b>

<b>(for the Minister for Law):</b> Sir, the Public Prosecutor has the

discretion to decide whether he will prosecute in any particular

case.  The Public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>



Prosecutor decides on these matters based on the law, the  facts

of  the  case,  the  reports  of the investigating  agency,  the

available evidence and the public interests involved.   In  this

particular case, the Public Prosecutor decided that the  company

should be prosecuted, not the employees who gave the bribes.  He

did  so  after considering all the facts of the case,  including

the fact that they did not act for their own personal gain.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The Minister of State can be assured that I

know  that it is the Public Prosecutor's decision.  But  may  we

know  why was it not thought necessary to prosecute the Managing

Director  and  at least one other director who would  appear  to

have been actively involved in giving this bribe to Mr Cornelius

van  der Horst?  Is the Minister aware that, under section  6(b)

of the Prevention of Corruption Act, it is the person who should

be  prosecuted?   I  know the Interpretation Act  says  "person"

includes  "companies".  But may we know why these directors  are

being let off?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Like I said in my answer, under

the  Constitution,  the discretion to prosecute  lies  with  the

Public  Prosecutor.  So he has considered all the facts  of  the

case,  including, like I said in my answer, the  fact  that  the

directors  did  not  act  for their own personal  gain.   Having

considered  all these factors, he has decided to prosecute  only

the company.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I know whether Parliament should not be

told  what are these facts upon which the Public Prosecutor made

this  decision?  May I also ask whether any attempt will be made

to  recover the $8.3 million that was lost to the company  as  a

result of the directors giving the monies away in bribes?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the decision of the Public

Prosecutor  in  individual cases should not be  the  subject  of

Parliamentary scrutiny.  As I mentioned just now, in every case,

depending  on the merits of the case, the Public Prosecutor  has

to  decide based on the law, the facts of the case, the  reports

of the agency, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



available evidence and the public interests involved.   I  think

that  is the assurance that we have - that the Public Prosecutor

would  exercise his discretion judiciously, carefully and indeed

wisely.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I know from the Minister of State, in

view  of  his  answer, are we to understand that the  Government

will  condone  companies giving bribes to foreign  companies  or

organisations to secure contracts and let the directors go scot-free every time this happens?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the Government's position

on   corruption  is  very  clear.   The  Government's  stand  on

corruption  is  very  tough.  We have in fact  fared  very  well

internationally  in terms of this criterion.   So  there  is  no

question of letting people off if they are corrupt.  But, like I

said,  in any particular case, the Public Prosecutor would  have

to  consider all the factors and decide first whether or not  to

prosecute and, if so, who to prosecute.

flexibility of

<div align="center"><b>FILMS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Information and the Arts (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995, I spoke in this House about flyers being stuffed

into  HDB letterboxes offering pornographic video tapes for sale

to residents.  Sometimes, young children were used as runners to

distribute such flyers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, what has become "hot" are VCDs - video compact

discs.  Uncensored



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



VCDs,  including  new releases which are not  yet  available  in

stores,  are sold at pasar malams, trade fairs and other places.

A  number of these are obscene.  Most have been smuggled in.  Of

the  raids  conducted by the Board of Film  Censors  (BFC)  last

year, 20% of the items seized were obscene.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC officers report that the illegal profits are very high.

Even  after BFC raids, the sellers would be back the  next  day,

selling the same obscene VCDs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current penalties are clearly not of sufficient

deterrence.   In this Bill, we are therefore proposing  enhanced

penalties.   For example, for the first offence,  the  fine  for

distributing  obscene films or videos will  be  doubled  from  a

minimum  of  $1,000  to $2,000 per film, and  the  maximum  from

$40,000  to  $80,000.  For the possession of obscene  films  and

videos,  the  minimum  fine will also be doubled  from  $500  to

$1,000  per  film,  up  to a maximum of $40,000.   We  are  also

proposing  that the penalty for exhibiting obscene films  should

be  increased  from  a minimum of $1,000 per  film  to  $10,000,

regardless  of the number of films.  The enhanced penalties  are

aimed  at  those who profit from the distribution  and  sale  of

obscene videos and VCDs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also proposing some new provisions to further

control  the  trade in obscene videos.  To deter the  inflow  of

obscene  videos through custom checkpoints, we propose, for  the

first  offence, a minimum fine of $1,000 per film and/or a  jail

term  not  exceeding  one year.   To deter  the  duplication  of

obscene films/videos, a lump sum minimum fine of $20,000  and/or

jail term not exceeding two years is proposed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although e-mails have been included under the definition of

electronic  transmission, MITA has no intention to intrude  into

private  communications.  The inclusion of e-mails is to  enable

enforcement  action  to  be taken when individuals  complain  of

obscene  films  sent  to them via e-mail.   Under  the  proposed

amendments,  electronic  transmission  is  covered   under   the

definition of "supply" in both the Films Act and the Undesirable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



Publications Act.  Adapted from New Zealand law, it is  intended

to  cover  the  electronic transmission of films  which  do  not

involve the supply of physical copies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to do this. The market place is changing rapidly.

In  the  US, cinema chain operators now transmit newly  released

movies  electronically, without the need for film  reels.   Even

individuals  can  package films and disseminate  them  over  the

Internet,  especially when broadband becomes  widely  available.

Our  focus, however, is on those who try to profit from  selling

pornographic material in Singapore, not individuals  who  chance

upon such material.

<br><br><i>Protection of minors</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our concern is particularly for the young. We should have

no  sympathy  for  those who use children to distribute  obscene

videos  or  VCDs.  Under existing laws, it is hard  to  penalise

operators who use children in this way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we have specifically inserted a new section 29C

which will allow additional penalties to be imposed on those who

exploit  children  in  the  making, import  or  distribution  of

obscene  films.   In  other words, those  who  make,  import  or

distribute obscene films commit offences and are liable  to  the

penalties set out in new section 29.  In addition, if  they  use

children  in  committing the offences, they would be  liable  to

additional penalties under the new section 29C.

<br><br><i>New technology</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Films Act was enacted in 1981, 17

years  ago, before the advent of new technologies like  CD-ROMs,

enhanced CDs, VCDs and DVDs.  We are redefining "films" to cover

these  new technologies.  Under the redefinition, computer  file

formats  with  extensions like .mpg, .dat,  .avi  and  .mov  are

considered as films because they comprise moving images  similar

to what is found in a movie or video.

<br><br><i>Political films</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 1996, the Government rejected an application from

the SDP for a licence to sell party political video-tapes.  The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



Government rejected the application because political videos are

an  undesirable medium for political debate in Singapore.  In  a

political  video,  political issues can  be  sensationalised  or

presented in a manner calculated to evoke emotional rather  than

rational  reactions.   Videos also do not  allow  for  effective

rebuttals.   There  is  also a risk that  political  debates  on

serious matters will be reduced to a contest between advertising

agencies, as indeed has already happened in some countries.  Our

intention is to keep political debates in Singapore serious  and

not  have  them become like the selling of soap.  The Films  Act

will  therefore include a provision to disallow the distribution

and  exhibition  of  party political films  in  Singapore.   The

penalty  for those infringing this provision is set at a maximum

of $100,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restriction pertains only to party political films.

Although  this will affect all political parties,  it  will  not

affect the freedom of political debate in Singapore.  There  are

already  sufficient avenues for political parties to  get  their

views, platforms and manifestos across to the public.  Political

parties can print newspapers, publish books and post webpages on

the Internet.  Debates in Parliament are reported over radio, TV

and  in  the  newspapers.  During general  elections,  political

parties are also free to hold rallies and dialogue sessions, and

are  given free broadcasting airtime in proportion to the number

of candidates they field.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed amendments to the Films Act

and  indeed to the Undesirable Publications Act, which  I  spoke

about  last  week,  are made in response to rapid  technological

advances.   We have to extend our various Acts - the Undesirable

Publications  Act,  the  Films Act, the Newspaper  and  Printing

Presses  Act and the Singapore Broadcasting Authority Act  -  to

cover  the new media forms.  We have decided to take it  Act  by

Act  and  not go for an omnibus legislation covering the  entire

media  field because the technology is still unfolding  and  the

problems cannot all be foreseen.  We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



should move step by step, be guided by practical experience  and

not be too ambitious in our legislation of new laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to amending the laws, we are also restructuring

the  censorship  process in MITA.  From 1st April,  the  current

Board  of Film Censors, the Censorship Section and the Licensing

Section  in MITA HQ will be merged into a new department  called

the  Films and Publications Department (FPD).  FPD will offer  a

one-stop  service  for the public for all matters  dealing  with

publications  and  films.   The Films Act  and  the  Undesirable

Publications Act will be administered under one roof by the same

group of officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not our object to increase the level of censorship in

Singapore.   As  I said in the debate on the amendments  to  the

Undesirable  Publications Act last week,  just  maintaining  the

existing level of censorship is difficult enough.  What we  need

is  a  practical  approach and do only what  is  feasible.   For

example,  certain categories of videos like those  intended  for

children or for training of company personnel are now completely

exempted from censorship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased that attention has been drawn to the

advancement  of technology which has made the proliferation  and

dissemination of obscene and objectionable films easier and more

extensive.   We are aware of the tremendous impact  that  moving

images  have on our impressionable youths.  And that  access  to

such  objectionable  and  obscene materials  has  been  enhanced

through  the  use of new media like CD-ROMs, computer  diskettes

and  electronic transmissions.  In this light, the  redefinition

of  "film"  in  the Bill serves to ensure that the term  remains

relevant today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the numerous seizures of obscene materials by the

police  and  the extensive publicity by the media over  how  the

peddlers of obscene material flagrantly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



distribute  their catalogues, even directly to the mailboxes  of

residents  in  the  security  of  their  homes,  show  that  the

deterrent  effect,  as  the Minister has explained,  of  current

measures is grossly inadequate.  And it is appropriate to revise

the penalties now, last reviewed in 1981.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill also serves to address the cynical attempts

by  such  peddlers  to  circumvent the enforcement  of  the  law

through  the  exploitation  of minors  in  the  distribution  of

obscene films.  As such, we are encouraged that section 29C,  as

the Minister has explained, puts the onus on the part of persons

having  custody  of the children to be directly accountable  for

their action.  And the use of children as couriers in this trade

is deplorable and we hope that the authorities can make full use

of this provision to act against the principals behind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I am supportive of the measures tabled in this

Bill  to tackle obscene films and protect public decency,  there

may  appear,  in our haste to stem out such negative  films,  an

unduly  onerous  provision,  and this  is  with  regard  to  the

forfeiture  clause  in  section 16 of the  Bill  that  seeks  to

retain any deposit put up by promoters and distributors of films

for classification and censorship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe there is already a fee to be paid for

submitting   films  for  classification.   By   including   this

forfeiture provision, I wonder whether this would deter real and

genuine promoters and artists from wanting to submit artistic or

commendable films for classification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that we are actively promoting and marketing

Singapore  as  a  centre for the arts and to be the  renaissance

capital  of Asia via the International Arts and Films  Festival,

which  contributes  both to the development of  the  local  arts

scene  as well as tourism, there is concern that in our  attempt

to  eradicate  negative  films, we  may  indirectly  stifle  the

genuine  growth of the arts scene in Singapore.  I am  therefore

of  the  view that this provision should be reassessed, as  they

appear anathema to our goal of being the regional arts and media

centre.  And I submit to the Minister that perhaps an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



appeal  process  or  an exemption process for classification  of

films for the films festivals and arts events be provided for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we note that there has been some disquiet over the

extension  of  the  Films Act to disallow the  distribution  and

exhibition   of  political  videos.   It  cannot   be   stressed

sufficiently that the national interest is upheld given that the

application  of  the Act across the political spectrum  is  even

handed.   By  disallowing the debate on political issues  to  be

conducted through the medium of videos, both the ruling party as

well  as  opposition parties surrender their access to  what  is

effectively  an  efficient  but  dangerous  means  of   debating

political issues, as there is no room for immediate rebuttal  in

a  partisan video.  The impact of the use of such mass media  by

special  interest groups with agendas inimical to the well-being

and  stability of society has been thoroughly researched in many

other  countries.  The speed, the intensity and  the  impression

that   can   convey  in  a  15-second  film   tape   cannot   be

underestimated.   Similarly, the tremendous damage  to  society,

based  on distortion of the truth through sensationalisation  in

this 15-second film tape, can undermine years of nation building

and it would be almost impossible to unravel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a multi-cultural, multi-religious and multi-racial

small  society like ours, the second best solution of a  blanket

ban  across-the-board serves better to secure  the  cohesiveness

and  stability  of our country than allowing the  free  flow  of

information and views which need not necessarily be conducive to

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while western liberals argue that in a market place of

information,  the good ideas will prevail and will  outlive  the

bad,  and  that the truth will prevail over time,  there  is  no

guarantee that this will happen here in Singapore.  We  are  too

small  a  country to risk the consequences that a small partisan

populist posture and a medium with so much influence can  do  as

we  cannot  afford to make mistakes in the path that our  nation

takes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am aware of the concern that the scope for genuine

political debate is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



limited by this measure.  However, I am pleased to note that  in

this  Bill  there  are clear avenues open  for  such  debate  to

continue  unabated,  as  explained  by  the  Minister.   It   is

specified  in  new  section 2(3)(a) of  the  Bill  that  current

affairs  films are deemed non-political, and that is good  news.

This  clarity  is  certainly useful as we  consciously  seek  to

promote  Singapore as a media hub.  Similarly, while  this  Bill

effectively  prevents  political advertising,  it  respects  the

integrity  of  the  terms of political debate  in  Singapore  by

preventing  serious discussion from degenerating  into  a  sound

byte and a video clip or a contest between advertising agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in our effort to be comprehensive towards the

eradication  of  the  use of such medium  to  conduct  political

debate,   there   is  a  grey  area  and  uncertainty   in   the

interpretation of the Bill.  New section 2(b)(vi) defines a film

directed  towards a political end in Singapore as  one  where  a

current  policy  of  the  Government  or  an  issue  of   public

controversy  in Singapore is involved.  Sir, on  this  point,  I

would like to seek clarification from the Minister as to how the

provision  of  this  clause applies to the advertising  and  the

promotion of Government policies and public education drives  by

the  various Ministries.  Furthermore, would there be scope  for

appeal and exemptions for contributions by interest groups  that

behave  in  a responsible manner whose main aim is the education

and  the promotion of desirable causes, such as the professional

bodies, Action for AIDS, the AWARE group, among others?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The severity of the present draft could be counter-productive towards the development of a civil society and the

encouragement of more Singaporeans to participate and contribute

in  our  nation's  development.  I  would  like  the  Minister's

comments on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is also not very clear in the Bill, and this is

also  a  matter of concern among some Singaporeans, whether  the

party  political broadcast or the air-time given by  TCS  during

the election campaign is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



affected by the Bill in question.  For the people who are voting

and wishing to be informed in a medium accessible to them during

campaign time, perhaps a provision could be made in the Bill for

such broadcasts during election campaign to be allowed.  I think

the  Bill  is not very clear on this.  Perhaps the Minister  may

wish to clarify.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I support the Bill and I hope the

Minister  will  be able to clarify some of the concerns  that  I

have raised.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, this

Bill  to amend the Films Act to address the deficiencies in  the

law  arising from technological developments and advancement has

two  main  focuses:   (1) to prohibit and  deter  the  trade  in

obscene   film,   and  (2)  to  prohibit  the  import,   making,

distribution and exhibition of party political film.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first issue, Sir, on obscene film, I support the

stand  taken  to  ensure  and preserve  the  high  standards  of

morality  and decency.  In this regard, the proposal to increase

the  penalties for making such films must be supported.  I  must

compliment  the  Minister  for the  tough  stand  taken  against

persons  who allow children and young persons to be involved  in

the  production,  distribution or exhibition of  obscene  films.

The  penalties  in  terms of fines and imprisonment  are  indeed

severe.   But  they are necessary.  Children and  young  persons

must  never be tempted into such undesirable acts.  We have  the

responsibility  to  ensure that children and  young  persons  in

Singapore  are not corrupted by sleaze and obscenity.   We  must

strive and continue to make Singapore the best possible place to

raise our children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the proposal to increase the membership of

the  Films  Appeal Committee from nine to 15.   They  are  given

powers to overturn decisions of public officers of the Board  of

Film  Censors.  Their participation marks a step  in  the  right

direction  of having more civic participation in the  censorship

process and institutionalising such a process in the legislation

for    greater    accountability   and   transparency.     Civic

participation is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



necessary  in order to ensure that public officers, in  carrying

out  their work, are guided by the relevant social and  cultural

attitudes of our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second issue: to make it an offence to make,

reproduce,  distribute and exhibit any party political  film  is

something  different altogether.  In the past,  this  House  has

seen  many changes and amendments made to various Bills to  take

advantage of technological changes.  In this instance,  however,

it  is  my  view that technology which could have been  used  to

improve  communication  between  political  parties  and   their

electorate  is somewhat unnecessarily prohibited.   Singaporeans

have  become  very interested in their politics.  They  want  to

know  more  about the issues of the state. Contrary  to  earlier

perceptions,  Singaporeans  are not  disinterested  or  pathetic

about  politics  in  Singapore.  They want  more  communication.

They  want to be better informed.  Increasing the means and mode

of  communication  is one such way.  Films  and  videos  provide

additional  and more effective means of communication  and  this

must be further encouraged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we do not want is excessive politicking, intruding

into  our bedrooms through political broadcasts and advertising.

What  we  do  not  want is wrong information or  misinformation.

What  we  do not want is clandestine making and distribution  of

films which will cause instability, racial disharmony, panic and

rumour-mongering.  However, Sir, we have existing legislation to

deal  with  such abuses.  We have already limited the amount  of

money  that  political  parties spend during  elections  or  for

political  campaigns.  We can limit the time  political  parties

advertise  or  even  broadcast on radio or television.   In  any

case,  Sir,  we  do  not  have  too  many  competing  radio  and

television stations to cause these problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also other legal recourse. For those who are

guilty  of defamation, my suggestion is to sue them.  For  those

who are guilty of causing racial disharmony and instability, the

Internal Security Act and the Maintenance of Religious



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



Harmony  Act have adequate provisions to deal with such  issues.

For  those who breach ethics of broadcasting and journalism,  we

can  bring  them  to task either through a panel  consisting  of

professional media persons or from the Elections Department.  By

all   means, Sir, we should treat the message and the  messenger

severely if this is necessary and appropriate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, Sir, the Bill defines "party political film"

extremely broadly.  A ban would extend to any film made  by  any

person, not just by political parties, as long as it is directed

towards  any  political  end in Singapore.   This  includes  any

partisan  or  biased  references  to   Government  policies   or

controversial  public  issues.  The amendment  is  sweeping  and

vague.  Personally, I do not see a problem if the publication of

Petir or Hammer be made into a video or compact disk.  Yet  such

a video would be illegal.  In fact, it would take much less than

that to run foul of the proposed law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fear for the implication it has on the arts in Singapore.

On  literal interpretation, it would seem that even a movie like

"12  Storeys", which was Singapore's proud contribution to  last

year's International Films Festival, could get the producers  in

trouble.   "12-Storeys"  included humorous  and  often  critical

references  to  toilet flushing laws, the  SDU  and  many  other

Government  policies.  With the new law,  it  looks  as  if  the

producers and distributors of such creative works could be fined

or jailed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, I am assured that although the proposed law is

extremely  sweeping, the Minister will assure  us  that  we  can

trust  the  Government  to apply it very selectively,  and  that

producers  and distributors like that of "12 Storeys"  would  be

safe.  But this is not a satisfactory way for the legislature to

deal  with such issues.  If we believe in the rule of law,  then

laws   that  are  passed  by  this  House  must  be  clear   and

transparent.  They must not be so sweeping and vague that in the

end  it  is  entirely up to the Minister's discretion whether  a

person  has  broken the law.  Unfortunately,  this  is  how  the

amendment to the Films Act is written or perceived.  In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



fact,   if  the  Bill  is  taken  literally,  even  some  recent

television commercials produced by the Government could probably

be  banned.   For  example,  in 1996, before  the  last  general

election,  there  were television commercials  highlighting  the

role  of  public  service in keeping Singapore  running.   Since

public  service was one anticipated election issue, it could  be

argued  that this television commercial was "directed towards  a

political end, and that it contained partisan comments on issues

of public controversy."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would be unfortunate if such videos are stopped

simply because of this legislation.  On the other hand, if  such

campaigns are going to continue, and I think it should, how  are

these videos going to be exempted from the ban?  Therefore,  one

objection to this Bill is that it is too broad and vague.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill would deny opposition parties one way to reach out

to  citizens  and  inform them about their political  platforms.

Although  this  Bill  affects both the PAP  and  the  opposition

parties  equally,  there is a general perception  that  the  PAP

already  has  many ways of reaching the public.  The  television

companies and the Radio Corporation of Singapore are Government-owned.    The   newspapers  maintain  pro-Government   editorial

policies.   For opposition parties, video tapes are perhaps  one

tiny  way to redress this imbalance. To deny them, Sir, of  this

small opportunity, is unnecessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, on the second issue, Sir, I appeal to the

Minister  sincerely to give party political films  a  chance  in

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I agree to the

measures  on the amendment on the obscene films.  I  think  they

are  a step in the right direction.  I applaud the Minister  for

the  good  and  increased use of citizen panels in judging  what

films  should  be treated as obscene.  Let me then  turn  to  my

points  of  concern.   This relates to the fact  that  the  Bill

intends  to ban advertisements by any political party  or  films

directed  towards  political end, such  as  attempts  to  affect

voting in an election.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am well aware that I am not a politician, nor an

elected Member of this House.  I speak as a citizen, as a  voter

and I have been a commentator at the last general elections as a

member  of the Roundtable.  As a background to what I am saying,

Sir,  may I briefly refer to the comment by the NCMP in the last

meeting  of  the House where he said that one of  the  NMPs  was

taking  up cudgels for the Government.  My view in making  these

comments is that Nominated Members of Parliament such as  myself

are  neither for the Government nor against it, neither  pro-PAP

nor anti-PAP.  We try, at least I try, to look at the merits  of

what  is proposed in a non-partisan way, and today I have  tried

to  consider the Minister's arguments very seriously.  I do  see

his point that there are other avenues of debate available.  But

my  conviction is that I must stand against this Bill in respect

of  the  amendments concerning these prohibitions against  party

political  films,  especially in section 29D  as  proposed.   My

objection  is both on principles and on the particulars  of  the

amendments.  Let me turn first to the principles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, free and fair elections should be one of the great

hallmarks of Singapore's politics.  It is something we  can  and

should  be  proud about as much as our GNP per capita or  Changi

Airport.  Competition between political parties in free and fair

elections  is  what  validates the  PAP's  continued  return  to

Government.   Because of this, a PAP victory must be  recognised

not  only  by those who support the present Government  but  all

those  who  have contested or voted in the election.   It  is  a

question  of  legitimacy.   Conversely,  an  unfair  or   unfree

election makes victory hollow.  For free and fair elections, the

maximum width for political speech should be allowed.  Political

free speech has a value.  It is the way in which good ideas  are

recognised and adopted while bad ideas are rejected.  Article 14

of  our  Constitution recognises this.  It enshrines  that  each

citizen  should enjoy freedom of speech.  In practice, I believe

this  Government  has  always believed in  rational  and  robust

debate.   Yes,  there are recognised limits for statements  that

would jeopardise public order, incite racial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



hatred,   falsehoods,  or  statements  that  damage   individual

reputation.   But  these  exceptions  should  be  just  that   - exceptions.   And  that is the first reason I  am  against  this

Bill's ban on party political films.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ban does not restrict itself to films that threaten

this sense of public order, racial harmony or other common good.

It  is  much  more  broadly stated, too  broadly  stated  in  my

opinion.  Even an innocuous statement such as, "Vote for me  and

I  will  upgrade  housing." - this if said by a political  party

would  be subject to a ban.  It seems to me that the Bill is  so

widely  drawn  that  even the usual party  political  broadcasts

during  the  election would be potentially subject to  the  ban.

These  are telecasts by TCS.  Of course, broadcasting itself  is

accepted  under the proposed section 2(2)(b).  But the recording

of  the broadcast on film, video or other material record  could

be  an offence since each party in turn calls for people to vote

for  them and it therefore is partisan within the meaning of the

proposed section 2(2)(a).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have suggested, or may say, that this Bill is fair

because  it  applies to all parties in Singapore, including  the

party  in power.  This is an equal law on the face of it -  that

is true.  However, it has an unequal impact.  The PAP is, to put

it  mildly, well-known, for what it has done in the past and the

work  of  the  current Government.  The Workers' Party  and  the

Singapore  People's  Party  too have  their  representatives  in

Parliament.   But  other political parties are  not  represented

here  and  are  less  well-known.  They  cannot  showcase  their

abilities or, in some cases, their disabilities.  There is  also

the consistent public perception that the media in Singapore  is

pro-Government.   Several surveys have  shown  that  the  public

thinks  this is so.  In this context, this equal law  will  have

unequal impact.  That is the second reason I stand against  this

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But more than its impact on different political parties,

Sir,  I  oppose  this Bill for the effect it  can  have  on  the

citizens  of  Singapore.  I think that as Singapore  enters  the

21st  century,  we  should strive towards  a  greater  political

maturity.  Part of that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



maturity  is to increasingly allow people to discern things  for

themselves.  To do that, we need a system that allows  ideas  to

be  communicated as well as their rebuttals and  their  counter-rebuttals.   By banning this avenue for political  free  speech,

this  Bill  moves  in the wrong direction.  It shields  citizens

like  children,  rather  than prepares them  to  be  mature  and

discerning.  This Government has been the one that has asked  us

to  be a thinking nation.  Critical thought should apply to  all

fields,  including the political choice that  a  citizen  makes.

This is the third reason I am against the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these three reasons, rather than passing the Bill as it

stands, what I believe we should do is to, first, require  party

political  films to observe basic limits, such as the  avoidance

of  falsehoods,  incitement  against  public  order  and  racial

harmony,  and  defamatory remarks.  Secondly, we should  control

the  broad  parameters of what party political films can  do  by

fixing  expenses, length, the time they can be  distributed  and

exhibited and the numbers perhaps that each party can reproduce,

exhibit  and  distribute.  And thirdly, we should  take  up  the

citizen  panels which are used for other films and  establish  a

citizens' board which will license the political films.  This is

what  is  done  for  other  films,  including  those  which  are

potentially  considered  obscene.   Political  films  should  be

treated in the same way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are my three points and principles why I am against

this Bill, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move now to the particulars, and these relate

generally to the over-wide definitions that trouble me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in the proposed section 2(2)(b), the use of the word

"partisan".   The  word  "partisan" is  defined  by  the  Oxford

Concise Dictionary as being, "an adherent of party, cause,  etc,

especially   unreasoning  one."   I  think  if   there   is   an

"unreasoning  one",  an  unreasonable point  of  view,  that  is

something we can agree on.  But the meaning of "partisan" in the

earlier part is broad enough to encompass sincere and reasonable

beliefs, and I think these should be allowed rather than  caught

in this over-wide definition.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the list of examples provided in the Bill,

particularly  the  proposed section  2(2)(b),  I  believe  these

examples  are  over-wide.   Section  2(2)(b)  bans  films   that

question  current Government policy.  This potentially handicaps

valid  criticisms,  and  valid  criticism  is  the  way  society

improves.   For example, a Talking Point programme  that  covers

present review of the financial sector and features interviewees

who  support  or  propose more changes could be caught  by  this

Bill.   There is an exception, as other speakers have noted,  of

reporting of current events in section 2(3).  But, arguably, the

show  I have imagined goes beyond this protection.  It does more

than report because it provides opinion as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will consider excluding the subclause

and  permitting films that discuss current policies, or to allow

films  directed primarily at reform of existing laws or policies

by legal means.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third detail which concerns me is in the proposed

section  2(2)(a)  and  (2)(b).  This is  the  use  of  the  word

"partly".  These sub-sections mean that the Bill captures  films

that are not only wholly but also partly within the definitions.

I  would  urge  that  the Bill be narrowed  to  films  that  are

"substantially", rather than "partly".  If it  is  not,  a  film

that  is almost wholly innocuous may run foul because of a  very

short, minor section.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may argue that these over-wide definitions can be left

to  the  discretion  of the authorities to take  care  of.   And

therefore  the  examples that I have given are  moot,  TCS  film

makers will be saved.  But I caution against this approach.  One

function  of  the  law  must be to guide  people's  actions  and

expectations of future action.  Over-wide definitions fail to do

this.   Instead, they create uncertainty.  No one knows  whether

they  are  in  the wrong, or even if they are, if they  will  be

prosecuted.   Giving the authorities excessive  discretion  does

not help the situation.  It can lead to perception that our laws

are  not equal or transparently applied to all.  As compared  to

these over-wide definitions that I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



mentioned,  I  think  that the Bill omits mention  of  the  most

obvious and acceptable limits to party political films or indeed

any  free political speech in Singapore, that is, the limits  of

common  good  I  have  mentioned,  such  as  incitement  against

political  order and racial harmony.  These should be  put  into

the Bill for clarity and completeness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, my view is that our democracy

thrives  on free and fair elections, that all political  parties

need  a chance to reach out to the citizens.  Citizens on  their

part  need  to hear political parties to decide for  themselves.

Different means of communication are available, of which I agree

film  is just one.  But though it is just one, I urge the  House

to  consider that with proper licensing and limits, this  avenue

need  not  and  should  not be closed.   Public  discussion  and

debate,  the ability of politicians to convince and the  ability

of citizens to discern are things we must all believe in.  It is

something I have always thought this Government has believed in,

and  has been very successful at doing.  I urge the Minister and

this  House  to  apply this approach to party  political  films.

Don't ban them.  Convince the citizens.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support the Bill.  I believe there is a need for us to plug some

of  the  loopholes  which have surfaced over the  years  due  to

changes  in  technology as well as to strengthen  the  deterrent

effect  of  the Act through increased penalties.  New provisions

to  prevent  the use of minors in obscene video trafficking  are

also  timely.   I believe these provisions dealing with  obscene

films  and videos need no further discussion, as evident in  the

statements made by Members earlier.  However, the Bill also sets

forth new provisions dealing with political films and videos.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When assessing this part of the Bill, the basic question

that  we need to ask is what sort of political life we want  for

Singapore.   There  are  currently  various  avenues  and  ample

opportunities for political parties to disseminate  their  ideas

and  programmes.   Political parties  can  publish  newsletters,

books, and periodicals at any time of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>



year.   During  election  time,  they  are  given  air  time  to

broadcast   their  message  and  programmes  to  the   Singapore

electorate.   While  there  are those  who  decry  the  lack  of

opportunities, I believe political parties do, in fact, have the

opportunities to provide Singaporeans with detailed and in-depth

information through publications and broadcasts.  So  the  point

made  by  the hon. NMP, Mr Simon Tay, of unequal impact may  not

bear with altogether.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I do agree that at first sight the restriction on

political videos and films may appear heavy-handed.  However, on

further  reflection, I do believe that Singaporeans would  agree

that it is better to put the cap on the genie than to let it out

of  the  bottle.  Highly visual media such as videos  present  a

greater   danger   as   manipulatory   propaganda   tools   than

publications.   Visuals can have an impact that  far  overshadow

and even distort the substantive issues or messages raised in  a

campaign.  The excesses of American political campaigning made a

very big impression on me during my stay in the US.  During  the

presidential  contest between Michael Dukakis and  George  Bush,

the  Republicans  launched  an  advertisement  which  in  effect

reduced  Dukakis' prison reform programmes to that of  releasing

unrepentant  and dangerous prisoners.  The famous Willie  Horton

advertisement highlighted the case of Willie Horton - a prisoner

who  committed a crime shortly after being released on a weekend

furlough programme in Massachusetts, which was the home state of

Dukakis.   The  advertisement was aired continuously  throughout

the  campaign  and  this led to a significant opinion  shift  to

George  Bush.   Dukakis' prison programme and  crime  prevention

record  as  a  whole  went largely unexamined  by  the  American

public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Willie Horton case illustrates, the use of videos

can  lead  to  the  sensationalisation of issues,  reducing  the

contest of ideas to a process similar to that of selling soap or

detergent.   I  do  not  think  we want  political  contests  in

Singapore  to  go down that road.  Yes, we need to  protect  the

Singapore electorate.  Yes, there will be those who will  argue,

such as Mr Simon Tay, that Singaporeans are smart enough



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>



to  discern the honest leader from the snake oil salesman.   But

do  we  really want to take our chances and then have to  repair

the  damages?  Even in a mature democracy such as the US,  slick

political  advertising  can mislead  the  electorate.   I  would

rather   that   we   take  proactive  steps   to   ensure   that

sensationalism  and  demagogic appeals  have  no  place  in  our

political  process.  At the same time, we must also ensure  that

Singaporeans have adequate means of examining political  parties

and  their  programmes for themselves.  Parties can now  publish

newsletters,  books and periodicals to disseminate their  ideas,

programmes  or opinions on current policies.  Parties  can  also

broadcast  their  local messages during  election  time.   These

dissemination  opportunities need to be kept open and  protected

to  ensure  a healthy contest of ideas.  This amendment  is,  in

fact,  a  reflection of an ongoing process in our  society.   As

society changes and new technology develops, we would need to re-examine our regulatory framework for political discourse.   This

re-examination will need to seek the proper balance between  the

need  to  provide  political parties  with  the  opportunity  to

disseminate the ideas and stimulate political discussion and the

need to prevent the McDonaldization of political campaigning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even though I support this amendment, I do have some

concerns.   Under the leadership of our Prime Minister,  Mr  Goh

Chok  Tong, we are moving towards a more participatory-style  of

Government.   It  is an attempt to involve more  people  at  all

levels  in  order to create a thinking nation.  Given  this  new

thrust  or  attempt  to  create a more  participatory  political

culture, we should ensure that any legislation must be clear and

precise  in  setting  the  parameters of unacceptable  political

activities.   We must ensure that non-partisan groups,  such  as

those  raised by Mr Chew Heng Ching, which can make  a  positive

contribution to policy-making are not frozen out of the process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulation of political life is not borne out of a

desire   to  simply  restrict  political  discussion.    Rather,

regulations are needed to ensure that the Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



electorate is given a fair and honest chance to examine  parties

and  their  manifestoes and ideas.  If we allow parties  to  use

videos,  we  endanger  what we have achieved  thus  far  in  our

political life.  Do we really want this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say, at the

outset, that I support the Films (Amendment) Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modern technology allows for the production of films which

is   a   result  of  camera  tricks  and,  worse,  the   digital

manipulation  of figures and pictures.  We have seen  the  movie

Forrest  Gump in which the actor Tom Hanks is seen in  the  film

very realistically shaking hands with dead Presidents and former

Presidents  of the USA.  We have seen other examples of  digital

manipulation  of  advertisements in  which  a  very  plump  lady

suddenly  becomes  very slim.  And I think  we  also  have  seen

examples,  even without digital manipulation, of pictures  which

appear  to  present certain ideas and these ideas obviously  are

false.  It could, for example, make a person look sinister under

certain lightings and you could then persuade the audience  that

this  is  a  sinister person and in the political broadcast,  it

would be to persuade people not to elect him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore prudent and cautious of us to exclude a

medium  like this from the hurly-burly of politics and  that  we

should   restrict  political  debate  to  arenas  that  can   be

controlled,  in  the sense that publications and rally  speeches

can  be  controlled.   There will always  be  opportunities  for

rebuttal   and  there  will  be  no  opportunities  for   making

manipulated pictures like that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my work as the President of the Consumers' Association

of  Singapore,  very often we have to deal with  advertisements,

particularly TV commercials, which we find objectionable because

they  make  certain allusions or present certain pictures  which

lead the viewer into wrong conclusions.  But very often, when we

approach  the  Advertising Standards Authority of  Singapore  to

pull off the advertisement, the sale has been clinched



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



and  it is too late for us to stop it.  We can actually pull off

the  advertisement but, as they say, the harm is  already  done.

So  I  support this Bill to keep political debate to arenas that

we are familiar with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I have some points which I hope the Minister

will  clarify.  Firstly, clause 2(b) introduces a new definition

of  "electronic  transmission".   I  see  that  this  definition

excludes  "broadcasting".   Unlike the Undesirable  Publications

(Amendment) Bill passed at the last sitting of this House, there

is  no definition of "broadcasting" here.  In our laws, there is

the definition in the Copyright Act and a definition of sorts in

the  Singapore Broadcasting Authority (SBA) Act.  The  Copyright

Act definition is slightly archaic as it refers to "broadcasting

by  wireless  telegraphy".  The SBA Act is more  up-to-date.   I

would  take  it that the meaning of "broadcasting" here  is  the

same  as  that in the more modern SBA Act.  Whichever definition

is  adopted, however, I believe the new Bill does not appear  to

cover  the  use of telecommunication lines to do a  computerised

"broadcast" to all Internet users, for example, which should  be

an  act  penalised under this new Bill if the films or  pictures

sent are obscene or of an unauthorised political nature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, clause 2(f) introduces a definition of "supply".

I  know the Minister has said that it is an adaptation from  the

New  Zealand  provision.  With due respect,  Sir,  I  find  this

definition  verbose  and  incomprehensible.   I  would  like  to

commend the use of plain English in statutes and hope that  more

care will be put into drafting such legal provisions in future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, clause 2(d) gives a new definition to "obscene".

I  have  discussed  at  length my views on  "obscenity"  in  the

earlier debate on the Undesirable Publications (Amendment)  Bill

and  received  an answer from the Minister and  so  I  will  not

repeat them here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would turn to clause 2(g). This paragraph inserts

a new subsection (2) to section 2 of the principal Films Act.  A

film  is  directed  to a political end if  it  is,  inter  alia,

"intended or likely to affect voting in any election or national

referendum".  I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



fear  the  words  are  overly broad.  There  are  all  sorts  of

elections  in  Singapore, including elections at annual  general

meetings  of societies and companies and elections on residents'

views  in  relation  to  upgrading  projects  and  perhaps  even

elections to choose popular TV commercials.  I know the Minister

probably  has  in mind Parliamentary and Presidential  elections

only   and  would  ask  if  he  could  amend  or  clarify   this

accordingly.  All the other references to "any election" in  the

new subsection (2)(b) should also be similarly construed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A film dealing with "an issue of public controversy" is

also  political  under the amendment Bill.  In  most  instances,

this  may be right.  Yet, with utmost respect, Sir, I think  the

words  are  again over-broad.  The question whether  cloning  of

humans   should  be  made  illegal  is  "an  issue   of   public

controversy"; so too is the question whether owners of pets  who

take  long  holidays  should  be allowed  to  leave  their  pets

unattended.  Would films on these topics be political?  I submit

that they are not.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Minister may

wish to clarify this point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, could the Minister also consider amending or

clarifying the provisions of the new subsection (3) which states

that  films  solely for the purpose of reporting current  events

are  not  political.  I expect this would, of course, cover  the

broadcast  and  the  filming  of  election  rallies  and   other

political events as news.  But I would like to argue that  films

"discussing"  current events (and not merely "reporting"  them),

such as TV talk shows, or shows which contain obviously unbiased

material  in an attempt to inform or educate the public  (as  in

many documentaries we see), are also not political.  I await the

Minister's views on these points.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I totally support the banning of obscene films and the levy

of  harsh penalties on offenders in order to protect our  young.

I  am  concerned, however, by the aspect of the Bill which seeks

to define and then prohibit production and dissemination of what

is called "party political film".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have several specific concerns. Let me elaborate. My

first  concern  is  about the definition of what  constitutes  a

party  political  film.  There seems to be two components.   The

first  is  obvious, a film made by or on behalf of  a  political

party or a group advertising its views.  The second component is

far  more ambiguous and disturbing to me.  The second definition

of  a  party political film is if "it is made by any person  and

directed  towards  any  political end in Singapore".   The  term

"directed  towards  any  political end" is  further  defined  to

include specific examples, most of which relate to elections and

can  quite  arguably be considered party politics.   However,  a

film  which "contains wholly or partly either partisan or biased

references to or comments on any political matter, including but

not limited to a current policy of the Government or an issue of

public controversy in Singapore" is defined as "a film which  is

directed towards any political end" and is therefore prohibited.

That, I submit, is far too broad, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is biased and what is not biased? What is a political

matter   and  an  unpolitical  matter?   An  issue   of   public

controversy  at one time was the COE policy.  Another  time  was

the  levy  on the foreign maids.  Only recently, it was  housing

prices.   Are these not political matters?  And what  about  the

current  policy  of the Government?  Can anything  be  more  all

encompassing than this definition?  The concern of the  drafters

of  this  Bill  surely cannot be trying to  stifle  films  which

legitimately  and  constructively comment on Singapore  society.

After all, the Government actively encourages the development of

a  local  film  industry.   On the one hand,  we  complain  that

Singaporeans are politically apathetic and the young people  are

not  committed  to this society.  We want to develop  a  vibrant

cultural  scene  where  Singaporeans  can  develop  art   forms,

including  film, which have contemporary relevance.   But  under

this  amendment,  any so-called biased reference  to  a  current

policy  of Government or an issue of public controversy will  be

banned.   We all know that what constitutes "right" or  "wrong",

"biased" or "non-partisan" can be a less



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>



than  objective  exercise  or  evaluation,  and  the  evaluation

depends on who says it, when and with what intention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is the mechanism of evaluation carried out anyway?

From  what I understand, this Bill does not disallow the  making

of  a  film by any individual nor does it require any film-maker

to  submit  a story line and film script prior to production  to

the  Ministry for approval.  Film-makers therefore risked  their

money,  time  and talent on a production which may raise  public

controversy  after  it  was screened.  How  would  the  Ministry

respond to this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether a film will raise a political controversy in

society is an uncertain and, often times, unintended outcome  on

the part of the producer.  Even if it recognises the possibility

of  political tensions from such a film, it is more difficult to

assess  its degree of seriousness to justify its ban.  What  may

result is an unhealthy situation of individuals, film producers,

political party members as well as political institutions making

allegations against one another and defending their positions on

different reasons.  We do not want to be drawn into this kind of

unguided judgement battles.  Not that such allegations will  not

be  made  under  this  existing Bill,  but  the  amendments  now

proposed  only  give more room for contentious  interpretations.

Moreover,  the  offender  is liable  to  a  fine  not  exceeding

$100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our effort to promote the arts, Sir, the spectre of a

hefty  fine, due to many "possible" wrongful allegations can  be

daunting.   I  appreciate  the Government's  need  to  establish

reasonable   limits  to  self-censorship  within  the   artistic

community,  but  we  need  to offset  this  against  an  equally

important  need  for Singaporeans to free their imagination  and

intellect to create without ambiguous restrictions.   I  do  not

believe  that  our  top  leaders are  intolerant  or  afraid  of

criticisms.   They can hold their own in any debate against  any

of Singapore's detractors.  That makes me all the more perplexed

as to why this Bill



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



needs  to  have  such  a broad definition  of  "party  political

films".   Is  this  not  giving  unnecessary  broad  powers   to

bureaucrats who will want to err on the side of caution and  end

up banning any social commentary in our home-made film industry?

I  am  afraid  the  lack  of clear guidelines  and  definitional

criteria  will  paralyze appropriate exercise of  judgment  and,

worse,  it  cripples creative effort in our  young  and  stifles

quite   legitimate  and  constructive  commentary  on  Singapore

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has once said, on the

subject of financial deregulation, that previously what was  not

expressly  permitted was prohibited must now change to  what  is

not  expressly  prohibited is permitted.  I  believe  that  what

applies to the finance industry in Singapore should apply to the

film  industry.  I am afraid the amendments to the Act create  a

situation which is what is not expressly prohibited is also  not

permitted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make a specific proposal that the

definition  of  "party  political film"  be  more  realistically

defined  so  that it can only refer to films made  by  political

parties  or  groups and on specific issues related to  electoral

matters  and  that  broad catch-all reference  such  as  current

policies  of  Government  or issues of public  controversies  be

deleted.  In any Bill to prohibit an activity, I believe  it  is

the  onus  of  the  drafters to be as precise  and  specific  as

possible  and  not  to cover themselves by including  everything

under  the  sun.  It is convenient to do so but  it  would  only

impede  the development of an open and civil society.   For  me,

self-censorship is a necessary civic function  but  it  must  be

exercised  based  on knowledge and acceptance of  terms  of  the

contract, not out of fear and muddled understanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which I feel that the Films Act could also

address  is  violence, and the question of harm to children.   I

would  like  to suggest that the Censorship Board  broadens  its

scope to include the issue of violence in films and to develop a

classification   scheme   to  define   "acceptable"   and   "not

acceptable"  portrayals  of  violence  on  the  screen.   I   am

concerned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



that  violent  scenes  have  become  more  graphic  and  brutal.

However, there is inadequate research on the extent to which the

prevalence of violence depiction desensitizes the public.  There

is  reasonable  ground  to  fear that  children  are  vulnerable

victims  because  they  are immature and more  easily  led  into

committing copycat behaviour of violent portrayals in films.  It

is  important that this Bill allows the Government to  establish

clear guidelines to ban obscene films as well as political films

which  have  a negative impact on social cohesion,  but  violent

films  which have no regard for women, children and  the  higher

ideals  of  the human condition must also be regulated,  because

they  only  degrade our sense of decency, impoverish  our  moral

universe and fray the social fabric.  This is not a gracious and

gentle society which we promised for the people of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will seriously reconsider the

amendments to this Act and if need to, perhaps, in the  interest

of  the public, subject it to a Select Committee for review  and

recommendations, to give Singaporeans an opportunity to question

their own civic identity by airing their views on the limits  of

State  control  vis-a-vis individual rights and  responsibility.

This  may  be  a  significant political  and  social  agenda  on

community building as we enter the 21st century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not support the Bill as it is.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me

this  opportunity.  At the outset, I would like to  disclose  my

interest.  I am a member of  the Indian PAC which is chaired  by

Mr S. Dhanabalan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill introduces a new area, namely, political

films  which are subject to the purview of this Bill.  I  wonder

why the need to have this area legislated.  I share the concerns

shown  by the other NMPs  and I will not repeat them.  Political

parties still could hold rallies and speak their mind during the

election, and yet they have to be subjected to this law if  they

were to produce a film with a political end.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a people and as a government, I think we can take

pride,  and I say this seriously and even the opposition parties

will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



agree,  that  we  have the most fair elections anywhere  in  the

world.  Issues are debated openly and the voters have the  right

to   choose.   I  think  we  should  preserve  this.   In  other

countries, violence and money politics take the front stage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, under the leadership of the Prime Minister,

started building a participatory democracy.  Civil organisations

are  growing up.  Even the Straits Times'  Forum page,  compared

to,  say,  20  years ago, has more serious issues  debated.   On

Saturday,  the political page Insight deals with current  issues

in some depth.  It airs the views of the various leaders and the

man-in-the-street.  There will be criticisms of this  Bill  from

some quarters, especially the Western press.  I think there will

be  some  criticisms by Singaporeans that this Bill is going  to

silence the opposition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the definition of "political end" cannot be

exhaustive.  I agree.  But the definition, as it stands, is very

wide.   I  do not have any notion whether any other country  has

got  similar legislation.  And in the absence of other  judicial

authorities, our courts would have to evolve our own law and  it

will take some time for the law to be settled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the question that has to be asked and answered

is  this: are we sending the wrong signals to Singaporeans  that

we  are  becoming less tolerant of political dissent?   We  have

seen  a  slow nurturing of civic bodies whose aim is to get  the

community involved in decision making and to provide a  valuable

link  to  the policy makers.  In fact, two of the NMPs  in  this

House have come from this background.  The question that we have

to  ask is: what would happen if one of the civic bodies were to

make a film to educate its members?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, a film which has got a political end is

subject to the control of the law, even if only a small part  of

the  film  is likely to affect voting in any election.  This  is

indeed  very restrictive.  Even a civic group which  intends  to

educate  its members may run foul of the law.  Unlike the  other

Members,  I  have  no  contention with the second  part  of  the

definition  which tries to contain partisan or biased  comments.

I think the judge will be in a position to decide.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other concerns, Mr Speaker, Sir, which I would

like  to  highlight  in  the House.  Whilst  the  definition  of

"obscene" is something of a question of judgment value,  I  hope

that the officials dealing with the matter would be a little bit

more liberal in the definition.  Value judgment and question  of

morality  change from society to society and from  age  to  age.

What was decadent sometime ago may not be so now in the light of

new attributes.  Although the fine line between what is work  of

art  and what is yellow culture may be strained,  we should  try

to be more accommodating.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My other concern is on the Committee of Appeal. The

present   members  are  distinguished  people  with  very   rich

backgrounds.    We   have  a  young  poet,  banker,   architect,

accountant and people from the academia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a credit to the Minister that he need not have

amended  this  section.   The Minister could  have  allowed  the

membership  to  remain at nine and then reduce the  quorum  from

five to three, which is a respectable number in most panels  and

tribunals.  Even our Court of Appeal has three members.  It just

goes  to show that the Minister is sincerely concerned with  the

decision-making  process and to make  it  more  transparent.   I

think this House should applaud this action by the Minister.   I

welcome the increase in the number and I hope the Minister would

include  retired  lawyers, civil servants and community  leaders

who  could  provide  valuable  inputs  in  this  decision-making

process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I read yesterday's Straits Times and I appreciate the

arguments and sentiments by Koh Buck Song in the editorial page.

But I think the quorum should perhaps be increased from five  to

seven  for cases which are controversial, but not in all  cases.

But  for  cases  which  are of public  interest,  it  should  be

increased.   It  should  be  left  to  the  discretion  of   the

Committee's Chairman or Vice-Chairman.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another area which I would urge the Minister

to consider and this is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>



on  the appointment of two Vice-Chairmen, instead of the present

practice of choosing by the members themselves when the Chairman

or Vice-Chairman is not available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we should institutionalise the Committee of

Appeal's  work.  In landmark cases, it should give  its  grounds

which  should  be published.  By doing so, the  public  and  the

trade would know the view of the Committee of Appeal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also concerned that the fines have been increased

excessively.  I support the move to increase the fines  but  not

in  the way it has been done.  I think we have overdone it.  Let

me  give the House an example.  Under new section 29(4)(b),  the

maximum  fine is $100,000.  We all know that the courts normally

do not impose the maximum fine, but they always bear in mind the

quantum  laid  by Parliament, and in this case, it is  $100,000.

When  we  compare the fine imposed in more serious crimes  under

the  Penal Code, this House will realise that the proposed  fine

is excessive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area I am concerned is the definition of young

persons, which I do not think any of the Members has raised.  So

I  will raise it here.  I think we should start a new definition

of  a young person as anybody who is above the age of 12 instead

of  14.   Most  secondary students have the mental and  physical

attributes  which their parents 30 years ago may  not  have.   I

wonder  why  the  Minister wants to conform to  the  traditional

definitions of young person.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, I must congratulate him for giving the

protection to young people.  Under the proposed law, they  would

not  be  exploited and abused.  This is to be welcomed.  As  the

Minister  has  pointed out, flyers and all sorts  of  literature

appear  in letter boxes both in HDB estates and even in  private

residential estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another area which I would like the Minister

to  consider.  Both Tamil and Hindi films seem to have  a  great

deal of violence and obscenities, not pictorial obscenities  but

in the words used.  The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



fact that the Indian censors have cleared the film must not lull

our  Board of Censors.  Some of the words, especially in  Hindi,

are  indeed  obscene and cannot be mentioned.   Not  related  to

this,  but I would like to touch on, is the question whether  we

want  our  women to be treated in the fashion that some  of  the

Indian  films  portray.   Sir, the Indian PAC has  conveyed  its

views to the Minister about television programmes but censorship

does  not come under our purview.  I hope the Minister will take

this  into consideration.  Whilst SINDA and the Indian community

are trying hard to uplift the Indian community, the Indian films

are our biggest drawback.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Simon Tay has mentioned that we are here not to

support the Government or the opposition. We are here, chosen by

Parliament, to give our views independently so that the decision-making process of this Parliament would be easier.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I must first question the sweeping

statement of the NMP when he said that Singapore has the fairest

election in the world.  I wonder whether he has stood in any  of

the  elections in Singapore, especially on the opposition  side.

Standing  as a bystander and observing from the outside,  surely

he  cannot  get  the full picture.  Until he  has  stood  in  an

election, he has got no right to make such a sweeping statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot support this Bill because the part on banning

party  political films is purely political.  It has got  nothing

to  do with public good or the public interest.  Its purpose  is

to  give more advantage to the ruling party at the elections and

to  ensure that the PAP shall never lose its majority  in  every

election.   I  can support the part of the Bill disallowing  the

exhibition  and trade in obscene films as they tend  to  deprave

and   corrupt   members   of   the  public,   especially   young

Singaporeans.  Therefore, banning of obscene films  is  for  the

public  good and the public interest is served.  I support  that

part  of the Bill.  But banning party political films is another

matter altogether.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does banning party political films help to promote

public  good  or  public interest?  In  fact,  it  is  just  the

opposite.   The  public,  especially in Singapore,  hardly  know

anything about the opposition.  They only see and hear and  read

PAP  news.  Anyone who turns on the news on our local television

cannot  fail  to  see  and  hear anything  but  PAP  news.   PAP

Ministers'   and  Members'  public  activities  are  prominently

broadcast.   Anyone watching local television would  think  that

there are no activities organised by the opposition MPs at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Potong Pasir, I organise between five and seven public

activities  every  year.   Our Lantern Festival  attracts  about

1,000  participants  every year.  As for the  Kite  Flying  Day,

there  are usually about 200 to 250 persons who come to join  in

this   very  delightful  activity.   None  of  these  activities

organised  at   Potong Pasir over the last 12  years  have  been

reported  in the local press or over television.  Now there  are

new  technologies like the videos and the CD-ROMs which can give

a  chance  for  the  opposition to make known  their  views  and

activities,  but  the Government, with this Bill,  is  quick  to

clamp  down on the use of this new technology by the opposition.

Any  progressive Singaporean would welcome all new  technologies

and make use of them to the fullest advantage.  But in Singapore

the  situation is different.  New technologies are only good  if

they are to advance the cause of the PAP and not the opposition.

This  message is loud and clear with the implementation of  this

Bill  when it becomes law.  There is no half measure as  far  as

the  Government is concerned.  They want to make sure  that  the

opposition is completely deprived of new technologies to advance

their cause.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The punishment meted out for disobeying the law is a very

heavy   penalty  of  a  fine  not  exceeding  $100,000   or   to

imprisonment  for  a  term  not  exceeding  two   years.    This

punishment  is  even more onerous than the ones  meted  out  for

first  time  aggravated offence in connection with  dealings  in

obscene  films  where children and young persons  are  involved.

For  the  first timers of aggravated offences involving children

and  young persons, the upper limit of the fine is only $80,000,

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>



the  maximum prison sentence is 12 months.  As compared  to  the

first  time offenders in relation to party political films,  the

maximum  fine is $100,000.  As I said, the maximum jail  is  two

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is in fact no need to impose such heavy fines and

jail  sentences for offenders of party political films.  A  fine

of $2,000 or a jail sentence of six months would suffice.  Since

the whole matter is political, the intention of this part of the

Bill is for the Government to neutralise the opposition parties.

This  can be achieved by stopping opposition members from taking

part  in  elections  by fining them just a mere  $2,000  or  six

months' jail, if they are caught involved in dealing with  party

political films.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Singapore Constitution, once a person is fined

$2,000  or jailed six months, he is banned from taking  part  in

any  parliamentary elections for a period of five years.   So  a

fine of $2,000 or a jail of six months is a sufficient deterrent

in  regard to party political films.  The present punishment  is

out of proportion and is really uncalled for.  These heavy fines

and  jail sentences only indicate that the ruling party  suffers

real weaknesses. They think that if the opposition have a chance

to  use  party political films they can win even more  seats  in

Parliament  or even topple the PAP if such new technologies  can

be  exploited  by the opposition to the fullest.   That  is  why

draconian  punishments are meted out to completely  deprive  the

opposition of using new technologies to advance their cause.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the use of new technologies by the opposition something

bad?   I  do not think so.  I can think of at least five reasons

why  party  political  films should be  allowed.   Firstly,  the

public  will have the advantage of more than one point of  view.

Every  day, for 365 days a year, and year after year,  from  one

general   election   to   the  next  and   continued   non-stop,

Singaporeans are bombarded with PAP news.  It is high time  that

the  Government  opened up and allowed more than  one  point  of

view.   Singaporeans should be given an opportunity to hear  not

one or two points of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>



views,  but  a  diversity of views.  I believe Singaporeans  are

intelligent  and  mature  enough  to  know  what  is  good   for

Singapore.  They are discerning people and can accept the  point

of view that is best for Singapore and for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said that with party political films, the

opposition  can  give wrong information or  misinformation.   If

they  really  do that, they will in fact be shooting  their  own

feet  with  a  gun.  Because if they are found out, their  whole

credibility will go and they will never get elected again.  So I

do  not think that they will dare to be so irresponsible.  There

should  be  no fear of allowing Singaporeans to watch  and  hear

party  political films.  If Singaporeans are forced to hear  and

accept  only  one  point of view, very soon an absolute  tyranny

will  develop  in  Singapore.  Further, the PAP  is  not  always

right.  The stop-at-two policy is a glaring example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it is a shame if new technologies cannot be used

to  the fullest.  Singapore encourages its people to be creative

and  innovative.    It would appear that the mood  now  is  that

should  any  more new technologies be invented, they  cannot  be

used  by the opposition to their advantage, but only by the PAP.

This  kind  of  values  promulgated by  the  PAP  is  definitely

retrogressive and unfair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill only retards the growth of creativity and

innovativeness.   Politics is not something dirty  like  obscene

films,  and Singapore should be given a free rein to indulge  in

politics using new technologies.  The Government should have  no

fear  because the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act  and  the

defamatory  and  sedition laws are still all in  place  and  the

Internal Security Act has not yet been abolished.  The only harm

that  can  be  done by the opposition or Singaporeans  generally

using  party political films is to the PAP and not to Singapore.

I  hasten  to  say  that  the  PAP is  not  Singapore.   If  the

opposition is given a climate whereby they can grow and  attract

good  men,  in time they too can be just as good as  the  ruling

party.   But with this kind of a Bill that is before us, such  a

climate I speak of shall never come about.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason why party political films should be

allowed  is  because there are vast numbers of Singaporeans  who

shall  oppose  this Bill.  There are already two opposition-held

constituencies  at Hougang and Potong Pasir.   The  majority  of

people at these two constituencies shall surely oppose this Bill

since they have already voted for the opposition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many of the constituencies that were contested, the

votes polled by the opposition were over 40%.  Generally, we can

safely  say  that  about 40% of the voters  in  Singapore  would

definitely  oppose  the banning of party political  films  since

they are not against the opposition. In the results at the first

poll  for  the Elected President, there were about  40%  of  the

voters  who did not vote for the Government candidate.  I  would

think  that  they too would be against this move  to  ban  party

political  films.  Indeed, if those parts of the Bill concerning

banning party political films were to be put to a referendum, my

view is that the Government may just not get what it wants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth reason why party political films should not be

banned is because the Government is setting double standards  by

implementing this Bill.  The Government, under the  new  section

2(3), is allowed to broadcast party political films through  the

mass  media  because  the purpose of which  is  purportedly  the

reporting of current events.  Therefore, at election time, under

this  section,  the  Government can report  all  their  members'

election  speeches  and election activities  through  the  local

television  and  radio as current events.   At  the  same  time,

opposition  members  shall not benefit from such  wide  coverage

unless,  of  course, the news are bad about the opposition.   By

this  Bill, the playing field is further tilted to the advantage

of the PAP in coming elections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth reason for not allowing the banning of party

political  films  is  that  it is one more  step  to  discourage

political  awareness among Singaporeans.  The Bill also  further

gives  an  impression  to  our young  citizens  that  discussing

opposition politics is something to be avoided because  normally

a government would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



only  ban something which is bad for the people.  And by banning

party  political films which is really aimed at the  opposition,

the people of Singapore will also have the impression that films

made  by  the  opposition must be bad.  They are  to  be  lumped

together with obscene films.  Obscene films are actually  worlds

apart  from party political films.  Yet they are lumped together

in this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly object to the passing of this Bill banning party

political  films.   On record, by the votes  cast  at  the  last

general elections, there are almost 50% of those who voted shall

be  against this Bill as it stands.  On this line, I  would  say

that  there are very good grounds to send this Bill to a  Select

Committee and I call upon the Minister to do so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could I have a

clarification from Mr Chiam?  He said that one has to stand  for

election to know whether the elections are fair.  I think he  is

wrong.   In fact, the public of Singapore, the 3 million people,

know what is a fair election.  Is he saying to the House that he

came to this House by unfair election?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am sorry that the NMP has to ask me

to  clarify.  The best thing is actually for him to take part in

an  election.   Then  he will know the difficulties  as  regards

election  rallies, putting up election posters, party  broadcast

time, and as regards the Police who are always about.  There are

many things that he does not know and I think it is best for him

to  stand in an election.  Then let him say whether we have  the

most fair elections in the world.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Films (Amendment) Bill clearly provides for anyone who produces,

distributes or exhibits any party political film to be fined  up

to  $100,000  or  imprisoned for as  long  as  two  years.   The

Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) once produced a video film  but

it was banned from distribution by the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill further deprives the Opposition of the right to

make  use of other media to reach out to the people in order  to

express their views on the nation, society and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



Government.  However, the Bill also provides that films covering

current  affairs shall not fall under the category of  political

films.   Then,  the  People's Action Party  (PAP)  will  not  be

affected,  because the PAP can make use of the  current  affairs

programmes  on  the  television channels to send  their  signals

effectively  to  the people at any time.   The real  purpose  of

this  Bill  is not just to prevent the opposition from producing

and distributing films or video which are not in the interest of

the  PAP, but more importantly, it is designed to block out  the

unfavourable comment on the PAP  by any foreign media.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, the real question is whether this Amendment Bill

covers  also the TV broadcast relayed by Singapore Cable  Vision

(SCV).   We all know that SCV will eventually reach out to  each

and every household in Singapore.  SCV relays TV programmes from

other  countries.  Some of these may contain the views of people

from other countries on Singapore, particularly some comments on

policy matters, or on the way in which the PAP rules Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP introduces this Amendment Bill just as the people

of Singapore are beginning to avail themselves of some different

views  and  comments from SCV.  In clause 2 of  this  Bill,  the

definition  of  political  films is very  wide.  Any  film  that

touches on any of the Government's policy, controversial issues,

or  comments on any political matters shall be deemed  to  be  a

party  political film.  In future, if SCV is to telecast any  of

these  films, or any programme containing unfavourable  comments

or criticism on the PAP, will it then be committing an offence?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been telling the people of Singapore

that our information is open.  Our people can tune in to foreign

TV  programmes through SCV.  However, after this Bill is passed,

if  SCV  is to telecast any programme that contains unfavourable

comments on the PAP which are considered to be  biased, and  the

officer-in-charge is accordingly found to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



be  guilty  of an offence,  then is this what the PAP Government

mean by saying our information is open?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my concern, of course, is

with that part of the Bill that seeks to shut out any film of  a

political  activity in Singapore.  I have no  quarrel  with  the

amendments proposed to punish exhibitors of pornographic  films,

and particularly child pornography.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder, Mr Speaker, Sir, how many people outside this

House  were  aware,  before  the  House  sat  today,  that  this

Government intends to categorise a political activity, and  that

is, making a film on political issues, and thereby educating our

citizens into greater awareness, with obscenity and lewdness.  I

find  this totally inexplicable, that the Government should  try

and  lump a particular form of political activity with obscenity

and  lewd films.  And that is made clear, if you look at one  of

these clauses, that is, clause 11, which seeks to amend  section

35(1)  of  the Films Act.  And the amendment is that instead  of

the  word  "lewd", you insert "a party political  film".   So  a

party  political  film would appear to be in the  minds  of  the

Government to be the same as  a lewd film.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not propose to repeat what has been

said  before.  I am not going to go over the definitions in this

Bill.   To  me,  it  is  not  just a question  of  amending  the

definitions  and curtailing the impact of this total  ban  on  a

form  of  political activity in Singapore.  The whole  thing  is

totally  unnecessary,  with or without any  amendment,  and  any

amendment is not going to make it any better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister, in introducing the Bill and in attempting to

justify  the  ban, says a video-tape which contains issues  that

concern  Singaporeans may be emotional and perhaps move them  to

action.  What the Minister forgets, and the PAP forgets, is that

politics  is an emotional matter.  People are moved by political

decisions  that are made by the Government.  They do not  remain

cold  and impassive to a decision made by the Government.   Some

are moved very deeply by a decision of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



the  Government.   Is that wrong?  Is that to  be  dismissed  as

simply  that  they are emotional?  So I cannot  understand  this

justification  that  a videotape which tries  to  bring  to  the

citizens  any issues that concern them, and politics  is  simply

nothing  but discussion of issues that concern the people,  that

it  is emotional.  Politics concerns the body politic. It covers

everyone.  So if there is any issue that concerns them, then  it

is politics.  And so I cannot accept the attempt made to justify

the ban on the ground that people may be moved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, what is forgotten is that our citizens have to be

educated  on  issues, and a videotape or a film is  perhaps  the

most  effective way to educate our citizens on political issues.

It  is  quite  clear  that our Government in  Singapore  has  no

intention  and has no wish to educate our citizens  politically.

All  they  are  concerned with is to drive home to our  citizens

their message, their goals, regardless of whether it is good for

Singaporeans or not.  And as a result of all these, for the last

30  years,  this drone of Government propaganda is  churned  out

over  the  TV every night, churned out over the radio,  and  our

people have become resigned, as the former Deputy Prime Minister

of  this  Government  said,  to hearing  nothing  else  but  PAP

propaganda, and they are unable to make any judgement on whether

what  the  PAP  proposes is good for the society or  not.   That

clearly is what the PAP wants.  There is no question about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second justification made by the Minister is that there

is  already an arena for serious political discussion.  I really

wonder  whether the Minister has thought about what he is saying

that  there  are enough opportunities provided in Singapore  for

political  discussion.  The PAP's record,  ever  since  it  took

power  in  1959,  is one to stamp out political  discussion,  to

stamp  out  any  raising of issues by people who feel  concerned

about what is happening in the society.  Why has this Government

continued  and  strengthened  the  Internal  Security  Act  when

previously there was an appeal to an independent board from  any

detention?  This Government took away that appeal and so it  has

a very effective



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



tool in silencing any discussion on politics in Singapore.  As I

said,  the  record of this Government is one of  deliberate  and

systematic suppression of any political debate or discussion  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politics has become a dirty word in Singapore, and we see

it  here, it is to be lumped with obscenity.  That is the  place

for  politics  in Singapore, not anywhere else.  After  the  PAP

took  power  in  1959,  they began a deliberate  and  systematic

suppression  of the institutions in Singapore that  may  provide

opportunities  for political discussion and debate.   I  do  not

propose to dwell at length on this track record of the PAP.  But

I  wish to highlight to Singaporeans the principal ways in which

they  went  about  this.  The trade unions  were  brought  under

control.  Trade unions were not allowed to express any views  on

issues  that  concerned the people at large.   The  trade  union

movement was put under a man of their own party who was  brought

out  from Malaysia to lead the trade union movement.  And  after

him,  the trade union movement has been put into the care  of  a

Cabinet  Minister.   So what freedom was there  left  for  trade

unions  to  express  their  views on matters  that  concern  the

society?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was the press. At one time, Mr Speaker, Sir,

there  was  some  freedom  in the  press.   It  tried  to  be  a

responsible  press.  I recall that, before the  1959  elections,

when the then Secretary-General of the People's Action Party was

threatening  fire  and  thunder against  the  press  because  he

thought  they would be advocating wrong ideas, they  sent  their

representative  to  Helsinki to protest against  this  intention

announced  by  the Secretary-General.  But after  the  PAP  took

over, by a number of manoeuvres, the press have now become  mere

propaganda  agents for the Government.  What real  opportunities

are  there  for  serious  political  issues  to  be  debated  or

advocated  through  the press?   We have in  the  Party  sent  a

number of press releases, I have written a number of letters and

a  substantial number of them never see the light of day.  It is

probably because they all have got to be cleared first.  So  the

press  have  ceased to play any part in providing  a  forum  for

political discussion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the clamp down on professional and religious

organisations.   One by one the professional bodies  were  told,

"You  are  not  to  concern yourself with any  issues  that  may

concern  Singaporeans.   You are only to concern  yourself  with

matters  that affect your members."  And so the Legal Profession

(Amendment)  Act was passed which forbade the Law  Society  from

commenting  on  any Bill that was to be presented to  Parliament

unless  the Bill had first been sent to them for their comments.

And  then  there  were the religious bodies.  Now  we  have  the

Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act and under which any  cleric

can  lose  his licence if he dares to comment on any issue  that

may  concern  the Government.  It is again based on the  fallacy

that  religion  and  politics  are two  distinct  and  different

things,  forgetting that religion has to do with  the  citizen's

views  and  attitudes to the society around him.  That  is  what

politics  is  all  about.  So you cannot divorce  religion  from

politics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was the onslaught against the opposition

political parties.  It is very difficult for anyone who has  not

been  in  any  opposition  party to know  the  difficulties  and

problems that are put in the way of opposition parties.  We  are

not  allowed any public meetings other than the meetings perhaps

on National Day or Labour Day.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, can I ask you to be

relevant to the Bill under discussion?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am dealing with suppression of political

activities.  This is one of them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think you are taking it a bit too far. Can

I ask you to get to the Bill?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right, Mr Speaker, Sir. What I am

attempting  to  say is that this amendment drives  another  nail

into the coffin, an attempt to kill all political activities  in

Singapore.  That is what I am attempting to say here,  that  one

by  one,  all  political  activities are  being  killed  off  in

Singapore.   And it may not be very long before we have  another

Bill presented to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



this House which will perhaps even prohibit the publication by a

political  party  of  any newspaper or journal  because  it  may

contain  issues concerning the people which might  arouse  their

emotions.   I can see that coming with this Bill that  seeks  to

ban films put out by a political party to educate the people  on

any issues in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speakers who spoke after the Minister also made a

number  of  assumptions which I do question.  As  Mr  Chiam  has

already  pointed  out, an assumption is made that  elections  in

Singapore are free and fair.  Knowing how elections are held  in

other  countries and how elections are held in Singapore, may  I

say that elections in Singapore are not free and fair.  They are

anything but free and fair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again the assumption made by a number of speakers,

that  there  are  other areas for serious  discussion.   But  no

attempt  is  made  to  try and define where these  areas  exist.

There are no areas for public discussion of issues in Singapore.

Has  the  PAP  made  any attempt to call  a  public  meeting  of

citizens  to  discuss any policy or Bill that  they  propose  to

bring  into  Parliament?  Have we heard of any such  meeting  or

read  of  any such meeting?  This Bill and the way it  has  been

introduced  demonstrates  that only  too  clearly.   This  is  a

momentous decision, to stop one form of political activity.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, you are engaging in

tedious  repetition.  If you have nothing new to say, could  you

end your speech?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right, Mr Speaker, Sir. What I will say

to  the Government is this.  Why do we not be honest?  Why  does

the  Government, the PAP, not say that our brand of democracy  - because  that  is  what  it has often said  -  that  Singapore's

democracy  is something quite different.  Our brand of democracy

will  not  permit opposition political parties  to  put  forward

their  views,  unless the views conform to what we say  are  the

stated goals and objectives.  Then at least one can say that the

Government is being honest about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, a lot of Singapore is pure pretense,

pretense that we have got



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>



democracy,  pretense that people are allowed free discussion  on

matters  that concern them, pretense that we have a  responsible

press, pretense that we have a responsible trade union movement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment Bill seeks only to strengthen the PAP's hold

on  Singapore,  and that clearly seems to be the object  despite

all  the high-sounding words that have been said to justify  the

amendment to ban all party political films.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is our brand

of  democracy that has enabled the NCMP to be here in this House

to  speak on this Bill.  He opposed the NCMP provision, in  case

we forget.  He lost in the election at Cheng San.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> How did I lose?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> He came in here because of a

provision we made to ensure that there will always be  a  lively

debate  in  this House, and for which I think we are  all  happy

that  he  has spoken his piece, somewhat tediously perhaps,  but

still  by  the  extreme way he has presented his views,  he  has

helped  to  clarify the landscape.  Now our main positions  have

emerged and everything else in between are details.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very grateful to many Members of the House for

spending time looking into the details of the Bill.  I  have  no

doubt that all those who spoke spent a lot of time checking  the

Bill,  the  original Act, looking for inconsistencies,  checking

definitions  in  the Bill with definitions in  other  Acts.   It

shows how important this Act is to us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I touch on the rather controversial amendment on

party  political films, let me first clarify some of  the  other

issues  which were raised.  By and large, Members supported  the

other  amendments, but there were some questions raised which  I

feel I ought to respond to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching asked whether the threat to forfeit all

or  part of the deposit might somehow inhibit the growth of  the

film industry.  Not at all.  The purpose is a practical one.  It

is in response to a practical problem.  Ever since we introduced

R(A) rating in our cinemas, we have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>



required  cinema operators to check the ICs of young people  who

buy  tickets  to ensure that they are above 21 before  they  can

watch R(A) rated movies.  Sometimes they have been lax and young

people  have gotten in.  So this is to ensure that they  can  be

fined,  that a penalty can be imposed upon them when  they  have

not  kept  to  the  conditions  of  their  licence.   It  is  an

administrative thing, a provision which we have not had  in  the

past.  The  only recourse we had in the past was between  giving

them  a  warning and withdrawing their licence, and we  felt  we

needed something in between.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of MPs asked whether the proposed changes would

somehow  stifle  the  arts or stifle  the  growth  of  the  film

industry.  Not at all.  In fact, what we have tried to do is  to

clarify  a  particular area about which I will talk  in  greater

detail later.  But our objective remains the same, which  is  to

promote the arts and to promote the film industry.  In fact,  it

is  the plan of the Ministry of Information and the Arts to form

a  Films Commission under the National Arts Council specifically

to  help promote the growth and prosperity of the film industry.

Films like Twelve Storeys  will not be affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same process of consultation between BFC and the trade

will continue.  If you are not sure whether a film will infringe

censorship guidelines, you can consult the censors.   They  will

give  you  advice.   They will say, "These are  the  benchmarks.

These are the things we have allowed in the past.  These are the

things we have disallowed.  So please adjust accordingly."   And

we also have a system for classification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether films to educate members of the public produced by

Ministries will be affected, no.  It is clear in the  Bill  that

Government films are exempted from the provisions of the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh See Kiat asked some questions about definitions.

"Election" is separately defined in the beginning of the Bill to

make  it  clear that it does not refer to elections for  private

clubs or whatever.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of "broadcasting" is the dictionary

definition, which is if you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



broadcast  programmes, television or radio, by  wireless  or  by

cable.  It is a simple definition.  It suits our purpose.  There

is  no  need  to  define it at this point in time more  clearly.

Internet   broadcast  will  be  covered  under   the   Singapore

Broadcasting Act. These are some of the clarifications  which  I

owe Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to talk about the special amendment to ban

party political films.  In 1996, around March, Dr Chee Soon Juan

of  the SDP wrote to BFC to ask whether he required a licence to

distribute political videos. BFC said yes.  Then he submitted an

application.  This is the first time anything of this  sort  had

happened in Singapore.  For those Members who talked about  this

restriction  somehow  affecting  fair  and  free  elections   in

Singapore,  we have had free and fair elections all these  years

in  the  pre-video  age.  I do not think with  or  without  this

provision,  it  will affect substantially the way elections  are

conducted in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman of the Board of Film Censors, sensing that

this  is  a  new area, referred the matter to the  Ministry  and

asked  for policy guidance.  There were two approaches we  could

have  taken.  We could have allowed political films.  If we  had

allowed  party  political films for the SDP, then naturally  the

Workers'  Party  and the PAP would all have  jumped  in.   Right

through  the  nine-day campaign period, we  would  all  be  busy

putting on make-up, combing our hair, dressing up, appearing  in

political videos and distributing them to Singaporeans in  order

to  win  votes.  Or we could say, do we want everybody  to  jump

into this new medium?  The question we have to ask ourselves is:

will  this new medium improve democracy in Singapore or  degrade

it?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of having a debate in this House is that

there is an immediate encounter.  A point is raised, a point  is

rebutted.   Views are immediately clarified.  The  media  is  up

there to report on everything that is happening.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do a political video, we worry about sound bites. We

watch the tone of our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



voice.    We   smarten  ourselves  up.   We   distribute.    You

distribute.  To whom?  I do not know.  We distribute.  To  whom?

You  do  not  know.   After  a while,  members  of  the  public,

receiving  all these versions, will develop a very cynical  view

of  who  we are.  We are not film stars.  We are not TCS  stars.

We  are  here  elected  by the people of  Singapore  to  discuss

serious  matters.  And when we have a debate,  let  us  have  an

encounter, a meeting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you object about something written about you in the

newspapers,  you  write  in  to  rebut.   You  write   something

scurrilous  or libelous in a political newspaper,  the  offended

party can require you to clarify, if a case can be put up to the

judges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On television, do we really want political parties to have

the right to buy commercials?  You know how expensive TV airtime

is.   In  America, before you think about running for elections,

you  first  ask  yourself, "Can I raise  the  money?"   And  the

financial hurdle is enormous.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a small city state. Even if there were a massive

power failure and there is no television and the telephone lines

are  dead, within a few hours, from one end of the island to the

other,   from  Changi  to  Tuas,  the  grapevine  will  operate.

Singaporeans are not ignorant.  How could we be where we are now

as  a  major financial trading centre in the world if we are  an

ignorant  people,  if  we  are as suppressed  the  way  Mr  J  B

Jeyaretnam would have us believe?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if we allow this medium, what happens? We will all

become  entrepreneurial.  There will be any number of PR men  in

Singapore or foreign consultants offering their services to  us.

You  know, in America, it is an industry and they are very  good

at  it.  It is an art form.  They will teach us all kinds of new

tricks, how we should sit down, how we should look when  the  TV

camera  pans  at us, how many seconds of sound bites  we  should

plan  for,  what  kind  of particular  spin  to  give  to  every

political ball that we kick.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not good for the political process in Singapore. We

will reduce it to the selling of detergent.  Every evening, when

we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>



watch the television, toothpaste, detergents, soaps, hamburgers,

any number of reasons attractively put across.  With ditties our

children are able to reproduce with accuracy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the quality of our democracy in Singapore is reduced to

that, our democracy would be debased.  That was the question  we

had  to ask ourselves: should we or should we not encourage this

medium in Singapore for political debate?  If we do, then all of

us are in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay talked about unequal impact. If we are in, I

think  the  PAP would not necessarily be disadvantaged,  because

you will need money, and because of our wide base of support  in

Singapore, we are likely to be able to raise more money than the

opposition can.  But to its credit since 1959, the PAP has never

used  the financial hurdle to keep out the opposition from  this

House.   Till today, does it cost a lot for Mr Chiam and Mr  Low

Thia Khiang?  Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam has a different problem because

he  skirts  on the margin of libel and so gets caught  out  from

time  to  time. But did it cost Mr Low Thia Khiang and Mr  Chiam

See  Tong a lot of money to get voted in?  Did they have  to  be

businessmen?   Did they have to be independently  wealthy?   You

can  get in today on a shoe-string if you can win the hearts and

the  minds  of  the people of Singapore.  And that  is  what  it

should  continue to be.  Do not make it show business.  Keep  it

to  an encounter of ideas so that Singaporeans will decide  whom

to  vote for, whom to represent them in this House on the  basis

of ideas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was a very serious matter, I put it up to the

Cabinet.   We had a discussion in the Cabinet.  Then my Ministry

issued a policy instruction to BFC to say, "Look, we should  not

allow  the making and distribution of political films."  So  the

SDP's  application was turned down. That was in July  1996.   At

that  time, we had three SDP Members in this House.   We  had  a

Member  from  the Workers' Party.  Did anyone of  them  raise  a

single question and cause the matter to be debated?  Not a word.

If it was such an important matter, so crucial to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



outcome  of the election, all of them would have jumped  up  and

down.  Did they?  The records speak for themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could have gotten by, I could have gotten by, without

tabling  this  Amendment Bill because, under the existing  Films

Act, we are able to ban political videos, and that's that.   But

why  then did we decide to enact this amendment?  In order  that

we  have this debate in the House today.  Because it is such  an

important matter, and is a matter which will recur, it  is  very

important for the public mind that we know what the issues  are,

and if Singaporeans are excluded from using film as a medium for

political  debate, they know why.  I was under no pressure  from

the  opposition, or from anybody for that matter, to enact  this

amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked, "If politics, why not race or

religion?"  In fact, the Films Act does not explicitly state the

grounds  on which films can be censored.  We inherited this  Act

from  the  British.  It is left open so that internal guidelines

would  build  up  over  a  period of time.   For  obscenity  and

violence,  detailed guidelines have been drawn up  and  this  is

also  my  answer to the NMP, Claire Chiang.  If a film is  made,

which  inflames public emotions, let us say, the  Indian  Army's

storming of the Golden Temple in Amritsar, we will have to  look

at  it very carefully.  If it is inflammatory or incendiary,  we

would have stopped it.  That's that.  This is because the public

interest  requires it.  But in this particular case, because  it

affects  the  evolution of political debate  and  discussion  in

Singapore, we thought it better to have a full airing so that we

all  know  why we are doing this. It is not because we have  to,

not because we are under pressure to, but because it is good for

the development of our democracy in  Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Singapore's own democracy.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Yes, which allow Mr J. B.

Jeyaretnam to now make this interruption.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Singapore's own brand of democracy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Every society treats film as a

special  category, because it has a mass impact which books  and

other  forms of broadcast do not have.  For television,  we  are

watching different channels.  We watch desultorily.  I may be in

the  toilet, I may come back with popcorn.  There is no  focused

attention.   For books, we read different books.  For  Internet,

there are millions of web pages.  But when you gather a group of

people together in a theatrette or an amphitheatre and watch the

same  drama,  by words, pictures, music, sound,  you  can  bring

everyone to laughter and tears into their eyes or you can arouse

in them deep hatred and a desire for revenge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The communists and the fascists work this into an art. In

China  today, the whole of China, in a year they show 200 films.

They  treat  the cinema hall as they do the television  station.

Every  year,  we  show over a thousand films in  Singapore.   We

consider  them  mostly entertainment.  But in the  wrong  hands,

films  can  have a powerful impact.  It is for this reason  that

over  a period of time, in  all societies special laws have been

enacted  to  govern the making, distribution and  production  of

films.   This  is  why  this  Act is different  from,  say,  the

Publications Act or the Newspapers and Printing Presses  Act  or

the Singapore Broadcasting Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members have talked about whether somehow we would

stop  having discussions on television, whether party  political

broadcast  would  cease,  whether we would  stop  foreign  views

coming  in through SCV.  None of it.  Because the Act  makes  it

very  plain that it does not cover broadcasting.  We are talking

about  films  and its variants, videos and new  mutants  on  the

Internet.   But  we are talking principally about  films,  about

people  coming  together  for  a group  exhibition  being  moved

together one way or another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why the heavy fine of $100,000 and up to two years of jail

sentence?  Because the impact during an election campaign can be

dramatic.   Let  us  say,  $2,000,  as  proposed  by  Mr  Chiam.

Election  day minus two, you suddenly mass-distribute throughout

Singapore in key constituencies and you swing the public vote,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>



whether PAP or opposition.  And we transform the nature of  this

House.   After that, you can pay the fine.  But the  damage  has

been  done.   The  damage can be dramatic and catastrophic.   So

there  must be no doubts in people's minds as to the seriousness

of  this  offence.  Of course, if this is done years  before  an

election  and under less serious circumstances, I  am  sure  the

judge  would take it into account.  But the purpose of having  a

high   maximum   is  because  in  an  election   campaign,   the

consequences  of  such  a  wrongdoing  can  affect  gravely  our

country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of Members have asked, "Why can't we just restrict

the definition to films made by political parties? Then it is  a

simple definition.  It is clear.  I am not a political party.  I

do  not  make the film.  That's that."  But imagine  if  we  had

confined  it  in this restrictive way, and you are  a  political

party desperate to win votes and wanting to use film as a way to

win  votes, what would you do?  You get your friends outside the

party to produce and to distribute the films.  You do it in  the

Workers' Party, the SDP will do it, the PAP will do it.  This is

why  the second limb has to be constructed because if you do not

construct  the  second limb, that wider definition,  you  cannot

maintain  the  position in the first limb.  But  the  intent  is

clear.  It is not, in non-party political fields, to do anything

more than what we are doing now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam and Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam suggested that we are

denying  high-tech  to the opposition.  You will  remember  that

some years ago, I caused the Young PAP to start an Internet  web

site,  knowing  full  well  that we  would  have  to  eventually

regulate political web sites on the Internet.  Letters which  Mr

Jeyaretnam complains are not being printed in the Straits Times,

he is quite free to post them on his web site.  Singaporeans are

free  to  click in on his web site and be moved by the force  of

his  arguments.  I would suggest to members of the  public  from

time to time to scan political web sites to see what is on them.

If  our  political parties are really so deprived,  so  excluded

from  all channels of communications, so denied of free  speech,

you would have thought that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>



their  web  sites  would be flourishing centres  of  debate  and

discussion and enlightenment.  Are they?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have also asked, "We already have the

Maintenance  of Religious Harmony Act and the Internal  Security

Act.  Are they not enough?"  In an election campaign, you cannot

lightly  use  the  Internal Security Act  because  it  would  be

immediately  misunderstood.  If you use it after  the  elections

are over, the damage is already done.  It is a blunt instrument.

We need something finer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh See Kiat asked whether the definition of political

films would somehow prevent discussion on animal rights or about

the moral issues concerning cloning or whatever.  It depends  on

the  actual facts of the situation.  If animal rights  become  a

gripping political issue in Singapore, and all political parties

take positions, then, yes.  But if it is just a fringe activity,

firstly, I do not think we will take notice, and secondly, if it

is  unbiased  and  takes in all views, I  think  that  may  well

qualify  as a reporting rather than anything else.  The key  is:

is  it partisan?  Is it biased?  Is it intended to influence  an

election, or legislation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An MP asked, "Why not have more civic participation? Why

not  have  a  Select Committee?"  There are so many consultation

boards  in  Singapore  that I have  quite  lost  count.   In  my

Ministry  alone,  we  have  proliferated.   So  have  the  other

Ministries.   Many  Singaporeans complain that  they  are  being

asked to sit on so many boards and so many panels.  Far from  it

being that we do not consult, if there is a criticism now, it is

perhaps that we consult a little too lightly and too frequently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this somehow a restriction of free speech, free debate,

in  Singapore?   Recently,  the two major  financial  television

channels  merged, ABN, which is owned by Dow Jones and TCI,  and

CNBC,  which  has  a  joint arrangement with  Microsoft.    They

merged  and  they decided to keep as their common entity,  CNBC.

CNBC  was based in Hong Kong, and ABN in Singapore.  The  merged

entity would be called CNBC.  They decided that it should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>



be  based in Singapore and not Hong Kong.  If we blithely  enact

laws to prevent debate and free speech and the education of  our

people,  would  big  international media corporations  like  Dow

Jones and TCI and NBC have taken such a position?  But this does

not  mean  that we should not be masters of our own destiny  and

shape the evolution of our own democracy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, I thank Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam for providing

contrast  to  our  argument.  He asked why  we  should  separate

religion from politics, by which I infer that he would encourage

monks and priests and ulamas to talk about politics.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> About issues.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> On political issues, in places of

worship.   Mr  Jeyaretnam's position  on  this  is  clear.   Our

position  on this is clear.  I think the majority of Singapore's

position  on this is also very clear.  So too our proposal  here

to  exclude film as a very poor medium, and a degrading  medium,

for political debate in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister by way of

clarification?  I understood him to say that if videotapes  were

allowed  in  the  elections, and he mentioned  one,  two,  three

constituencies, it would transform the nature of this House.   I

take  it  that  the  Minister  says  we  would  then  have  more

opposition  Members in Parliament.  And he says that the  damage

would  have been done.  May I know what would be the  damage  if

you had more opposition Members in Parliament?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, I was not saying that at all.

If  we had political videos, Mr Low Thia Khiang and Mr Chiam may

not be in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill. - [BG George Yong-Boon Yeo].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;

read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>CIVIL LIST</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 7 of the Civil

List and Pension Act (Chapter 44), resolves that the Schedule to

that   Act   be  varied  by  deleting  the  figures   "$84,000",

"$3,378,400", "$819,100" and "$226,000" in the second column and

substituting  the  figures "$100,800", "$2,404,700",  "$841,300"

and "$17,000" respectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is proposed to increase the provision for the Class

I  expenditure by $16,800 for entertainment allowance  to  cater

for higher costs of hosting official functions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for Salaries of Personal Staff is expected to

decrease from $3,378,400 (for 103 posts) to $2,404,700  (for  52

posts) due to the transfer of the Horticultural Section from the

President's Office to National Parks Board on 1st April 1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A provision of $841,300 is required to meet Expenses of

Household.   This  is  $22,200 or 2.7% higher  than  the  FY  97

provision  mainly to meet the higher maintenance expenditure  of

the Istana grounds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sum of $17,000 is required for Special Services for the

purchase of office equipment ($5,000) and the honorarium payment

to   the   President's  legal  adviser  of   $12,000.    It   is

substantially  lower  than  the FY 97 provision  which  included

$140,000 for the replacement of a station wagon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore necessary to vary the provisions in the

Schedule  to  the  Civil List and Pension Act  (Chapter  44)  as

indicated in the Motion before the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 7 of the Civil

List and Pension Act (Chapter 44), resolves that the Schedule to

"$3,378,400", "$819,100" and "$226,000" in the second column and

substituting  the  figures "$100,800", "$2,404,700",  "$841,300"

and "$17,000" respectively.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of the

Government for the financial year 1st April, 1998 to 31st March,

1999.

<div align="center"><b>I REVIEW OF THE ECONOMY</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4>ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN 1997</h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore economy grew by a robust

7.8% in 1997.  However, this did not reflect the seriousness  of

the ongoing regional economic turmoil which started in July last

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic growth in 1997 was largely shaped by two factors.

First,  we benefited from the recovery in the global electronics

industry.   Corrections in inventory overhang  and  healthy  new

orders in US and Europe boosted export demand, and confirmed our

earlier  assessment  that the slowdown  we  experienced  in  the

second  half  of  1996 was primarily cyclical.  This  turnaround

provided  the fillip for the manufacturing sector.   We expected

this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nobody expected the second factor - the spread and

subsequent deepening of the economic crisis in the region.   The

speed and severity of contagion caught everyone off-guard.  What

started  off as a devaluation of the Thai Baht led to widespread

financial  and  economic turbulence in the  region.   One  after

another, regional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>



currencies   and   stock  markets  plummeted  as   international

confidence  in  the  region as a whole fell and  global  capital

flowed   out  of  East  Asia.  Singapore,  despite  our   strong

fundamentals, was not spared.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the impact on the real economy in 1997 was

muted.  There were two primary reasons for this.  First, a large

part  of  Singapore's  regional  trade  consists  of  intra-firm

movement  of  parts,  components and final  products  by  multi-national companies (MNCs) for export to end markets in the  OECD

countries.   As  final demand from the US and  EU  was  healthy,

Singapore's overall trade was not too seriously affected by  the

regional  crisis.    Second, the upswing in  global  electronics

demand  also  supported  our  manufacturing  growth,  generating

favourable spin-offs for our related hub services.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR 1998</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional crisis is far from over. While its impact on

us  in  1997  was  minimal, the same cannot be  said  for  1998.

Being at the heart of South East Asia, we are not isolated  from

regional  conditions.  We have comprehensive  economic  linkages

with   the   region  and  a  strong  stake  in  our  neighbours'

prosperity.   In particular, our tradable services sectors  like

finance and tourism have a strong regional orientation and  will

be directly affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is useful to review how the regional crisis started and

spread,   assess  its  impact  on  the  Singapore  economy   and

businesses,  and  identify the measures  which  the  Government,

companies  and Singaporeans can take to tide over this difficult

period.



<br><br><b>What Caused the Crisis</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roots of the crisis can be traced back to the huge

influx  of  cheap  foreign capital to the region  in  the  early

1990s.    With   inadequate  prudential  supervision,   regional

financial   institutions  over-extended  themselves   and   lent

excessively,  often to unproductive sectors and projects.   This

rapid  build up of foreign debt was not sustainable.  It created

asset  bubbles in the property and stock markets.  For  a  time,

strong regional economic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>



growth  enabled the countries to service their debt  obligations

through buoyant export revenues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidence in the region's export potential began to waver

towards  the mid-1990s, with various exchange rate realignments.

In  1994,  China  devalued the Yuan.  In 1995 the  Japanese  Yen

started depreciating against the greenback.  In countries  whose

currencies  were tightly pegged to the US dollar, exports  began

to  lose  competitiveness.  Economies such as  China  and  Latin

America   emerged  as  keen  competitors.   These   developments

coincided  with  a  cyclical downturn in the global  electronics

industry and precipitated a regional export slowdown in 1996.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the export engines stalled, investors and creditors

grew  nervous  of the regional countries' continued  ability  to

service the growing foreign debt burden.  Eventually, the market

lost  faith  in  the sustainability of the linked exchange  rate

systems adopted by regional economies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thailand was the first to suffer this loss of investor

confidence.  Speculative attacks against  the  Baht  mounted  as

concerns  about the Thai economy grew.  The breaking point  came

when  Thailand's  foreign reserves dipped below  its  short-term

foreign  debt  obligations  in  the  middle  of  1997.   Without

sufficient  reserves to defend its currency, the Thai Government

was  forced  to allow the Baht to float on 2nd July  1997.   The

contagion  effect of this de-facto devaluation of the Thai  Baht

quickly  spread to Malaysia and Indonesia as the market switched

its  attention to other Southeast Asian economies  with  similar

structural weaknesses in their financial and banking systems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By September, the financial crisis extended to North East

Asia.  Hong Kong's US dollar peg came under severe pressure, but

managed to hold.  Long standing structural weaknesses in Japan's

financial  and banking system caused some major institutions  to

fail.   South Korea, with weaker fundamentals and large  private

sector debt, took the biggest hit.  A massive US$57 billion IMF-led bail-out package was necessary to stabilise the Won, and  to

keep the Korean economy on its feet.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending on how successfully Governments manage economic

recovery,  maintain political and social stability, and  restore

investor   confidence,  the  regional  situation  could   either

gradually  stabilise  and start to recuperate,  or  continue  to

deteriorate  before it gets better.  Even if regional  countries

take  all  the right steps and see through painful but necessary

political  and  economic reform policies, the  recovery  process

cannot  be  immediate.  Overall, we can therefore expect  slower

regional growth over the short to medium term.



<br><br><b>Outlook for the Singapore Economy</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, it is difficult to predict precisely the

immediate economic outlook for Singapore.  The regional  context

is  too  volatile  and  fraught with   uncertainties.   Further,

political,  social  and economic changes  can  trigger  off  new

discontinuities, and render past trends irrelevant.  What we can

do  is  to  assess  the economic outlook based  on  the  current

situation, assuming there are no drastic developments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore economy is expected to feel the full impact

of  the regional economic crisis this year.  The latest business

expectations  survey  results indicate  that  nearly  all  major

sectors expect weaker business conditions for the next 6 months.

The  Composite Leading Index, which leads economic  activity  by

about 9 months, has been slowing down since September.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growth in the financial services sector is likely to

moderate significantly.  The Asian Dollar Market, one of the key

financial growth engines, will slow considerably.  With the risk

premium  for  the  region having risen significantly,  financial

institutions   are   adopting  a  wait-and-see   stance   before

committing any new loans to the region.  Activity in the foreign

exchange and stock markets is also expected to moderate from the

high levels in the second half of 1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commerce sector has already registered early impacts

from the regional crisis.  Entrepot trade will moderate as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



import  demand  from  regional  countries  for  consumption  and

capital  goods  slows.    The  other  domestic  segments  within

commerce  will  also  not be spared.   The  tourism  and  retail

trades  are already seeing slower tourist arrivals and  consumer

spending, with no immediate prospects of a pickup.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transportation sector, especially our air and sea

ports,  will also be adversely affected by the fall  in  tourist

arrivals  and  regional transhipment activities.   However,  the

telecommunications sub-sector should continue to expand,  albeit

at a more moderated pace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In manufacturing, the continuing robustness of our major

export markets in US and EU will help to sustain growth.  The US

is   enjoying   an  unprecedented  stretch  of   strong   growth

accompanied by low unemployment and low inflation.  The  uptrend

in US demand for electronics components since the second half of

1996 is continuing.  Growth in the EU is also expected to remain

firm.   The healthy pipeline of investment commitments over  the

last  few  years  will also contribute to additional  industrial

capacity  in  1998.   These  positive  factors  will  help   our

manufacturing   sector,  although  we  will   still   see   some

consolidation  in industries where there is global over-capacity

and keen competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction should see robust growth. Private residential

developments are sluggish. But growth will be supported  by  the

continued  healthy  pipeline  of  public  sector  infrastructure

projects,  including the North-East MRT line and public  housing

projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under present conditions, the Ministry of Trade and

Industry  (MTI)  expects  the Singapore  economy  to  slow  down

significantly, but not to the extent of going into a  recession.

MTI's  economic growth forecast for 1998 is 2.5  to  4.5%.   MTI

will continue to monitor future developments closely, and review

its forecast where necessary.



<br><br><b>Lessons from the financial crisis</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid development of the regional crisis and the

regional  outlook  for 1998 contains two important  lessons  for

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, even while the external environment appears

favourable,  things can deteriorate rapidly.  We  cannot  assume

that  the  external environment will remain benign forever.   We

should never be complacent.  Policy vigilance is necessary.   We

must  save and invest wisely in good times, to build up  a  deep

and firm economic foundation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the regional crisis has reaffirmed the importance

of  preserving  and  instilling confidence  internationally  and

domestically  for  continued  stability  and  economic   growth.

International  and domestic investors determine  demand,  invest

ment  and  hence the level of business activity.  The Government

must  therefore build up the confidence and trust  of  investors

through  credible, consistent and pro-growth  policies.   During

crises,  we  must  be  responsive and ready to  effect  rational

measures judiciously and promptly to restore market confidence.



<br><br><b>Policy Stance/Adjustments</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should use this period as an opportunity to build on our

considerable  strengths, review our longer term  strategies  and

position ourselves for future growth.  Fortunately, our  economy

is  now  much stronger and more resilient than it was  in  1985.

Our  economic  structure is more mature, our costs more  aligned

with  productivity  and economic growth, and our  people  better

trained  and  skilled  than a decade ago.  Our  current  account

surpluses and reserves are healthy, our export markets are  well

diversified,  and  our industrial and services  base  is  broad.

Overall, our fundamentals remain sound.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is watching closely the impact of the

regional  crisis on our economy.  The Committee  On  Singapore's

Competitiveness  has  gathered  private  sector   feedback   and

recommendations.  We  must make some adjustments   to  keep  our

business environment competitive, but drastic policy changes are

not appropriate or necessary at this juncture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In formulating our policies, the Government's key objective

is to maintain the framework for economic activity.  Market



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>



forces  will  compel industries to consolidate and  restructure.

Some  industries will feel the fall in business demand more than

others.   Weak and over-extended companies may have to merge  or

fold.   We  must  accept  this.  It is  the  normal  process  of

adjustment  to  new economic conditions.  The Government  cannot

prevent  it  from  happening, or intervene to support  companies

which are in difficulty, without paying a high price in terms of

misallocated resources and moral hazard.  At the same  time,  we

will  push  ahead with plans to restructure our economy  towards

higher   value-added  activities,  and  enhance   our   economic

capabilities and competitiveness to support future growth.



<br><br><b>(A) Fiscal Policy</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this period of uncertainty, we have emphasised

fiscal  prudence  in planning the Government  Budget.   We  have

decided to adopt a conservative fiscal stance, and target for  a

modest budget surplus, smaller than in recent years.  Government

revenues  will  be  stagnant.  We are keeping  a  tight  lid  on

operational   expenditures.   But  we  are  increasing   capital

expenditures,  particularly  in  the  key  areas  of  education,

economic infrastructure and defence, in order to invest for  the

long-term.



<br><br><i>Education</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human talent has always been our most precious resource,

and  will  become  increasingly critical as we  develop  into  a

knowledge-based  economy.  The quality of our  education  system

will  determine  whether  young Singaporeans  will  be  able  to

access, process and apply knowledge creatively.  The Ministry of

Education (MOE) has embarked on a comprehensive plan to  upgrade

both  the  hard  and soft aspects of our school  infrastructure.

For  example,  the  Master  Plan for Information  Technology  in

Education  seeks to impart thinking, learning and  communication

skills  through the use of information technology  (IT)  in  our

schools.   At the same time, the Master Plan aims to continually

anticipate  the needs of society in future and cater courses  to

meet these needs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Economic infrastructure</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our world-class infrastructure has helped to keep us in

front  in a highly competitive environment by keeping our  total

business  cost relatively low.  We must continue  to  invest  in

building  our  longer-term productive  capacity.   Key  economic

infrastructure projects we will push on with include reclamation

at  Changi  East,  Jurong Island Phase 3 and  the  upgrading  of

industrial  facilities at Tuas.  This counter-cyclical  spending

will boost the economy, and enable us to take advantage of lower

construction costs during the regional slowdown.



<br><br><i>Defence</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic prosperity depends on a framework of stability and

security.   A  strong, credible SAF deterrent  has  been  a  key

element of this framework.  A professional and effective defence

force  with cutting-edge capabilities is not built up overnight,

but  through prudent and consistent investment over many  years.

Defence  spending  must be seen as a long-term  investment,  not

dependent on the ups and downs of the economy from year to year.

A   credible   defence  capability  is  the  pre-condition   for

Singapore's continued peace and prosperity.



<br><br><b>(B) Wage Restraint & Skills Upgrading</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our overall cost structure is not significantly out of

line.  Singapore is internationally competitive, unlike in 1985.

But   we  should  be  careful  to  do  nothing  to  weaken   our

competitiveness  during this period of slower  economic  growth.

Cost containment will be a major concern for all businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wages form the largest component of business costs. We

need  to watch wage costs very carefully. Our priority this year

should be to protect jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies are already trimming back wage increases, and in

some  cases  freezing wages. The Government has  announced  that

salaries  of  ministers and civil servants will  effectively  be

frozen this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



year.  Wage moderation and flexibility are an important part  of

our response to the regional crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to the 1985 recession, our wage system was too rigid.

This made it difficult for companies to trim wage costs when the

economy  slowed, and contributed to deepening the recession.  To

trim costs, we had no alternative but to cut the employers'  CPF

contribution  rate.   So  after the recession,  we  set  up  the

flexible wage system. As the economy grew, year by year we built

up  a variable component of wages, instead of locking in all the

wage  increases of good years in the fixed wage.  This  variable

component  would  be  a buffer that could  be  reduced  not  too

painfully when business conditions changed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1987, when the flexible wage system was introduced, the

variable  component was, on average, 11% of total annual  wages.

Today, in the civil service the variable component has increased

to  at  least 20% of annual wages, while in the private  sector,

the variable component is about 16%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We built up the variable component of salaries precisely to

meet  a situation like this year.  If we need to trim wage costs

this  year, these variable components will be the first line  of

defence. This will depend on the NWC recommendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slower economic growth also makes it more urgent for

workers  to  re-skill,  re-train and upgrade  themselves.  There

will  be  retrenchments as industries and companies consolidate.

Workers  who  add significant value to companies are  those  who

will  keep  their  jobs.  The key challenge for  workers  is  to

remain relevant and employable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's policy has always been to create the right

conditions  for  companies to create good jobs, and  to  provide

ample training and upgrading opportunities for workers. We  have

not  opted for unemployment insurance, but instead have kept our

labour  market flexible.  This approach has served workers  well

and produced full employment for many years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, despite this, nobody can expect lifetime job

security. From time to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



time  workers  will  be retrenched, even in  a  full  employment

economy. When this happens, those who have been retrenched  must

be  willing  to  be  flexible  in  their  expectations,  and  if

necessary  accept a little less pay to secure a  new  job.   The

longer a worker stays unemployed, the more difficult it will  be

for him or her to rejoin the workforce.  Even now the number  of

foreign  professionals and workers is still increasing in  Singa

pore.  There  are  more  jobs  to be  filled  than  Singaporeans

available to do them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies too need to tighten their belts during this

period.   They  should  look at streamlining  and  consolidating

their  operations  to  cut  costs. They  should  also  take  the

opportunity  to  upgrade their capabilities, and  enhance  their

existing  products and services to prepare for the  upturn.   At

the  same  time, they should make more efforts to upgrade  their

workers.   While MNCs and larger companies have made significant

progress in worker training, reaching roughly 4-6% of investment

payroll, smaller companies still lag behind, spending an average

of  only about 2%.  Just as the Government is not letting up  on

our  investments in education, companies too should not  neglect

to improve the quality of their workforce.



<br><br><b>(C) Local Enterprise Financing Scheme</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another key concern of businessmen during this period of

slower growth is the availability and cost of capital to support

their  business activities.  Some businesses have reported  that

they  are  facing  higher interest rates and that  their  credit

lines are being pulled back.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some tightening of bank credit and increase in interest

rates  is  inevitable  at a time of regional  uncertainty.   The

Government has explained that it cannot intervene to  ask  banks

to   extend  loans  or  to  lower  interest  rates.   These  are

commercial lending decisions, which the banks themselves have to

take.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government will enhance its Local Enterprise

Financing  Scheme  (LEFS)  to help local  businesses  to  obtain

working capital.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will expand the scope of LEFS to cover more local

enterprises. For factoring and working loan facilities, we  will

raise the eligibility threshold for manufacturing companies from

a  maximum  of  $15 million in fixed productive assets,  to  $30

million.   For services companies, the cap on maximum employment

size will be raised from 200 to 300 employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Government will share a greater part of the

risk  in  LEFS.   Currently, for factoring loans,  the  risk  is

borne fully by the financial institution administering the  LEFS

loan,  while for working capital loans, the Government  and  the

financial institution share the risk 40:60.  The Government will

now  co-share  the risk for both factoring and  working  capital

loans  on a 50:50 basis with the financial institution. However,

the  financial  institution must still undertake  the  necessary

credit  analysis, and satisfy itself that the company is a  good

risk.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the maximum loan quantum per company for factoring

and  working capital loan facilities will be increased  from  $5

million to $8 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cater for the expected increase in the volume of LEFS

loans,  the Government will increase its provision in LEFS  loan

lines  from $760 million to $1.1 billion.  We will review  these

enhancements to LEFS in 2 years' time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Productivity and Standards Board and the Economic

Development Board will be releasing more details of the enhanced

LEFS shortly.



<br><br><b>(D) JTC/HDB Rentals</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides wages and the cost of capital, rentals form another

significant component of business costs.  In July last year, the

Jurong  Town  Corporation (JTC) implemented several measures  to

moderate  or  defer  rental increases for  its  lessees.   These

measures  are  up  for review on 1st July 1998.   Similarly,  in

December   1997,  the  Housing  and  Development   Board   (HDB)

implemented  a package of rental concessions for its  industrial

and  commercial  tenants.  The HDB package  included  moderating

rental adjustments at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



3rd  renewal of tenancies and staggering increases in  rent  for

sub-letting and assignment cases.  These steps were part of  the

Government's  continuing  efforts to review  and  moderate  cost

pressures on businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC and HDB will now extend additional rental concessions

to their tenants and lessees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) JTC and HDB will freeze their posted land rentals

for  an additional 12 months, till end June 1999.

They  will moderate rental adjustments for  their

industrial land lessees who are paying less  than

the posted rates.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) JTC will freeze the posted rentals of its

factories, workshops and warehouses till end June

1999,  and  similarly moderate rental adjustments

for existing tenants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) To help tenants and lessees who may have

temporary  cashflow problems, HDB  and  JTC  will

make   upfront  collections  of  rental  payments

monthly rather than quarterly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC and HDB will be releasing more details of these

concessions separately.



<br><br><b>(E) Government Land Releases</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area of concern is the health of the property

market in Singapore.  An unstable property market will not  only

affect   the  property  value  of  homeowners,  but   also   has

repercussions on the financial and economic system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November, the Government announced adjustments to the

private  residential  policies to avoid aggravating  the  excess

supply  in  the market.  The sale of sites for some 2,000  units

from the 1997 Government Land Sales (GLS) programme was deferred

to the first half of 1998.  The 1998 GLS programme was postponed

until the second half of 1998, and the original sale quantum  of

5,000 units was to be reviewed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the situation has altered considerably since November.

The  Government has decided on further adjustments to  its  land

sales in 1998 as follows:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Private Residential Properties</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will defer the sale of sites for 2,000

units,  scheduled  for  the first half of  1998.   It  plans  to

release   a   total  of  2,500  units  for  private  residential

development  in  the second half of 1998.  We will  continue  to

monitor  the regional and domestic situation, and if  necessary,

adjust the land sales programme again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy to release sufficient land over the medium term

to  meet Singaporeans' aspirations to own private properties  is

unchanged.   The Government will resume selling a steady  supply

of land when the market recovers.



<br><br><i>Executive Condominiums</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like private residential properties, the demand for

Executive  Condominiums has also been affected by  the  economic

slowdown.   The  Government  will reduce  the  land  supply  for

Executive  Condominiums in 1998 from the 3,000 units  originally

announced to 1,500 units.

<br><br><i>Commercial Space & Hotel Rooms</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will release land for about 80,000 square

metres of nett commercial space in 1998. This is about half  the

166,000  square  metres made available in 1997, and  takes  into

account the demand and supply situation in the medium term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there are enough hotel rooms to meet the needs of the

tourism  industry  in the medium term, the Government  will  not

release any land for hotel development in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of National Development will separately

announce details of the sites to be released in 1998 for private

residential  properties, Executive Condominiums  and  commercial

development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will also be making some tax changes and

concessions  to help ease business costs.  I will  elaborate  on

the details in a later part of my speech.





<br><br><div align="center"><b>CONCLUSION</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional financial crisis arose out of financial

excesses  and a rapid erosion of investor confidence.   Provided

stability is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>



maintained and effective reform measures are implemented, market

confidence will be gradually restored in the regional  economies

and  further fall-out will be minimised.  But if reform measures

are  unsuccessful or stability is shaken, it could  trigger  off

further uncertainty and economic difficulty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional crisis will affect the Singapore economy

significantly in 1998.  We must all be prepared for  the  slower

growth.    However, Singapore is in a strong position to weather

this  regional  storm.   Provided businesses,  workers  and  the

Government  rally  together, we will successfully  weather  this

difficult period and emerge more resilient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intense economic competition is already a reality. When

the  region  recovers, the regional economies  will  be  leaner,

fitter  and more competitive.  Singapore must use this  time  to

invest  wisely,  restructure,  consolidate  and  build  up   our

capabilities and productive capacities.  Whether we can ride the

next  wave of growth when the region recovers depends on whether

we continue to add value to the world.



<div align="center"><h4>II THE FY98 BUDGET</h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now present the Budget for Fiscal

Year 1998.



<div align="center"><b>EXPENDITURE POLICY</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating revenue in FY98 is expected to grow by 3.8% in

FY98,  lower than the average growth rate of 6.7% over the  past

three  years.   This  is due to the effects  of  lower  economic

growth and the follow through of tax cuts introduced in previous

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the slower increase in revenues, our

revenue  base  remains  robust  and  a  deficit  budget  is  not

envisaged.   Adequate funds will be available to  maintain,  and

even  increase, where necessary, expenditures needed to  support

long  term  growth  and  future competitiveness.   As  mentioned

earlier, this will mainly be in the areas of education, economic

infrastructure   and   defence.    However,   because   of   the

considerable uncertainties which continue to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>



overhang the region, we will exercise fiscal restraint in  other

non-crucial  areas  of expenditure.  The FY98  Budget  Estimates

have been prepared on this basis.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>FY98 EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total Government expenditure in FY98 will increase by 15%

to $27.2 billion.  This is more than double the expected nominal

GDP  growth rate, which will provide some fiscal stimulus to the

domestic  economy.  As in past years, we have however  continued

to keep a firm rein on operating expenditure, which will rise by

7.8%  to $15.5 billion.  This is 9.8% of GDP, up marginally from

9.7% of GDP in FY97.  On the other hand, development expenditure

is  expected  to  jump by 25% to $11.7 billion, carried  by  the

momentum of economic and infrastructural development which began

in recent years.  This accounts for 7.5% of GDP, up by more than

1 percentage point from 6.3% of GDP in FY97.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now highlight the salient features of this year's

expenditure  budget  against  the  backdrop  of  our   budgetary

policies.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>EXPENDITURE PRIORITIES</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, this year's budget continues to emphasise the

Government's  priorities on education, security, health,  public

housing,  environment, transportation and economic  development.

Chief among these are education and security which have a strong

bearing on Singapore's long-term strategic interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total spending on education will rise by a hefty 30% from

$4.4  billion  in FY97 to $5.7 billion in FY98.  The  jump  from

3.0%  to 3.6% of GDP brings our spending on education closer  to

the  medium-term  target of 4% of GDP.  We  can  take  pride  in

having  developed an educational system which we believe is  one

of  the best in the world.  Our students' performances have been

outstanding in international mathematics and science surveys and

Olympiads.   This  year,  higher  enrolments  are  projected  in

schools and tertiary institutions, leading to a 12% increase  in

operating  expenditure.  The main boost in the education  budget

however comes from a 80%



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



increase  in development spending on the building of  new  and

better schools and campuses, the single session secondary school

building  programme and the roll-out of the IT  Master  Plan  in

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defence spending will amount to 4.6% of GDP, up from 4.4%

in  FY97, but still well below the 6% of GDP that Government  is

prepared to commit to develop and maintain a strong and credible

defence  force.   So  long as revenues hold up,  we  should  not

slacken  spending in this area since the security of our  nation

is the very basis of our survival and prosperity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the emphasis on education, the social and community

services sector as a whole will account for the lion's share  of

37%  of total expenditure in FY98, with security coming in close

at  34%.   The share of spending on economic and infrastructural

development will exceed 20% for the second consecutive year,  up

from  an  average of only 15% over the period in  FY93-96.   The

increase   in  this  sector  is  driven  by  higher  development

spending.



<br><br><b>Operating Expenditure</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating expenditure in FY98 is expected to be 9.8% of

GDP.   As  a  share of GDP, this is consistent  with  levels  in

previous  years,  barring  the  one-time  compensation  of  $1.5

billion  to  SingTel in FY96 for removal of monopoly privileges.

At  around the 10% GDP level, our operating expenditure is  also

considerably lower than that of most developed countries.   This

is  the  result of a deliberate policy to keep the public sector

lean  and  trim,  avoiding welfarism and confining  Government's

role  to one of providing basic public goods and services,  thus

freeing  more  manpower and financial resources to  the  private

sector as the engine of growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the growth of operating expenditure will

not   be   held  down  dogmatically  without  regard  to  public

expectations  for  new and higher quality services  as  well  as

increased  workload.   Where  warranted,  we  will  provide  for

increases in operating expenditure.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1994, we have also introduced a financial management

system called Budgeting-for-Results or BFR, to raise the quality

and efficiency of public services.  Under the BFR programme, the

public sector is managed along the lines of Autonomous Agencies,

or  AAs.  With effect from April last year, all AAs are required

to  pre-specify output and performance targets that they hope to

achieve  for  the  budgets voted to them in return  for  greater

autonomy   in  financial  and  personnel  management.   Wherever

possible,  they will attempt to link their outputs  directly  to

their funding.  In this way, there is greater accountability for

deliverables,  and  transparency in the  utilisation  of  public

resources.   The  aim is to ensure that public sector  recurrent

spending  does  not  outstrip  nominal  GDP  growth  rate,  with

compensation made for increased workload and new programmes  and

services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BFR framework is appropriate and effective in

regulating  the  running  cost  of  Government  departments  and

Government-funded  statutory boards.  Running  costs  constitute

more  than  90%  of  our  operating expenditure.   Since  annual

increases  in cost factors are generally lower than GDP  growth,

any  increase in running costs as a share of GDP is due entirely

to new programmes and higher workload.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfers, the other component of operating expenditure,

are budgeted at $1.2 billion.  These constitute less than 10% of

operating  expenditure.  More than half will go to  restructured

hospitals as healthcare and medical subsidies, another 16%  will

go  to  town councils to subsidise estate management costs,  and

10%  will  go  to welfare and community self-help organisations.

This   reflects   the  Government's  philosophy  on   subsidies.

Subsidies are given selectively, and only on essentials such  as

basic  healthcare  and public housing on a  cost-sharing  basis.

For example, medical subsidies on hospitalisation are fixed as a

percentage of charges and skewed heavily in favour of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>



the  lower  income groups.  At the same time, genuine  cases  of

dire need are never ignored.  Medifund, set up in 1993 as a fall-back  for those who cannot afford to pay their share of  medical

cost,  is  expected  to  pay out some  $18  million  in  medical

subsidies in FY97 to cover the needs of those who cannot  afford

even the heavily subsidised C class charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its launch, the Medifund has received $600 million in

transfers from the Government to build up its capital endowment.

Based  on  the  current level of capital in the fund,  projected

income will be adequate to meet projected drawdowns in FY98.   I

do  not  therefore  propose to make an  additional  transfer  of

capital to the Medifund this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The absence of large scale public assistance programmes

reflects the Government's stand on state welfarism.  We  believe

that  extensive  welfare programmes damage  the  fabric  of  our

society  as  they  diminish  individual  responsibility,   self-reliance, community support and the work ethic.  Even in the UK,

the  Government has realised that welfarism is not the right way

to go, and is trying to roll back many of the welfare programmes

and  policies  introduced  after  the  Second  World  War.   Our

approach  is  one  of many helping hands, with  co-funding  from

Government  and  public  donations,  and  services  rendered  by

volunteers and members of the community.



<br><br><b>Development Expenditure</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a percentage of GDP, we spend much more on development

than the G-7 economies.  This reflects the emphasis we place  on

building  up  a  world-class infrastructure, focusing  on  areas

which  bring high returns and lasting benefits.  We will  invest

in  infrastructure  to  support economic  activities.   We  will

develop  a  first-rate road and rail network system to transport

people  and goods efficiently and more industrial land  will  be

made  available  through  reclamation.   School  buildings   and

teaching  systems  will be constantly upgraded  to  prepare  our

young  to  deal  with  future challenges in  the  workplace  and

society.   We  will  continue to invest in affordable  and  good

quality



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>



public  housing,  and  in modern drainage,  sanitary  and  waste

handling systems to support healthy living.  Not least, we  need

to   constantly  upgrade  our  defence  and  internal   security

infrastructure  so  that  our  families  and  assets  are   well

protected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last three years, that is, FY95-97, spending on

development has risen steadily from between 3-5% of GDP prior to

FY95  to 6.3% in FY97, and now, to 7.5% in FY98.  As Singapore's

economy graduates from the ranks of developing country status to

an  advanced developing economy, we will face new challenges and

stronger  competition.   We will need to  quicken  the  pace  of

economic  infrastructural  development  and  renewal,   and   to

accelerate  the  development  and education  of  our  workforce.

Notwithstanding the current regional economic turmoil, we intend

to  implement all the essential development programmes.  We will

then  emerge stronger and more robust once the storm blows  over

in this part of the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic development programmes under the Ministry of Trade

and  Industry are expected to cost $2.8 billion and account  for

the  largest share of development expenditure.  Its share of GDP

will rise from only 0.3% of GDP before FY95 to 1.8% of GDP.  The

thrust of development is in land reclamation on Jurong Island to

meet  expansion  needs  of  the  petroleum,  petrochemical   and

chemical  industry,  an  important  and  growing  arm   of   our

manufacturing sector.  More than $1 billion is committed in FY98

for  reclamation  of 1,800 hectares and a road  link  to  Jurong

Island.   In  addition, another $420 million has been  earmarked

for  on-going reclamation and development at Tuas  View.   Funds

are  also provided under the Economic Development and Assistance

Scheme,  and  the  building  of  a  mega  exhibition  centre,  a

centrepiece of the Tourism 21 plan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communications ranks second with a development budget of

$1.8  billion.  This is 1.2% of GDP, doubling from 0.66% of  GDP

in  FY96,  as  we  are  committed to create a  world-class  land

transport  system.  A sum of $1.2 billion is  provided  for  the

North East MRT Line, Changi MRT Extension,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>



Bukit  Panjang LRT, Sengkang LRT, a new MRT station at Singapore

Polytechnic  and the construction of a building  directly  above

and  integrated with the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station.  Also  on  the

cards are several improvements to our road network, such as  the

upgrading  of  expressways  and the  building  of  new  junction

interchanges and roads to ease congestion for faster movement of

people and goods.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, spending on economic and infrastructural

development as a whole is set to more than double from  1.3%  of

GDP  in FY93 to 3.1% of GDP in FY98.  For the second consecutive

year, it has overtaken social and community services as the  top

priority in development spending.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this has not been achieved at the expense of reduced

development spending on social and community services.  In fact,

development spending on social and community services  has  also

risen steadily and strongly over the past five years, from  1.7%

of GDP in FY93 to 2.7% of GDP in FY98.  This is driven mainly by

increased  spending  on education projects,  which  will  almost

double,  from  0.7%  of  GDP in FY93 to 1.2%  of  GDP  in  FY98.

Spending  on  drainage, sewerage and waste  disposal  facilities

under  the  Ministry of the Environment has also gone up  three-fold  from 0.2% of GDP in FY93 to 0.6% of GDP in FY98.   On  the

slate  are  a  fourth incineration plant, a  landfill  at  Pulau

Semakau,  and  the  upgrading  of  various  sewerage  works  and

facilities  to expand processing capacity to accommodate  future

demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital expenditure on public housing is expected to remain

at  about  0.5% of GDP, increasing by 8% to about $790  million.

This  includes  $150  million in capital  grants  to  HDB,  $350

million  for  the  main upgrading programme,  and  another  $130

million for the interim upgrading programme.

<div align="center"><b>III REVENUE AND TAX CHANGES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me turn next to

the fiscal position and the proposed tax changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue growth is expected to slow in 1998 in tandem with

slower  economic growth.  Estimated revenue collection is  $29.9

billion,  while  operating  and  development  expenditures   are

budgeted  at $27.2 billion.  The operating surplus for  FY98  is

therefore expected to be $2.7 billion or about 1.7% of GDP.   As

a  percentage of GDP, the surplus is much lower than the average

of  nearly 7% achieved over the five years between 1991 and 1995

and even lower than the 3.8% average of 1996 and 1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the direct impact of the regional turmoil on

lowering growth and revenue in FY98, there are two other reasons

for  the  smaller  surplus.  One is a general  slowdown  in  the

growth  of  revenue collection due to the cumulative effects  of

tax  cuts introduced over the past 12 years.  The other  is  the

substantial  rise in development expenditures in  recent  years.

Over  the  5-year  period  between 1991  and  1995,  development

expenditures averaged 4.3% of GDP per year.  In 1996  and  1997,

development  expenditures jumped to nearly 6.5% of GDP  when  we

embarked  on major programmes to upgrade and expand our economic

and  educational infrastructures.  Development expenditure  will

rise  further  to 7.5% of GDP in FY98 as implementation  of  the

Education  IT  Master  Plan,  North-East  MRT  Line   and   land

reclamation  programmes  accelerate.   These  expenditures   are

expected to peak in FY99.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite slower revenue growth and higher development

spending, the forecast surplus of 1.7% of GDP will allow  us  to

continue  with the policy of adding to our surpluses each  year.

The  need  to  build up our financial reserves  cannot  be  over

emphasised.   The  regional crisis has clearly demonstrated  the

importance of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



such  reserves,  especially for a small and  open  economy  like

ours.  If not for our strong fiscal and reserves positions,  our

currency  and  stock market would have been much  more  severely

affected  by  the  fallout  from  the  financial  crisis.    The

comfortable reserves position which we enjoy today is the result

of  prudent fiscal policies steadfastly pursued in the  past  30

years.  We are committed to continuing with these policies,  and

remain  confident  that our strong fundamentals  will  carry  us

through the current financial turmoil.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the FY98 budget, substantial increases in

infrastructure  expenditure  will  provide  stimulus  to  offset

slowdowns  in sectors affected by the regional crisis.  Although

GDP  growth is expected to slowdown substantially this  year,  a

decline  to  negative growth is not foreseen, so major  stimulus

initiatives  are not contemplated at this time.  Our  tax  rates

remain competitive and no major tax changes will be made against

a   background  of  declining  revenue  collections  and  rising

development expenditures.  However, as the economic  outlook  in

the   region  this  year  is  volatile  and  unpredictable,  the

situation  will  be  closely monitored.  If  a  sudden  downturn

should take place, Government will not hesitate to respond  with

off-budget measures, as we have more than adequate resources  to

cope  with  any eventuality.  In the interim, we will make  some

adjustments  to  lower the cost for businesses.   We  will  also

provide  some assistance to individuals and households  to  help

them tide through a more difficult year. I will elaborate on the

details  later.  In addition, we will continue to fine-tune  our

tax incentives to promote activities with high growth potential.

In  particular, there will be a package of incentives to promote

the development of the financial sector.  These refinements will

sharpen  our  competitive edge and ensure that when  the  region

recovers,   we   will  be  ready  to  take  advantage   of   the

opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal first with the tax changes for companies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>TAX CHANGES FOR COMPANIES</b></div>



<br><br><div align="center"><b>Tax Incentives to Promote Fund Management</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, fund managers approved under the Tax Exemption

Scheme for Fund Management enjoy a concessionary tax rate of 10%

on  the fee income earned from managing non-resident funds.   In

addition,  fund managers which manage at least $5 billion  worth

of non-resident funds can also enjoy a reduction in the tax rate

to  5%  on  the  incremental  income earned  compared  with  the

previous year.  Further, those which manage at least $10 billion

of non-resident funds are totally exempt from tax for the income

earned  from managing non-resident funds.  These tax incentives,

coupled  with  the  Government's decision to place  more  public

funds  with the private sector for management, have boosted  the

growth  of  our fund management industry.  In 1996 alone,  total

funds managed by financial institutions in Singapore jumped  45%

to  reach  $125  billion.  While growth in the  fund  management

industry  may have slowed somewhat amidst the current  financial

turmoil,   we  remain  optimistic  about  Singapore's  long-term

potential  as a major fund management centre in the  region.   I

have  therefore decided to introduce further measures to enhance

the  competitiveness  of  the industry.   These  complement  the

initiatives  to promote the fund management industry,  announced

by DPM Lee on Thursday, 26th February.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage more fund managers to expand their operations

in  Singapore, I have decided to lower the threshold requirement

to  qualify  for  the full tax exemption.  Fund  managers  which

manage at least $5 billion of non-resident funds will now  enjoy

the  full tax exemption for fee income earned from managing non-resident  funds for a period of 5 years.  This will replace  the

existing  concessionary tax rates of 5 and 0% for fund  managers

which  manage  $5 billion and $10 billion worth of  non-resident

funds  respectively.  For those which already manage $5  billion

of  non-resident  funds  and  have made  strong  commitments  to

further  increase their level of fund management  activities  in

Singapore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



a  longer  exemption period of up to 10 years may be considered.

In  addition, fund managers which manage less than $5 billion of

non-resident funds may qualify for the tax exemption for up to 5

years  if  they  increase  their fund management  activities  in

Singapore  substantially.  MAS will negotiate  these  conditions

with  individual fund managers, on a case-by-case basis, in  the

same  way  that  EDB  negotiates pioneer status  and  investment

allowance awards with individual companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new incentive scheme will be effective from Year of

Assessment 1999 and will be reviewed after 5 years.



<br><br><b>Tax Incentives to Promote the Bond Market</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has grown in importance as a regional centre for

the issue of bonds and other debt securities.  However, our bond

market is still less developed compared to our equity market  as

most  corporations  still prefer to raise funds  through  equity

listing  on the stock exchange or through direct borrowing  from

banks.   This  is  generally true of most markets  in  Asia.   A

vibrant  bond market is important to the overall development  of

Singapore  as  an  international  financial  centre.    I   have

therefore  decided  to  introduce a  package  of  incentives  to

promote  the development of an active bond market in  Singapore.

They are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) tax exemption on fee income earned by financial

institutions  in  Singapore from arranging  debt  securities  in

Singapore, including the underwriting and distribution  of  such

securities;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a 10% concessionary rate of tax on interest income

earned  by  financial institutions and corporations in Singapore

from  debt  securities  arranged by  financial  institutions  in

Singapore;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) tax exemption on interest from debt securities

arranged  by financial institutions in Singapore and  earned  by

non-  residents who do not have any permanent establishments  in

Singapore.  The exemption will apply automatically to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>



debt  securities which meet the criteria.  There will be no need

to seek approval for the tax exemption for each debt issue as is

currently the case; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) a 10% concessionary rate of tax on income earned by

financial  institutions  in  Singapore  from  trading  in   debt

securities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new tax treatment for fee and interest income will

apply  to  debt  securities issued within a period  of  5  years

commencing 28th February 1998.  The incentive for income  earned

from trading in debt securities will be granted for a period  of

5 years from 28th February 1998.



<br><br><b>Taxation of Unit Trusts</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1995 Budget, I introduced a tax incentive to promote

the  domestic unit trust industry.  Under this incentive, income

except  Singapore dividends received by a designated unit  trust

would  be  taxed at the time of distribution instead of  at  the

time  when the income was received by the trustee.  The trustees

are   however   required  to  withhold  tax   on   the   taxable

distributions.   The  incentive also  granted  a  concession  to

resident individual unit holders who were taxed only on  10%  of

the  distributions  made  out  of gains  from  the  disposal  of

securities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make investments in unit trusts more attractive to

resident  individuals, I have decided to remove the tax  imposed

on resident individual unit holders for 10% of the distributions

paid out of gains from the disposal of securities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, to simplify the management of unit trusts, I have

also  decided to remove the withholding requirement  on  taxable

distributions  made  to unit holders who are  tax  residents  of

Singapore.  Unit holders who are tax residents are however still

liable to pay tax on the distributions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes will take effect from 28th February 1998.



<br><br><b>Tax Exemption Scheme For Syndicated Offshore Credit And Underwriting Facilities</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax exemption scheme for syndicated offshore credit and

underwriting facilities was introduced to promote the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



development   of  loan  and  debt  syndication   activities   in

Singapore.   Under  the  scheme,  income  earned  by   financial

institutions  in  Singapore from arranging and participating  in

syndicated facilities denominated in foreign currencies for non-resident  borrowers is exempt from tax.  The scheme has resulted

in  the  growth  of the loan and debt syndication activities  in

Singapore.  In the past three years, an average of $13.5 billion

of  such facilities were syndicated by financial institutions in

Singapore annually.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme is due to expire on 31st March 1998. I have,

however,  decided  to  extend it for  another  five  years.   In

addition, I have also decided to extend the scheme to credit and

debt  facilities which are syndicated by financial  institutions

in  Singapore for Singapore borrowers, provided the funds raised

are used outside Singapore.  These measures will help to further

develop  the  syndication market in Singapore.  They  will  take

effect from 1st April 1998.



<br><br><b>Tax  Deduction for General Provisions Made by Banks and Merchant Banks</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1991, we introduced an incentive to encourage banks and

merchant banks to build up their level of general provisions  as

a  cushion  against  unexpected losses.  Each  year,  banks  and

merchant  banks  are allowed to claim tax deduction  on  general

provisions  of  up  to  25% of qualifying  profits  or  0.5%  of

qualifying loans and investments, whichever is lower.  For  each

bank  or  merchant  bank,  the level of tax  deductible  general

provisions  on a cumulative basis cannot exceed 3% of qualifying

loans and investments.  Many banks and merchant banks have taken

advantage   of   this  incentive  to  build  up  their   general

provisions.   This  has  helped  to  enhance  the  soundness  of

individual  banks  and merchant banks, and  also  the  financial

system,  especially  during this period  of  regional  financial

turbulence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage banks and merchant banks to further build up

their  general provisions, I have decided to temporarily suspend

the  annual  limits  of 25% of qualifying profits  and  0.5%  of

qualifying loans and investments for a period of two years



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>



with  effect from Year of Assessment 1998.  This will give banks

greater  flexibility  to  make as  much  general  provisions  as

possible  to cushion against potential losses arising  from  the

regional  financial difficulties.  The overall limit  of  3%  of

qualifying loans and investments, which was raised from 2%  last

year, will remain unchanged.



<br><br><b>Extension of Tax Holiday for SIMEX</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore International Monetary Exchange Limited

(SIMEX)  was  granted a 5-year tax holiday  when  it  was  first

established in 1984.  The tax holiday was extended in  1988  and

again  in  1993  for additional 5-year periods  to  support  the

growth  of  SIMEX.  The incentive has enabled  the  Exchange  to

build up its reserves and improve on its trading infrastructure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIMEX is currently the foremost financial futures exchange

in  the Asian time zone for the trading of international futures

and  options  contracts.  But there is no room for  complacency.

In  order to meet the challenges of global competition  and  the

emergence of other exchanges in the region, SIMEX must  continue

to  improve  on  its  facilities and  strengthen  its  financial

reserves.   I  have therefore decided to extend the tax  holiday

for SIMEX by another 5 years to the year 2003.

<br><br><b>Extension of Venture Capital Incentives</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been actively promoting the venture

capital  industry  since the mid-1980s.  Venture  capital  funds

managed in Singapore have reached $7.7 billion as at end of last

year.   Currently, venture capital funds enjoy tax exemption  on

the   gains  from  disposal  of  investments,  and  on   certain

investment incomes for a maximum of 10 years.  At the same time,

fund management companies which manage venture capital funds are

awarded pioneer status for managing these funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current 10-year limit may be too restrictive for some

investments which have maturity periods which are longer than 10

years.   I  have  therefore decided to extend the tax  incentive

enjoyed by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



venture  capital  funds, on a case-by-case basis,  by  up  to  a

further  5  years beyond the current maximum of 10 years.   This

will  encourage  venture capital funds to  take  a  longer  term

perspective  of  their  investments and  to  minimise  premature

divestment.  The extension will take the form of a concessionary

tax  rate  of not more than 10%.  The fund management  companies

which  manage  these venture capital funds will also  in  tandem

enjoy concessionary tax rate under the Development and Expansion

Incentive  beyond  the  tenth  year.   The  changes  will   take

immediate effect.



<br><br><b>Transport and Logistics</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our transport and logistics network has played a pivotal

role   in   Singapore's  development  as  a   global   city   of

international trade.  Today, the transport and logistics  sector

contributes 9% to GDP and employs more than 110,000  workers  or

about  7%  of  our  work force.  As an industry  which  provides

essential  support to our trade sector, it needs  to  constantly

evolve  new  and  improved services to meet the demands  of  the

trade.   Our  continued growth as a global city of international

trade and hub port also depends critically on the development of

a  transport  and logistics sector with extensive networks.   To

encourage  major  transport and logistics operators  to  further

expand their businesses in Singapore and use Singapore as a base

for  their operations, I have therefore decided to introduce the

following tax concessions:



<br><br><i>(a) Tax Exemption for Income Derived from Uplift of Freight</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, tax is levied on the uplift of cargoes from

Singapore, except for Singapore-flagged vessels and vessels from

countries  with  which Singapore has signed a  tax  treaty.   To

further boost Singapore's development as an international  cargo

and  shipping  hub,  I have decided to exempt non-resident  ship

owners  and  charterers from tax on their  freight  uplift  from

Singapore.   This  benefit  will also be  extended  to  resident

shipping companies and companies under the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approved International Shipping Enterprise Scheme. Removal of

the tax on freight uplift would allow shipping companies greater

flexibility in planning their shipping schedules and operations.

The exemption will take effect from Year of Assessment 1999.



<br><br><i>(b) Tax Concession for International Freight and Logistics Operators</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has a long history as the main shipping and

distribution  hub  in the region.  To further  enhance  our  hub

status, I have decided to introduce a tax incentive to encourage

international   freight  service  providers  to   expand   their

activities  in Singapore.  This incentive will be  available  to

ship   agencies,   ship  management  companies   and   logistics

providers.  To qualify for the incentive, the company must  have

substantial operations and a good track record in the  provision

of  freight and logistics services.  Companies that qualify will

be  accorded  a concessionary tax rate of not less than  10%  on

their  incremental income. The incentive will be granted  for  a

period  of  five  years  and  will  take  effect  from  Year  of

Assessment 1999.



<br><br><i>c) Tax Exemption for Income Derived From Writing Offshore Marine Hull and Liability Insurance Business</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that Asian shipping companies own more than

40%  of  world shipping tonnage today.  Singapore is well placed

to  serve  the  marine insurance needs of the companies  in  the

region,  particularly  in  the  provision  of  marine  hull  and

liability  insurance.  I have therefore decided to  exempt  from

tax  the  income  derived by approved insurance  companies  from

writing  offshore  marine hull and liability insurance  business

for  a  period of 10 years.  The incentive would allow insurance

companies  to  tap  the  insurance  potential  of  the  shipping

communities in the region.  It would also complement Singapore's

development as a shipping hub.  This concession will take effect

from Year of Assessment 1999.



<br><br><b>Tax Incentive For Exhibition Organisers</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is currently a major venue for international

exhibitions and trade fairs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>



Given  our  strategic location and excellent infrastructure,  we

are  well positioned to develop into an International Exhibition

City.   To  provide  further impetus to the development  of  the

exhibition  industry,  I have decided that  approved  exhibition

organisers will be granted a concessionary tax rate of not  less

than 10% on their incremental income.  The incentive will enable

exhibition  organisers  to  offer  better  quality  and   bigger

exhibitions  and  trade  fairs  to  the  international  business

community.   The  incentive  will  take  effect  from  Year   of

Assessment 1999.



<br><br><b>Approved Cyber-Trader Scheme</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in technology have revolutionised the mode of

business transactions.  Internet, for example, is set to  change

the  way companies conduct their businesses.  The value of goods

and services currently being traded on the Internet is estimated

at  US$46 billion.  It is expected to grow to between US$200-300

billion by the year 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internet electronic commerce holds many opportunities for

businesses.  The financial and logistics sectors will gain  from

the  increased international trading generated by this new  mode

of transaction.  The media and communications sectors, including

advertising,  information technology, and content creation  will

also  benefit from this development.  Local companies  can  take

advantage of this new medium to expand their businesses  to  the

region  and  beyond  through  direct  marketing  and  other  new

strategies.  Foreign companies can also use Singapore as a test-bed for broadband applications and a launch pad for its Internet

trading activities in the region.  The uniqueness of Asia  calls

for  a  hub  that  can  service this time  zone,  and  meet  its

distribution and consumer needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is well placed to become an electronic commerce

hub.   To  tap this growing market, I have decided  to  grant  a

concessionary tax rate of 10% on offshore trading income derived

from  transactions  made over the Internet  under  the  Approved

Cyber Trader Scheme for companies that qualify. Approved



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



companies will also enjoy an Investment Allowance of up  to  50%

of  the  cost of qualifying new fixed investments, and  full  or

partial  exemption  of  withholding tax on qualifying  payments.

These  incentives will be granted for a period of 5  years  with

effect  from  Year  of  Assessment 1999.   The  scheme  will  be

administered by the Trade Development Board.



<br><br><b>Double Tax Deduction for Employing Talent from Abroad</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has at last year's National Day Rally

spoken  on  the need for Singapore to tap the best  talent  from

around  the  world to meet future competition.   In  support  of

this,  I  have  decided to allow companies to claim  double  tax

deduction  for  approved  relocation  and  recruitment  expenses

incurred  in the hiring of talent from abroad.  The  double  tax

deduction  will  help to offset the extra costs which  companies

have  to  bear in employing such talent to supplement our  local

work  force.   Further details of the scheme will  be  announced

later.



<br><br><b>One-Year Accelerated Depreciation Allowance For Industrial Noise And Chemical Hazards Control</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noise and harmful chemicals are the two main occupational

health  hazards in industries.  Exposure to excessive noise  can

cause hearing loss, while overexposure to harmful chemicals  may

result  in  poisoning and diseases.  As Singapore  continues  to

industrialise,  more workers could be exposed to  these  hazards

unless measures are taken to prevent them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage factories to implement effective measures to

counter  noise  and chemical hazards, I have  decided  to  allow

expenditure on such measures to enjoy 100% depreciation  in  the

first  year, provided that certain qualifying criteria  relating

to  noise  and  chemical exposure levels  are  satisfied.   This

incentive  will apply to expenditure incurred with  effect  from

1st  January  1998.   The  scheme will be  administered  by  the

Ministry of Labour.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



Details  of  the  guidelines and qualifying criteria  for  these

incentives are set out in Annexes (Cols. 565 - 572) I and II.

<br><br><div align="center><b>TAX CHANGES FOR INDIVIDUALS</b></div>



<br><br><b>Income Tax Rebate</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slower economic growth will translate into more moderate

wages  for  our  workers.   The impact  will  be  felt  by  both

individuals and households.  To provide a measure of  relief  to

taxpayers, I have decided to give an across-the-board rebate  of

5%  on  individual income tax in Year of Assessment  1998.   The

estimated revenue loss to Government will be $130 million.

<br><br><b>Rebates on HDB Service and Conservancy and Rental Charges</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the GST-related changes made to personal income

tax, currently about 70% of individuals no longer pay income tax

and   would  not  benefit  from  the  income  tax  rebate.   The

Government  will  grant rebates on HDB Service  and  Conservancy

(S&C)  charges and rentals to citizens in this group staying  in

rented  and  owner-occupied HDB flats.  The rebates will  be  as

follows:

<br><br>(a) One-Room Flats

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two months' net rent and two months' net S&C charges, after

deduction of the GST offset rebates and the S&C grant associated

with  the  utilities rebates which I will elaborate later.   The

rental and S&C rebates will be made on 1st June and 1st December

this year.

<br><br>(b) Two-Room Flats

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One month's net rent and two months' net S&C charges, after

deduction  of the GST offset rebates and S&C grant to be  given.

The  rental  rebate will be made on 1st December,  and  the  S&C

rebates on 1st June and 1st December this year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>(c) Three-Room Flats

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One and a half months' net S&C charges, after deduction of

the  GST  offset  rebates and S&C grant to be  given.   The  S&C

rebate will be made on 1st June and 1st December this year.

<br><br>(d) Four-Room Flats

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three quarter month's net S&C charges, after deduction of

the  S&C grant to be given.  The S&C rebate will be made on  1st

December this year.

<br><br>(e) Five-Room Flats

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half a month's net S&C charges, to be made on 1st December

this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated cost of these rental and S&C rebates is $29

million.



<br><br><b>Rebates for Revisions in Utilities Rates</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, utilities rebates and monthly S&C grants were

given to citizens living in 1 to 4-room HDB flats to offset  the

utilities  rates increases for the lower income  households.   I

announced  that  the Government would grant the  same  utilities

rebates  and monthly S&C grants in 1998.  I am happy to  confirm

that  the  same utilities rebates and S&C grants will  be  given

this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The utilities rebate will be $100 for 1-, 2-, and 3-room

HDB  flats, and $50 for 4-room HDB flats.  The rebates  will  be

credited against the utilities bills of eligible households  for

the month of September which are payable in October.  Households

with  smaller bills which are unable to use up the rebate within

the  month can carry over the balance of the rebate until it  is

fully used up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S&C grant will be $3 per month for 1-room flats, $4 per

month for 2-room flats, $5.50 per month for 3-room flats, and $4

per  month  for 4-room flats.  The monthly grant, which  started

from July 1997, will continue until June 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The utilities rebates and S&C grant will cost the

Government about $72 million.  Those lower income households who

do not live in HDB flats and hence are unable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to benefit from the utilities rebate and S&C grant can obtain

help   from  the  Citizens  Consultative  Committees  Assistance

Scheme.



<br><br><b>Pre-Medisave Top-Up Scheme</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pre-Medisave Top-Up Scheme was introduced in 1996 to

help  older  Singaporeans who retired before or soon  after  the

introduction  of  Medisave to build up their Medisave  accounts.

The  first three instalments under the Scheme had been  paid  in

January  1996,  January  1997,  and  January  1998.   The   last

instalment is to be paid in January 1999, subject to  the  state

of  the  economy.  Notwithstanding the expected slowdown in  the

economy,  I am pleased to confirm that the Government  will  pay

the  final  instalment  of  the Pre-Medisave  Top-Up  Scheme  in

January 1999 as scheduled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top-up will be paid into the CPF Medisave accounts of

eligible  Singaporeans who are 64 years or older  on  1st  April

1998.   As  with  the third instalment, the co-payment  required

will  only be $20, instead of $50 for the first two instalments.

The lower co-payment is to help as many elderly Singaporeans  as

possible  to  benefit  from  the scheme  while  maintaining  the

principle  that  health  care should be a  joint  responsibility

between  the  individuals, their families  and  the  Government.

Eligible  recipients  will have to make the  co-payment  of  $20

between  1st  July 1998 and 31st December 1998  into  their  CPF

Medisave  Account.  The Government will match this  $20  with  a

contribution of $100 to $350 depending on the age group. 250,000

senior  citizens qualify for this scheme and the total  cost  of

this, if fully taken up, is $70 million.



<br><br><b>Revision of CPF Interest Rates for Special and Retirement Accounts & Voluntary Transfer of CPF Savings from Ordinary Account to Special Account</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the CPF Special Account and Retirement Account

both  receive an interest rate premium of 1.25% over  and  above

the  Ordinary Account.  From 1st July 1998, the Government  will

raise the interest rate premium for these two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>



accounts   by  a  quarter percentage point, to 1.5%,  above  the

Ordinary  Account interest rate.  This is to enable CPF  members

to achieve a higher rate of saving in these two accounts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, from 1st July 1998, CPF members will be given

the  option  of  transferring their savings  from  the  Ordinary

Account  to the Special Account.  These transfers will be  on  a

voluntary  basis.   The amount that can be transferred  will  be

subject to a cap of $40,000 in the Special Account, that  is,  a

CPF  member  can  only  transfer up to  the  difference  between

$40,000  and  his  Special Account balance at the  time  of  the

transfer.   The  $40,000 limit is equal  to  the  eventual  cash

component of the CPF Minimum Sum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transferred funds will form part of the Special Account

and  will  enjoy  the  higher interest rate  applicable  to  the

account.  However, the transferred funds will be subject to  all

existing  CPF  rules  on  the  Special  Account,  including  the

restrictions  on  the  use  and withdrawal  of  funds  from  the

account.  Also, all such transfers from the Ordinary Account  to

the  Special Account will not be reversible.  CPF members should

therefore consider carefully before making such transfers to the

Special Account to earn higher interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two changes to the CPF will help CPF members enhance

their  retirement cash savings.  They are estimated to cost  the

Government more than $100 million per year.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>OTHER TAX CHANGES</b></div>



<br><br><b>Property Tax Rebate</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help ease cost pressure on companies, I have decided to

give  a 15% rebate for commercial and industrial properties  for

the  year  commencing July 1998.  The revenue loss to Government

is  estimated to be $145 million.  HDB, JTC and other Government

agencies  owning properties will pass on most of this rebate  to

their   tenants.    The  Government  also  strongly   encourages

landlords  to  do  likewise, and pass on at least  half  of  the

rebate to their tenants.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><b>Property Tax Exemption for Land Under Development</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1986 and 1995, land under development was exempted

from  property  tax.   The  exemption  was  introduced  to  help

developers tide over the economic downturn during the  recession

years.  It was subsequently withdrawn after the economy and  the

property  market  had shown strong recovery.   In  view  of  the

current  difficulties  faced  by the  property  sector,  I  have

decided  to reinstate the property tax exemption for land  under

development.  The  exemption will be for a period  of  up  to  5

years,  and will apply from the time construction begins to  the

time  the Temporary Occupation Permit is granted.  The exemption

will  take  immediate effect.  The estimated revenue  loss  from

this measure is $200 million a year.



<br><br><b>Stamp Duties</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, stamp duty is levied on a variety of instruments

specified in the First Schedule of the Stamp Duties Act.  In the

<br><br>1996&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget,  stamp  duty  was  abolished  on  13   types   of

instruments.   To  further  reduce costs  and  inconvenience  to

businesses  and  members  of  the public,  stamp  duty  will  be

abolished  on all instruments, except for those which relate  to

stock  and  shares,  and  immovable properties.   The  estimated

revenue  loss  from these changes is $33 million.   The  changes

will take effect from 28th February 1998.  Details are set forth

in Annex III (Cols. 573 - 576).

<br><br><b>Duties on Cigarettes</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duties on cigarettes were last increased in February 1993

to  discourage  smoking.  In support of the national  effort  to

discourage  smoking, particularly among the younger  population,

the  excise duty on cigarettes will be raised from $115 to  $130

per kilogram.  Details of the changes are in Annex IV (Cols. 577

-  580).  The changes in duties is estimated to increase revenue

by about $35 million a year, and will take effect from today.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><b>Electronic Road Pricing and Vehicle Tax Rationalisation</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Communications will be introducing the

Electronic  Road  Pricing  (ERP)  system  this  year.   It  will

commence on 1st April 1998 on the East Coast Parkway (ECP),  and

would be phased in to other parts of Singapore over the next two

years.   In  conjunction with the introduction of the  ERP,  the

vehicle tax structure will be rationalised and a package of road

tax rebates will be given.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes in road tax structure and the road tax rebate

package  will result in a revenue loss of about $1  billion  for

the Government for the next 5 years.  This revenue loss will  be

partly  offset  by ERP revenue and additional revenue  from  the

release  of  more  COEs over the next 3-5 years.   Overall,  the

Government  expects  to  achieve  revenue  neutrality  for  this

exercise  in  about 8 years.  Details of the ERP  implementation

plan,  the  road  tax  rebate package and the  new  vehicle  tax

structure  will  be announced by the Minister for Communications

next week.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>CONCLUSION</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the events since July 1997 have shown how

quickly  the  regional environment can turn  unfavourable.   The

policy  measures  introduced in this budget  are  based  on  our

assessment of the present state of the Singapore economy and the

outlook  for  the year.  They assume that no major changes  will

occur in the external economic environment which will affect  us

drastically.   But we cannot be certain how the  situation  will

develop.   The Government will monitor the regional  environment

and economic conditions vigilantly, and keep in close touch with

the  private  sector.  If the picture changes, we are  ready  to

implement  further measures promptly.  We have the resources  to

do  so.  We  cannot  totally neutralise  the  fallout  from  the

regional  crisis, but we will do everything possible  to  offset

its impact on Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businesses and individuals must prepare themselves for a

period of slower growth and uncertainty.  They must be ready  to

respond to unanticipated developments, and not flinch from tough

measures  where warranted.  Our best approach is to  acknowledge

the  realities of the situation, however adverse  they  may  be.

This maximises our chances of surmounting the problems.  It also

demonstrates  to  investors  and analysts  our  preparedness  to

tackle problems directly rather than evading them.  This adds to

confidence in Singaporeans and in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we stay united in tackling the problems which come our

way,  we  will  strengthen  our competitiveness,  ride  out  the

crisis, and emerge stronger than before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.
