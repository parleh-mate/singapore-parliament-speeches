at certain moments in time, we are reminded starkly that each of us has but one life here, one lone opportunity to leave a mark on our family, our friends, our fellow men, our country. The true measure of a man is seen not just in the height of his accomplishments here and now, but also in the depth of the gap he leaves behind when he passes on, and in the loss that we all feel.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This past week, Singapore has lost one of its finest sons.&nbsp; Dr Ong Chit Chung* was a distinguished parliamentarian, a devoted representative of his constituency, a learned intellectual, a leading business figure, and much more.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We salute his achievements in these fields. But we will always remember him as a fellow comrade and colleague, a generous mentor, an inspiring individual. He was, for many of us as well, a close and dear friend.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As with fellow Members of this House, I was stunned when I first heard the sad news of Dr Ong&rsquo;s sudden passing.&nbsp; I have known Dr Ong for many years. We both entered Parliament together in 1988, worked closely in many areas, and enjoyed many hours of fellowship.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only recently, we, the 1988 batch of MPs, past and present, had dinner with him and his wife Elizabeth, a gathering which Chit Chung&nbsp; had initiated and organised.&nbsp; We had a good time talking about many things &ndash; politics, family, life.&nbsp; He was his usual meticulous self, making sure all arrangements were perfect, right down to the bottle of 1988 red that Elizabeth told me he had personally selected.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2810</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many have paid tribute this past week to Dr Ong&rsquo;s many notable achievements, such as his dedicated grassroots work, his outstanding contributions to defence and security issues and his active engagement with unions. He was an exemplary union advisor who helped to strengthen labour-management relations on the ground, for which he was recognised by the NTUC as a&nbsp; Friend of Labour.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, it would be difficult to list fully all of Dr Ong&rsquo;s accomplishments. I cannot but echo the Prime Minister&rsquo;s words, when he called Dr Ong a man of deep convictions, a party stalwart, and an indispensable member of the PAP election team. Those of us who have fought many tough election battles will recall the invaluable help rendered by his Bukit Batok branch, whose members churned out the flyers and pamphlets for our campaign, sometimes at very short notice.</p><p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong was a veteran member of this House. He first entered Parliament in 1988, and served two terms as Member for Bukit Batok from 1988 to 1996. After the January 1997 General Election, he was returned to Parliament as a Member for Bukit Timah GRC. At the November 2001 General Election, Dr Ong was once again returned to Parliament, serving as MP for Jurong GRC, a position which he held into this current term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was a dedicated and hardworking MP, who served his residents well and represented them fearlessly and faithfully in Parliament. He reflected their hopes and aspirations,&nbsp; as well as their frustrations and fears.&nbsp; He in turn was well-loved by his residents, from all walks of life, all ages and races. This was all too evident in the stream of people who came to pay their last respects to him at the funeral service on Friday.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong served this House and this Government tirelessly and with <p align=left>Column: 2811</p>distinction. He was Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Home Affairs and the then Ministry of Labour from 1991 to 1993. He was Deputy Government Whip from 1994 to 2002.&nbsp; Apart from various other committee appointments, Dr Ong was also the former GPC Chairman for Education, and for Defence and Foreign Affairs.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all recall the many passionate speeches which Dr Ong made in this very Chamber, on various issues close to his heart, from defence to education to social welfare. We remember the many sterling contributions he made, both within and outside Parliament. We treasure those too few moments each of us had with him. We will never forget our comrade in arms, this stalwart of a man, this fine son of Singapore.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on behalf of this House, may I express our deepest condolences to the family of the late Dr Ong Chit Chung.&nbsp; The family is&nbsp;with us in the House today. To his wife Elizabeth, and his two sons, Christopher and James, their spouses Magdalene and Sharon and his sisters, Chai Ming, Chai Peng and Tan Leong, we mourn with you the loss of your husband, father, brother, and our friend and comrade, Ong Chit Chung.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></P></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B> Sir, both questions pertain to alleged illegal organ trading transactions in Singapore.&nbsp; As the case is before the courts and further investigations are still on-going, I should not comment on them.&nbsp; After the case has been fully wrapped up, my Ministry will review existing measures and fix any inadequacy.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me instead discuss this subject generally to outline the extent of the problem, our current approach and our strategy going forward.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End stage renal disease (ESRD) or kidney failure is a dreadful disease.&nbsp; Every year, about 1,000 new cases are diagnosed here.&nbsp; 38% of the patients will not survive the first year given the severity of their illness.&nbsp; For the remaining 600 patients, the treatment options are limited: either a kidney transplant or life-long kidney dialysis.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2813</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kidney transplant is the preferred option as patients&rsquo; life expectancy is longer and their quality of life is better as the transplanted patients do not have to be hooked on to a dialysis machine for a significant portion of their life.&nbsp; But kidney transplant is a major operation with its attendant risk.&nbsp; Old age and other co-morbidity of the patient can significantly increase the surgical risk to the patient and reduce the chance of a successful transplant.&nbsp; That is why only about a third of the 600 new patients, ie, 200, are suitable for kidney transplant and can potentially benefit from the transplant option.&nbsp; The other 400 new patients will have to depend on kidney dialysis.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Donated kidneys come from two sources: deceased donors and live donors.&nbsp; Like the rest of the world, we have worked to increase the kidney transplant rate.&nbsp; While we are not yet getting 200 kidney transplants a year, we have raised our transplant rate quite significantly.&nbsp; We are now about 50% sufficient, which is not bad as compared to many other countries.&nbsp; This is a result of our adopting the Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA) based on presumed consent in 1987, 21 years ago,&nbsp;and our more recent efforts to promote living donor organ transplants.&nbsp; HOTA now contributes about 50 kidneys a year and living-related kidneys another 30, for a total of 80 kidneys a year.

Both of these countries have successful altruistic organ donation systems built up through years of sustained public education.&nbsp; In Singapore, we have not yet maximised the yield through altruistic organ donations.&nbsp; Let us emulate them and push altruistic organ donations to their maximum potential.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With or without legalising kidney trading, HOTA and living-related kidney donations must be the predominant sources of kidney transplantation.&nbsp; But if altruistic kidney donations cannot fully meet demand, we should continue to search for good complementary solutions.&nbsp; We should not reject any idea just because it is radical or controversial.&nbsp; By forcing ourselves to think about unconventional approaches, we may be able to find an acceptable way to allow a meaningful compensation for some living-unrelated kidney donors, without breaching ethical principles or hurting the sensitivities of others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally, I receive requests from some charities and religious bodies which wish to provide some compensation, in kind and in cash, for the organ donors and their families, to acknowledge their altruistic act.&nbsp; But they worry that this may be construed as organ-trading and they may be breaching the HOTA rules.&nbsp; My view is that we should encourage third parties, especially those from the charity and religious sector, to help promote altruistic organ donations, and that we should consider how they can be allowed to provide some financial <p align=left>Column: 2816</p>compensation to the donors and their families after the transplants have taken place.&nbsp; My Ministry will study whether such an idea is feasible and, if so, whether HOTA needs to be amended to facilitate its implementation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the reality is that we have not fully met the demand for kidneys and there are desperate patients out there wishing to live and desperately poor people willing to exchange a kidney for a hopefully improved life.&nbsp; While countries and ethicists proclaim that organ trading is illegal and immoral, a black market of illegal transplants flourishes in many countries, and not just in Asia, with poor clinical results for many patients and exploitation of many in poverty.&nbsp; This is the stark reality and the human dilemma confronted by many in such desperate situations.&nbsp; We must therefore take a practical approach.&nbsp; Criminalising organ trading does not eliminate it.&nbsp; But it merely breeds a black market with the middleman creaming off the bulk of the compensation which the grateful patient is willing to offer the donor.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Arthur Lim, a senior doctor and a past President of the Singapore Medical Association, argued eloquently in a letter to the <I>Straits Times</I> just last week that organ-trading "laws should be removed or amended to take into account the desperate circumstances of dying kidney patients."&nbsp; While they have breached the technical aspects of the law, Prof. Arthur Lim argued that "It is wrong to consider them criminals .....&nbsp;&shy;In the same way, kidney donors should be supported and not regarded as criminals."&nbsp; He appealed to Singaporeans to think over this important issue carefully, knowing that it is complex.&nbsp; He hoped that Singapore "will not go down in history as a nation with no support and empathy for those who are dying from kidney failure.".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the practical problem of organ shortage grows, attitude towards com<p align=left>Column: 2817</p>pensating kidney donors is gradually changing, and not just in Singapore.&nbsp; Prof. Gary Becker, Professor of Economics and Sociology and Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, published an article recently, entitled: "Should the purchase and sale of organs for transplant surgery be permitted?"&nbsp; Prof. Becker won the 1992 Nobel Prize in Economics and he studied the applications of economics to social policies.&nbsp; I would suggest to our media to publish this article of his so that more Singaporeans can be informed of this school of thought.&nbsp;&nbsp;The academic ethicists and medical doctors may be against the sale of organs, but the economists have analysed the problem from a practical perspective, which deserves to be considered.&nbsp; In the article, Prof. Becker carefully weighed the pros and cons and came to this conclusion:&nbsp; "My conclusion is that markets in organs are the best available way to enable persons with defective organs to get transplants much more quickly than under the present system. &nbsp;I do not find compelling the arguments against allowing the sale of organs, especially when weighed against the number of lives that would be saved by the increased supply stimulated by financial incentives."<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of my Ministry, even as we take action against those involved in illicit organ trading and unscrupulously exploiting the desperate and the vulnerable, we will take a sympathetic approach to the plight of the exploited donors and the basic instinct of kidney failure patients to try to live.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I have three supplementary questions for the Minister.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to welcome the two initiatives that the Minister has mentioned that will help to increase the number of donors available for transplants.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has not answered this question but I think it is still a pertinent <p align=left>Column: 2818</p>one, especially since we still have the current legal framework in place&nbsp;&ndash; will&nbsp;the Ministry&nbsp;consider setting up an independent Ethics Committee to assess donations of kidneys by non-related donors and recipients?&nbsp; One of the difficulties is that of getting the hospital ethics committee to be able to effectively assess whether there is a genuine relationship, especially when we have non-related donors and recipients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the premise of wanting to legalise organ-trading is that it would eliminate the black market, but as the Iranian situation shows us, even with a legal market, under-the-table arrangements and payments cannot be eliminated.&nbsp; It still prevails.&nbsp; How confident are we, even as we consider this as part of the debate and on-going discussion, that this area will be addressed?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Sir, may I ask the Minister whether we are focusing on the right issues?&nbsp; As we know, there is a huge number of Singaporeans suffering from diabetes and hypertension which are contributing factors to renal failure.&nbsp; Instead of just focusing on organ transplants, should we not be focusing more on prevention at the primary care level to prevent people from contracting these chronic diseases?&nbsp; And if indeed they have contracted them, should we not be spending more efforts in preventing their conditions from worsening, in other words, address the pipeline issue that contributes to the growing numbers of renal failure cases?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Khaw Boon Wan</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I thank the Member for her support in advance of the proposed HOTA Amendments which I will bring&nbsp;to this House.&nbsp; I agree totally with the Member on prevention as the best approach, going forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter how hard we try on this front&nbsp;&ndash; and we will push it to the limit&nbsp;&ndash; patients will still fall sick and there will be kidney-failure patients.&nbsp; Our end-stage renal failure rate is high, as compared to other populations.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2819</p>So there is scope for us to bring it down further.&nbsp; But no matter how hard we try on this front, there will&nbsp;still be patients with kidney failure and we have to seriously think about how to manage those kidney-failure patients.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the existence of a black market in Iran, that is a model that we will study because, currently, this is the only country that legalises it.&nbsp; They themselves admit that their solution is not perfect.&nbsp; That is why this topic needs a fairly deep study.&nbsp; It is not something that I will bring to this House immediately, certainly not this year, but the more we discuss the practical difficulties of pushing this front, the more we may be able to find better solutions out of it.&nbsp; The stark reality remains that a black market exists in this part of the world and, as I have said, not only this part of the world but in Europe as well.&nbsp; I was having a conversation with a transplant surgeon from the UK who knows this business very well, so I asked, "Where do desperate British patients with kidney failure go to?"&nbsp; He said, "There are many countries in Europe where such things are happening."&nbsp; Ethical concerns, I can understand.&nbsp; To me, the biggest concern about the ethics of this activity is the exploitation that is going on.&nbsp; But if we apply our minds, if we do not shut off our minds to options like this, I hope to be able to find practical solutions that can minimise or even eliminate the exploitation.&nbsp; Is that not a better outcome than the current situation?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

(1)&nbsp; Under the current HOTA for altruistic living organ donations, is there a <p align=left>Column: 2820</p>provision for employers to provide the necessary support to the donors in terms of paid leave or even extended medical leave?&nbsp; If not, would it not be useful to mandate donor-employer support so as to minimise the sufferings and sacrifices of these living donors?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; By increasing the age limit of donor organ above the age of 60, is there any study to indicate the survivability of such organs;&nbsp;and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; What is the cost of dialysis per patient per year?&nbsp; Will&nbsp;the legalisation of a kidney white market&nbsp;result in significant cost savings and better usage of limited medical resources, in addition to the alleviation of pain and sufferings among kidney-failure patients?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Khaw Boon Wan</B>:&nbsp; Sir, the lifting of age limit is something that is common in&nbsp;many countries.&nbsp; Our&nbsp;setting this arbitrary limit of 60 is quite unique.&nbsp; I remember the history to this.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were breaking new grounds with a presumed consent legislation,&nbsp;so for conservative reasons, my predecessor decided to set this age limit of 60.&nbsp; We can certainly study the survivability or success of kidney transplants in other countries where elderly donors are involved.&nbsp; But the fact that in Norway and Spain, for example,&nbsp;many donors are above 60 and their population life expectancy is not&nbsp;worse than ours suggests that this is a very viable and practical option, going forward.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for employer support, this is not covered under HOTA.&nbsp; My understanding is that&nbsp;employers&nbsp;are generally supportive of employees who are donors, including insurers.&nbsp; I have checked on this point before, for example, whether insurance premiums of donors will be affected, and the answer is "No".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I missed&nbsp;an earlier&nbsp;question from Mdm Halimah, which was on hospital Ethics Committee, and whether <p align=left>Column: 2821</p>we should set up other ethics committees to just look at unrelated organ donors.&nbsp; Our system&nbsp;is not unique.&nbsp; We have a National Ethics Committee which provides guidance to the various hospital ethics committees, but we leave the decisions at the ground level to the hospital ethics committee.&nbsp; It is their job to assess carefully&nbsp;the donors. &nbsp;There are two things they have to look out for:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the donors well informed about the risks that they are going into;&nbsp;and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Are they being pressured by financial considerations?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the arrangement we have in Singapore, which is also the system elsewhere.&nbsp; If we bring it to the Ministry of Health to perform such a role, can we do a better job?&nbsp; I am not so sure.&nbsp; I spent many years running hospitals and I am used to listening to the&nbsp;talks in the doctors' lounge or in the corridors, and often you get better information at the hospital grounds than far away at&nbsp;the Ministry headquarters.&nbsp; So whether there are unethical practices happening on the ground, if you bring the committee to a level which is much more remote from the ground, I do not think we are improving the situation.</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:ORGAN TRANSPLANTS PERFORMED IN SINGAPORE--><!--END_COL_TITLE:ORGAN TRANSPLANTS PERFORMED IN SINGAPORE:::2823--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

For expressways, this is 45 kph, and for arterial roads, it is 20 kph.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people assume that if we do not make changes to the ERP system, our roads will continue to remain smooth flowing. This is not true. If we freeze ERP charges, the congestion does not go away but simply builds up on our roads. Nor is it true that if we freeze ERP charges, there are no costs incurred by motorists. The costs are there except that it is hidden in the form of time lost and extra fuel consumed being stuck in traffic. At a time of economic stress, it is important that we ensure that our economy remains vibrant and productive. One critical way to ensure this is to act decisively to prevent our roads from being gridlocked.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have also been concerns on the impact of the ERP changes on the cost of living. In conjunction with the changes in the ERP system, the Government has reduced road taxes by 15%. The increase in ERP revenue is estimated at $70 million against $110 million from the road tax reduction. This means that drivers as a whole are not worse off despite the higher ERP charges.&nbsp; Indeed, only 24% of drivers incur ERP charges daily, and the majority who do not pay ERP would be better off as a result of the 15% road tax reduction.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LTA will continue to monitor the road traffic conditions closely. If, as Dr Lam said, drivers choose to drive less, whether due to high fuel prices or public transport improvements and the traffic speeds improve, the Government will be happy to collect less ERP revenue.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade):</B> &nbsp; Sir, I want to thank the Minister for clarifying the role of ERP in managing traffic congestion.

If the demand for driving falls materially, because of high fuel prices or public transport improvements or both factors, then the ERP rates will either stay as they are or actually go down.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A good example of this would be the April 7th gantries. When LTA announced this in January this year, it was based on speed data in December 2007. But after the January&nbsp; announcements, there were significant changes in driving behaviour. So, if you look at the actual half-hour slots that LTA announced for April 7th, it was less than half compared to what was originally anticipated in January.&nbsp; It is a dynamic situation.&nbsp; It is a function of the demand for driving.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Lam Pin Min:</B> &nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether LTA has studied the effect of escalating fuel prices which have increased by almost 100% over the past year on the road traffic congestion problem and the mode of travel pattern of Singaporeans, especially those who own private vehicles.

The percentage of childless ever-married female residents aged 30-39 increased from 14.1% in 2000 to 19.7% in 2007. For those aged 40-49, the percentage increased from 6.4% in 2000 to 7.7% in 2007.&nbsp; The number of childless ever-married women is one of the factors behind our low total fertility rate (TFR) of 1.29 in 2007, which is among the lowest in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other causes of low TFR are that more Singaporeans are not getting married <p align=left>Column: 2827</p>or marrying later. And for those marrying later, they tend to have children later and have fewer children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proportion of single male residents aged 30-34 increased from 30.7% in 2000 to 34.7% in 2007; that of single female residents increased from 19.5% in 2000 to 22.2% in 2007. For the age group 45-49, the proportion of male singles increased from 10.5% in 2000 to 12.5% in 2007; and that of females increased from 12.5% in 2000 to 12.8% in 2007.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The median age at first marriage has also been increasing over the years. For male residents, the median age at first marriage increased from 28.6 in 2000 to 29.7 in 2007; for female residents, it increased from 26.2 in 2000 to 27.2 in 2007.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given later marriages, the median age of women at the birth of their first child increased from 28.4 in 2000 to 29.5 in 2007. On average, ever-married female residents aged 40-49 had 2.1 children in 2007, down from 2.2 in 2000 and 2.8 in 1990.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will ask the Clerk of Parliament to circulate a handout* on the statistical trends that&nbsp;I just told Members about.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, yet, based on the surveys and public consultations that the Government has conducted, most Singaporeans desire to get married and have children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government enhanced the marriage and parenthood package in August 2004. There is an improvement in the number of births&nbsp;from 35,135 in 2004 to 37,074 in 2007. We have managed to stabilise the declining total fertility rate and reversed it slightly from the historic low of 1.26 in 2004 to 1.29 in 2007. But this is still low and more efforts will have <p align=left>Column: 2828</p>to be made to increase it to a more significant level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans have given feedback that the marriage and parenthood package in 2004 has helped to address some of the concerns that they have on getting married and having children in Singapore. However, they continue to face practical constraints such as limited socialisation opportunities for the singles to find a prospective partner, work-life balance, financial concerns and childcare concerns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Government has studied various countries with high fertility, including Denmark, Sweden, Finland, France and the United Kingdom. The Nordic countries, in particular, have generous family benefits to support couples in having and raising children. They have provided some useful learning points.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides the low TFR, Singapore has a low female labour force participation rate (LFPR) for ages 15 and above at 54.3% in 2007. In Singapore, people generally want to work and have children too, but we have not been as successful in this regard compared to the other countries which have been able to achieve a high female LFPR of 65% to 75% and a high TFR of above 1.8 concurrently. While it is not possible to establish a direct causal relation between sustained female labour force participation and procreation, these countries have shown that the two can co-exist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Nordic countries, in particular, working mothers are given a lot of financial and institutional support in child-bearing and childcare from the government, their employers and the society in general. For example, parental leave of up to 64 weeks in Denmark gives working parents time to care for their children when they are very young, and highly subsidised quality childcare <p align=left>Column: 2829</p>provides ease of mind and allows them to go back to work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr>*Cols. 2945-2950.<BR></div></P></div>					<div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such social benefits come at a price.&nbsp; The Nordic countries have a high tax regime to support these benefits, eg, Denmark has a personal income tax rate of up to 63% and a high Value Added Tax (VAT) rate of 25%.&nbsp; I will ask the Clerk of Parliament to circulate a table* comparing the benefits given to and tax rates paid by the citizens of these countries. High income taxes in these countries do cause other problems. An article in the <I>International Herald Tribune</I> on 5th December 2007 discussed some of these.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In comparing with the Nordic countries, we need to be mindful of the differences in the political, economic and social environment and the tax regimes between Singapore and these countries. We have to decide what can work for us, based on what we can afford and our local context.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Government wants to promote a more pro-family environment in Singapore to create the conditions for marriage and parenthood. The Government is considering how we can further enhance our overall environment to be more pro-family. Areas under study include facilitating socialisation and interaction opportunities for singles, providing more financial support for parents, fostering a more pro-family workplace environment and providing more viable childcare options for parents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The details of the proposals are being finalised and an announcement will be made next month.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr>*Cols. 2951-2960.<BR></div></P></div>		          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">        	      		<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B></span></B></div><BR>							<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:&nbsp;</B>Sir, a follow-up question.&nbsp; Arising from Minister Mentor's recent comments on studying Sweden as a model for our marriage and procreation policies, there has been much discussion among Singaporeans on the issue. May I <p align=left>Column: 2830</p>ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether the Government is indeed considering using Sweden as a model and, if so, whether the Swedish model can indeed be transplanted and applied in Singapore?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Wong Kan Seng:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B> Sir,&nbsp;indeed,&nbsp;there has been much interest recently among Singaporeans on population issues and&nbsp;whether&nbsp;the&nbsp;Swedish model&nbsp;will work for us or not.&nbsp; Some Singaporeans are for the adoption of the Swedish model, while others cautioned against simply transplanting ideas and measures from other countries and expecting them to work in our own context.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Swedish experience does provide some useful learning points.&nbsp; But as I mentioned earlier, we must also be mindful of the differences in the context especially the overall political, social&nbsp;and economic environment between Singapore and Sweden. Sweden&nbsp;does provide&nbsp;many pro-family benefits such as highly subsidised childcare services and&nbsp;fairly generous parental leave entitlements. But childcare is not&nbsp;entirely free as some people believe. Parents still need to co-pay up to a third of the fees.&nbsp;It is only free from the fourth child onwards. Not many modern Swedish families have three or more children.&nbsp;Sweden also offers 480 days of parental leave that parents can take until the child turns eight with up to&nbsp;80% of the parents' income&nbsp;paid by the State, capped at about $5,600 a month.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, these pro-family benefits are indeed very attractive but they are not really free. They are paid for by the taxpayers. Like Denmark, Sweden has a high personal&nbsp;income tax rate&nbsp;of up to 60% and a high VAT&nbsp;rate of 25%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another significant difference between Singapore and&nbsp;the Nordic countries, such as Sweden and Denmark, is that they are operating in a largely homogeneous high cost region in Europe, characterised by high social spending <p align=left>Column: 2831</p>funded by very high taxes.&nbsp; These countries are able to adopt the same social economic structure as they are competing against one another&nbsp;on a level footing. On the other hand, Singapore is in a fast growing and competitive region where operating costs are generally much lower. If we are to offer the same generous levels of social subsidies as in the Nordic countries, we will have to raise our taxes very significantly. But to do so would also mean that we price ourselves out of the Asian market. Well-educated Singaporeans will leave and businesses will shift their operations overseas.&nbsp; We simply cannot afford to lose them. We have to decide what can work for us based on what we can afford in our local and regional context.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, instead of crafting policies and measures wholesale from other countries or cherry-picking those which seem attractive, we should examine our own strengths and weaknesses and adapt and localise these policies to meet our needs. But, ultimately, Sir, there is a limit to what the Government can do. Getting married and having children are very personal decisions. At the end of the day, society is the one to prosper, but strong emphasis on children and family life, positive peer influence,&nbsp;support from employers and friends and an overall pro-family environment are essential. This is what&nbsp;we found out in&nbsp;countries with a high&nbsp;TFR. Societies and employers that support women to balance work and family life, that provides for a more equal&nbsp;sharing of the child-raising responsibility&nbsp;between mother and father where societal norms favour family formation than to have higher TFR. This is also the case in the United Kingdom, France, Ireland and the United States.&nbsp;In the US, they manage to achieve this without a high tax subsidy regime of countries in Europe. This is because family life is&nbsp;supported and treasured by the larger community which&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2832</p>provides sufficient support for couples with children from&nbsp;employers to friends to relatives and neighbours.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, Sir, the societal belief in gender equality and balancing work and family are the key factors fostering the high fertility in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Nordic countries. <I>The New York Times</I> on 29th June 2008 carried an article entitled "<I>No Babies</I>?", that&nbsp;highlighted the differences in the societal mindset and fertility outcome between the&nbsp;Nordic countries and the southern European countries such as Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain, demonstrating the effects of these key factors. With better education and career opportunities presenting themselves to women in the past decades, women are faced with the conflict between traditional family role of a woman, mother and entering into an attractive career as an individual. The Nordic countries have quickly accepted these trends and have taken steps to accommodate&nbsp;mothers who want a career as well. Over time, society has come to accept that fathers, too, play a part, and have a very important role in&nbsp;parenthood&nbsp;in the Nordic countries. When men take a more active role in child-raising, women are also more willing to have more children and work at the same time. On the other hand, in a more patriarchal southern European countries, society attitudes continue to expect women to stay at home to raise their families when they have children. As women increasingly aspire to have a career, such social pressures have led to very low TFR of about 1.3 in the southern European countries that I mentioned.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a society, Singaporeans must want to encourage and support&nbsp;marriage&nbsp;and parenthood and to facilitate parents who want to work to continue to do so even after they have children. Such a societal mindset is necessary before any measure can take effect.&nbsp; The Government is committed to fostering a pro-family environment in Singapore. <p align=left>Column: 2833</p>However, we have to cut our clothes according to the size of the cloth&nbsp;which we have and also fashion it in a way which fits our culture.</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:CHILDCARE SUBSIDIES--><!--END_COL_TITLE:CHILDCARE SUBSIDIES:::2834--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p align=left>Column: 2833</p><B>CHILDCARE SUBSIDIES</span></B></div><BR>		<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Review--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Review)</span></B></div><BR>					<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.&nbsp; <B>Er Lee Bee Wah</B> asked the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (a) whether his Ministry will consider enhancing the current childcare subsidies to encourage housewives from lower-income families to seek employment; and (b) when were the childcare subsidies last reviewed.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):&nbsp;</B> I would like&nbsp;to assure the Member that we do encourage housewives, especially those from&nbsp;the lower- income families, to seek employment and we do help them by providing additional subsidies for their children&nbsp;to attend childcare. The Centre-based Financial Assistance Scheme for Childcare (CFAC) helps low-income families to send their children to childcare centres.&nbsp; This scheme provides monthly subsidies&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;a one-off start-up grant to eligible families.&nbsp;This enables and encourages their mothers to find employment&nbsp;and to&nbsp;remain in employment.&nbsp; The CFAC subsidy is over and above the $150 subsidy which the&nbsp;Government provides to children of working mothers.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CFAC subsidies are reviewed regularly and, in fact, the last review occurred in February this year and on&nbsp;lst July, which is this month, we&nbsp;increased the CFAC subsidies. Eligible families&nbsp;will receive a start-up grant of $1,000&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;an additional recurrent monthly subsidy of up to $340 a month. So, it is $340 plus $150.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, with effect from this month, we have also&nbsp;extended the CFAC <p align=left>Column: 2834</p>to more households.&nbsp; The scheme was extended beyond the previous&nbsp;cut-off point of&nbsp;$1,500 household income to now include families who&nbsp;lie&nbsp;in the range of between&nbsp;$1,501 and&nbsp;$1,800.&nbsp; These families are eligible for a $1,000 start-up grant and a CFAC subsidy of up to $200.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It allows me to assure Members of this House that money is not the limiting factor as far as low-income families&nbsp;sending their children to childcare centres is concerned.</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:INFANT CARE CENTRES--><!--END_COL_TITLE:INFANT CARE CENTRES:::2836--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p align=left>Column: 2834</p><B>INFANT CARE CENTRES</span></B></div><BR>		<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Qualifying professional criteria for operators and staff--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Qualifying professional criteria for operators and staff)</span></B></div><BR>					<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

The Indonesian authorities' recent arrest of a group of terrorists, including a Singaporean, in Palembang demonstrates the usefulness of cooperation with foreign security counterparts.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up till now, our security agencies have not received any information from their Indonesian counterparts to confirm that Mas Selamat is presently hiding in Indonesia.&nbsp; Neither do we have domestic intelligence that shows that he has left the country.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we obviously cannot dismiss the possibility that Mas Selamat could have managed to escape Singapore for another country.&nbsp; Singapore is not a fortress.&nbsp; As an island, our borders are porous. There can be no 100% control over all illegal exit and entry even if our enhanced security operations have kept this to a minimum.&nbsp; I am not aware of any country that can prevent with absolute certainty illegal entry or exit across the length of its borders over time.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will do our utmost to find Mas Selamat whatever it takes.&nbsp; If Mas Selamat has escaped abroad, we will work with the relevant foreign counterparts to track him down and bring him back into custody in Singapore.&nbsp; We have done it before; we will do it again.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also continue to work on all possible scenarios.&nbsp; In this regard, although there is no intelligence at present <p align=left>Column: 2839</p>to substantiate it, as more time passes, this scenario of Mas Selamat being harboured by sympathisers inside or outside Singapore must logically be treated as increasingly plausible.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, two private individuals have approached the Ministry of Home Affairs&nbsp;(MHA) and offered to put up a cash reward of $1 million for information leading to the apprehension of Mas Selamat inside or outside Singapore.&nbsp; They have asked MHA to operationalise their proposal because they wish to remain anonymous as they are concerned over the prospect of themselves, their families or business interests in the region becoming a target for retaliation.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not the first time a bounty has been offered for information on Mas Selamat.&nbsp; In March, a labour-supply company and a non-government organisation offered $50,000 and $5,000 respectively for information on Mas Selamat.&nbsp; A security firm offered $1,000 to its&nbsp;staff to help track him down.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a policy, the Singapore Police Force does not offer cash reward for information on fugitives and unsolved crimes, or for assistance from the public.&nbsp; However, we do not object if private corporations and individuals wish to offer cash reward for information on the whereabouts of Mas Selamat.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are encouraged by such continued public support.&nbsp; We remain committed to finding and capturing Mas Selamat no matter how long it takes.&nbsp; We have done it before and&nbsp;we will do it again.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member):</B>&nbsp; Sir, four supplementary questions for the Deputy Prime Minister (DPM).&nbsp; First question is, whether there is any fresh intelligence that the Government has obtained that Mas <p align=left>Column: 2840</p>Selamat is still in Singapore.&nbsp; Second question is, security analysts have observed that Indonesia is a logical place for Mas Selamat to escape to.&nbsp; In fact, as early as 1st March 2008, which is a few days after the escape, there were some analysts predicting that he already fled to Indonesia via a speedboat to Bintan.&nbsp; I would like the DPM's assessment on whether this is a likely scenario.&nbsp; Third question, about one month after the escape, the DPM had said that his Ministry would examine if there are sufficient legal powers within Singapore territorial waters to do effective searches or whether the law will need to be amended.&nbsp; I would like the&nbsp;DPM to update us on this.&nbsp;And last of all, Sir, the Interpol Chief had commented in the aftermath of this case that when it comes to such escapes, the first hours&nbsp;are crucial and it has now been five months since the escape.&nbsp; I would like the Minister to tell the House whether he has changed his assessment of the likelihood of recapturing Mas Selamat in Singapore.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

As regards the security analyst's assessment, that is his assessment and we do not have intelligence to confirm it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the legal powers of searches, I think Ms Lim might have read about what I said some time ago regarding the legal powers of searches for vessels at sea.&nbsp; Right now, the Police have powers to search whenever they need to, and we do not think we need more powers in this regard.&nbsp; On what the Interpol Chief had said that the first hour is crucial, that is also his opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure he is&nbsp;a professional and I believe that he has his own basis to make this comment.&nbsp; As far <p align=left>Column: 2841</p>as we are concerned, we have done what we could during the first hour and we could not find him.</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:RECENT SECURITY LAPSES--><!--END_COL_TITLE:RECENT SECURITY LAPSES:::2841--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

<B>Mr Speaker:</B>&nbsp; Yes.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Iswaran:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo has asked about stagflation and whether it has set into Singapore.&nbsp; Stagflation&nbsp;refers to a prolonged situation of stagnant economic activity coupled with high inflation. This happened in the mid-1970s when many of the OECD countries (notably the US and UK) experienced high inflation, sluggish economic growth, and rising unemployment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;Singapore is not facing stagflation.&nbsp; Singapore's economy grew by 4.3% in the first half of this year, based on the latest GDP advance estimates, that is the number it&nbsp;stands.&nbsp; This is within our medium-term potential rate of growth of 4%-6%.&nbsp; Our job market remains healthy.&nbsp; In the first quarter of the year, more than 73,000 jobs were created, and unemployment remains low.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The momentum of economic growth has recently slowed, and the global economy is expected to remain soft in the second half of 2008.&nbsp; In the US, there are significant vulnerabilities in the financial sector.&nbsp; And in the other major developed economies like Japan and Germany, they&nbsp;also expect to see further softening, as they are confronted with the challenges of high oil prices and weak consumer confidence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Asia, on the other hand, economic growth has been fairly robust.&nbsp; China's GDP grew by 10.6% in the first quarter of this year, while India's GDP grew by 8.8%.&nbsp; But both China and India are facing high inflation and have started to take steps to contain inflationary pressures.&nbsp; These in turn could dampen growth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2843</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the strong pipeline of foreign investments and tourism projects that we have secured will also provide a certain level of support to the economy for the rest of this year and beyond.&nbsp; These new projects will give rise to new activity and help to create new jobs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier in May, the Ministry of Trade and Industry estimated Singapore's GDP growth for this year at 4% to 6%.&nbsp; We will review this forecast in August, after we have compiled all relevant data for the first half of 2008.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to inflation, the other aspect of stagflation, since mid-2007, CPI inflation in Singapore has risen to 7.5% in May 2008.&nbsp; This is due largely to the sharp increases in global prices for food and fuel, which have also affected other countries.&nbsp; We expect some moderation in inflation in the second half of 2008, as the effects of the GST increase wash out and food prices peak.&nbsp; But inflation is not likely to return to previous levels any time soon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has put in place several measures to dampen inflation and&nbsp;help Singaporeans cope with the higher costs of living.&nbsp; The stronger Singapore dollar has helped to reduce imported inflationary pressures arising from the higher prices of food and oil.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we must take care that wage growth does not exceed growth in productivity, so as not to set off a domestic wage-price inflationary spiral.&nbsp; The National Wages Council has recommended that companies grant sustainable wage increases that are commensurate with performance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a price taker, Singapore cannot avoid the effects of global inflation.&nbsp; But we can aim to reduce the impact of higher inflation on Singaporeans, by using our <p align=left>Column: 2844</p>limited resources, in a targeted way, to help those most affected by higher prices.&nbsp; The GST Offset Package and rebates on utilities and conservancy charges, will help to ease the impact of higher prices faced by Singaporeans.&nbsp; The Growth Dividends, with more going to the elderly and the needy, will also provide some relief.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Penny Low has asked for advice on employers and employees in this environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;During this period of economic volatility, it is important that our companies continue to upgrade their business capabilities and enhance their competitive edge.&nbsp; This will give our companies the requisite capacity to withstand the challenges of slower growth, as well as to capitalise on market opportunities, especially when growth recovers.&nbsp; We are committed to building the capacity of our companies.&nbsp; For example, SPRING's various programmes support the development of enterprise capabilities in the areas of automation, technology innovation, IT adoption and management development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important for employees to proactively upgrade their skills, so as to ensure that they remain productive and relevant in a changing economy.&nbsp; Working with the Ministry of Manpower and the Workforce Development Agency, we will ensure that there are appropriate continuing education and training (CET) programmes for all our workers&nbsp;from the rank and file to professionals and managers&nbsp;to help them weather uncertainties in the economic environment.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Iswaran:</B> &nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the overall data on retail sector in the first half remains positive.&nbsp; So their overall performance of the sector is not a cause for alarm.&nbsp; But there are some components which may have some indifferent results maybe in the later part of the first half, for example, in the automotive sector and also, I think, in the watch and&nbsp;jewellery sector which are high-end, and you can expect some adjustment in spending efforts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, we have a slew of measures in place, in terms of what SPRING is able to do, and&nbsp; the Member would be very familiar with them, such as the Local Enterprise and Association Development (LEAD) Programme and also the Capability Development Programme as well as other more targeted efforts.&nbsp; And SPRING is involved in an effort where the discussion is ongoing with the retail sector as to how we can further enhance their competitiveness, not just during a more challenging time but in the long run to position Singapore as continuing to be an attractive place for shopping for Singaporeans and international tourists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I would say that, in general, we have a fairly good dialogue with the retail sector and our agencies are working with them on an ongoing basis.&nbsp; As for risks when you go overseas, I think this is part of normal business risks which companies should rightly take and you ride the ups and downs as part of the business cycle.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The bottomline is whether inflation in the global environment will affect Singapore, and the answer must be yes.&nbsp; Although the Singapore dollar has appreciated&nbsp;in the last two years or so&nbsp;by maybe about 23% against the US dollar, the fact remains that we cannot be fully insulated from global price trends for precisely the reason that the Member has mentioned.&nbsp; What we need to do, therefore, is to make sure that our businesses are competitive.&nbsp; The key element is productivity and we must sure that our businesses are supported in that effort to enhance productivity.&nbsp; The other element&nbsp;is to ensure that the more vulnerable segments of our population, such as our lowest 20th percentile which spends about a third of their income on food, have the assistance against any inflationary pressure.&nbsp; So, giving them targeted assistance makes a lot of sense, especially in an environment where food price inflation is quite substantial.</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:DECISION OF INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE ON PEDRA BRANCA'S CASE--><!--END_COL_TITLE:DECISION OF INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE ON PEDRA BRANCA'S CASE:::2849--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Dr Balaji Sadasivan</B>:&nbsp; Sir, to answer Mr Michael Palmer, the ICJ, on 23rd May 2008, awarded Pedra Branca to Singapore, while Middle Rocks was awarded to Malaysia.&nbsp; The ICJ stated that South Ledge belonged to the State in the territorial waters of which it is located.&nbsp; The status of South Ledge, therefore, depends upon whether it falls on Singapore's or Malaysia's side of the territorial waters boundary in that area.&nbsp; The process which will eventually lead to discussions on the territorial waters boundary has already started.&nbsp; Since the judgment of the ICJ, the Joint Committee led by Wisma Putra Secretary-General Rastam Mohd Isa and MFA Permanent Secretary Peter Ho met on 3rd June 2008 to discuss the implementation of the judgment.&nbsp; At the meeting, both sides reiterated their commitment to honour and <p align=left>Column: 2848</p>abide by the ICJ's judgment and fully implement its decision.&nbsp; Both parties also agreed that a technical sub-committee would be set up to oversee the conduct of Joint Survey Works to prepare for eventual talks on maritime issues in and around Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge.&nbsp; Officials on both sides are currently working towards carrying out the Joint Survey Works which are expected to start later this year.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second part of Mr Michael Palmer's question, yes, Singapore is claiming a territorial sea and an Exclusive Economic Zone around Pedra Branca.&nbsp; As we had indicated in the Press Statements of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs dated 15th September 1980 and 23rd May 2008, Singapore has a territorial sea limit that extends up to a maximum of 12 nautical miles and an Exclusive Economic Zone.&nbsp; This is consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) of 10th December 1982, to which Singapore is a party.&nbsp; The precise coordinates of Singapore's territorial sea and Exclusive Economic Zone will be announced at an appropriate time.&nbsp; Should the limits of our territorial sea or Exclusive Economic Zone overlap with the claims of neighbouring countries, Singapore will negotiate with these countries with a view to arriving at agreed delimitations in accordance with international law.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer Ms Indranee Rajah, according to Article 61 of the Statute of the ICJ, a party is able to apply for a review of an ICJ judgment if "it is based upon the discovery of some fact of such a nature as to be a decisive factor, which fact was, when the judgment was given, unknown to the Court and also to the party claiming revision, always provided that such ignorance was not due to negligence".&nbsp; I would like to highlight that the ICJ, in its 23rd May 2008 judgment, ruled that Johor had original title over Pedra Branca before the lighthouse was <p align=left>Column: 2849</p>built but added that "what is decisive for the Court is the conduct of the authorities in Singapore (and India) and in Johor following the 1844 exchanges of correspondences".&nbsp; So even if this 1844 letter was discovered, and even if its contents demonstrated that Johor had title over Pedra Branca in 1844, in our view, it is unlikely to make a difference to the court's judgment because the Court had already ruled that Johor had original title over Pedra Branca.&nbsp; In fact, Singapore had searched for the 1844 letter over many years at various archives but to no avail.&nbsp; We had also stated both in our written pleadings and during the public hearing by DPM Prof. S Jayakumar at the ICJ in November 2007 that Singapore does not have a copy of Butterworth's 1844 letter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to conclude by noting that by resolving this dispute through third party adjudication, both countries have demonstrated our respect for international law and our commitment to settle disputes in an amicable manner.&nbsp; This case exemplifies the usefulness of a third party dispute settlement mechanism and can be a model for resolving other bilateral disputes.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Mr Teo Chee Hean</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to express my heartfelt condolences to the families of the late 2LT Clifton Lam Jia Hao and the late REC Andrew Cheah Wei Siong.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF treats every death of a serviceman with utmost seriousness.&nbsp; For each case, we conduct a thorough investigation to determine the cause and also to enable us to take all necessary preventive measures in the future.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2851</p>MINDEF has convened two separate inquiries to investigate the deaths of the two servicemen.&nbsp; As the investigation process has yet to be completed, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on their outcomes at this point in time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Indranee Rajah asked about the need for any consequential actions to be adopted by the SAF.&nbsp; Sir, the SAF did not wait for the outcome of the investigations but, in fact,&nbsp;took immediate action by imposing a three-day time-out for all physical and endurance training to review their systems, processes and procedures.&nbsp; The review provided an opportunity for units to confirm that the systems are good and sound, and that proper processes and procedures are in place and are being followed.&nbsp; The time-out allowed both commanders and soldiers themselves to refocus on safety.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Indranee Rajah and Mr Siew Kum Hong&nbsp;asked about medical screening in the SAF.&nbsp; I should first say that it would be premature to draw conclusions about whether medical conditions that might have been detected in pre-enlistment medical screening were factors in the incidents, as the investigation process has not yet been concluded.&nbsp; Nevertheless, since there has been quite a lot of interest in the medical screening processes of the SAF, let me take the opportunity to describe these&nbsp;processes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF carries out medical screening of our servicemen carefully.&nbsp; Medical screening takes place at several key junctures:&nbsp; before enlistment, before attending specialised courses, before strenuous training or deployment and, periodically, after the age of 25.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screening is comprehensive.&nbsp; There are 14 medical speciality areas, including eyesight, hearing, cardiovascular, muscular-skeletal&nbsp;conditions.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2852</p>Let me take the screening for cardiac conditions as an example.&nbsp; A 12-lead resting electrocardiogram (ECG) screening is conducted for all pre-enlistees, and the SAF has 28 different protocols to address the different cardiac conditions based on these ECG findings.&nbsp; If abnormalities are found, the pre-enlistees will be sent for additional testing, which may include the stress ECG test or the 2D echocardiogram and referral to a cardiologist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 12-lead resting ECG screening was introduced in November 2000 on the recommendation by the SAF's panel&nbsp;of medical experts.&nbsp; The panel of medical experts concluded that the findings of a study published in 1998 on the screening of competitive athletes in Italy&nbsp;were appropriate for the SAF and ought to be adopted by the SAF.&nbsp; The comprehensive study&nbsp;showed that resting ECG was a reliable tool for screening for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM), which is one of the more common causes of sudden cardiac death among young adults.&nbsp; HCM is a disease of the heart muscle in which a portion of the muscle is thickened.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the introduction of this 12-lead resting ECG screening is an example of how the SAF keeps up with the best and most appropriate screening practices.&nbsp; The SAF&nbsp;is guided by an independent panel consisting of top medical consultants and specialists in Singapore that sits regularly to review the entire&nbsp;medical screening regime.&nbsp; In a recent review concluded last September, the SAF medical screening protocols were found to be comprehensive, robust and in line with good clinical practice.&nbsp; In fact, the SAF's routine screening for heart disease in pre-enlistees is equivalent to the standards recommended by the European Society of Cardiology and International Olympic Committee, and higher than the standards recommended by the American Heart Association.&nbsp; The SAF's screening protocols are also more <p align=left>Column: 2853</p>comprehensive than those used by many other established armed forces.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Siew Kum Hong asked for figures on sudden cardiac deaths (SCD) in the SAF since 1965, and how many of these were Full-time National Servicemen (NSFs).&nbsp; Sir, I am unable to give&nbsp;the figures since&nbsp;1965, but I am able to provide the figures from 1995.&nbsp; Specific data on SCD for the years before 1995 was not systematically collected, as SCD itself, in young adults then, was not a well understood phenomenon in the medical community.&nbsp; The figures for 1995 to 2008 showed that there were a total of 23 SCD cases in the SAF.&nbsp; Seven of them were of Full-time National Servicemen (NSFs), three of which occurred during training.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Siew also asked whether any of these could have been detected by exercise ECGs or echocardiograms, and whether the SAF was going to introduce additional screening such as these.&nbsp; Of the seven NSFs who died from SCD both during training and not during training, six were due to conditions that were most unlikely to be picked up by exercise ECGs or echocardiograms.&nbsp; This is what the doctors have told me.&nbsp; The remaining one had a condition that could have been detected by exercise ECGs or echocardiograms.&nbsp; This death&nbsp;occurred in 1999, a year before the SAF began conducting ECG screening for pre-enlistees.&nbsp; His condition could have been picked up by the 12-lead resting ECG that was introduced in 2000, and this pick-up would have led to him being referred to a cardiologist and subjected to an exercise ECG or echocardiogram.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MINDEF will continue to review our medical screening procedures and amend the protocols or adopt new procedures should the SAF's panel of medical experts advise that it is appropriate to do so.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B></span></B></div><BR>							<div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>of the exercise ECGs or echocardiograms is "helpful". If that is the case, then why is this "helpful" screening not made available to NSFs who serve the nation by performing National Service and so the nation should serve them by taking all the measures that are helpful, instead of leaving it only for those who can afford to pay for these additional testing.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second question, Sir, is that the Minister has said that MINDEF has a panel of leading doctors who say that the existing tests are sufficient but&nbsp;a cardiologist in private practice has publicly stated that many of his colleagues who agree with this publicly, nevertheless, send their own children for additional screening. Can the Minister then confirm whether this panel of leading doctors send their own children who are required to serve NS for additional tests?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My third question, Sir, is that a recently published study by the Institute of Sports Medicine in Florence, Italy, tested over 30,000 people, including 23,500 men, using both resting ECG and exercise ECG. The resting ECG test found a previously undetected heart&nbsp;anomaly in 1.2% of those screened. This rose to 4.9% for the exercise ECG. In light of this study, does the Ministry still stand by its decision not to introduce additional screening for NSFs?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Teo Chee Hean:</B>&nbsp; Sir, I think that if the individuals or parents want to go for additional medical screening and tests, that is entirely their right to do so and they may do so if they wish to. But whether they do so or not, I think that they and their parents should be assured <p align=left>Column: 2855</p>that when they come for National Service at the pre-enlistment stage, the SAF will give them a comprehensive medical screening whether they have gone for one themselves or not. So that is our commitment, and that is important. The medical screening protocols are audited and recommended by the SAF medical panel of specialists. There are about 50 of them covering 14 medical specialities and areas. I can only go by what they recommend to us and if there are doctors, individuals who feel that there are practices supported by good evidence and research which will be helpful for SAF servicemen, we will be happy to receive such research reports and reviews supported by good evidence.&nbsp;The medical panel will be happy to consider them and if they are appropriate for application in the SAF, we will be happy to do so.&nbsp;I would invite Mr Siew or doctors in public or private practice or individuals who have such information, who feel that it is relevant to us, to please do so and send it to us. But&nbsp;I do assure the public and parents that the SAF medical panel itself does comprehensive literature searches, they are experts in their field, and they do look out for the best practices available. The example I gave was that of a study that was concluded in 1998. The panel looked at it very quickly after the study was completed, found that it was a study which was useful&nbsp;and valid&nbsp;to us, and we brought it into effect by the year 2000. And we will be happy to receive any other studies or information which the panel may, by some chance, have missed.</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATHS OF SINGAPOREANS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATHS OF SINGAPOREANS:::2858--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p align=left>Column: 2855</p><B>SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATHS OF SINGAPOREANS</span></B></div><BR>							<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18.&nbsp; <B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</B> asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there has been any pattern of sudden cardiac deaths afflicting Singaporeans over the last 10 years; (b) what can be done to <p align=left>Column: 2856</p>reduce the incidence occurring in the general public; and (c) how does the percentage and rate of sudden cardiac deaths in Singapore compare to that of other countries.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> &nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as explained by the Minister for Defence just a while ago, SCD is a sudden and unexpected death due to cardiac causes.&nbsp;&nbsp;A common cause of SCD is abnormal heart rhythm,&nbsp;resulting in the heart stop pumping.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, about 16,000 deaths occur every year, of which 23% are from cardiac causes,&nbsp;almost one in four.&nbsp; SCD is a subset of cardiac deaths and in Singapore accounts for about a third of deaths due to cardiac causes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past 10 years, our incidence of SCD has increased steadily from 26 per 100,000 population in 1998, 10 years&nbsp;ago,&nbsp;to 34 in 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is largely due to the steady increase in the proportion of the elderly in our population as the incidence of SCD is highest among the elderly, eg, last year, the incidence of SCD ranged from 2 per 100,000 for those below 35 years old to 211, 100 times more, for those above 60.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the 1,538 cases of&nbsp;SCD&nbsp;last year, 67%&nbsp;were above 60 years of age. Less than 3% were below 35.&nbsp; In fact, the incidence in younger persons under 35 has declined from 4 per 100,000 in 1998 to 2&nbsp;last year.&nbsp; There is a gender difference in the SCD incidence, with men having more than double the risk as compared to women.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, our SCD incidence of about 1 in 3,000 is low as compared to other developed countries. Studies from the US and Europe have reported higher rates, of 1 in 600 and 1 in 1,250 respectively, although there are some variations in defining SCD in these studies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2857</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to reduce SCD incidence?&nbsp; More than 80% of SCD is due to blockage in the coronary arteries. So the key to prevention&nbsp;lies in adoption of a healthy lifestyle: eating wisely, not smoking, staying active and maintaining healthy weight. Early detection and good management of chronic diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol also reduce the risk of developing coronary heart disease.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the younger age group, diseases of the heart muscles, although uncommon, may play a role in some cases of&nbsp;SCD. Some examples are enlargement of heart muscles and viral infection of the heart.&nbsp; Screening may be useful to detect some of these conditions so that precautionary measures can be instituted to prevent exercise-related deaths, but no test can identify all individuals at risk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite our best efforts at prevention,&nbsp;SCD will still occur. In such cases, survival can be improved if the patient is treated as soon as possible with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation.&nbsp; There are programmes in place to teach and encourage CPR and use of defibrillators for the public and appropriate personnel such as policemen, and staff at sports facilities and airports. All our SCDF ambulances are equipped with defibrillators. We also support efforts to improve access to defibrillators at public locations with high human traffic and at mass participation high intensity sports events.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>3.10pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker:</B>&nbsp; Order.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order for Second Reading read.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, all forms of gambling in Singapore are prohibited except for selected products offered by the Singapore Totalisator Board and its two agents, Singapore Turf Club and Singapore Pools.&nbsp; While gambling is not an activity that we want to encourage, it <p align=left>Column: 2861</p>is also not something that we can wish away. Imposing a complete ban on gambling will&nbsp;only drive the industry underground and profit the illegal operators.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach has therefore been to allow a limited range of gambling products in a controlled environment, with appropriate safeguards for the vulnerable groups. Together with sustained enforcement action against illegal operators and continuing efforts to raise public awareness of the ills of gambling, we can minimise social concerns. The Singapore Totalisator Board has been using and will continue to use the gambling proceeds to fund programmes and projects for the social good.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to the Singapore Totalisator Board Act seek to achieve three objectives. First, to allow the Singapore Turf Club more operational flexibility so as to combat illegal horse betting. Second, to provide the Ministry greater flexibility to update the gambling advertising regulations. And, third, to strengthen governance at the Singapore Totalisator Board.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now highlight the key changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;Moving the Singapore Totalisator Scheme out of the Subsidiary Legislation</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first change relates to the removal of the Singapore Totalisator Scheme from the subsidiary legislation under the Act. The Scheme governs the administrative and operational aspects of horse racing and betting, such as race fixtures, admissions to the racecourse, and bet types.&nbsp; Currently, any variation to the Scheme must be approved by the Minister and published in the <I>Gazette</I>.&nbsp; By removing the Scheme from the subsidiary legislation, and having it administered by the Turf Club under a private contractual arrangement with the Totalisator Board, <p align=left>Column: 2862</p>the Turf Club will be able to respond better to challenges posed by the illegal operators by changing their betting rules and bet types. The Turf Club will still need to seek regulatory approval for the introduction of new gambling products or changes to regulatory conditions such as age limit.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach is consistent with practices in other jurisdictions such as Hong Kong, the United Kingdom and Western Australia. It is also consistent with the treatment of operational rules governing lottery games and football betting run by Singapore Pools. Clauses 2(b) to 8, 10 and 12 of the Bill provide for this change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Transferring advertising regulations from main Act to subsidiary legislation</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second change relates to the transfer of advertising regulations from the main Act to the subsidiary legislation. The Act currently&nbsp;allows the Turf Club to publish certain information in the newspapers.&nbsp; This includes the hours of business, address and telephone number of Turf Club's betting outlets, and the names of the race meetings. The Act does not cover advertising by Singapore Pools and the Totalisator Board.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By removing the advertising regulations from the main Act, and empowering the Minister to make subsidiary legislation on advertising, the regulations can be updated more expeditiously, in response to changes in the operating and social environment. We will adopt a balanced approach, allowing the Turf Club some room to enhance awareness of their products and channels so as to divert demand away from the illegal operators, while ensuring sufficient safeguards to protect the youth and other vulnerable groups. We will also extend the regulations to Singapore Pools and the Totalisator Board.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2863</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is similar to the approach taken for the Casino Control Act. Clauses 2(a), 11, 13 and 15 of the Bill provide for this change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Increasing the quorum at Board meetings</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Bill increases the quorum at Board meetings from three members to a majority of the members to ensure majority representation and sound governance at the Totalisator Board. Clause 16 of the Bill provides for this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Other changes</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other changes include removing the need for the Turf Club to seek Minister's approval for by-laws controlling admission to the Turf Club, which are operational in nature; allowing any public officer authorised by the Minister to compound prescribed offences; and consequential amendments to the Betting Act and Common Gaming Houses Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim:</B> Sir, under the existing Act, the Minister's approval is required before the Board can conduct gaming activities and the Minister approves schemes and may impose conditions on any gaming activity.&nbsp; Clauses 4 and 6 of the Bill collectively remove the need for Ministerial approval.&nbsp; It seems that the Board is now given a freer hand to decide what kind of gaming activities are carried out and under what conditions.&nbsp; For instance, it appears that it can decide the rules of the game, how to calculate dividends and what kind of credit facilities will be available.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask for clarification on the following:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2864</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; What was the original rationale for requiring Ministerial approval in the first place?&nbsp; Was it due to a need to supervise the gaming industry to safeguard the public interest?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; By removing the need for Ministerial approval, is the Government giving the Board more liberty to promote gaming as it sees fit?&nbsp; Is it&nbsp;foreseeable that gaming would proliferate society further, more addictive forms of gaming may arise and credit will be made more easily available?&nbsp; Are we putting society at greater risk with this approach?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Siew Kum Hong:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to participate in this debate.&nbsp; I rise in support of the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this Bill is intended to rationalise the workings of the Tote Board, which is now responsible for regulating gaming and betting in Singapore and to address certain gaps in the law that currently exist. As such, I only have two points to make.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, clause 10 of the Bill repeals the existing section 15 of the Act and introduces a new section 15, which essentially provides that it is lawful for any person of or above the age of 18 years to participate in licensed gaming or betting.&nbsp; This is a relatively lower age and is of some concern, given the trend of Singaporeans starting to gamble at a young age.&nbsp; A survey released by the Government in May this year found that a quarter of respondents started gambling when they were less than 18 years old, up 10% from 2005.&nbsp; Setting the legal age for gambling at 18 years risks exacerbating this problem.&nbsp; I would therefore like to ask the Minister to clarify and explain why and how this age of 18 years old was decided upon, especially when this is lower than the age of 21 years which is required for entry into the upcoming casinos under the Casino Control Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2865</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a related note, this new section 15 now makes it explicitly clear that those who are 18 years and above may lawfully gamble with licensed operators, which is something that was previously not so clear.&nbsp; So, this is positive.&nbsp; This also means that, by implication, those who are below 18, who somehow manage to gamble with licensed operators are committing an offence under the Betting Act or the Common Gaming Houses Act.&nbsp; But neither of this Act nor the Betting Act, nor the Gaming Houses Act, imposes any liability on licensed operators if they allow those who are below 18 to gamble.&nbsp; That seems to be a lacuna in the law which should be plugged, so as to drive home to licensed operators the seriousness of their responsibility not to allow young persons under the age of 18 to gamble.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, Sir, clause 14 of the Bill introduces a new section 20B that empowers the Minister to exempt any person or class of persons from any or all provisions of the Act through <I>Gazette</I> notifications.&nbsp; There is no statement as to the purposes for which such exemptions may be granted.&nbsp; Sir, the debate on&nbsp;casinos shows that gambling remains a sensitive issue in Singapore, which many Singaporeans are greatly concerned about.&nbsp; This broad power to the Minister to grant exemptions is worrying because it potentially deprives Parliament of the opportunity to review and debate proposed exemptions.&nbsp; If the Minister is of the view that this power to grant exemptions is administratively and operationally desirable and necessary, then I would suggest that, at the minimum, the new section 20B should be amended to explicitly state the purposes for which exemptions may be granted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with that, I support the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Lim Hwee Hua--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the Members for their comments and support of the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2866</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards Ms Sylvia Lim's point about the liberty that is seemingly given to the Minister in varying the Scheme, let me assure her that this is actually a balance between trying to enable the Turf Club to exercise flexibility and to respond better to challenges.&nbsp; But the Club would still need regulatory approval for the introduction of new gambling products or, for that matter, changes to regulatory conditions.&nbsp; So, there would be no concern over the proliferation of newer products.&nbsp; This will just be simply variations of the existing rules that are allowed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Mr Siew Kum Hong's point about the age limit, let me just clarify that&nbsp;currently the&nbsp;Tote Board Act actually already stipulates the age limit for gambling as 18 years.&nbsp; The objective of clause 10 is really not to set the age limit but to make a consequential amendment because of the removal of the Scheme from the subsidiary legislation.&nbsp; And as he has noted, the age limit applies to all gambling activities, except casinos which have a higher limit of 21 years.&nbsp; Eighteen years, if I may add, has been adopted as the age limit for gambling in many other jurisdictions, including Hong Kong, United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.&nbsp; It is also incidentally the same age limit set for the consumption of alcohol and tobacco in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards the operators' responsibility towards the age limit, Singapore Pools and Turf Club have actually taken very concrete steps to ensure that the products are not offered to the underaged.&nbsp; This is part of their commitment towards responsible gambling.&nbsp; In fact, all the frontline staff and employees are required to undergo training in terms of executing these gambling measures.&nbsp; So, they will do physical control checks and checks of IDs as well.&nbsp; But I take his point that while this has worked well thus far, there may be a case to consider <p align=left>Column: 2867</p>making these responsibilities explicit in the legislation.&nbsp; So, we will study this further.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for his point about clause 14&nbsp;giving the Minister the power to exempt any person or class of persons from all the provisions, let me assure the House that the Ministry does not intend to abuse the authority provided for by this new section.&nbsp; As I have commented earlier on, any decision taken is really a balance of all the different points.&nbsp; We should note that the gambling industry is a fast-changing one.&nbsp; The illegal gambling operators continue to pose a major challenge today and, therefore, this new provision will enable the Turf Club to be able to respond quickly with once-off exceptional exemptions to be made by the Minister in a timely manner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Being one of the cities with the lowest crime rate in the world, Singaporeans and visitors alike feel safe and secure walking around our city at any time of the day.&nbsp; All these do not come about by chance.&nbsp; It is due to the continuing commitment and dedication of the Home Affairs Ministry, its Home Team and their community partners in planning our security system and conducting strict enforcement to make Singapore a safe haven for all.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the safe and secure environment in Singapore has also created a false sense of security among Singaporeans; and thus resulted in a certain level of complacency among our staff and officers in the Home Team.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the recent security lapses, namely, Mas Selamat Kastari's escape; the attempted escape of two detainees from the lock-up facility of the Subordinate Courts; and the passport mix-up incident at Changi Airport, have revealed certain weaknesses in our security system.&nbsp; The lapses have also affected public confidence in our security system; dampened the morale of our Home Team; and dented Singapore's reputation.&nbsp; Although the findings from these security lapses have identified a confluence of factors and human errors as contributing causes, we should not take comfort that our security system is sound.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, security lapses are security lapses.&nbsp; Whether it is due to systemic faults or human errors, the outcomes are the same <p align=left>Column: 2869</p>and could have serious consequences.&nbsp; In Mas Selamat's case, we now have one terrorist leader at large, which might pose serious security threats to our country.&nbsp; I am indeed very concerned that the recent security lapses are attributed mainly to human errors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, very often, systemic failures could be addressed once and for all.&nbsp; But human errors are more challenging to avoid or prevent as it would involve recruiting good people, providing quality training and changing the mindsets of existing staff.&nbsp; The Ministry must seriously look into these aspects to further strengthen and instil greater discipline in our security force.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a more disturbing phenomenon is the confluence of factors leading to the security lapses.&nbsp; It shows that our lines of defence are not robust and independent.&nbsp; Every security officer at each line of defence thinks that somebody is doing his or her job in the other lines of defence, and thus slips into complacency. This situation is unhealthy and requires urgent attention.&nbsp; We must ensure that all officers at all lines of defence take responsibility and exercise due diligence to carry out their duties professionally.&nbsp; These lines of defence must be regularly "stress tested" to reduce possible breaches.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to highlight the lessons which we could learn from these security lapses, and urge the Ministry to update the House on the follow-up measures taken after these lapses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are useless if they are not properly carried out by the respective officers at various security positions.&nbsp; First, the officers must understand the rationale behind these SOPs and adhere strictly to the procedures.&nbsp; Second, they must use their common sense and exercise more caution when faced with unusual or <p align=left>Column: 2870</p>deviant situations.&nbsp; For example, the detection of a mismatch of fingerprints at the immigration counter should have prompted the immigration officer to conduct a more thorough check of the passenger.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the guard who accompanied Mas Selamat to the toilet should have detected that he was taking too long at the urinal and checked on him immediately.&nbsp; Our officers must be trained to stay alert at all times and follow SOPs to avoid security lapses.&nbsp; To stay vigilant at all times requires discipline.&nbsp; I would urge the Ministry to take concrete measures to instil discipline in our Home Team.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the toilet at the Whitley Road Detention Centre's visitation block is poorly designed.&nbsp; The folding door for the urinal, window without security grilles, failure of CCTV system, and covered linkway linking to the perimeter fence reflected the lack of security design in our facility.&nbsp; Similarly, the design and layout of the Subordinate Courts' lock-up facility allows easy escape from detention.&nbsp; Sir, in view of new and emerging security threats, we should consider setting up a Security Design Audit Team in the Ministry to provide independent checks and balances on the design of both new and existing security facilities. Good design plays a significant role in enhancing our security system and facilities.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our security system can only be sound if our officers who run the system are well trained to stay vigilant at all times.&nbsp; Top management and commanding officers must be more "hands on" to ensure that ground officers are performing their duties properly.&nbsp; Sir, security work is a 24/7 job.&nbsp; It requires officers to be alert at all times.&nbsp; This can be challenging if the vehicle or human traffic is high, especially in airports, ferry terminals or customs checkpoints.&nbsp; For practical reasons,&nbsp;we&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2871</p>need to adopt a risk-based approach towards security in certain places such as airports and customs checkpoints.&nbsp; But we can always use appropriate technology and deploy relevant manpower to reduce human errors and security lapses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, any security system would fail if left unchecked or untested for a long period of time.&nbsp; Therefore, it is crucial that independent security audit checks are carried out frequently to identify potential weaknesses so that remedial actions can be taken.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would propose that the Ministry consider setting up an overall independent Security Audit Committee to conduct checks and balances frequently on our security system, including the Internal Security Department.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the recent security lapses have sparked off much debate among Singaporeans, especially on the Internet.&nbsp; Instead of pursuing a blaming game, I would urge all Singaporeans to rally together and play a role in further strengthening the security and safety of Singapore.&nbsp; In these trying times, we need to show our support for the Home Team officers who are guardians of our safety and security.&nbsp; We must learn from these mistakes, and work closely with the Home Team to make Singapore a safer home for all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is impossible to have a 100% safe proof security system.&nbsp; But we can always make sure that our security system works 99% of the time.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.39 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, Dr Teo Ho Pin has highlighted three areas for improvement.&nbsp; I would like to highlight one more which is <p align=left>Column: 2872</p>the need to increase the robustness of the mindset of our security personnel and for them to improve upon, what I would call, an antenna for danger.&nbsp; The Ministry of Home Affairs had indicated that the lapses occurred as a result of human error and security personnel not following procedure.&nbsp; If it&nbsp;was the case&nbsp;of just one incident caused by an error on the part of one individual, there would be less cause for concern.&nbsp; However, what we have seen in recent months is a series of several errors committed by several individuals across three different departments.&nbsp; That seems to me&nbsp;to be&nbsp;an indication of a wider problem. &nbsp;So the deeper question we have to ask is: what were the cause of these errors on the part of these individuals?&nbsp; It seems to me that if we analyse the underlying causes of each of these incidents, it would be seen that there is a common thread that runs through each incident and, that is, that the individual in question all acted on the assumption that nothing would go wrong.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the Mas Selamat's incident first.&nbsp; The first failure was on the part of the Superintendent of the Detention Centre who thought that sawing off the handle of the ventilation window was sufficient&nbsp;as a&nbsp;security measure to prevent him&nbsp;escape.&nbsp; In the Minister's Report in the COI findings, it was reported that the Superintendent thought that this measure would be adequate because he assumed that the guards would always have sight of the detainee.&nbsp; The second failure though was the failure by the guard to keep Mas Selamat in his line of sight.&nbsp; He allowed Mas Selamat to close the urinal cubicle door.&nbsp; He apparently did this because he assumed that the urinal cubicle was a secure facility and that Mas Selamat could not escape from the Detention Centre.&nbsp; So the Superintendent was lax because he assumed that the guard would do his job and the guard was lax because he assumed that the Superintendent would do his job.&nbsp; Then there is also the question of delay caused <p align=left>Column: 2873</p>by hesitation.&nbsp; When the first guard felt that Mas Selamat had taken too long, he referred the matter to a fellow guard.&nbsp; This officer in turn turned to the Special Duty Operative of the STO.&nbsp; She in turn hesitated to break down the toilet door because it was a male toilet, so she referred it to the Assistant Case Officer who eventually took a decision.&nbsp; Throughout the series of hesitations, however, it was indicated that at no time did the guard or the STO become concerned that Mas Selamat was taking too long because he did not think that he might have escaped.&nbsp; So, again, there was another assumption.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the Subordinate Courts' case.&nbsp; In that case, the first failure was on the part of the policeman who obliged when one of the detainees asked for water.&nbsp; The policeman opened the door&nbsp;to give the prisoner a cup of water which was a breach of procedure.&nbsp; No doubt he was trying to be helpful but, again, there appeared to have been a failure to appreciate the potential danger in coming into close proximity to prisoners that way.&nbsp; He assumed that the prisoners would be cooperative and well behaved.&nbsp; And having got out of the cell, the two detainees got out of the building because of&nbsp;a second failure, and this was the failure of the policeman or security officer who did not look up to check&nbsp;the CCTV when the two escapees buzzed for the door to open.&nbsp;&nbsp;He again acted on an assumption &ndash; he assumed that whoever was on the other side of the door would be a person who was allowed to come through.&nbsp; Again, the antenna for danger was not up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of the immigration lapse, Mr Ang, the passenger, cleared all the security checks, he cleared the airline counter, he got past the CISCO officer, he then ran into problems at the ICA counter because he was not able to clear his fingerprint scan at the Immigration Automated Clearance System.&nbsp; The immigration officer then directed him to a <p align=left>Column: 2874</p>lane for manual clearance.&nbsp; Once again, the failure here was an assumption rather than asking why the system was rejecting the scan.&nbsp; The immigration officer proceeded on the assumption that the person in front of him was the right person and that the machine must therefore be wrong.&nbsp; He ignored the red flag&nbsp;when&nbsp;it went up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, in&nbsp;the security arena, two factors are of critical importance&nbsp;&ndash; the system and the people&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; and these particular instances were not incidents of the system failure or failure in SOP.&nbsp; It is not about the system.&nbsp; This was about the quality and&nbsp;robustness of the mental attitude of our security personnel.&nbsp; The lack of alertness and sense of danger appears&nbsp;to be a result of living in&nbsp;a society which has been safe and secure for so long and which there has been no major security disaster.&nbsp; In fact, it is the success of very good work done by the Ministry of Home Affairs that, in a sense, has perhaps led to our sense of infallibility and a certain softness and complacency appear to be creeping into our mindset.&nbsp; Ironically, however, it is when our security officers feel most secure that we are the least secure. &nbsp;In order to be effective, our security agencies cannot proceed on the assumption that nothing will go wrong.&nbsp; Instead they should proceed on the assumption that&nbsp;if&nbsp;something can go wrong, it will.&nbsp; This mental robustness is something that needs to be addressed, and quickly.&nbsp; I would urge the Ministry of Home Affairs to look into this aspect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

That may be so.&nbsp; But this seems to imply that human error is unavoidable and hence <p align=left>Column: 2875</p>inevitable.&nbsp; This is difficult to reconcile with the&nbsp;Government's previous calls to Singaporeans to be ever vigilant because we have to win against the terrorists every time but&nbsp;they only have to win once.&nbsp; The inescapable fact remains that we have had three lapses across three different departments within&nbsp;a short span of four months or so.&nbsp; One would have expected the Home Team to be&nbsp;extra vigilant after the escape of Mas Selamat and that there would at least have been no more human errors in the period immediately following his escape.&nbsp;</P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Sir,&nbsp;I think there is a very legitimate question as to whether three lapses in three different agencies in four months&nbsp;are enough evidence of a wider problem in MHA.&nbsp; The Ministry has consistently focused on individual officers' omissions and how even the best-designed systems are susceptible to human error but has not acknowledged any fault as an organisation.&nbsp; If there are human lapses in different agencies within the Ministry, then there is a valid question as to whether the Ministry itself has done enough to inculcate a culture of zero-tolerance for human errors across the entire Home Team as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, in the month or so since the Changi Airport slip-up, there has, to date, been no apology from MHA to Singaporeans for these lapses.&nbsp; The public would be forgiven for thinking that MHA is in denial, at least publicly.&nbsp; I think an apology is the least that the Ministry could do, and I believe a clear, unreserved, unqualified apology is a necessary first step towards the restoration of public confidence in the Home Team because it demonstrates that the Ministry is squarely confronting the issue.&nbsp; The failure to apologise suggests <p align=left>Column: 2876</p>that it is downplaying&nbsp;the seriousness of these incidents and denying responsibility.&nbsp; Unless and until this happens, it would be difficult to expect public confidence in the Home Team to be restored.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim:</B> Sir, Mas Selamat's escape is an embarrassment and, together with the recent lapses, this has actually led some members of the public to ask whether MHA is breaking down.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, for each of these breaches, there are many other times when security was successfully provided.&nbsp; The nature of security is such that successful security operations are unnoticed, precisely because nothing eventful happened.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, we must not lose our perspective.&nbsp; At the same time, the Government owes a duty to the public to account for these lapses honestly and holistically.&nbsp; What I think is constructive in the long run is to step back and have a thorough review of the increasing demands on MHA, the resources needed and how to ensure that the public interest is protected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three questions which come to mind:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Are these incidents signs that MHA has work overload?&nbsp; I am aware of how heavily deployed the Home Team has been in recent years.&nbsp; Ever since 911, many Home Team officers have been deployed for counter-terrorism activities.&nbsp; While we seek to promote Singapore as a centre for meetings, conventions and exhibitions, every IMF meeting, every F1 Night Race is an added strain.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the public continues to seek police assistance every minute.&nbsp; We can try to leverage on NSmen, reservists or private-sector partners, but there are limitations to this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; The population has expanded to 4.7 million and is expected to breach the <p align=left>Column: 2877</p>six-million mark.&nbsp; This will surely strain our social services, including those under the Home Team.&nbsp; We need more police officers, more firefighters, more immigration officers.&nbsp; What has been done to ensure that recruitment is keeping pace with the increased population?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Outsourcing of Home Team functions to auxiliary police and private security companies has become necessary.&nbsp; As jobs become divided and farmed out, coordination of security operations becomes more complex.&nbsp; There will be differences in organisational culture and mindset between a regular Home Team officer, auxiliary police and private-sector guards.&nbsp; Just as we have seen in&nbsp;Mas Selamat's escape, will each person be so focused on their area of work to the detriment of the final outcome?&nbsp; How smooth is the interface between the different agencies and how is this being monitored?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Speaker:</B> Mr Shanmugam.&nbsp;

These appear to be straight-forward questions.&nbsp; But the answers cannot and should not be simplistic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I need not go into detail about the recent three cases.&nbsp; Ms Rajah and Dr Teo have pointed out that the common thread running through them was a failure to comply with SOPs.&nbsp; We acknowledge that.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in considering these lapses, we should not oversimplify the issues.&nbsp; If we look at the three cases within their operating contexts, we can see that one type of mistake is not the same as <p align=left>Column: 2878</p>another, even if the common thread is persons failing to comply with SOPs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in the passport misclearance case, the officer&rsquo;s focus was on security.&nbsp; He rightly conducted a face-to-face clearance when the automated gates failed.&nbsp; Terrorists are known to use real passports and in their own identities.&nbsp; Thus, such an assessment is important in our counter-terrorism security clearance system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer in question is quite experienced.&nbsp; He assessed Mr Ang by examining if Mr Ang fitted a terrorist or security-risk profile; whether he exhibited any suspicious behaviour cues or indicators; whether the passport tendered was tampered or a forgery.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to that point, the officer did everything right.&nbsp; The officer, however, made a mistake in not pursuing Mr Ang&rsquo;s failure to clear the automated gates.&nbsp; He was satisfied that Mr Ang was not a security risk, and assumed that it was just a technical glitch. &nbsp;He will be penalised for that error.&nbsp; But we must also be fair to the officer in question. &nbsp;He exercised most of the security protocols correctly, but made an error in not checking the passport against the boarding pass.&nbsp; To equate this case as the same as that of the Mas Selamat escape would be quite wrong.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this distinction important? &nbsp;I make it not to excuse any mistake or to trivialise one over another. But we need to highlight it because such a distinction is built into the design of all risk-based security systems.&nbsp; Such&nbsp;systems are designed to minimise not just failure but also to mitigate the magnitude of specific failures. &nbsp;This is inherent in any risk-based approach to security.&nbsp; We have to prioritise our resources and focus according to the risks. &nbsp;More resources are focused on high risk, high-consequence areas, and less resources&nbsp;on lower-risk, lower-consequence areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2879</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will there be a misclearance case in future?&nbsp; More than 140 million travellers pass through our checkpoints annually.&nbsp; Five cases of persons carrying the wrong passports are detected every day by ICA officers. &nbsp;Can we guarantee that we will pick up all of these and that there will never be one which we might miss?&nbsp; While the Home Team will certainly work to avoid such an instance, it would be foolhardy and unrealistic to assume this. &nbsp;What we can assure you is that we continuously&nbsp;work to minimise such lapses because we take them seriously.&nbsp; What we can assure you also is that the security system is layered and robust and is structured to minimise serious consequences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What should be done going forward?&nbsp;&nbsp;We will certainly review lapses and seek to learn from them.&nbsp; We are doing so. &nbsp;Officers who make mistakes or who are liable must be taken to task. &nbsp;But we must also not over-react and be unfair to the officers.&nbsp; We have to ensure that, in our judgment, there will be fairness, a sense of proportion and justice, and adherence to established due processes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo has spoken about the need for more discipline, more audits and more checks.&nbsp; Ms Rajah has made similar points.&nbsp; The question perhaps is really: how much more is enough?&nbsp; We do regularly conduct audits and checks, and they are important and useful. &nbsp;But these audits cannot prevent&nbsp;episodic individual failure to comply with established procedures.&nbsp; In respect of the lapses which have occurred, the systems and processes were found to be sound.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So more checks and more compliance audits may not be the total solution.&nbsp; What we have done in MHA is to develop and implement a programme to test operational effectiveness.&nbsp; Since January <p align=left>Column: 2880</p>2007, there is in place a Red Teaming programme with the help of expert external consultants.&nbsp; This programme is designed to evaluate the actual level of competencies, alertness and vigilance of frontline security forces. Such tests help us identify operational blind-spots, weaknesses and the level and quality of vigilance of the frontline officers.&nbsp; The results allow us to then develop appropriate and practical interventions, including special training, for our frontline officers and their supervisors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even such tests cannot stop the individual officer opening a gate without looking at his screen, nor can it help to prevent an officer failing to check the passport against the boarding pass.&nbsp; These, as stated earlier, are individual episodic lapses.&nbsp; They are not systemic practices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Strict compliance or active empowerment?</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Dr Teo&nbsp;and Ms Rajah that ground commanders and supervisors have a responsibility to ensure compliance by frontline officers with established procedures. &nbsp;However, in doing so, we want to also ensure that we do not dis-empower our frontline officers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Systems and SOPs are inherently dated. &nbsp;They are designed based on known experiences and scenarios.&nbsp; Just as we learn and improve, our adversaries, be they terrorists or criminals, learn and improve all the time as well. &nbsp;Ultimately, when confronted with something new, we depend on the frontline officer to meet such a challenge through his experience, judgment and initiative. &nbsp;How can we do this? &nbsp;One practical approach we have taken is to invest heavily on scenario-based, hands-on, front-liner training at the Home Team Academy. &nbsp;We want our officers to internalise knowledge and understand their SOPs rather than just <p align=left>Column: 2881</p>comply blindly.&nbsp; We want them to develop good situational awareness and to cultivate good reflexes and instincts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>There is no 100% security</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that no system can be completely fail-proof, either now or in the future.&nbsp; The aim must be to minimise failures and maximise success but also recognise that there will be failures and no absolute 100% success.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we have a zero-tolerance philosophy for drug abuse and death penalties for drug trafficking.&nbsp; Our drug abuse and trafficking numbers are low, but they are not zero.&nbsp; That does not mean that CNB has failed or that our policy has failed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2007, ICA cleared some 143 million travellers through our land, sea and air checkpoints, or close to 400,000 travellers each day.&nbsp; With stepped-up security measures, ICA detected 37,800 cases of smuggling at the borders and more than 2,200 foreigners who attempted to enter Singapore fraudulently. Yet, we know that despite ICA&rsquo;s best efforts, there will be some illegal immigrants and contraband smuggled into Singapore.&nbsp; To expect otherwise is completely unrealistic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when Mr Siew Kum Hong makes his points, I think he has got to bear these perspectives in mind and not take all three cases together and lump them together and then say, therefore, there is a serious situation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfection is the ideal to aim for.&nbsp; But imperfection is the reality we have to work with each day. &nbsp;We face security challenges with incomplete, elliptical information of the evolving threat.&nbsp; Even so, we must act and make the best judgment we can.&nbsp; Our officers must not be made to become risk-averse and avoid making judgements for fear of being wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2882</p><p><I>Is the Home Team over-stretched?</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, questions have been raised as to whether&nbsp;the Home Team is over-stretched.&nbsp; The core functions of the Home Team have not changed. &nbsp;But the volume and scope of work have greatly expanded, with increased population, tourist arrivals and more international events which require higher security coverage.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a smaller Police force per 100,000 population when compared to Hong Kong and New York.&nbsp; But our crime rate per 100,000 population is lower than Hong Kong&rsquo;s and three-and-a-half times less than that of New York City&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new security landscape post-911 has raised significant demands on the Home Team.&nbsp; Unlike in the past, Singapore is today a target for terrorist groups.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fundamental question which MHA is exploring is whether we can continue to operate with the current level of resources.&nbsp; Our Home Team officers at the front line are stretched and strained over a high alert that started since end 2001. &nbsp;The total number of overtime hours ICA ground officers at the checkpoints have to put in every month to cope with the volume of work varies between 23,000&nbsp;and 28,000 overtime&nbsp;hours.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To consider the impact of this, the Ministry has directed that a human factor study be conducted. &nbsp;The study will look at issues of operational fatigue within the Home Team.&nbsp; The study will also look at resources and manning levels and see if there are sub-optimal areas which need urgent attention.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Look at security in perspective</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security must always be viewed in&nbsp;context.&nbsp; For instance, the Subordinate Courts is a place which the public must <p align=left>Column: 2883</p>have free access, given the critical function it plays in the justice system.&nbsp; Any Police lock-up facility within the premises cannot undermine or compromise this function.&nbsp; We can enhance the lock-up security there.&nbsp; But it cannot be at the same level as Changi Prison.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, security needs to find a balance between efficiency and expediency on the one hand, and effectiveness of security measures on the other.&nbsp; As much as we should maintain our security levels at our checkpoints, we also need to facilitate tourism, trade and social activities across borders.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to look at security as always operating in a context where there are competing imperatives of economic, political and social interests.&nbsp; This is not a bad thing. &nbsp;Indeed, a completely security-sealed country is one which will suffocate enterprise and liberty.&nbsp; It is a cure worse than the disease it is trying to prevent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need, therefore, to understand that security is not an absolute end.&nbsp; It is always achieved at a trade-off.&nbsp; And risks are always relative, to be managed, and not something we can eradicate completely in any human system operating in a living society.&nbsp; If we over simplify a complex subject like security design and operations, we may create unrealistic expectations of these systems and of the people who will man them. In the end, we only fool ourselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mistakes which have occurred recently cannot be dismissed.&nbsp; We should <p align=left>Column: 2884</p>confront them,&nbsp;take ownership and take proper action to deal with them.&nbsp; But let us do so always with a sense of balance and on an informed basis, understanding the context and the complexity of the issues involved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members of the House that the officers of the Home Team are committed to their work and mission and view the lapses which have occurred seriously.&nbsp; No one is more critical of these lapses than the officers and everyone at Home Team.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, we need to look at the generalised outcome of security in terms of the quality of life we have today.&nbsp; The real test of security must be whether there is a sense of safety, whether people can walk about freely and without fear that they would be robbed or assaulted and whether our police force is trusted, and generally free of corruption and nexus with the underworld.&nbsp; On the score-card, whether for crime, drugs or terrorism or for neutralising hazards or even in rehabilitating prisoners to give them a second chance, any objective and honest assessment will conclude that the officers of the Home Team have done a good job compared to their counterparts in other parts of the world, despite the difficult operating environment they face every day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Dr Lee Boon Yang--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank both Ms Ng and Ms Low for their interest in the Singapore Arts Festival and its future direction.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singapore Arts Festival has evolved over the past 30 years in line with our arts scene and audiences. In the 70s and 80s, it was the main platform for fledgling semi-professional Singapore arts companies. Since 2000, in support of Singapore&rsquo;s vision to be a global city for the arts, the National Arts Council had enhanced the international dimension to complement the strong Asian flavour and also strived to bridge the traditional and the contemporary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Singapore&rsquo;s pinnacle arts event, the Festival aims to meet three objectives. Firstly, for our performing arts talents and industry, the Festival promotes artistic development and excellence. This is done by commissioning new works by our artistic talents and forging international artistic collaborations. Secondly, for the audience, the Festival promotes wider and deeper appreciation for the arts. It offers a broad range of enjoyable and appreciated free outreach programmes in the city and the heartlands, as well as a core programme of ticketed shows which includes new works and some cutting edge performances. Thirdly, to position Singapore as a global arts city, the Festival seeks to raise international awareness of Singapore arts by developing strong partnerships with foreign art festivals and creating an international profile synonymous with artistic innovation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the Festival&rsquo;s focus is on the performing arts, NAC has not neglected other artforms.&nbsp; Ms Penny Low enquired about the upcoming Singapore Biennale. The Singapore Biennale is an equivalent platform to the Singapore Arts Festival, but with a focus on visual arts.&nbsp; While the Arts Festival showcases quality Singapore and international performing arts, the Singapore Biennale will present international contemporary visual artists alongside Asian and Singaporean artists. The Singapore Biennale is Singapore&rsquo;s largest contemporary visual arts exhibition. It will enhance Singapore&rsquo;s standing as a regional and international platform for showcasing and discussion on contemporary visual <p align=left>Column: 2887</p>arts. It thus complements the effort of the Singapore Arts Festival to position Singapore as a vibrant global arts city.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The overall budget for the Singapore Arts Festival has remained relatively steady at around $6.5 million to $7 million a year over the past decade. Each year about 50% of the budget comes from sponsorship and ticket sales.&nbsp; A major challenge that NAC faces is to keep within the budget despite rising local and international organising costs. For 2008, more of the core ticketed programme were medium to small scale performances instead of big "blockbuster" shows. This approach addressed the cost factor for "blockbuster" shows and also recognised that such shows are now presented throughout the year by other art promoters. For example, the Sun-Festival organised by IMG Artists in October 2008 will bring in big names in arts and entertainment such as the opera singer Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Vienna Boys Choir, among others.&nbsp; Award-winning Broadway musical Avenue Q will also start its season in October.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The focus on more medium and smaller scale shows in the core programme meant that only 30,000 tickets were available compared to the 37,000 tickets for the 2007 Festival. Hence, this year&rsquo;s Festival recorded a lower ticketed attendance. Nonetheless, the core programme provided audiences with a line-up of innovative, exciting and diverse works of an international standard. The overall attendance was 74% of the 30,000 available tickets. This is close to the average of 75% to 80% ticketed attendance for the past ten years of the Festival.&nbsp; In fact, of the 50 ticketed performances, 18 were sold out which was comparable to 2007 when 16 of the 48 ticketed performances were sold out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;While some people were of the opinion that this year&rsquo;s Festival had failed, critics&rsquo; opinion of the Festival&rsquo;s productions in both Singapore and foreign media was predominantly positive. NAC counted over 50 positive reviews received from the key Singapore media alone, including the <I>Straits Times</I>.&nbsp; For example, <I>ST</I> had remarked that the opening performance <I>Architecture of Silence</I> was a &ldquo;winsome and ambitious work that was contemporary and accessible&rdquo; and a &ldquo;refreshing and delightful piece&rdquo;.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This year&rsquo;s Festival also continued to support artistic development by commissioning new works from Singaporean arts groups. Through the Festival&rsquo;s international collaborations, works by Singaporean artists such as <I>The King Lear Project</I> had already performed at an Arts Festival in Brussels, while <I>Awaking</I> by Ong Keng Sen was co-commissioned by the Edinburgh Arts Festival. To meet the aim of bringing the arts to Singaporeans, the Festival also successfully spearheaded new partnerships to develop more engaging outreach programmes, especially in the heartlands. As a result, there were 580 outreach events attracting an overall total attendance of about 570,000. For example, the Festival&rsquo;s closing performance at Bedok Reservoir, in partnership with the PUB&rsquo;s Singapore International Water Week, attracted 18,000 people alone. This partnership approach contributes significantly to the Festival&rsquo;s outreach efforts, and the objective of growing a more discerning arts audience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I would like to assure Ms Irene Ng and Miss Penny Low that we will continue to review the organisation and form of the Festival to address the challenges of a changing cultural landscape. Today, the Singapore arts scene is more vibrant and there is greater diversity.&nbsp; Audiences can choose from a range of arts performances throughout the year. The Festival need not duplicate programmes that are already provided by commercial arts promoters.&nbsp; Instead, the challenge is for the Festival to evolve a programme mix that would continue to meet the goals of artistic and audience development, and to enhance its <p align=left>Column: 2889</p>international position and influence. We will also study the possible organisational structures that would best ensure the attractiveness and standing of the Festival. Even though we have received numerous domestic and international accolades about the quality of the festival and performances, there is certainly much room for improvement. We will continue to review various aspects of the Festival to improve its programming and delivery. NAC will consult closely with event partners and arts groups, as well as take into account audience needs and public feedback in such review.</p></p></span>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

As of now, we think that it is too early to decide whether there is a need for some of the rules to be further fine-tuned.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I will now deal with the two questions that Ms Ng has highlighted.&nbsp; As regards to her first question, the role of the council of a management corporation and that of a collective sale committee&nbsp;is described in the legislation.&nbsp; The Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act provides that the role of a management corporation is, amongst other things, to control, manage, maintain and administer the common property of the development to ensure that they are in good and proper condition.&nbsp; Members of the management corporation council are responsible and accountable for carrying out the duties of the corporation for the benefit of all the owners.&nbsp; The role of the management corporation council does not extend to exploring and facilitating a collective sale of the development, which is under the purview of a collective sale committee duly elected at a general meeting.&nbsp; The role of a collective sale committee, as described in the Land Titles (Strata) Act, is principally to act on behalf of the owners on matters relating to a collective sale of that development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As regards to Ms Ng&rsquo;s second question on the use of proxy votes, just as a shareholder who cannot attend a company&rsquo;s general meeting can cast his vote on the resolutions through a proxy, it is necessary to allow an owner to vote through a proxy at a general meeting of the corporation.&nbsp; Disallowing or limiting the use of proxy votes will mean that owners who are unable to attend a meeting will not be able to exercise their right to vote.&nbsp; We see no compelling reasons to deprive owners of this right.</p></p></span>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Let me first deal with the issues relating to construction cost before I update her on the use of sustainable construction materials in the industry.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore, like other fast growing countries in the world, is facing rising construction costs. BCA&rsquo;s Building Tender Price Index(2), which tracks mainly manpower and equipment costs, rose by 19% in 2007, and by another 4% in the first quarter of 2008.&nbsp; In terms of overall construction cost, feedback from leading Quantity Surveyor firms indicates that the increase was about 20% to 30% in 2007, and about 3%-5% in the first quarter of 2008.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sharp increase in construction cost is driven mainly by the high demand for construction resources and materials worldwide, and exacerbated by the surge in fuel prices. For example, the price of steel bars has risen by 85% since June last year.&nbsp; Concrete now costs about 18% more, year-on-year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Government has implemented several measures to ease the tight resource supply situation. MOM has relaxed the construction sector dependency ratio from 1:5 to 1:7 and raised the S-pass quota from 15% to 25%. Experienced foreign workers are also exempted from the Man-Year-Entitlement requirement.&nbsp; BCA is also working closely with the industry to expand its contracting capacity, including bringing in contracting resources from overseas. For a start, BCA has organised&nbsp;two joint-industry trips to China.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To help moderate construction demand, the Government had earlier deferred $3 billion worth of public sector construction projects to after 2009.&nbsp; This month, public agencies have identified another $1.7 billion worth of projects for deferment.&nbsp; This will bring the total value of projects that the Government is deferring to $4.7 billion.&nbsp; However, projects that are essential to meet Singapore&rsquo;s economic and social needs, such as key infrastructural development, will proceed as planned. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and work with the key industry stakeholders such as developers, builders and quantity surveyors to mitigate the cost increase as much as possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mdm Phua asked about the impact of rising construction costs on HDB&rsquo;s building programme and the prices of flats.&nbsp; As new HDB flats prices are not based on cost, they will not be directly affected by the construction cost increases. New flats will continue to be priced at a discount to their equivalent market prices, so that buyers enjoy a generous <p align=left>Column: 2895</p>subsidy.&nbsp; As I had mentioned earlier, overall construction costs had gone up by 20% to 30% in 2007.&nbsp; In comparison, new flat prices had increased by a slower pace, in tandem with the prevailing market trends.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, comparing&nbsp;two BTO projects next to each other in Sengkang, the project launched in November 2007 was on average about 14% higher than the one launched a year earlier in November 2006.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, the construction cost increase poses a strain on HDB&rsquo;s budget for new building projects. HDB has already implemented various measures to mitigate the extent of cost increases as far as possible.&nbsp; For example, HDB is stepping up overseas promotional efforts to attract more foreign contractors to participate in HDB tenders.&nbsp; HDB also purchases cement and sand in bulk to cushion HDB contractors against price increases of these raw materials.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mdm Phua also asked about the use of sustainable materials in construction.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sustainable construction&rdquo; is about the efficient use of materials. It is an important thrust to support the larger goal of sustainable development, and also a means to help manage overall construction cost.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sustainable construction&rdquo; requires the adoption of building designs and construction methods that optimise material usage, and enable the use of recycled materials, as well as materials that have sustainable supplies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This concept is relatively new in Singapore, but we have made progress. For example, the use of dry partition wall systems, which can help builders save on materials compared to conventional concrete or internal brick walls, is becoming more popular.&nbsp; HDB has also recently adopted such systems for the conversion of some rental flats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sustainable construction methods also include prefab construction using structural steel and pre-cast concrete. While steel prices have risen considerably, there are savings on productivity, manpower, materials and construction time which could offset the higher upfront costs.&nbsp; Prefab construction can potentially offer a better construction solution for developers and builders, and industry stakeholders should weigh the pros and cons to decide if it is a viable option for certain types of projects such as commercial buildings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;BCA is also advocating more efficient concrete design to reduce concrete usage, and promoting the use of recycled materials in construction. To facilitate the use of recycled materials, a new Singapore Standard was launched to allow the safe and appropriate use of manufactured and recycled aggregates in place of natural aggregates in concrete production.&nbsp; In addition, BCA is working with demolition contractors to encourage the sorting of demolition waste and looking into the accreditation of recyclers to raise the standard of the industry.<br></p></p></span><p><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr><p>(2) BCA&rsquo;s TPI tracks mainly manpower and equipment cost, and excludes piling, M&amp;E costs, etc.</p><BR></div></P></div>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:DORMITORIES FOR FOREIGN WORKERS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:DORMITORIES FOR FOREIGN WORKERS:::2898--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"></B><p align=left>Column: 2895</p><B><P>DORMITORIES FOR FOREIGN WORKERS</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Supply--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Supply)</B></span><div><BR>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak </B>asked the Minister for National Development in view of the increasing number of foreign workers entering Singapore in recent years (a) whether he can provide an update on the supply of dormitories for foreign workers; and (b) if these facilities are able to cater to the needs of these workers.</P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><p align=left>Column: 2897</p><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since February 2007, BCA and JTC have released 11 new dormitory sites, providing some 65,000 additional bed spaces.&nbsp; These will be completed progressively by 2010.&nbsp; Among these dormitory sites are vacant Government buildings that will be converted into transitional dormitories to meet the immediate demand for dormitory facilities in the next&nbsp;one to&nbsp;two years, while more permanent dormitories are being developed.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the new permanent workers' dormitories, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and the Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) will require tenderers to provide a range of amenities within the dormitory sites. Apart from adequate living space, the dormitories may also contain various facilities such as mini-marts, barber shop, remittance services, TV room and sports facilities.&nbsp; This will help to make the dormitories more attractive and self-contained, insofar as daily living and recreational needs are concerned.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given that Singapore is becoming more built up, it will be an increasing challenge to find suitable sites for foreign workers. Residents may find more foreign workers living in their midst, or dormitory sites located near to their premises.&nbsp; We hope that Singaporeans will be more understanding and accommodating in this aspect.&nbsp; Foreign workers are here to contribute to our economic growth.&nbsp; We should accept their presence in our midst.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employers and dormitory operators must also play a part in educating the foreign workers on our social norms and way of life in Singapore, and ensuring that the workers are properly housed.</p></p></span>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:SMALL VEHICLES--><!--END_COL_TITLE:SMALL VEHICLES:::2900--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"></B><p align=left>Column: 2897</p><B><P>SMALL VEHICLES</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Compulsory wearing of seat belts/lap belts--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Compulsory wearing of seat belts/lap belts)</B></span><div><BR>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

and (b) whether he will consider amending the Enlistment Act to allow some flexibility and clarity in its enlistment policy so that students who are genuinely scheduled to sit for examinations may seek deferment to a later intake.</P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Teo Chee Hean:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first explain the basis of our deferment policy.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Enlistment Act, NS-liable males can be called up for NS as soon as they turn 18 years of age.&nbsp; There is a reason for this enlistment age.&nbsp; The SAF must be able to maintain a credible defence force for our security and survival.&nbsp; Given our small population, national servicemen form the backbone of the SAF.&nbsp; We train them to become soldiers and leaders in their&nbsp;two years of full-time NS and they continue to play these critical roles during their operationally ready service.&nbsp; For many, this means they are required to serve up to at least age 30.&nbsp; By enlisting them at around 18 years of age, we optimise the ability of the SAF to fulfil its missions with an energetic and able-bodied defence force.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the legislated enlistment age, MINDEF exercises flexibility by granting deferment from full-time NS for pre-enlistees pursuing their studies under certain circumstances.&nbsp; In determining our policy, MINDEF applies the key principles of universality and equity to ensure that everyone is given the opportunity to attain &lsquo;A&rsquo; levels, international baccalaureate, or polytechnic diploma or equivalent qualifications before enlistment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MINDEF therefore grants deferment for pre-enlistees to gain their basic educational qualifications of up to 'A' levels, polytechnic diploma, international baccalaureate or equivalent qualifications.&nbsp; This is reasonable as most of our NS-liable males would either have completed or are completing their basic educational qualifications when they turn 18 years of age.&nbsp; NS-liable males are therefore enlisted at the earliest opportunity after turning 18 or when they have finished such courses, whichever is later.&nbsp; As university degrees are considered higher educational qualifications, deferments for university studies will not be allowed.&nbsp; This will strike an appropriate balance as our NS liable males will be given the opportunity to complete the basic qualification at &lsquo;A&rsquo; levels, polytechnic diploma or equivalent, and be enlisted for military training while they are young and fit.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Educational opportunities in Singapore have increased over the past years.&nbsp; There has been a proliferation of private institutions and courses offered.&nbsp; Some of these private institutions offer to admit students directly into their undergraduate programmes upon the completion of their &lsquo;O&rsquo; levels without them having to first attain &lsquo;A&rsquo; levels or diploma <p align=left>Column: 2901</p>qualifications.&nbsp; Some NS-liable males have enrolled for such undergraduate programmes upon the completion of their 'O' levels before they turned age 18.&nbsp; They subsequently asked to be deferred to complete their university studies or their semester examinations before enlisting.&nbsp; Mr Yeo has asked whether MINDEF can exercise some flexibility by allowing such students in private institutions to defer till their end-of-semester examinations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, MINDEF does not allow deferment for university studies, regardless of whether the deferment is for part of or the entire duration of the undergraduate course.&nbsp; Allowing such students deferment would be unfair to the vast majority of their peers studying in Junior Colleges, Polytechnics and other institutions, who do not have the same opportunity to be deferred for their university studies.&nbsp; This would also undermine our key NS principles of universality and equity.&nbsp; The NS system will not work if we allow individuals to choose when they would like to be enlisted.&nbsp; Hence, NS-liable males who commence their university studies before their enlistment would be enlisted at the first opportunity after age 18.&nbsp; They will have to disrupt their university studies as they will not be granted deferment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In line with the above, MINDEF has stopped granting deferment for university studies since the end of 2005.&nbsp; This change to our deferment policy was announced during the Committee of Supply in 2006.&nbsp; Our deferment policy can be found on the NS Portal on the internet and in the information package that is sent to all NS-liable males when they turn 16&frac12; years of age.&nbsp; MINDEF has also informed major private institutions of our deferment policies and has more recently requested them to remind their potential students at the point of application that deferment will not be granted for university studies.&nbsp; For the minority who complete their basic educational qualifications before age 18, they can apply for early enlistment if they are above age 16&frac12; under the Voluntary Early Enlistment Scheme.&nbsp; This will enable them to enlist slightly earlier and complete their full-time NS before proceeding for university studies.</p></p></span>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:CRASH-LANDING OF SUPER PUMA AS 332 HELICOPTER--><!--END_COL_TITLE:CRASH-LANDING OF SUPER PUMA AS 332 HELICOPTER:::2904--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The crash-landing was due to an error made during take-off by the pilot in control of the aircraft, who was a junior pilot on a training flight.&nbsp; He was undergoing continuation training to improve his proficiency, something that all pilots do.&nbsp; As the aircraft lifted off the ground, it experienced a left yaw.&nbsp; A left yaw means that the nose of the helicopter was swinging to the left.&nbsp; The pilot immediately tried to correct the yaw, but assessed that the aircraft was not responding as quickly as he wanted it to.&nbsp; As his attention was overly-focused on correcting the yaw, he did not simultaneously increase the power of the aircraft, as was required.&nbsp; As a result, the helicopter lost height, hit the ground and rolled <p align=left>Column: 2903</p>over in a matter of seconds.&nbsp; Under such circumstances, the senior pilot supervising him was not able to take over control of the aircraft.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flying an aircraft is a complex task requiring the pilot to carry out multiple actions at the same time.&nbsp; In this particular instance, the pilot over-focused on one action which rapidly resulted in the crash.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The RSAF immediately ceased all flying on this aircraft type.&nbsp; After ascertaining that the cause was pilot error, and ruling out mechanical failure, flying was allowed to resume.&nbsp; Before doing so, the RSAF took immediate steps to review its pilot training and flight operations.&nbsp; These were found to be adequate for equipping our pilots with the skills to operate aircraft safely and competently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pilot concerned was put on a revalidation package that included simulator training and check-flights by instructor pilots.&nbsp; He has since resumed flight training.&nbsp; The Squadron also put other junior pilots on an enhancement programme, which included increased supervision and simulator training, to ensure flying competency is maintained at a high level.</p></p></span>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The Singapore Sports Council (SSC), at the request of the Singapore Dragon Boat Association, commissioned a safety inquiry on the incident.&nbsp; The objectives of the inquiry were, first, to establish the sequence of events and contributing factors that led to the dragon boat incident; and, second, to recommend preventive measures to reduce the risk of similar incidents in the future.&nbsp; The inquiry was led by Mr Bernard Tan and included experts from the sports, safety and legal fields.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2909</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Panel has done a thorough job in assessing the factors that led to the accident.&nbsp; We agree with the inquiry&rsquo;s assessment that a combination of factors led to this most unfortunate incident.&nbsp; The inquiry panel has also issued sound recommendations to enhance safety in dragon boating. This included compliance with the international federation&rsquo;s guidelines on the organisation, conduct and safety of such races, and putting in place a proper selection and training system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We agree with the panel&rsquo;s recommendations. Since the release of the Safety Inquiry&rsquo;s report, SSC has been working with the Singapore Dragon Boat Association to implement the recommendations, which would be progressively extended to cover other water sports under&nbsp;National Sports Associations (NSA).&nbsp; SSC is also developing a safety framework for event organisers and NSAs. This framework comprises components such as the safety policy, rules and regulations, risk assessment and checklists.&nbsp; A guidebook is also being developed to assist event organisers be mindful of the safety do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts in organising events, programmes and competitions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the responsibility of the NSAs, sports officials, coaches and athletes to be familiar with safety and risk management standards set down by the international sports federations, and to implement these standards accordingly during sports activities and competitions. SSC has since conducted one round of risk management with the NSAs and will follow up with future sessions. There is always an element of risk in sports and accidents can and do happen.&nbsp; Sensible precautions and a sense of responsibility, both personal and collective, need to be ingrained into everyone involved with sports.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every life lost is one too many. We must foster a culture where all Singaporeans think safe, play safe, and stay safe, so as to ensure that similar tragedies will not happen again in the future.</p></p></span>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:HDB SUBSIDISED RENTAL SCHEME--><!--END_COL_TITLE:HDB SUBSIDISED RENTAL SCHEME:::2912--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"></B><p align=left>Column: 2909</p><B><P>HDB SUBSIDISED RENTAL SCHEME</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Penalties for abuse--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Penalties for abuse)</B></span><div><BR>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;46.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad </B>asked the Minister for National Development whether he will consider (i) increasing the penalties for people who abuse the HDB subsidised rental scheme and sublet these rental flats to their own tenants; and (ii) jail terms for offenders who have been making profits from subletting their rental flats for long periods of time.</P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB rental flats are heavily subsidised and meant as a last resort for needy families without other housing option.&nbsp; Illegal subletting of HDB rental flats is an abuse of housing subsidies meant for the poor.&nbsp; One rental flat that is illegally sublet means one less unit to house a needy family.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry takes a serious view on illegal subletting.&nbsp; HDB has stepped up its enforcement since 2007.&nbsp; Where there is evidence of abuse, it will not hesitate to recover the rental flat and re-allocate the unit to a family in need.&nbsp; Tenants who illegally sublet will be barred from buying or renting another flat from HDB for&nbsp;five years.&nbsp; The tenant&rsquo;s spouse will also be debarred for&nbsp;five years, while all other authorised occupiers will be debarred for 2.5 years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2911</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB will monitor the situation closely.&nbsp; If need be, we will impose stricter penalties to further clamp down on illegal subletting.</p></p></span>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:SAFETY OF TAXI DRIVERS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:SAFETY OF TAXI DRIVERS:::2912--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"></B><p align=left>Column: 2911</p><B><P>SAFETY OF TAXI DRIVERS</P></span>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;49.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim </B>asked the Minister for Transport, in light of the recent rise in robbery cases on taxi drivers, what measures are taken by his Ministry to enhance the safety of taxi drivers.</P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safety of taxi drivers is a key concern of the taxi companies and taxi drivers&rsquo; associations. To enhance the safety of taxi drivers, taxi companies have installed security systems in their taxis. One such system has distress alarms that are linked to their company&rsquo;s vehicle location system which uses Global Positioning System (GPS) technology to track the location of their taxis. When a taxi driver triggers the distress alarm, his location can be immediately established and the Police will be notified to assist.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hardware installations are only part of the answer. Very often, simple preventive measures like educating taxi drivers on the do's and don&rsquo;ts and the appropriate responses to take when faced with potential threats, which the taxi companies have also undertaken, can be more effective.&nbsp; For example, taxi drivers have been advised not to keep valuables in their taxis and to keep their cash out of sight. When confronted with armed robbers, they are advised not to put up resistance in order to minimise the risk of bodily injury.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The taxi companies and their drivers have great interest in the issue of drivers&rsquo; safety, and they have been conscientious in addressing such concerns. The Land Transport Authority will work closely with the taxi companies, taxi drivers' associations and the Police to facilitate their efforts in enhancing taxi drivers&rsquo; safety and collectively deterring crime against taxi drivers.</p></p></span>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:TAXI DRIVERS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:TAXI DRIVERS:::2914--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"></B><p align=left>Column: 2911</p><B><P>TAXI DRIVERS</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Complaints from members of the public--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Complaints from members of the public)</B></span><div><BR>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Ms Ellen Lee--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>Ms Ellen Lee </B>asked the Minister for Transport (a) if he will explain the process of how the Land Transport Authority (LTA) handles complaints from members of the public about taxi drivers; (b) how many taxi drivers were given demerit points/penalised due to customer complaints over the past&nbsp;three years; and (c) what is the action taken by LTA when the investigations revealed that the customer is unreasonable, rude or abusive.</P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has various channels, such as the customer service hotline, SMS and the online feedback form for members of the public to provide feedback on errant taxi drivers.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To facilitate the investigation, members of the public will need to provide the date, time and place of incident, the taxi registration number and a brief description of the <p align=left>Column: 2913</p>incident. LTA will then interview the taxi driver, the complainant and witnesses, if any. Only when LTA is clearly satisfied that there has been an infringement of the rules and regulations will LTA proceed to penalise the taxi driver. The taxi driver can appeal to LTA, and, if the driver&rsquo;s licence is suspended, appeal to the Minister for Transport as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Over the past&nbsp;three years from 2005 to 2007, 486 taxi drivers were issued composition fines arising from complaints by members of the public. Of these, 400 were also given demerit points.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In situations where taxi drivers encounter difficult passengers, they have been advised to handle the situation calmly and avoid entering into arguments with these passengers. If taxi drivers require assistance, they can alert their taxi companies&rsquo; call centres or contact the Police.&nbsp; If LTA&rsquo;s investigation reveals that the fault does not lie with the taxi driver, LTA will not take any action against the taxi driver.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The taxi industry is a service industry. Both LTA and the taxi companies place strong emphasis on taxi drivers providing quality service to their passengers. LTA will continue to work closely with the taxi companies and the taxi drivers&rsquo; associations collectively to improve the service levels of taxi drivers. However, passengers also have a part to play by treating taxi drivers fairly. It is only with mutual respect that taxi drivers can provide a service that their passengers are happy with.</p></p></span>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:MANDATORY CANING OF OVERSTAYERS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:MANDATORY CANING OF OVERSTAYERS:::2916--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"></B><p align=left>Column: 2913</p><B><P>MANDATORY CANING OF OVERSTAYERS</P></span>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Gautam Banerjee--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>Mr Gautam Banerjee </B>asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the introduction of mandatory caning of at least 3 strokes for foreigners who overstay 90 days or more, which was introduced in 1989, has been a sufficient deterrent to curb the immigration offender problem; and (b) how does the annual number of overstayers in recent years compare with the annual number of overstayers before the introduction of mandatory caning.</P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandatory caning for illegal immigrants and foreigners who overstay more than 90 days was introduced in March 1989. In August that year, then Minister for Home Affairs informed the House that more than 10,000 immigration offenders surrendered themselves and were repatriated even before the law came into operation. Two more amnesties were given and an additional 2,000 immigration offenders surrendered themselves. After the law was introduced, the number of overstayers fell sharply from 4,120 in 1988 (or 0.1% of the 4.3 million total visitor arrivals) to about 2,330 in 1990 (or 0.04% of the 5.3 million total visitor arrivals). Last year, the figure was 4,800, or 0.05% of the record number of 10.3 million visitors to Singapore. This low proportion demonstrates the deterrent effect of the provision.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As stated in my reply to Parliament on 26th May, mandatory caning remains an important and necessary deterrent against immigration offenders. However, it is not the only measure employed to tackle the problem. For example, through publicity efforts, ICA educates employers and landlords on the due diligence checks they must perform before employing or renting out their flats or rooms to foreigners. MOM has stepped up its outreach efforts to educate employers and workers on our employment and immigration regulations, including issuing a guidebook in various languages which highlights the <p align=left>Column: 2915</p>penalty of mandatory caning for overstaying.&nbsp; Enforcement efforts against immigration offenders by ICA and Police have also been stepped-up over the years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore remains an attractive destination for potential immigration offenders. MHA has taken and will continue to take a multi-pronged approach of having tough but effective laws, raising public awareness and maintaining a high level of enforcement.</p></p></span>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:THEFT OF PETROL FROM MOTOR VEHICLES--><!--END_COL_TITLE:THEFT OF PETROL FROM MOTOR VEHICLES:::2918--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"></B><p align=left>Column: 2915</p><B><P>THEFT OF PETROL FROM MOTOR VEHICLES</P></span>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;52.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak </B>asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) if he will provide a breakdown of the cases involving theft of petrol from motorcycles and other motor vehicles reported to the police in the last 12 months; (b) what are the locations where these thefts occurred; (c) what progress has the police made so far in their investigations; and (d) why is there no police advisory to warn the public to take preventive measures against such thefts.</P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a total of 27 cases of petrol theft reported in 2007, of which 25 cases were from motorcycles and&nbsp;two cases were from cars.&nbsp; Between January to June this year, there were 41 such cases reported, of which 37 cases were from motorcycles and&nbsp;four cases were from cars.&nbsp; The cases occurred mainly in Woodlands, Jurong West and Bukit Panjang estates, in both open and covered car parks.&nbsp; Since 2007, Police have solved&nbsp;eight cases of petrol theft and are continuing to investigate the other cases.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly, motorcycles are more prone to petrol theft as their petrol caps are exposed and if unsecured, can be removed easily.&nbsp; Every vehicle owner should take responsibility to ensure that their vehicles are properly secured.&nbsp; Petrol tanks can be protected by using fuel-locking caps, which are readily available in the market. This is a simple precaution which acts as an additional deterrent. Motorcycle owners can also cover motorcycles with canvas sheets secured by locks, which make it difficult for thieves to reach the fuel caps and siphon the petrol out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member asked why the Police have not issued an advisory to warn the public to take preventive measures against petrol thefts.&nbsp; The Police has alerted residents and vehicle owners at the affected areas through the local grassroots about such thefts and worked with relevant agencies and grassroots organisations through the Neighbourhood Watch Zone (NWZ) and the Community Safety&nbsp;and Security Programme (CSSP) in preventing and detecting such crimes.&nbsp; For example, residents in a neighbourhood may form a watch group to look out for suspicious characters at car parks.&nbsp; I am told that in Choa Chu Kang, there is an initiative where the residents and grassroots members perform regular patrols at car parks to deter and detect crimes at car parks.&nbsp; Since its implementation in April 2008, such crimes have reduced significantly.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the Police have been collaborating with the&nbsp;Town Councils since June 2006 to equip the Town Councils with mobile CCTV cameras.&nbsp; Some of these mobile CCTV systems, which are owned by the Town Councils, have been deployed at public car parks to prevent thefts from vehicles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Police advisories on petrol theft have been done at the local level and not as an island-wide crime advisory.&nbsp; This is because the thefts have occurred primarily in certain clusters.&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2917</p>The number of cases which have occurred so far is very small, considering we have about 145,000 motorcycles and scooters and about 725,000 cars and other vehicles currently registered in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Opportunistic crimes like petrol thefts can be prevented if only vehicle owners take anti-theft measures.&nbsp; The Police will do their part.

This will improve the competitiveness of the ERP payment market.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;On the non-refundable deposit for the ez-link card, the Ministry of Transport has previously explained that this is based on the cost of producing the card. To lower the deposit or make it refundable will mean that every cardholder will be subsidised. This is not desirable. Instead, assistance should be provided in a more targeted way to the needy. In this regard, the Government set up a three-year $10 million Public Transport Fund last year to help lower-income commuters cope with public transportation costs.

In 2007, there were 60 IOs in Singapore. This included major players from a variety of fields, such as the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), International Baccalaureate Organisation (IBO) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA).<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further strengthen our efforts in attracting IOs, an International Organisations Programme Office (IOPO) was established last year. IOPO is led by EDB, with MAS, MFA, STB and several other agencies as partners. The type of IOs covered by the IOPO include inter-governmental organisations, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), foundations and other philanthropic organisations, industry associations, think-tanks, social enterprises and organisations dealing with corporate social responsibility.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IOPO provides one-stop information and assistance to IOs. It also conducts marketing and outreach to promote Singapore as a premier base for IOs, and supports Singapore-based IOs to expand their regional or international operations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a range of incentives available to IOs.&nbsp; The changes announced in Budget 2007 on fund-raising and tax regulations for philanthropic organisations have helped to attract IOs. For example, all registered charities now enjoy automatic income tax exemption. For the other non-profit IOs without charity status, but who have regional or international charters that can bring economic value to Singapore, they can now apply to the IOPO for an income tax exemption for an initial period of not more than 10 years. These and other changes have been well-received. EDB also has start-up grants for qualifying IOs to build capability and undertake significant regional activities based out of Singapore. Such IOs may also qualify for support under STB&rsquo;s Business Events in Singapore scheme.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We welcome IOs and local industry associations to work with Government agencies to strengthen their organisations and the IO sector. For example, IE Singapore helps Singapore-based companies identify regional opportunities in partnership with IOs that provide assistance to developing countries, and helps IOs keep abreast of the capabilities, expertise and track record of Singapore-based companies. SPRING provides support to industry associations to develop roadmaps and development projects for our industry through its Local Enterprise and Association Development Programme (LEAD).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To date, the feedback and response from IOs is promising.&nbsp; The target is to have 150 IOs in Singapore by 2015.

But doctors now know how best to control the disease to prevent or reduce the risk of developing further complications, such as kidney failure, gangrene, blindness or even death.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The control measures are effective, only if patients are cooperative and comply with their doctors&rsquo; advice.&nbsp; In almost all cases, they would need to change their lifestyle, watch their weight, exercise more, stop smoking, take medications and attend regular medical screening. As healthcare providers, we can only provide advice and offer prescriptions; the patients must take personal responsibility and act on the advice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many are still unaware that they have diabetes as it is a silent disease in its early stage. From next week, all Singaporeans above the age of 40 will be reminded by the Health Promotion Board to go for regular screening by their family GPs.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those with abnormal results, the GPs will advise them to follow up in accordance with a structured treatment protocol. Under the protocol, the diabetic patients are monitored regularly for good blood sugar control and undergo annual eye and foot checks as well as urine tests for early kidney disease. This is supported by patient education efforts through nurse health educators. Patients can use their Medisave Accounts to help pay for the treatment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regular screening and proper disease management programme, with full compliance by patients are the key measures to help diabetic patients avoid, delay or reduce the onset of complications.</p></p></span>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:HAND, FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE--><!--END_COL_TITLE:HAND, FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE:::2924--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"></B><p align=left>Column: 2921</p></B><P>HAND, FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Preventive measures against outbreaks--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Preventive measures against outbreaks)</B></span><div><BR>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>Mdm Cynthia Phua </B>asked the Minister for Health in view of the frequent outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth disease among young children (a) whether any studies have been done to understand the pattern of these outbreaks; (b) whether there are measures that can be introduced to prevent the outbreaks; (c) why are the outbreaks becoming more frequent; (d) what are the chances of an outbreak arising from public playgrounds where the environment is not regulated; and (e) can an outbreak be caused by contamination of books in public libraries.</P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know quite a lot about the hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD).&nbsp; It is a common illness that affects infants and children worldwide. Many different viruses cause HFMD. Coxsackie A16 is the most common but Enterovirus 71 (or EV71) can also cause HFMD.&nbsp; I mention EV71 because its infection has been associated with severe complications, including death, in young children. Infection by one virus does not confer immunity to other viruses causing HFMD.&nbsp; That is why a person who has recovered from HFMD may still come down with the disease again.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In temperate countries such as Japan and Australia, HFMD outbreaks occur most often in the warmer months.&nbsp; In Singapore, HFMD occurs throughout the year but it generally peaks during school terms and decline during the school holidays.&nbsp; This suggests that <p align=left>Column: 2923</p>nurseries, childcare centres, kindergartens and primary schools are major sources of transmissions.&nbsp; Locally, EV71 has also been observed to be the predominant circulating virus every&nbsp;two to&nbsp;three years. There is no evidence to suggest that HFMD outbreaks are becoming more frequent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The disease is spread by direct contact with nasal discharge, saliva, faeces and fluid from the rash of an infected person, or with droplets from coughing or sneezing. A person who touches a contaminated surface will be exposed if he does not wash his hands properly before eating his food or touching his mouth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The virus can survive in the environment for a few days. Since children can be infectious even without symptoms, the virus can potentially be found in any public place, including playgrounds and public libraries.&nbsp; But as noted earlier, the main sources of transmissions are in childcare centres, nurseries, kindergartens and schools.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;HFMD is endemic in Singapore and it cannot be eliminated as there is as yet no vaccine. However, we can minimise its spread through maintaining continuous high standards of personal and environmental hygiene. We all can play a part to maintain good personal hygiene such as washing our hands after going to the toilets and washing our hands before we eat.&nbsp; Parents should set good personal examples and get their children to adopt these simple hygiene habits. Together, we can reduce the spread of HFMD.</p></p></span>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:CASE OF MR CHAN MUN CHIONG--><!--END_COL_TITLE:CASE OF MR CHAN MUN CHIONG:::2926--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"></B><p align=left>Column: 2923</p><B><P>CASE OF MR CHAN MUN CHIONG</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Charge under section 377A of Penal Code--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Charge under section 377A of Penal Code)</B></span><div><BR>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>Mr Siew Kum Hong </B>asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs what was the rationale for charging Mr Chan Mun Chiong under section 377A of the Penal Code in view of the Prime Minister&rsquo;s statement to Parliament last year that the provision is not proactively enforced.</P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chan Mun Chiong was convicted by a District Court under the Infectious Diseases Act (IDA) for not disclosing that he was HIV positive before engaging in sexual intercourse.

Mr Chan Mun Chiong&rsquo;s case, however, is not such a case. It is not the result of active enforcement against him in a private place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chan was investigated by the Police after a report was lodged by a 16-year old male who had oral sex with him.

Different-coloured tones of road tarmac are typically caused by the road works of various utility service agencies, such as PowerGrid Limited, PowerGas Limited, the Public Utilities Board and Singapore Telecom.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US State Department&rsquo;s assessment of Singapore as a &ldquo;Tier 2&rdquo; country in its Trafficking-in-Persons (TIP) Report 2008 (&ldquo;the Report&rdquo;) means that in their view, we do not meet the &ldquo;minimum standards&rdquo; of the U.S. Trafficking Victims Protection Act 2000, but that we are making &ldquo;significant efforts&rdquo; to meet those minimum standards.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum standards prescribed under the U.S. Act are as follows:</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) The government of the country should prohibit severe forms of trafficking in persons and punish acts of such trafficking.</p><p align=left>Column: 2931</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) For the knowing commission of any act of sex trafficking involving force, fraud, coercion, or where the victim of sex trafficking is a child incapable of giving meaningful consent, or of trafficking which includes rape or kidnapping or which causes a death, the government of the country should prescribe punishment commensurate with that for grave crimes, such as forcible sexual assault.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) For the knowing commission of any act of a severe form of trafficking in persons, the government of the country should prescribe punishment that is sufficiently stringent to deter and that adequately reflects the heinous nature of the offence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) The government of the country should make serious and sustained efforts to eliminate severe forms of trafficking in persons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not share the view of the US State Department and its classification of Singapore.&nbsp; Our laws are tough but fair and our approach to crime has been uncompromising.&nbsp; This applies as much to human trafficking as it does to any other crime.&nbsp; In addition, we have an effective law enforcement regime with high rates of successful prosecution.&nbsp; Tough laws and a competent law enforcement regime have resulted in low crime rates and a high level of community safety and security.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our approach to human trafficking is not different from how we deal with crime in general.&nbsp; We have in place laws which criminalise the different aspects of sex trafficking, among which are the offences of forced prostitution and using false pretences to bring a woman into the country for prostitution, under sections 140(1)(c) and 142 of the Women's Charter, and under section 373A of the Penal Code.&nbsp; The Children and Young Persons Act specifically prohibits trafficking in children.&nbsp; Indeed, Singapore takes sexual exploitation very seriously.&nbsp; As noted by the Report, we have extended our laws to criminalise prostitution involving a minor under the age of 18, extended extra-territorial jurisdiction over Singapore citizens and permanent residents who purchase or solicit sexual services from minors overseas, and make organising or promoting child sex tours a criminal offence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In relation to the protection of Foreign Domestic Workers (FDWs), we have stringent laws which are actively enforced.&nbsp; As is well known, employers who abuse their FDWs are prosecuted, and we have prescribed a more severe maximum punishment of one and a half times the norm for acts of assault against domestic workers.&nbsp; Non-payment of salary is also punishable under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Punishments for human trafficking under our laws are severe and sufficiently deterrent.&nbsp; For example:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;Women's Charter, section 141 (trafficking in women and girls)&nbsp;&ndash; up to&nbsp;five years' imprisonment and fine;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;Women's Charter, section 140 (forcing a woman or girl into prostitution)&nbsp;&ndash; up to&nbsp;five years' imprisonment and fine;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;Penal Code, section 373A (bringing a woman into or out of Singapore by fraudulent or deceitful means for the purposes of prostitution)&nbsp;&ndash; up to 10 years' imprisonment and fine;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2933</p><p>&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;Penal Code, sections 372 and 373 (selling or buying a person under the age of 21 for prostitution)&nbsp;&ndash; up to 10 years' imprisonment and fine.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We make a committed effort to detect and punish acts of trafficking.&nbsp; When a sex trafficking case is reported or when a foreign sex worker is arrested, Police interviews the woman at length to establish if any criminal offences were committed.&nbsp; If any offences are detected, action will be taken to bring the perpetrators to justice.&nbsp; Police also leverages on intelligence sources, and does not depend only on the willingness of the sex worker to lodge a report if she has been victimised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another key focus of the Report is our treatment of Foreign Domestic Workers working in Singapore.&nbsp; Every FDW enters Singapore voluntarily via proper channels and is issued with a work permit.&nbsp; They should therefore not be included in a report on human trafficking.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this, we have many measures in place to protect FDWs against exploitation.&nbsp; Prior to the issuance of the work permit, a new FDW attends a Safety Awareness Course and sits for an entry test without the presence of both her employment agent and employer.&nbsp; The course not only educates the FDW on safety issues and rights which safeguard her well-being, but also informs her of available avenues through which she can raise concerns and problems.&nbsp; FDWs are informed of a toll-free FDW helpline manned by Ministry of Manpower (MOM) officers, and given feedback forms in prepaid envelopes to surface any problems they may encounter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOM also conducts random interviews with FDWs working for the first time in Singapore during their initial months of employment.&nbsp; These one-on-one interviews allow MOM to determine if the FDWs have adapted to the work environment in Singapore and serve as an additional avenue for FDWs to raise any concerns which they might have.&nbsp; There are therefore ample opportunities for a FDW to contact the authorities if she is forced, deceived or coerced into employment against her will before and after she starts work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;</I> &nbsp;&nbsp;We do not agree with certain observations made in the Report on Singapore.&nbsp; It alleges that Singapore is a destination country for women and girls &ldquo;trafficked&rdquo; for the purpose of labour and commercial sexual exploitation, and alleges that women from India, Thailand, the Philippines and the People&rsquo;s Republic of China who travel to Singapore voluntarily for prostitution or work are subsequently deceived or coerced into sexual servitude.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a gross distortion of reality.&nbsp; Our investigations have revealed very few cases of forced servitude.&nbsp; In cases where force, coercion or deception is found, the offenders will be punished through our criminal laws.&nbsp; The evidence does not show that sex workers are forced or deceived to work as prostitutes in Singapore.&nbsp; Many indeed come here for economic reasons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Report also states that a &ldquo;significant number&rdquo; of FDWs in Singapore face physical or sexual abuse.&nbsp; This is again a distortion of the realities on the ground.&nbsp; Under Singapore law, it is an offence for employers or employment agencies to withhold the FDWs&rsquo; passports against their wishes.&nbsp; Wrongful confinement of FDWs is also a serious offence under the Penal Code.&nbsp; NGOs and Embassies are also aware of the laws that have been put in place to address any complaints and are encouraged to persuade those subjected to abuse to report their abusers to the authorities for further action.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every report of a FDW who is physically or sexually abused is taken seriously and thoroughly investigated.&nbsp; No effort is spared to bring the offender to justice.&nbsp; The number <p align=left>Column: 2935</p>of substantiated FDW abuse cases handled by the Police fell from 157 cases in 1997 to 68 cases in 2007, in spite of an increasing FDW population.&nbsp; From 2001 to 2007, 28 employers, spouses or household members were jailed for FDW abuses.&nbsp; From 2004 to 2007, MOM successfully prosecuted a total of 13 errant employers for failing to pay wages due to their FDWs, 5 of whom were eventually jailed.&nbsp; Over the same period, MOM also revoked the licences of 10 employment agencies and did not renew the licences of 18 others.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instances of FDW abuse are not widespread.&nbsp; The frequency of abuse should be seen in the context of the total number of FDWs in Singapore, some 180,000 as of 2007.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In terms of enforcement of laws, the Report also alleges that we have not prosecuted or convicted any trafficking offenders during the reporting period.&nbsp; It wrongly assumes therefore that we have not been serious about enforcing our laws against trafficking.&nbsp; This is a rather strange indicator to use.&nbsp; Drug abuse rates in cities of the same size as Singapore&nbsp;are very much higher.&nbsp; If we record fewer arrests made against drug abusers and traffickers this year, would that mean that we are not serious enough about enforcing our tough laws against drugs?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From 2005 to 2007, 35, 33 and 28 cases of human trafficking respectively were reported to the Police.&nbsp; Upon further investigation, however, none of these cases was substantiated trafficking cases, although one case reported in December 2007 is currently under investigation.&nbsp; In Singapore, we investigate and prosecute any person who commits an offence but we cannot obviously &ldquo;arrange&rdquo; for prosecution numbers to go up without evidence or basis just so that we can get a better rating from the US State Department.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are aware that some foreign workers take large loans or are made promises of high salaries by labour agents which are later not kept, but these situations mainly arise in their home countries and cannot be effectively regulated by receiving countries.&nbsp; Singapore therefore supports the principle of balanced responsibilities between labour-sending and receiving countries to tackle the problems faced by migrant workers.&nbsp; At the same time, MOM is committed to addressing the issue within Singapore&rsquo;s jurisdiction, and has rolled out a number of initiatives.&nbsp; For example, employers are prohibited under the Work Permit conditions from recovering employment-related expenses such as the levy and security bond from their FDWs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore will continue to work closely with the Embassies of the respective labour-sending countries to ensure that the interests of FDWs are protected during their stay in Singapore.&nbsp; Collaborative efforts include regular coordination meetings as well as the dissemination of information and collateral through the Embassy.&nbsp; Reports of isolated cases of abuse should not obscure the fact that the majority of foreign workers in Singapore are reasonably well-treated.&nbsp; In a survey conducted by the Feedback Unit in April 2006, 90% of all FDWs said that they were happy with their employment in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning to the protection of trafficking victims, the Report criticises the Singapore Government for not directly operating victim shelters but instead referring potential victims of trafficking to foreign embassies or shelters operated by NGOs.&nbsp; This criticism is misguided and shows a lack of understanding of local conditions.&nbsp; Social services in Singapore are delivered by Voluntary Welfare Organisations working in partnership with, and usually subsidised by, the Government.&nbsp; This &ldquo;Many Helping Hands&rdquo; approach to <p align=left>Column: 2937</p>social service delivery empowers committed individuals and dedicated agencies on the ground to provide swift and comprehensive intervention.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government ensures that the protocols are in place and that all staff of these agencies are trained to discharge their respective roles.&nbsp; We also provide funding for all victims referred to NGO shelters as well as financial support for ad-hoc refurbishment projects.&nbsp; This funding model ensures that the NGOs are always able to assist with the maintenance and upkeep of each referred person.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, the Report states that Singapore does not provide trafficking victims with a legal alternative to removal to countries where they may face hardship or retribution.&nbsp; This is again untrue.&nbsp; MOM generally allows foreigners who are under investigation for illegal employment to work in Singapore under MOM's Temporary Job Scheme during the period of investigation, subject to the prevailing work pass requirements.&nbsp; Thereafter, if the foreigner is found not to be culpable of an offence (for example, where he was deceived into believing that he was working legally), he will be allowed to continue working in Singapore if he wishes to do so provided he meets the prevailing work pass requirements.&nbsp; All complaints of abuse are referred to the Police.&nbsp; MOM and Police will then work closely with the NGOs and respective Embassies to assist these workers to ensure that their basic needs are taken care of.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Any negative perception arising from our classification as a &ldquo;Tier 2&rdquo; country is unjustified.&nbsp; Singapore is committed to ensuring that we are not a destination for human traffickers.&nbsp; We have in place robust laws and processes to achieve this.&nbsp; We have a committed and competent law enforcement system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has often been criticised for being too tough in law enforcement.&nbsp; To be criticised instead for being too soft in the US State Department&rsquo;s TIP Report is strange indeed.&nbsp; Our Police will, of course, continue to work against trafficking as they do against all crimes.&nbsp; They are answerable to the Singapore people who will judge how they perform.&nbsp; In this regard, it is fortunate that the public at least is better informed and has a better understanding of the realities on the ground and can separate fair fact from unfair conjecture.</p></p></span>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

There is, hence, a need to increase the supply of EAS services to meet the specific needs of the users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SCDF emergency ambulances and crew are costly and highly geared resources designed to handle not only EAS cases but also extreme crises, including biological and chemical terrorist incidents.&nbsp; For 2007, almost 60% of all EAS calls were non-critical medical cases, which do not require the high competency level of SCDF&rsquo;s EAS.&nbsp; The outsourcing of such cases to competent private providers is, hence, a viable option without compromising service delivery.&nbsp; These private providers will be managed by SCDF and augment its current fleet to meet the rapid rise in demand for ambulance services.&nbsp; By providing a calibrated service, they will help keep costs manageable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interested operators will be put through a rigorous and stringent selection process.&nbsp; Private providers selected to augment SCDF&rsquo;s fleet will also be required to retrofit ambulances and hire crew according to almost similar specifications as per SCDF ambulances and crew.&nbsp; The standards required to be met by private ambulance operators are currently being reviewed jointly by MOH and SCDF, and the revised guidelines will ensure that all ambulances and crew will be equipped to handle medical emergencies for which they are despatched.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selected private operators will also be required to meet the same performance standard of reaching the incident site within 11 minutes, 80% of the time.&nbsp; Their ambulances and crew would also be subjected to regular stringent audits as is practised today for SCDF.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help ensure a steady pool of proficient fresh hires, SCDF collaborated with the Institute of Education (ITE) in 2007 on a 3-year dual certification programme in Nursing as <p align=left>Column: 2941</p>well as Paramedic and Emergency Care.&nbsp; The first cohort is expected to graduate in 2009.&nbsp; The Civil Defence Academy will also provide training to operators to ensure that they are able to meet the required standards.</p></p></span>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE PRACTITIONERS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE PRACTITIONERS:::2942--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"></B><p align=left>Column: 2941</p><B><P>TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE PRACTITIONERS</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Complaints of professional misconduct or negligence--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Complaints of professional misconduct or negligence)</B></span><div><BR>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Dr Fatimah Lateef--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>Dr Fatimah Lateef </B>asked the Minister for Health since the establishment of the TCM Practitioners Board in 2001, (a) whether there have been more complaints pertaining to professional misconduct or negligence; and (b) whether the current number of registered practitioners is as expected or does it fall short of expectations.</P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The TCM Practitioners Board was established in 2001 to regulate and register TCM practitioners.&nbsp; The transitional period for the registration of TCM practitioners ended on 31st December 2003.&nbsp; From 1st January 2004, only those who are registered with the Board can practise TCM.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From 2004 to 2007, the Board received a total of 55 complaints: 19 (2004), 9 (2005), 17 (2006) and 10 (2007).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were currently 2,232 TCM practitioners registered with the Board, a significant increase from 1,910 in 2004.
