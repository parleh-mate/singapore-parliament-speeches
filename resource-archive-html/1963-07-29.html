<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have had a message that the Prime

Minister may be a few minutes late.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of Questions, there is a Standing

Order  which  provides for a  contingency  of  that

nature. It is Standing Order 20 (3):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If a Minister [I am reading the relevant portion]

who  is  to  answer  a  question,  is  absent,  the

question  shall,  if he then be present,  be  taken

after  all  other questions appearing on the  Order

Paper have been disposed of.'



<br><br>If by then the Prime Minister is not present, there

are  other  provisions in the Standing Order  which

will apply.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> On a

point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir,I have been asked

by the Prime Minister to reply to Question No. 4.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will then call Question No. 4. Mr Tan Cheng Tong.





<div align="center"><b>LONDON TALKS (1963) (Expenditure from Government funds on Government officers and Prime Minister's wife)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b> asked the Prime Minister

what is the total expenditure from Government funds

on  the Government officers who attended the recent

London talks; and whether the expenses or any  part

thereof of his wife during her stay in London  were

met out of such funds.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee (for the Prime Minister):</b> The

expenditure  incurred on bills so far received  for

air  passages  and  other  expenditure  amounts  to

$44,808.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lee Kuan Yew's travelling and other expenditure was on the Prime Minister's personal account. It is not borne by the Government.

<div align="center"><b>HAWKERS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Number arrested and amount of fines collected from 3rd June, 1959, to 31st July, 1961, and from 1st August, 1961, to 30th June, 1963)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b> asked the Minister for

Health  and  Law  how  many hawkers  were  arrested

during  the  periods (a)  3rd June,  1959,  to  31st

July, 1961, and (b)  1st August, 1961, to 30th June,

1963;  and  what  was  the total  amount  of  fines

collected from the hawkers during each period.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. M. Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the period

between  3rd  June, 1959 and 31st July,  1961,  493

hawkers were summoned before the police courts  for

hawking offences and the total of the fines imposed

by the courts was $4,140.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this period, no sort of positive action

was  taken  to  help  the hawkers,  and  conditions

became  chaotic especially in congested  areas  and

around  the  markets and street-corners,  with  the

result  that market stallholders left their  stalls

in the markets and shop-keepers left their shops to

compete  with the hawkers outside the  markets  and

shops and in street-corners. In this situation of a

free-for-all  which did not serve the  interest  of

the  hawkers themselves, the Hawkers Department was

too  afraid to discharge their normal duties to the

hawkers and to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the period 1st August 1961, to 30th June,

1963, 3,214 hawkers were summoned before the police

courts  for hawking offences and the total  of  the

fines imposed by the courts was $33,763.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the second period under reference, a new

policy  for  the resiting of hawkers on alternative

sites  off the main roads and markets was  adopted.

The  new  sites  they occupy are  chosen  in  close

proximity  to the places from where they  had  been

removed  so  as to ensure the least dislocation  to

their  business. Every hawker who is to be  removed

from  a clearance site is registered and is assured

of  a place in the new site. The places in the  new

sites are drawn for in a ballot held in public. The

sites  are  properly marked out and laid  out  with

standpipes to facilitate daily cleansing. Bins  are

also provided at such sites.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hawkers were also, in this second period,

for the first time, given a proprietary interest in

the  sites they occupied which they could  transfer

to  others for a consideration when they decided to

give   up   their  business  or  which   could   be

transferred  to members of their family  when  they

die.  Previously in such circumstances, their sites

were  declared  to  be vacant  and  were  given  to

newcomers on the results of a ballot. Under the new

system,   all  opportunities  for  graft   in   the

allocation  of pitches and hawker sites  have  been

eliminated,  as the hawker himself  gets  the  best

price  for  his site and his family gets  the  site

when  he  dies. Under the present system also,  the

hawker who actually does the business on a site  is

licensed  and  if  subletting  is  discovered,  the

person actually doing the business gets the licence

transferred to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing Board has also embarked on a very

enlightened  policy of building hawker  pitches  in

the Board's estates which are rented to the hawkers

on   small  instalments  to  cover  their  cost  of

construction over a period of three years and which

become the property of the hawker at the end of the

period.  Thereafter, the hawker only pays a nominal

rent of $1 per month for the site which is his  and

which he can transfer to others for a consideration

or which passes to his family when he dies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in furtherance of the scheme for a

fair  deal  for hawkers, they have been allowed  to

ply their trade in various parts of the city and in

the rural areas at nights and in selected locations

once a week where their presence does not cause any

traffic obstruction and where they can find a ready

market for their goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a result of the enlightened policy

followed in regard to hawkers in the second period,

the   hawker  situation  in  the  town  has   shown

considerable  improvement. The  Government  regrets

the  need for enforcing the law on hawking but this

action has had to be taken in the interests of both

the hawkers themselves and the public and has been

reduced to the very minimum. Where new hawkers come

to  sites  where hawkers have been resited,  action

has obviously to be taken against them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>



otherwise  there  would be no point  in  proceeding

with resiting schemes. Also where hawkers ply their

trade at street-corners or on streets which because

of  the  heavy traffic are restricted  to  hawkers,

action  has  obviously  to be  taken  to  keep  the

streets free for traffic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with the new deal that the Government has given

to the hawkers, the Government has been able to get

their  co-operation in keeping the city clean.  The

hawkers  themselves understand that if the  law  is

not  enforced  in a fair and reasonable  manner,  a

free-for-all situation develops which does  not  in

the long run serve their own interests.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I would like to understand why  there

is  a great difference between the fines imposed in

one  period and those imposed in the other  period.

In  the  period  between 3rd June, 1959,  and  31st

July, 1961, the fines were less than those for  the

period  between  1st August, 1961, and  30th  June,

1963. The time lapse between the two periods is not

very   great.  Why  is  there  also  such  a  great

difference in the number of hawkers arrested during

the two respective periods? It may be an indication

that after 31st July, 1961, the Government did  not

look after the interest of the hawkers well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, have already answered

the  question. I have told the House  that  in  the

first  period there was no attempt made to  try  to

contain the hawker situation. A genuine attempt was

made in the second period referred to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the second period, I can assure you that the Member for Bras Basah, who is closer to the hawkers than the Member for Jalan Kayu, who is the son of a rich landowner in Singapore, was a member of the Hawkers Committee, and endorsed this policy as being in the interests

of  the  public as well as in the interests of  the

hawkers themselves.

<div align="center"><b>(Expenses of Mr C. V. Devan Nair)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b> asked the Minister for

Labour  whether he has any information  as  to  who

paid  for the expenses of Mr C. V. Devan Nair when

he   attended   the  recent  International   Labour

as the workers' representative.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

did they go to other places in addition to Geneva?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That supplementary question does not

arise out of the original question. If the Minister

chooses  to  answer, he can do so  if  he  has  the

information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b> indicated dissent.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The question is out of order on

<div align="center"><b>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN SINGAPORE AFTER MALAYSIA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Prime Minister)</b></div>



<br><br>2.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, whilst I

was  in  London  I was approached  by  the  British

Council of Churches about the question of religious

freedom  in  Singapore  after  Malaysia.  It  would

appear that there was some misunderstanding and not

unnatural concern regarding religious liberty after

Malaysia.   I  therefore  undertook   to   make   a

declaration  on religious freedom on my  return  to

Singapore in this Assembly. It has always been  the

policy  of  the  Government of Singapore  to  allow

freedom of all religions in Singapore, and I gladly

give the assurance that we will continue the policy

of religious toleration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of other religions than the Muslims will

appreciate that the Singapore (Constitution)  Order

in  Council,  1958, makes it the responsibility  of

the  Government of Singapore to protect, safeguard,

support,   foster,  and  promote   the   political,

educational,   religious,  economic,   social   and

cultural    interests   of   the    Malays.    This

responsibility will remain after Malaysia  Day,  as

it  will be included in the Singapore Constitution.

However,  the  over-riding safeguard for  religious

freedom is contained in Article



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>



11 of the Federal Constitution, which provides that

every  person has the right to profess and practise

his  religion,  it is the policy of  the  Singapore

Government  to  maintain  the  status  quo  in  all

matters of religious freedom, in other words, there

will be no change after Malaysia. Article 11(4)   of

the  Federal  Constitution does give power  to  the

State to control or restrict the propagation of any

religious   doctrine  or  belief  amongst   persons

professing  the Muslim religion. And Article  11(1)

of  the  Constitution provides that  the  right  to

propagate  the  religion shall be subject  to  this

power.  The  power will be exercised by  the  State

Government  and  the  provisions  of  the   Federal

Constitution  in  this  matter  cannot  be  amended

without the consent of the Singapore Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not possible for me to bind all future

governments in Singapore, but I give the  assurance

that  it  is not the intention of my Government  to

introduce  legislation to control or  restrict  the

propagation  of any religious doctrine  or  belief,

and   the  present  position  in  all  matters   of

religious liberty will continue.

dishonourable  conduct and abuse  of  privilege  in

<br><br>2.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I must apologise to Members  of  the

House  in  not being able to present  them  with  a

final  version of the Malaysia Bill even  right  up

till  now.  I  discussed the matter with  you,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, on Saturday and decided that  rather

than wait for more further amendments to be put  in

which  will  delay the debate, we would  table  the

Malaysia   Bill   as  it  is  and   introduce   the

amendments. I hope, in the course of the debate but

certainly  before  adoption  by  this  House.   The

position is as follows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members who have read the exchange of letters will

be  aware  that there were certain changes conceded

and  agreed  to on the 8th July, the  day  when  we

signed  or  initialled the Agreement in London.  In

several cases, as in the case of one document which

was  signed by the Prime Minister of the Federation

of  Malaya, it was not agreed to till 9.15  on  the

evening  when we signed the Agreement.  That,  Sir,

has provided certain drafting problems. I have been

busy  this  morning with the State Advocate-General

who   is   in  constant  communication   with   his

counterpart  in  the  Federation.  I   would   have

preferred to have all these amendments included  in

the  document  presented,  but  I  think  time   is

pressing and I have undertaken to introduce



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



the  amendments before the provisions  are  adopted

and then to produce a clean copy of the final Bill.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Hon. the Prime

Minister mentioned the date as "8th July" when  the

Agreement was initialled.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have been a bit puzzled about this

date   because  the  Agreement  itself,  which   is

contained in Paper Cmd. 22 of 1963, gives the  date

as "9th July".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, there was some

difficulty about that. We foregathered at  about  a

quarter to twelve. After 9.15 when we agreed at the

Ritz,  quite appropriately. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the

Prime Minister of the Federation took us all out to

dinner  to  a  place called the  Omar  Khayaam.  We

foregathered at Marlborough House at 11.30 and  did

not  get  down to business until 11.45.  I  am  not

quite  sure  at  what exact time I  initialled  the

Agreement, but I think there was some jesting  with

some  of the participants of that Conference as  to

the date of it, because when the last signature was

appended,  the clock had moved on to  Tuesday,  the

9th of July. I think, for purposes of propriety, as

far  as  I was concerned, it, was the 8th of July,.

hut if the document says "9th of July", then so  be

it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Then will the Prime Minister

agree  to  a typographical amendment to his  motion

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- instead of "8th July", it will be "9th July"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, surely, Mr Speaker, Sir.

I am not quite sure when the Agreement was made - I

mean   the  exact  time  when  everybody  put   his

signature to it - but I think it might be safer if we

said it was the 9th of July.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments that will be introduced - I hope some

tomorrow or some this afternoon, and some  the  day

after  - are  of  two  types. One  is  purely  legal

draftsmanship.   The   legal   draftsman   of   the

Federation  Government, who has been seconded  from

the   British   Treasury,  has  suggested   certain

improvements in the syntax and phraseology of  some

of  the Articles of the Constitution. There are  no

substantial amendments, and I think the House  will

not  wish  to quibble if the Federation  wishes  to

take their draftsman's advice on these matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are several other amendments of

substance.  We  managed to have one  put  into  the

Bill.  Members  will  note that  when  the  general

elections for 51 seats take place - it will  be  any

time  between  now  and  three  months  after  31st

December, depending on the will of Members  of  the

Opposition   - the   position  of   candidates   and

Assemblymen  will no longer be quite the  same.  If

those  who  are elected on the party  platform  and

bear  the party symbol break faith with the  Party,

either by resigning or by being expelled, then they

automatically vacate their seats in this  Assembly.

In  other  words,  there will be  no  more  musical

chairs  in  this Chamber. The next election  is  an

election  to decide who is to govern for  the  next

five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two other important amendments. One,

Members  will notice, is contained in  a  letter  I

wrote  to the Tunku, enclosing a document he signed

in  which  it  has been agreed that  the  power  to

detain  gangsters  even after merger  and  Malaysia

will rest with the Singapore Government. This is  a

matter  of  some  importance,  Mr  Speaker,   Sir,

particularly  as we know that in certain  parts  of

the  country  and certainly before 1959,  gangsters

played an important role



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



in  elections. Well, I am afraid they will  not  be

able  to  do  so  at  the next  general  elections,

whether  it  be before merger or after merger.  The

power,  the executive authority, under the Criminal

Law  (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance,  rests  with

the Singapore Government. I think it is to the good

of  the peace and good order of this country. I  am

sorry  some  Members  on the other  side  may  have

friends  who  were in Pulau Senang, but  they  will

remain in custody. This is a matter of sufficiently

grave  importance for it is to be  carefully  spelt

out in the Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is the question of migration control. Under

the  Constitution  we  have  afforded  the  Central

Government  authority to prevent  specific  persons

under  the Restriction of Residence Ordinance  from

staying  in  a  particular  part  of  the  country.

Members will remember how one Said Zahari came back

to  Singapore and suddenly found the ban across the

causeway. He then resided in Singapore and added to

the mischief that was then going on. Well, I think,

in fairness, we should have a reciprocal right that

we shall have no more Fong Swee Suans, or, for that

matter,  Lim  Ching  Siong, whose  family  is  from

Pontian  and who will be proved ultimately to  have

come from Pontian; James Puthucheary, Mr Woodhull.

Mr  James  Puthucheary was a political  friend  of

mine,  now  he is only a friend. I do not  see  why

they  should add mischief to Singapore. There  will

be  reciprocity. In other words, we will  keep  our

bad  hats in Singapore if the Federation Government

so  wills it, and we will have the right to request

the    Federation   Government   to   keep    their

undesirables on the other side of the causeway.  In

this  way, I am quite sure Singapore will become  a

much more peaceful and salubrious place. This power

extends  not  only  to political undesirables,  but

also to secret society undesirables. It may be, Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  that  just  before  the  election,

whether  it  is  held between now or  three  months

after the end of the year, trainloads of young men,

whose political skill Consists of the bicycle chain

and  the knuckle duster, will come from places like

Ipoh, Penang and other parts of Malaya, where they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>



do not have the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions)

Ordinance to detain them. Members will notice  that

every time there is an election in a town, there is

always  an  anguished plea for  fair  play  by  the

Opposition.  I  leave Members  to  draw  their  own

conclusions.  But I say, first of all,  we  do  not

want these gentlemen to come here either before  or

during  an  election. I know of several bus  owners

whose  business ramifications spread over the  rest

of Malaya and who, I am quite sure, will be able to

provide  quite  a  number  of  cohorts  for   these

matters.  Youth  leaders, the Youth  League,  first

they  cannot  come here because we  will  have  the

right to ask the Federation Government not to allow

them entry; secondly, if they do slip by, they will

be  detained  under  the  Criminal  Law  (Temporary

Provisions)  Ordinance.  Insofar  as   is   humanly

possible, we will try to keep Singapore the  clean,

sober and reasonable city that it always has been.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons. Mr Speaker, Sir, it was not

possible  to give Members the Malaysia  Bill  until

sometime, I think, yesterday morning -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> This is for the record. The paper

arrived here at 9.15 a.m. We started to despatch at 10.30  a.m. and  it  took the whole  day  until  7 o'clock in the evening.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Well, I apologise for it, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,I do not think it is the  Government

Printer's fault. He had 500 pages of electroplating

to  do,  the Rueff Report, the Malaysia  Bill,  the

various  financial  papers  and  the  exchange   of

documents. I think, in all fairness, Members should

read the Malaysia Bill before the debate commences.

I  read  in  the  newspapers, that the  Member  for

Anson,  who was not present, said he had  read  the

Malaysia Bill. He had bought a copy from London and

had ordered hundreds of them for the Press. Well, I

am  sorry  he  has done so, because I  think  these

copies will be a little bit out of date. They  will

need  a  lot of corrigenda. By tomorrow I hope  the

drafting amendments will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



in,  and  the  gist, if not the final form,  of  at

least   two   of   these  important  constitutional

provisions.  Therefore,  I propose  under  Standing

Order 33 (2)  (b)  to name tomorrow 2.30 p.m. as  the

date  for  the commencement of the debate.  In  the

meanwhile,  if  my  Office or the  State  Advocate-General's Chambers can be of any use to Members  on

the  other side who are genuinely interested in the

Constitution, we shall give whatever explanation is

required.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The motion will be before the House

tomorrow.  Now I take it the Leader  of  the  House

will move the adjournment?





<br><br>3.09 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker, I move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE OF THE PORT WORKERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> The Public of

Singapore  must have been amazed at the  manner  in

which  the Prime Minister has tried to bring peace,

as  he  says,  to  the port workers.  Members  will

recollect  that  as early as March this  year,  the

public  was  treated to the wonderful spectacle  of

the  Chairman of the Harbour Board instructing  the

police to go and nail up the premises of the  Staff

Association,  and  then a few hours  later  of  the

Prime  Minister  saying that he was horrified,  and

that  he had instructed the Chairman of the Harbour

Board not to do such naughty things. All this  sort

of  play-acting really brings the P.A.P nowhere. It

just  makes people laugh. Here was the Chairman  of

the Harbour Board, a Permanent Secretary, doing the

thing  which  he  thought was what  the  Government

wanted, and here was the Prime Minister saying that

the  Chairman  of the Harbour Board should  not  do

such  a  naughty thing. That was the start  of  the

tussle for power between the P.A.P. and the Barisan

Sosialis  for  the Harbour Board Staff Association:

between,  as they would like it to be described  in

more trade union terms, the N.T.U.C. and S.A.T.U.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in May, as the matter could not be settled

amicably,  the  Prime Minister, who  had  been  the

legal  adviser to the Singapore Harbour Board Staff

Association  for  many, many  years  in  the  past,

called  a  meeting  of  the  two  factions  in  the

Singapore Harbour Board Staff Association. He tried - he  really  did - to bring peace. He told these  two

factions  that  they should go back,  talk  matters

over,  and come to some decision whereby they could

protect the interests of the workers. But, and this

is  what  he  warned them, they  should  not  allow

themselves to be made use of by pro-Communists  who

were  just around the corner trying to cash  in  on

the situation in an endeavour to damage Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it really tickled me. I have been in the

Legislative  Council since 1948,  and  the  British

colonial  government, whenever they  met  with  any

trouble  from  the  trade unions,  always  smelt  a

Communist  behind  every  tree.  "Ha,  this  is   a

Communist  trade  union.  Ha,  so  and  so   is   a

Communist."  And the Prime Minister, who  was  with

that  union  for many, many years  and  who,  as  a

result  of  the  support given by that  union,  won

resoundingly  in  the Tanjong Pagar  election,  the

Tanjong  Pagar by-election, and yet another Tanjong

Pagar election, and was carried on the shoulders of

Jamit  Singh as a great victor - and now poor  Jamit

Singh  is under detention by the same man  whom  he

chaired -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> By your friend, the Tunku.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - now smells a Communist behind

every tree. Their boys have just found out that the

Singapore Harbour Board Staff Association,  because

the  P.A.P. have found difficulty  in  controlling

them to their way of thinking, are now getting into

the hands of the Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two factions, as I have said, went back and I

do  not know what they did; whether they did try to

resolve  their differences; but it would seem  that

they  could not resolve their differences.  In  May

the  Prime Minister found it difficult to drum some

sense  into the group of trade unionists who  would

not follow



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



the  P.A.P. party line. He gave  them  a  sort  of

ultimatum, "Unless you boys behave, you watch out!"

Although  he did not use the same memorable  phrase - "I  can fix you, but you cannot fix me!" - it meant

the same thing. "You boys watch out!" He told these

two  groups and I do not know whether they did  try

to  resolve  their differences. But it  would  seem

that  things have gone from bad to worse. The Prime

Minister  thought that something must  be  done  to

teach these boys, who would not listen to the great

words  of  wisdom  of the Prime Minister,  a  much-needed lesson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trouble between the two groups was not

resolved. But then the one group that did  not  owe

allegiance  to the P.A.P. decided that they  should

give  an  ultimatum to the Harbour  Board  to  have

their demands finalised within a certain period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That really got the Prime Minister wild. He went

to  the  Harbour Board, and with the P.A.P. radio,

P.A.P. television,  and  P.A.P. newspapers   too

showing  pictures, it would seem  that  there  were

10,000  workers,  with mouths  opened  and  gaping,

listening  to  the words of wisdom from  the  Prime

Minister.  At that meeting, he said, "Boys,  better

watch out. If you go on strike, the strike will  be

called off within two days." I do not know what  he

meant  by  that. Obviously if there  was  to  be  a

strike, the Government would take action and put an

end  to  it. And this came from the Prime  Minister

whose   political  strength  came  from  the  trade

unions. A man who fought me when I was there  - thou

shalt not do this; thou shalt not do that - is doing

the  things that he told me that I should  not  do.

Times  change, temperaments change, and even  ideas

change.  I  cannot blame the Prime Minister  if  he

feels that he should now do the things that he said

I  should not do. So he said he addressed  the  big

meeting of 10,000 workers. I am not so uncharitable

as  to  suggest that the gates were closed and  the

people were shepherded there, that even some of the

people  who  listened to him  were  from  the  Work

Brigade  and  they were not members of the  Harbour

Board.   Let  it  be.  There  were  10,000   people

listening.  But  this is what  the  Prime  Minister

said,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>



"You boys. Do not listen to all this. Do not go  on

strike,  if the strike is not over in two  days,  I

know who they are. These 300 or 500 people will  be

in  trouble. But if you behave, I shall give you an

interim award." Where is the Harbour Board?  Is  it

an  autonomous  body or is it not, with  the  Prime

Minister  saying.  "I  shall give  you  an  interim

award."?  He said so on Tuesday, "I shall  give  an

interim  award." The boys raised their  hands.  Who

does  not want money? Cheers. "Hurray, great  Prime

Minister.  I  am  going to  get  an  ang  pau."  So

everybody  raised  his hands. So the  photographers

who  were there when the people raised their  hands

snapped the picture, and it came out with everybody

raising  his hands for the great ang pau  from  the

Prime  Minister who, at that particular  time,  was

the  Chairman and members of the Singapore  Harbour

Board  all rolled into one. That was what the Prime

Minister was when he announced that. Then  he  came

and  said, "I do not think there will be  a  strike

because  I believe in the good sense of the workers

of the Harbour Board."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything went on nicely for two or three days.

Suddenly he found that this troublesome group, as a

result  of  evil  machinations of  the  Member  for

Thomson, still would not bow down to him. They were

trying  to call a meeting, trying to take a  ballot

of  the  port workers as to whether a strike should

take  place or not. The Prime Minister had  another

meeting.  "Boys, boys, look at this. Do not  listen

to all this. I give you a Malaysia bonus." Malaysia

bonus!  The Prime Minister giving a Malaysia bonus!

"I  have  deregistered the Singapore Harbour  Board

Staff  Association." Sir, everything  is  "I".  The

great Prime Minister! Where is the body that is  to

consider whether this interim award should be given

or  not?  Is  not  the Singapore Harbour  Board  an

autonomous body? The Minister who is to say whether

a  trade union is to be deregistered or not is  the

Minister  for  Labour.  But  here  was  the   Prime

Minister who says. "I - I - I." Everything  is  "I".

Even in London -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He says no.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - it was "I". He is also the

Minister for Finance! He said, "I will give  you  a

Malaysia  award." If I were uncharitable,  I  would

say.  "Ah, the Prime Minister is giving a  Malaysia

award  because of elections, is it not?" If I  were

to  think  along  those lines, I would  say  it  is

nothing but political corruption. I do not want  to

think  in that way. The Prime Minister can do  what

he  thinks  is good for him. I only hope  that  the

people of Singapore, particularly the port workers,

will not be so foolish as to accept this sweet  and

think  that all the evil that the P.A.P. has  done

for  the  past  four years should be forgotten  and

forgiven.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what makes matters worse in the industrial

field in Singapore today is this, Sir. Here was the

Prime Minister saying that he was giving a Malaysia

award.  He is now giving ideas to the trade  unions

so  that they will be going to their employers  and

saying,  "Ah, Malaysia is coming. I want a Malaysia

ang pau."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And why not?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> So much so that the Prime

Minister if he would say, as far as I could  gather

from  the port workers, that the Malaysia award  is

postponed, "Tahan sekejap. Not so fast." It has not

been  paid. It is up to him. If he says it is paid,

I  shall be very happy for the workers. But it  has

not  been paid, because of the implication that  is

coming  in. A Malaysian ang pau is going to be  the

demand by trade unionists. And if trade unions from

the  S.A.T.U. group start demanding ang  paus.  "My

God, it would mean the Communists again working  up

industrial  strife in Singapore and we should  lock

them all up." The Prime Minister might say that.  I

do  not know. I met such "activities" of the  trade

unions  during my time, when the Singapore  Harbour

Board  Staff Association was very ably led by Jamit

Singh  - now under detention - and very ably  advised

by  the  Prime  Minister, who was  then  the  legal

adviser  of  the  Singapore  Harbour  Board   Staff

Association,  and in spite of all the  evil  things

that they did against me, I had not the heart -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You had not the courage and

guts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It is not a question of courage,

Sir. It requires courage to do the right thing  and

at the right time. It is not courage to use the big

stick,  as  a Government, to go and knock  off  the

head.  It is the greatest form of cowardice. Surely

that  is not courage. If it is courage, let us have

it on equal terms.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You were chased from pillar

to post.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Chased from pillar to post by

the  Prime  Minister who was then  adviser  to  the

Singapore  Harbour Board Staff Association.  But  I

took  a  stand, a stand that I felt was  the  right

stand,  the most democratic stand - freedom for  the

trade  unions to do what they think is right  under

the  law, without political pressure. But the great

Prime  Minister does not believe in such democratic

practice,  "You cannot fix me. I can fix you."  The

poor  Harbour Board Staff Association is now really

fixed. What is more shocking is this. For the Prime

Minister  who believes in the right of association,

freedom of trade unions, to say to the workers  - on

T.V. too, "If you take two, Markandu - tidak apa. If

this  side has two, never mind. I will put in  two.

So  we have six new committee members. You can have

the union back." What is this'? Is this the way the

Prime  Minister  plays with the trade  union?  "You

opposing group - you have two. My group has  two.  I

put  in  two. Four against two. You can  have  your

union back." That is not the way to make use of the

law  for  the benefit of the P.A.P. And  with  this

T.V. it is wonderful. Every day you cannot open the

T.V. set  and turn it on without seeing the  great

Prime  Minister.  It  says, "Ah,  our  great  Prime

Minister, the hero, Premier Lee Kuan Yew." And what

made me feel sorry for the Prime Minister was this:

here was the Prime Minister having Markandu sitting

by  his  side with the T.V. on: "Markandu, are  you

for Bani or are you for me? If you are for Bani, no

interim award for you." Is that the way to run  the

government? "If you are for Bani, no interim  award

for you." Is the Prime Minister giving ideas to the

employers that unless the workers are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>



good to the employers, the employers can refuse  to

give   any  award.  Unfortunately  for  the   Prime

Minister,  P.A.P. television just boomeranged.  "If

you  are  for  Bani, you will not get  the  interim

award.  If  you are for me, say so." And that  gave

Markandu the chance to say, "I am not for Bani  nor

am  I for Lee Kuan Yew. I am for the workers of the

Harbour  Board." There was a big  roar  and  a  big

laugh.   And   how   did  he  fix  this   Markandu?

Citizenship withdrawn. But then over television  he

said.   "Markandu,  saya  tahu,  lah,   you   bukan

Communist." But why take away his citizenship if he

is  not a Communist? Here again is another example

of  the Prime Minister carrying out his threat,  "I

can  fix  you,  but  you cannot  fix  me."  So  the

Opposition knows all the tricks of the trade of the

Government   to  fix  the  Opposition   while   the

Opposition cannot fix the P.A.P. But the Opposition

can at any time knock out the P.A.P. The P.A.P. was

knocked out at the last sitting of the Assembly and

yet they have not admitted their defeat.



<br><br>3.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

often been accused by Members on the other side  of

being  arrogant. But I think you will forbear  with

me if I say that it is not arrogance that impels me

to  say  what  I  am going to tell the  Member  for

Cairnhill,  but  out  of contempt  for  despicable,

dishonourable, stupid conduct. On whose side is  he

on?   The   great   anti-Communist  defending   the

Singapore  Harbour Board 10,000  workers!  I  never

fought  them.  Playing the Bani line, the  S.A.T.U.

line,  a small hard core of 20 chaps with an  outer

core of 150 chaps. And we know who they are. It  is

my  job  to  know them and I am fighting them.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, you will also forgive me if I  cannot

help  but show my disdain for those whose political

fortune,  literally fortunes in dollars and  cents,

motivate their whole being. The Member says  he  is

an anti-Communist; that I am a waverer, a ditherer.

My friends are non-Communists. Here is a Communist-led  group  - that is what the Intelligence  is  for

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- and I compare that intelligence with my own

knowledge of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>



my  own  friends  in  the unions.  The  Member  for

Thomson   dared  not  raise  it.  The  Member   for

Cairnhill  has  raised  it  on  a  motion  for  the

adjournment.  It was fiat and punctured.  Would  he

like  me to do it the way he did it - incomprehension

of  the problem, feeble? His knowledge of Communist

philosophy, strategy and tactics was negligible. He

was too busy preparing for the day when he would be

out of office, like his colleagues now in the iron-mining  business. He is even now too busy  to  read

these   documents,  or  he  would  know   that   by

postponing the elections till after Malaysia, he is

not   going   to  get  any  advantage.  Unthinking,

plunging in to foolish decisions. Would he have  me

do  it  the way lie did it together with the Member

for  Anson? When the Harbour Board went on  strike,

the  port was paralysed for over two months. Troops

had to be called in. Industry and commerce came  to

a  grinding huh. Finally, when a general strike was

called  in  1955, he had to arrest  Mr  Fong  Swee

Suan. Let his memory not be so short. I was away at

that  time,  hut  I  was following  it  with  great

interest.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> He

was the Minister for Labour.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He was the Minister for

Labour.  If  nothing  else, I learned  how  not  to

govern. Let me tell him, because it is too late for

him  now ever to govern, hut he might wind up as  a

Senator in the Upper House, not from Singapore hut,

you  know, there are powers of patronage. One could

be  a  Minister by becoming a Senator, an appointed

one.  He will never learn to govern now. He is  too

busy  selling De Havilland aeroplanes to the Tunku,

or trying to. $8 million worth of it.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Thank you for the advertisement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, I give De Havilland

advertisement. I was there. The brochures  were  on

the  Tunku's table, and I asked him, "What  is  all

this?" He said, "Oh, Yew Hock is trying to sell me

De Havilland aeroplanes -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>



$8  million worth." I know he is busy. He wants  to

build  Kuala  Lumpur Airport for $50 million.  Just

think  of it, Mr Speaker, Sir, at 5 per cent,  one

could  retire and live ten lifetimes in comfort.  I

sympathise   with  him.  These  are  his   personal

problems.  He has got four children to  educate  in

England.  Why not make money? Why not  utilise  the

power of the connections, the contacts he has made,

when  he was Chief Minister? But I say to him  now,

and  I  say  it  seriously, here and  outside  this

Chamber: do not meddle with the lives of the people

of  Singapore.  We  will  fight  before  and  after

Malaysia.  Never  believe that because  the  police

will be under the control of the Central Government

after Malaysia, we will be deterred from saying and

from doing what is right. Never believe that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my colleagues and I have this one great advantage - we have faced the ultimate. We faced it that night, here in 1961, when they all said it was phoney. That night we had to decide whether to fight the Communists or pack up. And fighting the Communists meant that if we lost, we

died.  And  a painful death: they do not just  take

you at dawn and shoot you or give you a last cup of

coffee and a cigarette. Thai is not the way they do

things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we are relieved of all these mundane

problems of making a little bit of commission on $8

million worth of aeroplanes and $50 million on  the

Airport, and lots of other things besides  what  Ah

Hong  Construction  does in Kuala  Lumpur.  We  are

relieved  of these problems. We are not interested,

Mr   Speaker,   Sir,  but  we   are   deeply   and

passionately  interested  in  the  future  of  this

country, and we will fight the Communists  and  the

merchant adventurers. His ilk -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I suggest to the Hon, the

Prime Minister that all this probably will be  very

apt  when we come to his motion. We are now on  the

port workers of the Harbour Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The point I wanted to make,

Mr Speaker, Sir, is that all is for the purpose of

gain.  In  this case, to get back to power,  he  is

prepared



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>



to  run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. The

15  seats  - he ganged up with the Barisan Sosialis,

not  knowing the immeasurable consequences of  that

decision.  I  have said this before,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  - he  is  a good poker player. I  have  played

poker with him and the Tunku. I have, from time  to

time  in  the course of our deliberations,  had  to

play  poker with the Tunku, besides golf.  Golf  in

the   morning,  sometimes  poker  in  the  evening,

settlement in between, and sometimes on the back of

an  envelope. But I did not play poker  to  win.  I

played  poker to amuse my friends. And I am  not  a

good poker player. I do not like the game of bluff.

We  played bridge. When you know what your Opponent

bids,  you  calculate very carefully what  are  the

possibilities, and, most important, you come  to  a

conclusion on the probabilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we put the 15 seats. This is by way of

illustration  to  show how silly  he  is.  He  will

forever  regret this. As an act, he took  our  Bill

away,  but I think it would have made no difference

if  I  had  been  here. He had orders  from  above,

according  to today's afternoon newspapers,  as  he

must   from  time  to  time.  Does  he   know   the

consequences of that? The 15 seats - we  tested  the

ground  with the Communists, and had them. See  the

difference  between September last year  arid  now.

Referendum Day - 25 per cent - let us see  how  much

they  have got and where it is, and let us work  on

it. And there is no danger attached to it; no power

is attached to winning the 15 seats. By his foolish

move,  which we also contemplated - we credited  him

with   more   intelligence  and   said   that   the

possibility was 50-50 whether he would block it  or

whether he would allow it. I think I over-rated his

intelligence or perhaps these were things  not  for

him  to  decide  but for higher authority.  Now  he

faces a contest for 51 seats, with power attached.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hate to interrupt the Prime

Minister, but I think I must bring him back now  to

the industrial dispute of the port workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> In the same way this is a

prelude to my explanation, Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



Speaker.  Sir.  By unthinking actions  he  has  led

himself  and  the country into dire peril,  because

these  51  seats have got power at the  end  of  it

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- $500 million worth of money every year controlled

by  the Treasury plus radio, television, and a host

of other things. If he wants it that way, so be it.

I  would  have  preferred to do it the  intelligent

way:  when one goes over a road which one knows  is

mined,  one sends an armoured car first to blow  up

the  mines. Watch for them, know where the path  is

safe,   then   follow.  But  not  the  Member   for

Cairnhill.  He  just went in on the  Harbour  Board

Staff  Association. Does he know what this  is  all

about?  Has  he got any contacts with  the  Harbour

Board? He says it i5 the N.T.U.C. versus S.A.T.U. I

do not think it is. It is the Communists versus the

Rest  and  I am in favour of the Rest. Mr Rajendra

is  not  my  friend. I did what was right  for  the

nurses, although at that time my friend, the Member

for Kampong Kapor, was extremely upset. Because  my

job  was  to get the Rest. It is like one of  those

Test  matches, Mr Speaker, Sir. You know the other

fellows   have  11  good  men  and  I   think   the

intelligent thing is to get as many of the good men

on your side as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Harbour Board is not under my control. I put

Jamit   Singh   there.  He  was   blackmailed   and

bludgeoned into going the Communist way. He had  to

take  the  consequences. He went wrong. That  is  a

matter  for the law. But he was playing a political

game.  He got sentenced, sent to prison. He put  in

Bani  and  Lim Shee Peng. Lim Shee Peng is  now  in

Kuala  Lumpur. I arrested Jamit Singh. Want  to  be

unkind?  His  boss the Tunku is keeping  Mr  Jamit

Singh  and  Mr Lim Shee Peng. I could have  fought

them  out right up to the 31st of August. We  haste

also calculated that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, Mr Speaker. Sir, my colleagues are like

the  Minister  for Finance. We all play  chess  and

there  are  books on it - the possible  permutations

and  combinations which - are feasible in any  given

situation. You make one move, the enemy makes three

or  four possible counter moves. You calculate what

is the possible counter



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>



to   his   counter.  A  good  chess  player,   like

Botvinnik, I think, calculates 10 moves ahead.  But

the  Member for Cairnhill, only takes one leap into

the  abyss, not knowing where it is going  to  lead

him -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Dissolved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. He talks of the N.T.U.C.

versus S.A.T.U. At least we put up a fight with the

N.T.U.C. What has he got? Where is his trade union?

Where  is his trade union leader, Mr Lee Yew Seng?

In  St.  John's  Island as a  criminal  law  secret

society  detainee. He has been there for  the  last

four years and will be there until he repents. That

is his trade union leader. He wrote him a plaintive

letter  the other day. We passed it on.  No  reason

why  we should not. Probably he thought, after  the

31st  of August, Mr Lee Yew Seng would be released

and  the old gang would re-form and then they would

run  around  the town again. No, we have calculated

that to the nth degree. Make no bones about it.  So

we say he gets no advantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said all this tickled him. Does he really, Mr

Speaker, Sir? Very funny man if he does. To go down

to  a  meeting of 10,000 workers with whom  he  had

lost  contact for three to four years. I knew  them

for  years.  And on that confidence  that  my  long

association  with them would give me  a  chance  of

getting  a fair hearing, I got them there  and  got

the  union leaders there and put the cards  on  the

table.  I  was  not going to have a  Harbour  Board

strike,  definitely not one led by  the  Communists

and certainly not before the 31st of August. And if

they called one, it would be illegal. The union  is

under  a  state of suspension; order to show  cause

for  stealing  union funds; Court  sentenced  Jamit

Singh  to one and a half years for pinching $8,000;

committee improperly elected; challenge in the High

Court.  I  thought it was right and  proper,  in  a

friendly way, to put my cards down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me tell the Member for Cairnhill - he will

never learn and it is too late even if he tries  it

now  because  he has not got that kind of  thinking

apparatus. Never fight the workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



Isolate  the  Communist leaders,  settle  with  the

workers, then break the Communist leaders.  I  make

no  bones about this. They know that I am going  to

break  them  and they are going to break  me.  They

were  not worried about him. They would rather have

him  here.  Life would be easier for them.  Because

the  Member for Cairnhill just would disappear.  He

would  not turn up. I went there, put my  cards  on

the table. There was no brow-beating; there was  no

nothing.  There  was just the plain straightforward

putting of the cards on the table: appeal to  their

logic,  their  reason  and good  sense.  I  gave  a

Malaysia  bonus.  Why not? $2 million  which  Jamit

Singh, had he not played the Communist game,  would

have  got  them nearly two years ago. The Anson  by

election  - he started his first claim. We  made  an

offer.  My  colleague, the Minister for  Education,

was Chairman of the Harbour Board then. I gave them

no  more than their just due, and I thought it  was

right.  I also made sure that there was no sparking

point for any trouble, because if the Harbour Board

goes on strike and riots start, then the troops are

out.  I  do not want the troops to be out. I  would

like  to  deal just with the leaders, not with  the

men. Never get the rank and file inflamed. I am not

interested  in  arresting or  beating  up  pregnant

women  who  come  to  my office  with  bottles  and

sticks,  or old- mothers and fathers. But I  think,

quite rightly, the State Advocate-General took  the

right  and proper view, and the gentleman  who  led

them will have to explain why they were present and

for  what purpose. And so the fight will always  go

on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last time I had a ringside view and I learned it

at  the  expense of the Member for  Anson  and  the

Member  for  Cairnhill I saw  them  bludgeoned  and

cudgelled  almost  into  stupor.  The  Member   for

Cairnhill's tactics? He said it tickled him.  I  do

not  know whether he is the sort of chap whose wife

will get a divorce for cruelty because he wants  to

be  tickled. But I will tell him this. It  did  not

tickle me when I read that Lim Ching Siong, in  the

days  when  the  Member  for  Cairnhill  was  Chief

Minister, in the room where the Clerk now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>



sits,  presented  him with black banners.  And  his

counter  to that was to run around town in his  car

with  the  black banner, go to Merdeka  Bridge  and

fire crackers -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> To drive away the evil spirits.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. I wept, Mr Speaker, Sir,

because   I   knew  it  was  an  unequal   contest.

Calculators  with  brawn and brains  on  one  side:

gamblers  on  the other side hoping for  the  lucky

punch.  I  am not hoping for any lucky  punch.  You

block  the  15  seats;  that was  also  taken  into

account.  Certain other alternative plans  are  put

into  operation. This motion is blocked.  He  faces

elections  before  31st August. Can  he?  The  boss

decides. And I say this to him quite frankly. If it

should so be, if they really want to test strength,

I say. "Right, let us have it."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Members on the other side, the Barisan, the

stupidity  of  it all. Here we were giving  them  a

chance,  a run for their money's worth; last  race,

put  your money on an outsider, maybe it would come

in.  Supposing  they won 10 or eight  or  seven  or

five.  There  you are, it proves that some  of  the

masses are on their side. No, they did not want it.

They  wanted  it after merger. I think  it  is  the

gravest miscalculation they have ever made. I  have

made  the  offer; it has been rejected; so  be  it.

Now,  we  proceed.  He kept on saying,  "During  my

time."  Yes,  three and a half years of ineptitude,

sometimes  sheer blunt stupidity. They waited  till

the fire started; it got out of hand, and he called

the  Fire Brigade. It was not enough. The Army fire

brigade  had to come in. I do not believe in  doing

that. I think the art of government in Singapore is

to  make quite sure that force need never be  used.

The   Chinese   Communists,  being   Chinese,   are

calculative. I say this without any offence  to  my

Malay friends on both sides of the House. They  run

amok.  They do not care whether they win  or  lose.

They  just  run  amok. When a Malay runs  amok,  he

takes  a knife and runs amok. You kill him  or  you

capture  him or he kills a lot of people. But  with

the  Chinese Communists, however brave, however big

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



talk  of  revolution, there is always  that  moment

before the final decision is made when he stops and

looks  at the opposing forces. If he sees  a  small

thing  which he thinks he can take on and bash  and

beat  up,  then  I think it mounts, and  then  real

trouble  starts.  Then you  have  to  call  in  the

reserves, British troops and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have decided to make my intentions and the

intentions of my Government really clear  and  very

simple. It always saves a lot of trouble. It is  my

way,  of governing. My colleagues all do the  same.

And  so  it was with the Work Brigade. The  Barisan

boys  were  going to start something.  One  morning

they  woke  up  at dawn and at all  the  camps,  my

colleague, the Minister for Home Affairs,  had  the

Gurkhas drilling in the centre of the compound. Not

one  word was said. Mr Speaker, Sir. Not one  word

need  be  said. All they did was, at 5  a.m.,  they

marched  into  the quadrangle of  the  camps  where

trouble was expected and drilled for one and a half

hours.  They  marched  forward,  gave  orders,  had

bayonet practice - put it up and down, I do not know

what  they  call  it:  you  know,  the  bolt,   the

cartridges  and  so on, and all the  trouble-makers

went home. Not a shot was fired. And forgive me  if

I  believe  that that is the better  way  of  doing

things.  Then they tried to march around town.  The

Reserve Unit came out, met them in sufficient force

to  leave  nobody in any doubts as to who would  be

the  victor,  who  would be  the  vanquished  in  a

collision. They also went home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member said the strike would be called off

within  two days. What did I mean? I will tell  him

what  I  would  have done. It is not past  history.

There will never be a strike before 31st of August.

Bani has been isolated. The Committee with him  and

the   150  chaps,  the  hard  core  with  him,  are

isolated. Two of them have already got the sack for

indiscipline during working hours, and any  one  of

the  others  up  for similar indiscipline  will  be

sacked.  My  orders.  I am in charge.  I  tell  the

Harbour  Board this is the way. Security ultimately

is my responsibility. I make no apologies for it. A

man  was found missing from duty for one and a half

hours. He is a Communist, Mr Speaker, Sir, I  know

him. He had been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>



going  around fixing up for the evening  whilst  he

was  supposed to be inspecting the loading  at  the

hatch.  He  was asked where he had been.  He  said,

"None of your business. You can tell the Chairman,"

which  they did. The Chairman consulted me,  and  I

said,   "Proceed  with  the  ordinary  disciplinary

procedure. What do the Harbour Board do under  such

circumstances?"  They said,  "Sack  him."  I  said,

"Well,  so be it." So the Committee were  going  to

call a strike. But that was a bad issue, because as

one  man, nobody got the benefit. So they  said  it

was  pay  claims. Another chap got the  sack  under

similar circumstances. Markandu is not a Communist.

I  gave  him five chances, Mr Speaker,  Sir  three

times in my office, two times in the Harbour Board.

I know him. The trouble with him is that he needs a

lot  of time at some of the places of entertainment

around  Tanjong  Pagar  to  be  sober,  and  he  is

completely in their grip. He sees me; he agrees. He

goes  hack;  Mr Bani writes a long  statement;  he

signs. He cannot write that statement, Mr Speaker,

Sir, I  know  his  English and I know  Mr  Bani's

English and I have proof that Mr Bani is -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Prime Minister should

refer to Mr Bani as the Member for Thomson.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, the Member for Thomson. He

was  the  leading light. I called him to my  office

three  times.  The  first time. I said,  "Markandu,

please  do not make me do this. Here is a  way  out

for you, and an honourable way out. So dissolve the

two  committees.  Get rid of the  Communists.  Bani

out.  Settle  your  union problem."  He  said  yes.

"Elect section by section, start negotiations.:" He

said  yes.  That evening there was a long statement

denouncing  me - that I prevented the right  of  the

workers  to  make representations. Members  of  the

Press  were there. Why was there no adverse  public

reaction? Because the public knew the truth.  There

was  a  long, deliberate, elaborate process of  the

clarification of stands before the strike.  I  gave

Markandu a chance. The second time he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



came,  I  said, "In that case, now since  you  have

gone in, you have got to retire. No. He went on and

signed  more  long  statements.  After  the   third

bottle,  they always think the revolution has  been

won.  Just like some members of the Alliance Party,

they  always  sit down at the table. I always  find

that  my troubles begin after they have had a  good

dinner, because at the eighth course and after  the

tenth  whisky  has gone down, in their  minds  they

have  won the next elections and thinking how  they

are  going  to  share the spoils. [Interruption]  I

drink beer, Mr Speaker, Sir. I make no bones about

it.   But  I  like  to  do  my  calculations   very

methodically  early in the morning with  a  cup  of

tea. I never make a decision at night. That is  so.

And so. Markandu twice in the Harbour Board, in the

Board  room  in  the  presence of  all  his  fellow

committee men and in the presence of the workers, I

offered  him a way out. I told him the  first  time

that if he went down and signed any more statements

from  Bani, then it was an act of war. He was going

with  Bani. The Member for Thomson is lighting  me,

willy-nilly.  He knows he has done it.  He  is  not

such a fool. He has got exactly 32 days left. If he

wants to make it shorter, that is his business. But

he has got 32 days left when I am in charge. And we

play it the open way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They blew me with loudspeakers froth the roof-top.

I  hailed back and turned the loudspeakers on them.

We  started the argument. They said I am a Fascist.

You  know.  Mr Speaker. Sir, it is a  very  simple

point. I told the crowd, all I had to do, if I  was

a  Fascist, was to tell the police officer who  was

there  to  ring up Rumah Miskin Police Station  and

the 70 gentlemen upstairs had no way of escape, and

they  would  all  be  in for a breach  of  the  law

- disturbing the peace, conduct likely  to  cause  a

breach  of the peace. I know enough of the  law  to

know  what section all these things fall under.  It

is  very simple. I thought it was best in the  long

run  to  let them have their go. Black banners.  So

long as they did not take a stone, a stick, an acid

bomb,  a gun. If they did, then force versus force.

I  mean, argument goes out of the window and  force

begins.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Member for Cairnhill prepared to do that?

He  will  never contemplate that. Again  these  are

personal problems which I do not wish to touch  on.

But  I  would say that people who spend their  time

playing mahjong and poker at high salaries are  not

likely   to  go  around  calculating  these  things

methodically. And you have to when you are fighting

an enemy who is methodical, thorough and absolutely

determined.  In  this case, they were  wrong.  They

fought the nation. They fought national unity. They

told  lies  on  citizenship.  They  told  lies   on

education.  Right at this moment,  they  are  going

around -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can I ask the Prime Minister

to try now to devote his time to the port workers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, we must always realise

what we are doing. On whose side are we on? That is

my  theme, Mr Speaker, Sir,I am asking the Member

for  Cairnhill, on whose side is he on? And  I  say

the answer is, he is on his side, and whether as  a

Communist  or anybody else, if he believes  he  can

get  something out of it, he proceeds. That  is  my

understanding  of  his  conduct.  They  are   going

around.  They  have not given up  the  fight.  They

thought  that there were going to be elections  for 15  Members  and now, by their own stupidity,  they

have  thrown  it away. They were preparing  for  it

whilst  I  was away in London. The moment the  Bill

was  tabled, they prepared for it. They went  round

the  rural constituencies from Sembawang  to  Jalan

Kayu  to spread the lie that Chinese education  and

culture  would  be destroyed after merger.  I  know

that.  I  will go back there and again explain  and

again unscramble. So it goes on all the time, every

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Mr Markandu again, on him I end. The Member

for   Cairnhill  says,  "Oh, what  a  wicked  chap

punishing a man." I gave Mr Markandu five chances.

The  last  one was at a public meeting in front  of

10,000  workers. I stated the facts which he  could

not  deny.  But  he  signed Mr  Bani's  statements

every  time.  He  said  "Oh,  well,  Bani  is   my

adviser." So I said, "Well, stop it now or you must

share Bani's fate."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



That  evening he went out and drank more booze  and

made  more  statements. His  citizenship  is  being

revoked and I made no apologies for it. I think  it

is  necessary in the national interest that  people

should  understand, that even  if  you  are  not  a

Communist but you play the Communist line, then you

wear  the  Communist jersey and go down with  them.

You  must  be  prepared. You cannot  say,  "if  the

Communists  win,  I  share in the  spoils.  If  the

Communists lose, please do not hurt me as I am  not

a  Communist." The fight is on. It is a  matter  of

life  and  death, and I am determined not  to  lose

this  fight. There is no stir in the Harbour Board.

The  Member  for  Cairnhill has no  chance  at  the

waterfront. All his gangster boys, Lee  Yew  Seng's

gangster  boys - I beg his pardon - are all gone  and

they have dispersed. Let me remind him that on  his

own  Special  Branch advice - I do not say  that  he

himself did it - he arrested the Member for Kallang,

Che  Buang,  in 1956, knowing that the  Member  for

Kallang  was  not  a Communist. He  arrested  Inche

Awang, President of the S.T.C.E.U., knowing that he

was  not  a  Communist, but because he was  running

around  with the Communists. So he went  down.  The

Special Branch recommended and he acted. When  they

were  confident  that Inche Awang and  Inche  Buang

were not really Communists or going to support  the

Communist cause, they were released.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Mr Markandu is in exactly that same

category.  The only difference between  the  Member

for  Cairnhill  and us is this. His Special  Branch

did  all  his thinking for him. Our Special  Branch

does part of our thinking for us because we have to

make  the  political decision. If I listen  to  the

Special   Branch,  Mr  Speaker.  Sir,  then   this

Assembly today will be a slightly different  place.

There will be a few vacant chairs in this Assembly.

I  make no bones about it. They know it and I  know

it.  It is a political decision which I had to make

and I said. "No. Let it be 25-25 to the end and the

end is the 31st of August." If he likes to make  it

earlier,  it  is in his hands. So I say,  far  from

making   an   apology  for  the  policies   of   my

Government,  I leave the Member for Cairnhill  with

this passing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



thought.  He  will  never come back  to  power  in

Singapore. He has not a chance. Even if the  Grand

Alliance win, he is fairly low down the ladder. He

is  not  even  an  office-bearer  now.  He  is  an

embarrassment to them. There are other bigger  men

whom  they think have cleaner records. He is  out.

So  please  do  not  try to  make  mischief  here,

because  let me tell him this. If between now  and

the 31st of August, any mischief is created either

by  his  running around with Mr Markandu who  saw

him and I know that -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> When?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is my

job to be informed. I do not always keep everybody

informed because it is not in the public interest.

But  I  think  in this case it is  in  the  public

interest  for  people to know  that  Mr  Markandu

thinks  it is unwise to get the Member for Thomson

to  raise his case: it is better to get the Member

for  Cairnhill  to  raise ii. Originally,  it  was

going  to  be  a much fiercer thing  than  just  a

motion on the adjournment, had prepared for it.  I

knew it before I went to the Harbour Board for the

first time. I say to him and his colleagues, there

is  a place in Malaysia for them. Kuala Lumpur has

many  places  in the Senate. There are  ways  out.

There are profitable ventures. But any involvement

of  Singapore's paramount interest in his personal

machinations. I say please do not. It is bound  to

have very unfortunate circumstances and I will not

baulk  even if the Member for Cairnhill,  in  his

folly,  for his own selfish interest, plays around

once  again with the communists, as he  did  -  15

seats and Mr Markandu. That is my job. As I  have

said,  we have contemplated the ultimate  and  the

ultimate is a very unpleasant death. That has  not

deterred us and nothing will - no Khaw Kai Bohs, no

other big bosses and other big friends of his.  We

will  do  what  is  right in the interest  of  the

people  of  Singapore and in the interest  of  the

people of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it on a point of order?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> No, we still have time up to

8.30 to reply.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There is no reply. The hon. Member

has  spoken. He might have another opportunity  to

meet  the points raised by the Prime Minister  but

certainly not on this motion for the adjournment.



<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, just now we have heard the Prime

Minister praising Fascism. In the last few months,

especially   the  last  few  days,   events   have

developed to such an extent that he is now feeling

uncomfortable.  According to his  own  words,  the

P.A.P.'s  game  has changed during  the  last  few

days. They cannot carry out their original plan of

striking  at  Singapore's Left-wing movement.  The

Prime  Minister has just pointed out in his speech

that the P.A.P. will not follow the actions of the

previous Government when striking at the Left-wing

movement  hut  that  they  will  adopt  their  own

policy. The Singapore Harbour Board employees were

suppressed  under this policy. Their  request  was

frustrated by him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech, the Prime Minister bragged about

the  correctness of his decision on the  award  to

the  Harbour Board workers' wages demand. When the

Member  for Cairnhill was the Minister for Labour,

he  adopted  the wrong policy because he  did  not

look  after  the interest of the workers  or  meet

their reasonable demands. But today, has the Prime

Minister met the reasonable demands of the Harbour

Board  workers?  Mr Speaker, Sir,  these  demands

arose long before the split between the P.A.P. and

the  Barisan Sosialis. For the last six years, the

wages of the Harbour Board's workers have not been

increased  and their working conditions  have  not

improved. Therefore, the claims of the workers are

not  as  a result of the tussle between the P.A.P.

and  the  Barisan Sosialis. Long before we  parted

with  the  P.A.P., the union raised their  demands

and negotiated with the Harbour Board -

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands):</b> On a point of order, Sir. There is no

quorum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice taken that thirteen Members were not

present -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Ring the Division bells.



<br><br>4.16 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bells having failed to ring -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> This is a very unusual position. It

is  either sabotage or some fuse has gone off.  The

Division bells refuse to ring.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest to Members of the Barisan Sosialis

that  if  they  wish this sitting to continue  they

should  have  their Whip to whip  in  at  least  13

Members in all. I will wait for two minutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Member for Upper Serangoon (Mr Chan Sun Wing)</b> left the Chamber.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.19 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Well, I have allowed two minutes. If

there  is  still no quorum after the expiration  of

another  30  seconds,  this  Assembly  will   stand

adjourned. It is up to the Whip now to get two more

Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng) left the Chamber.</b>

<b><br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b></b> The number has now increased to three

more Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further notice taken that a quorum was not then

present, Mr Speaker adjourned the Assembly without

question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
