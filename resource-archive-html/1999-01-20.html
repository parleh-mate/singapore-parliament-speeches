<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs

whether  the Malaysian government has given its legal  arguments

for  keeping  its customs, immigration and quarantine  (CIQ)  in

Singapore  and, if not, whether it has indicated when this  will

be done.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs

whether  the Malaysian government has to date filed the  grounds

for  its stand on the Customs, Immigration and Quarantine  (CIQ)

issues;  and  if  not, what has our Government  done  to  ensure

timely progress on the resolution of the matter.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S Jayakumar):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, may I have your permission to take  both  Mr  Low

Thia  Khiang's Question and Mr Simon Tay's Question together  as

they are related?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S Jayakumar:</b> Sir, Malaysia has to date not submitted

its written legal arguments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that Singapore rejected Malaysia's

claim  that  they  had a legal right to operate  their  Customs,

Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) at Tanjong Pagar.  However,  we

allowed them three months, until 31st October 1998, to submit

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1785</b></font><br><br>



written legal arguments to substantiate their claim.   Five days

before the 31st October deadline expired, Malaysia requested  an

extension  of  the  deadline by 1 1/2  months.   We  agreed  and

accordingly  extended  the  deadline  to  15th  December   1998.

However,  Malaysia did not submit their arguments  by  the  15th

December  deadline  nor did they give us any  explanation,  even

though  our High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur reminded  them  on

11th  December 1998.  On 16th December 1998, after the  deadline

had  expired,  Singapore sent a Third Person  Note  to  ask  the

Malaysian Government for an explanation and to ask when  it  was

submitting its legal arguments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, my Permanent Secretary spoke to his

counterpart  in the Malaysian Foreign Ministry and informed  him

that  we were awaiting a reply to our Third Person Note of  16th

December  1998  and  for their explanation why  they  failed  to

submit their arguments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereafter, the then Foreign Minister Dato' Seri Abdullah

Badawi  replied on 26th December 1998, referring to the  meeting

between the two Prime Ministers in Hanoi on 17th December  1998,

where  the  two  Prime  Ministers agreed  to  discuss  and  seek

solutions  to  all outstanding bilateral issues  as  a  package,

including  the  location of the CIQ.   His main point  was  that

this latest agreement between the two Prime Ministers superseded

any  previous  undertaking  or understanding  at  the  officials

level.     Malaysia's  understanding  was  therefore  that   the

question  of  a  deadline  should no  longer  arise.    He  also

mentioned  that  Malaysian officials would  be  ready  to  begin

negotiations sometime after Hari Raya Aidilfitri.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I replied on 30th December 1998 to point out that when the

two  Prime  Ministers met in Hanoi on 17th December 1998,  Prime

Minister  Goh had told Prime Minister Mahathir that  Singapore's

position  on the CIQ issue was straightforward, namely, Malaysia

would  have to recognise Singapore's sovereignty and  not  claim

that it had a legal right to operate its CIQ in Singapore.    If

so,  he  was prepared to discuss the next step.  Prime  Minister

Goh added that although there

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1786</b></font><br><br>

was no legislation allowing Malaysian Immigration to operate  in

Singapore,  he was prepared to discuss the possible location  of

Malaysia's  CIQ facilities in Singapore as part of a package  of

bilateral issues to be resolved.  But first of all, the question

whether  Malaysia still claims to have a legal right  to  be  at

Tanjong  Pagar had to be resolved.   Indeed, when Prime Minister

Goh  met  the press immediately after the meeting, he  told  the

media  that  Malaysia  should still give Singapore  their  legal

arguments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my reply to then Foreign Minister Badawi, we have

stressed that any negotiations on the location of the CIQ  could

proceed  only  after Singapore's sovereignty over Tanjong  Pagar

and Woodlands has been acknowledged and not disputed.   This  is

because  Malaysia has claimed a legal right for its Customs  and

Immigration   to   operate  in  Singapore  at   Tanjong   Pagar.

Singapore  rejects  this.    This is a question  of  Singapore's

sovereignty,  just  as  Malaysian  airspace  is  a  question  of

Malaysia's  sovereignty.   When Malaysia refused RSAF permission

to  fly  over Malaysia, Singapore acknowledged this sovereignty.

We expect them to acknowledge our sovereignty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have informed Malaysia that if they do not produce their

legal arguments in one month's time, we will assume that they no

longer wish to pursue their legal claim to be at Tanjong Pagar.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister  whether it is important to highlight the legal  points

in  this  case  or should it not be subsumed under some  overall

negotiating position because some members of the public do raise

this point?  Also, may I ask whether the appointment of the  new

Foreign Minister, Datuk Syed Hamid Albar would have some  impact

on the resolution of the CIQ and other bilateral issues?

<br><br><!-- Prof. S Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me take the first

part  of  Dr  Ong  Chit Chung's question, ie,  why  we  need  to

highlight  the  legal aspect.  It is not so much  "highlighting"

the  legal  aspect  because Members  will  recall  that  it  was

Malaysia which wanted the CIQ issue to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1787</b></font><br><br>

be  included in the package of bilateral issues to be  resolved,

according  to the two Prime Ministers' agreement.  We agreed  to

this.   But, because Malaysia insisted that it had a legal right

for its CIQ to operate in Singapore - as Members will recall the

debate  we  had on 31st July last year - Malaysia has  therefore

raised a fundamental question of sovereignty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There really can be no two ways about it. Either

Malaysia's  CIQ in Singapore are there as a matter of  right  or

they  are there because of our leave and consent.  If Malaysia's

CIQ are in Singapore because of an inherent legal right, then of

course  it  follows  that there is no need  for  any  negotiated

political  settlement because they are there as of legal  right.

Therefore, it is important, from Singapore's point of view, that

the  question of Singapore's sovereignty has to be acknowledged.

We  have  told  the Malaysians that if they do not submit  their

legal arguments within a month then we will assume that they  no

longer  maintain that they have a legal right to  operate  their

CIQ in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member's second question about the new Foreign

Minister,  let me say that I have previously worked  with  Datuk

Seri Syed Hamid when he was Minister of Justice in Malaysia.   I

in  fact  had a very good working relationship with him in  that

capacity  and  I  look forward to working closely  with  him  to

resolve outstanding bilateral issues and to strengthen bilateral

relations.   Members might have read in the media that  the  new

Foreign  Minister  has  in  fact  spoken  quite  positively   on

bilateral  relations and has indicated a desire to work  towards

improving  ties.  According to media reports, he  has  said  his

priority would be Singapore-Malaysia ties.  He said that he  was

optimistic and that it should not be difficult to resolve issues

amicably. I welcome his remarks.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister what the Government would do if Malaysia continues  not

to  acknowledge the sovereign rights of Singapore over  the  CIQ

issue and at the same time they also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1788</b></font><br><br>

fail  to  submit  the legal arguments but want  to  continue  to

operate their CIQ here.  What would the Government do?

<br><br><!-- Prof. S Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S Jayakumar:</b> I have always taken the position in this

House that we should take things one step at a time.  It is  not

that  Foreign  Ministries  and Foreign Ministers  never  inquire

internally  on  what to do if certain questions  such  as  those

posed by the Member arise.  We always have to address "what  if"

questions.   But in bilateral relations, we have to assume  that

things  will  develop one step at a time.  I would not  like  to

prejudge  this issue.  I would like to give the Malaysians  time

to respond to the position I have outlined.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> May I ask

the Minister whether it is the stand of the Singapore Government

that, prior to the moving of the CIQ to Woodlands, Malaysia  was

operating  its CIQ at Tanjong Pagar simply at the  will  of  the

Singapore Government, just a bare licence, or whether there  was

a legal right for them to operate the CIQ at Tanjong Pagar?

<br><br><!-- Prof. S Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S Jayakumar:</b> That is precisely the issue. Singapore's

position is that Malaysia's operation of CIQ facilities here  is

not  on  the  basis  of  a  legal  right  or  on  the  basis  of

extraterritorial rights.  They are here on the  basis  of  leave

and consent of the Singapore Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> The Minister

mentioned a one-month further deadline, after which he  presumes

Malaysia  would  not raise the claim again.  What  is  there  to

prevent Malaysia from raising the claim after this deadline?  In

the  same  connection, what is the reassurance that in packaging

various  issues  together, Malaysia would move  to  the  slowest

common denominator?

<br><br><!-- Prof. S Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S Jayakumar:</b> On the second part of the question, if

they move to the slowest common denominator, then conclusion  of

the framework of wider cooperation, which the Prime Minister has

talked  about several times in this House and to which  we  have

committed, will be that much more time-consuming.  But  again  I

would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1789</b></font><br><br>

not  like to assume that it will proceed on the "slowest  common

denominator".  We have to take the position, as both  the  Prime

Ministers  explained to the press, that both want to  solve  the

package  as  early as possible.  They have said  that  they  are

prepared to start the discussion on the package at the officials

level  soon  after Hari Raya Aidilfitri.  We have said  that  we

welcome  that.  But, first, the question of the legal issue  and

the  question of sovereignty have to be resolved and put  behind

us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the first part of the Member's question, if

that  issue is not resolved, obviously we cannot proceed to  the

package   of  issues  negotiations  because  it  will   not   be

productive.  There will always be a question mark over  the  CIQ

issue.   Are we negotiating the CIQ issue on the basis of  their

inherent  legal right?  Will they claim it in future?   If  they

claim  it in future, it will mean that we have not resolved  it.

So  it has to be resolved.  It has to be put behind us.  That is

why this basic legal issue has to be resolved.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> This being a

sovereign issue, which I think is not up for negotiation,  would

the Minister consider referring this matter to the International

Court of Justice?

<br><br><!-- Prof. S Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, on a technical

matter  of  referring the matter to the International  Court  of

Justice, on this procedural point, it requires two countries  to

agree  to  refer a matter to the International Court of Justice.

But  we  have not reached that stage.  We will reach that  stage

only when we see their position.  If they insist that they still

have  a legal right, then, as I mentioned in Parliament on  31st

July last year, if they send their legal arguments, we have said

that the two Attorneys-General and officials, the legal experts,

will  sit down and meet first and see whether it can be hammered

out  and  resolved by a meeting of the legal experts.   If  they

cannot  resolve  the  issue, then we have to discuss  subsequent

steps  and  settle  it  by  reference  to  judicial  records  in

Singapore.  But these are to prejudge what

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1790</b></font><br><br>

is going to happen.  Let us first see what is the

position of Malaysia.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1790</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>PEDRA BRANCA</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Review of outstanding issues with Malaysia)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin</b> asked the Prime Minister

whether  the  proposal  to review all the outstanding  bilateral

issues with Malaysia includes the issues of Pedra Branca.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S Jayakumar (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may I answer this question on behalf of the Prime Minister?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S Jayakumar:</b> Pedra Branca is not among the issues which the

two  Prime Ministers, in their meeting in Hanoi on 17th December

1998,  agreed  should  be  settled as a package  of  outstanding

bilateral issues.  This is because, as I informed Parliament  on

29th  June 1998, officials from Singapore and Malaysia  on  14th

April  1998 had already reached the agreement on the text  of  a

Special  Agreement to refer Malaysia's claim to Pedra Branca  to

the International Court of Justice.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Can I ask the Minister what is

the  status of the matter now being handled by the International

Court of Justice?

<br><br><!-- Prof. S Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S Jayakumar:</b> As I said, the text of the Special

Agreement has been agreed upon.  So the basic problem  has  been

overcome.   What has to happen now are procedural  requirements,

such as formal signing ceremony and ratification, after which it

will  be referred to the International Court of Justice.   These

procedural steps will be implemented in due course.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> May I ask the Minister

whether  the issue will include Malaysia's proposal to  build  a

second bridge to replace the Causeway?

<br><br><!-- Prof. S Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S Jayakumar:</b> Do I understand the Member's question to

be  whether  the package of issues includes the  proposal  of  a

bridge?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1791</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S Jayakumar:</b> The answer to the question is no. The

proposal  to replace the Causeway with a bridge is actually  not

part  of  the  package of bilateral issues  that  Singapore  and

Malaysian  officials have discussed.  In fact, this proposal  is

not  new,  nor has it been raised officially.  There were  press

reports, I believe, in 1996 to which Prime Minister Goh as  well

as my Ministry responded.  But these reports resurfaced recently

in  a number of Malaysian press reports that a consortium called

Gerbang Perdana had secured in-principle approval to construct a

bridge  to  replace  the  Causeway.  The  Ministry  of  National

Development  issued  a press statement on  18th  December  which

reiterated  that the Singapore Government had not  received  any

official   proposal  from  the  Malaysian  Government   on   the

development of a new bridge to replace the Causeway.  Only  when

the  Singapore  Government has received such a proposal  and  is

able to evaluate it, would we be able to comment on it further?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me say again that any proposal to build a bridge

must  be  agreed to by the two governments.  When the  Singapore

Government  receives  a  serious  proposal  from  the  Malaysian

Government, we will study it and do a cost benefit analysis.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, it appears that the

Singapore Government has not been consulted on matters of mutual

interest  and,  at the same time, we have been  accused  of  not

consulting  the  Malaysians on other areas of  mutual  interest.

Would the Government then consider referring this matter,  as  a

matter of protest, to the Malaysian Government to make sure that

we are equally consulted on matters of mutual interest?

<br><br><!-- Prof. S Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S Jayakumar:</b> The Member's point is taken. But as I

said, it is a private sector proposal.  The Malaysian Government

has not made a formal proposal to us.  I do not think this calls

for  a  protest.  But of course we wish that Singapore  is  kept

informed of such a proposal if the Malaysian Government does  in

fact support this proposal.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1792</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>RELEASE OF LAND SALES FOR PRIVATE PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Inderjit Singh</b> asked the Minister for National

Development if he will consider releasing land sales for private

property  development since property prices have  stabilised  in

the last few months.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, as announced in June last year, Government land

sales   for  private  residential,  Executive  Condominium   and

commercial development will remain suspended in 1999, except for

a site at Clark Quay MRT station.  We will review the demand and

supply  situation again towards the end of 1999 before  deciding

on the land sales programme for Year 2000. There is currently no

change in the Government's plan.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, as we have seen from

press  reports in the past few weeks, developers have  increased

prices  of private property by as much as 17%.  What this  means

is that the balance between demand and supply is a very delicate

one.   Does the Minister not feel that a one-year wait to review

the  prices  may  be  too late and we may see prices  escalating

again at uncontrollable levels?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government would

rather leave the setting of prices for properties to the market.

Our  job  is just to ensure that there is an adequate supply  to

meet the demand as many market analysts have indicated, there is

no  lack  of supply in the private property market.   Today,  we

have  more  than 6,000 units which have been launched but  still

unsold.   There are another 10,000 units not launched  but  with

all  the  prerequisites for sale.  So the developers are waiting

for  the  right  timing to launch these units.  There  are  also

another  10,000  units under planning without the  prerequisites

for  sale.  All in all, we have about 26,000 to 27,000 units  in

the  pipeline.  So there is no sense of urgency to release  land

for  this year.  We will again consider releasing land for  next

year towards the end of 1999.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE TOURISM BOARD</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Special allowance for hotel refurbishment scheme)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  whether he will disclose the details of the  Singapore

Tourism   Board's  special  allowance  for  hotel  refurbishment

scheme.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b>

The  Special  Allowance  for  Hotel Refurbishment  is  a  scheme

introduced  in July 1998 as part of the Government's $2  billion

package of off-budget measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme incentivises the industry to refurbish the

hotels  during  the  current downturn, in  preparation  for  the

upturn in tourist arrivals when the regional economies recover.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme allows hotels to apply for tax allowance of up

to  150%  of  the qualifying refurbishment expenditure.   Hotels

must  spend  a minimum of $3 million on such expenditure  to  be

eligible for this scheme.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, what are the criteria for the

assessment of the hotels which would qualify for funds under the

scheme?   So  far,  how many and which hotels  have  been  given

funds?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> The hotels interested in refurbishing

their premises should apply to the Singapore Tourism Board which

will  evaluate their proposals.  The allowance of up to 150%  is

available  to  hotels  which are within  the  safeguarded  area.

There  are certain areas within the Orchard Road corridor  which

we have safeguarded for hotels.  They are not allowed to convert

to  other uses.  So these hotels are allowed to apply up to 150%

of  the  Special  Allowance.   For  other  hotels,  the  Special

Allowance  could go up to 130%.  They have to apply  within  the

period.   The  refurbishment project must commence  not  earlier

than  1st  July last year, which was the starting date  for  the

scheme, and finish not later than 30th June 2003.  This means it

is a 5-year period

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1794</b></font><br><br>

in  which  they must refurbish, and each project must  not  take

longer  than  three years.  The first hotel to qualify  for  the

scheme  is  Marina Mandarin Hotel, as reported  in  the  papers.

There are several other applications in the pipeline.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I would like to know what are the

criteria for evaluation and it seems to me that priority will be

given  to  hotels  in  the  safeguarded  area.   Besides  Marina

Mandarin,  which has been given the funds, are there  any  other

hotels which would be given the funds?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> The idea of the scheme is to make use of

this  downturn, when tourist arrivals are lower, to upgrade  the

premises.   I  think some of the premises may  be  lacking,  for

example,  IT  facilities, or maybe they are a bit old.   So  the

general  idea  is  to be generous so long as they  meet  certain

minimum criteria.  The intention is to support them.  So what  I

have   mentioned  just  now  is  to  distinguish   between   the

safeguarded  area  and the areas outside.  The  reason  is  that

within the safeguarded area, which is the main tourism belt,  we

are  limiting  their  use of the land.  In the  past,  when  the

property market was hot, they wanted to convert to condominiums.

The  Government  said  no.  So for that  reason,  I  think  they

deserve somewhat more favourable treatment.  But otherwise,  the

intention  is  to  be generous and where they meet  the  minimum

criteria, the likelihood is that we will support them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, my question just now was whether

any  other  hotels were given the funds besides Marina Mandarin.

The  Minister says that they will be generous.  How generous are

they?   What  is the budget?  Does it mean whatever amount  that

they  have applied for?  Is this scheme also applicable to small

hotels?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> The scheme is applicable to gazetted

hotels, that means, they must be within a certain definition  to

be classifed as "hotels".  I cannot remember the actual figures.

It is $1

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1795</b></font><br><br>

million  expenditure,  or  something like  that,  but  I  cannot

remember  the  exact  numbers.  The first hotel  to  qualify  is

Marina  Mandarin.  But as I said, there are several other hotels

in  the  pipeline.  I do not want to mention their names because

this  is  a private matter with them.  But they are still  being

processed and the likelihood is that we will put up a  few  more

for approval.  This is in the nature of incentives.  We want  to

be as generous as possible.  It depends on how much they want to

spend on their refurbishment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> How about the Government's part? What

is the budget allocated for this?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> There is no Government budget for this

because we are forgiving certain tax.  Unless these are  in  the

nature  of  machinery or equipment, hotels could not qualify  in

fact to deduct this against their taxable income.  But when they

get  approval,  then  the amount that  is  approved  up  to  the

approved  percentage  could  be  offset  against  their  taxable

income.   This  is  like  giving pioneer status  and  investment

allowance  to  manufacturing projects.  So  there  is  no  fixed

budget,  in  the sense that it does not come out of tax  already

collected.  It is forgiving future taxes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> In other words, may I confirm with the

<div align="center"><b>FEE HIKES BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  whether  the Government will strengthen  the  existing

mechanism  to  ensure that a fee hike at the  beginning  of  the

year,  like that of the fee hike for refuse disposal,  will  not

lead  to  another  round  of  fee hikes  by  various  Government

agencies, thereby

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1796</b></font><br><br>

defeating  the purpose of its package of cost and  tax  cuts  to

help companies compete during this difficult period.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, the Government has

implemented  a $10.5 billion package to help cut business  costs

substantially.  However, it does not follow that  fees  for  all

public  services should be reduced or frozen across  the  board.

To  do  so  regardless  of  the merits  and  rationale  of  each

individual   case  will  hinder  the  Government   from   making

adjustments  that become necessary from time to time,  and  will

create   rigidities  and  distortions  which  will  impair   the

efficiency of our public services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in refuse disposal fee is necessary given our

limited  land  for disposal.  Refuse disposal is  expensive  and

costs  have  increased  further  because  the  landfill  on  the

mainland has been exhausted and refuse must now be barged across

the sea to the new dumping site at Pulau Semakau.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in disposal fees will not translate into

higher  refuse  collection  fees for  most  premises.   This  is

because  SEMAC, the waste collection company servicing  most  of

the  HDB  flats and other residential units, hawker  stalls  and

trade  premises in Singapore, has agreed to absorb the  increase

in refuse disposal fees, while the company that has successfully

tendered to collect refuse in the eastern part of Singapore will

be  charging refuse collection fees that are mostly  lower  than

SEMAC's.

<div align="center"><b>FREEZING OF UNIVERSITY AND POLYTECHNICS FEES</b></div>





<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Loh Meng See</b> asked the Minister for Education, in the

light  of  the current adverse economic conditions, (a)  whether

his Ministry will freeze the University and Polytechnics fees in

the   new   term;  and  (b)  for  students  who  face  financial

difficulties,  whether  there  are  special  assistance  schemes

available to help them.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the Ministry of Education, in consultation  with

the universities, polytechnics and the Institute

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1797</b></font><br><br>

of  Technical  Education  (ITE),  conducts  regular  reviews  of

tuition  fees to ensure that they are set at appropriate levels.

The  review  of  tuition  fees for the academic  year  1999  and

academic  year 2000 has just been completed.  The  tuition  fees

for  undergraduate, polytechnic and ITE courses for the academic

years  1999  and  2000 will remain at their current  level.   So

there will be no change in the fees for 1999 and the year 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the fees for postgraduate programmes which are as

low  as  only  40%  of  undergraduate  fees  will  be  increased

moderately  in academic year 1999 and academic year  2000.   The

increase will amount to an additional $300 in fees each year for

laboratory-based and non-laboratory based postgraduate  courses,

and $450 for medical and dental postgraduate courses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no deserving student will be denied the opportunity of

tertiary education because of inability to afford tuition  fees.

A  wide  range of financial assistance schemes in  the  form  of

scholarships,  bursaries and loans are  currently  available  to

undergraduates  and  polytechnic students.  Together,  they  can

cover  up  to  100%  of  the  tuition fees  and  provide  living

allowances for needy students. There are no quotas for the Study

Loan, Tuition Fee Loan Scheme and the CCC bursary.  Indeed, more

students  have  applied for such financial assistance  and  have

received  it  this academic year.  For example, the Tuition  Fee

Loan  Scheme in academic year 1998:  7,017 students have applied

and all have received assistance under this Loan Scheme compared

to 6,066 last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than two-thirds of postgraduate research students are

receiving  Research Scholarships or Studentships.   Other  full-time postgraduate students not on the research scholarships  and

studentships  are eligible to borrow up to 80% of their  tuition

fees  through  the Tuition Fee Loan scheme.  These schemes  will

continue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Government-funded scholarships,

bursaries  and loan schemes administered by the institutions  of

higher

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1798</b></font><br><br>

learning,  other forms of financial assistance are also  offered

by  foundations, community groups, self-help groups, and private

and professional organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also pleased to note that the student unions in the

universities  have  sustained their  self-help  initiatives  for

needy  students  through the Students'  Funds.   The  Government

matches  dollar for dollar the student unions' efforts to  raise

funds for these students. In April 1998, the Government matching

grant limit for the NTU Students' Union Fund was raised to $0.75

million.   Government  will be prepared to  consider  increasing

this grant limit should there be a need to do so.

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT'S POLICY ON HEDGE FUNDS</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Shriniwas

Rai -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will state the

Government's policy on hedge funds.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Question

No. 8, Sir.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  hedge  funds  are typically  private  investment

partnerships  that are marketed to a limited clientele  of  high

net worth investors.  There are many types of hedge funds.  Some

take  large and unhedged market positions, betting on  movements

of exchange rates, interest rates, and market trends. Others use

defensive  and  hedged strategies to protect themselves  against

adverse  market movements.  Some borrow heavily from  banks,  to

become  highly leveraged funds. However, the majority  of  hedge

funds are only lightly geared, and trade mainly using their  own

capital.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risks which highly leveraged hedge funds can pose to

financial  systems are well-publicised.  Such  hedge  funds  can

rapidly  build  up large market positions, using money  borrowed

from other institutions.  When their aggressive one-way bets

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1799</b></font><br><br>



go  wrong,  the  unwinding  of these accumulated  positions  can

threaten to destabilise the whole financial system.  The  recent

debacle of Long Term Capital Management was a vivid example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these risks are not specific to hedge funds.

Banks   and   other  financial  institutions,   and   especially

proprietary  trading  desks of banks, often  engage  in  similar

leveraged strategies as hedge funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some risk that speculation by hedge funds can

impair  the ability of governments to manage exchange rates  and

conduct monetary policies.  However, this risk exists regardless

of  whether  hedge funds base their fund managers in  Singapore,

Hong  Kong or anywhere else.  Decisions to take large aggressive

bets  are made by their head offices, and do not depend on where

the hedge fund managers are located.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While hedge funds have been blamed for causing the Asian

financial crisis, an IMF study in December 1997 found that their

role in the Asian financial crisis had been greatly exaggerated,

and  that  the  underlying causes were basic weaknesses  in  the

banking and corporate sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A world class financial centre is characterised by a wide

range  of  investors, intermediaries and financial  instruments.

It  has active markets and efficient exchanges. The presence  of

diverse investors stimulates the development of a broad range of

financial instruments.  Established financial centres  like  New

York,  London  and Hong Kong are already hosts to  such  a  wide

spectrum of investors, including hedge funds.  This has fostered

the use of innovative investment techniques in these centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS therefore has no blanket policy either to ban or to

attract hedge funds. Hedge funds wishing to operate in Singapore

are  subject  to the same regulations and licensing criteria  as

any other funds and fund management companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS' supervisory approach is to ensure that financial

institutions  are  not over-exposed to any  particular  counter-party or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1800</b></font><br><br>

type  of  asset.   MAS  will  continue  to  emphasise  financial

institutions' reporting of large trades and positions as well as

compliance  with  prudential exposure limits.   MAS  uses  these

supervisory  tools to monitor and manage systemic  risk  in  our

markets  and  exchanges, and to restrain financial  institutions

from  becoming  excessively exposed to any  particular  counter-party, including hedge funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulators in developed countries are actively studying the

issue  of  how  to improve disclosure and reporting requirements

for   hedge   funds   and  other  market  participants.    Given

Singapore's  position as a major financial centre,  MAS  has  an

interest in higher disclosure standards and is participating  in

such  studies.  MAS  will  ensure that our  own  disclosure  and

reporting requirements meet international best practice.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Deputy

Prime  Minister whether our financial institutions and financial

regulatory  system in Singapore are strong enough to manage  the

hedge  funds,  especially now that we welcome  the  presence  of

hedge funds in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are always

watching carefully developments and tracking whether we need  to

make adjustments to our supervision and regulation policies.  As

I  explained earlier, the point is not whether or not we welcome

the  hedge funds to Singapore, because even if we do not welcome

them  here,  they  can  operate in  the  Singapore  market  from

overseas.   They make their decisions at headquarters which  may

be  in  New York or London.  The entities are probably domiciled

in  Cayman Islands or Bahamas or some tax havens like that,  and

they  operate  around  the  world  using  agents,  other  banks,

sometimes present in person to track what is going on.   So  the

key  point is not whether or not they are present here  with  an

office,  with a nameplate, but whether or not they are operating

in  the  Singapore market, perhaps from afar.  And we have  seen

evidence  that  our  exchange  rate  movement  has  been  partly

affected by hedge

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1801</b></font><br><br>

funds  which have been taking positions, as they do in all Asian

currencies.  So it is a position which we have to watch all  the

time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, my question is: what is the

assessment of the Deputy Prime Minister on whether our financial

institutions and systems are strong enough to manage  the  risks

that may arise because of hedge fund speculation?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we believe that we

have  good institutions but we are never satisfied, and I  would

not  tempt  fate  to say that we are totally  impregnable.   You

never  know what developments can occur.  We have to  make  sure

that when they do, we are ready for them.

<div align="center"><b>WAGE COST REDUCTION MEASURES BY COMPANIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b> asked the Minister for Manpower if he will

indicate  the latest development on wage cost reduction measures

undertaken  by companies since the announcement of  the  revised

guidelines by the National Wages Council.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b> asked the Minister for Manpower whether

the  decision by some companies to return savings on  employers'

Central Provident Fund contribution to their employees will have

any adverse impact on our cost reduction exercise.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b> asked the Minister for Manpower how many

companies'  senior officers had taken higher wage reduction,  in

support  of  the National Wages Council's call to moderate  wage

cut for lower income workers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  Mr  Ong  has raised two questions relating to  the  recent

National Wages Council's wage guidelines and another on the  CPF

reduction.   May I have your permission to take  all  the  three

questions together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> As the revised NWC guidelines were

announced only in November last year, it is too early at this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1802</b></font><br><br>

juncture  to  determine how many companies have implemented  the

guidelines.   My  Ministry will conduct a survey  to  gauge  the

employers' response to the revised NWC guidelines.  The findings

are  expected  to be available by April 1999.  In the  meantime,

feedback from employers and settlements of cases referred to  my

Ministry for conciliation indicates that most employers in  both

the  unionised  and non-unionised sectors have  implemented  the

wage reduction guidelines issued by the NWC.  The extent of wage

cut   varies  from  company  to  company  depending   on   their

performance.  If this trend continues, the companies  should  be

able  to  reduce their wage cost by 5-8% as recommended  by  the

NWC.   Together  with  the  10  percentage  point  cut  in   the

employers' CPF contribution implemented in January this year, we

should be able to achieve the target of 15% reduction in overall

wage cost to regain business competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM's survey will also determine whether senior management

personnel had taken a bigger cut in their salary as compared  to

their  junior  counterparts.  While the detailed  findings  will

only  be  available  in  April,  information  available  so  far

indicates that many companies have implemented a bigger  cut  in

the  salary of their executives and senior management personnel.

In  the  case  of the civil service, senior civil  servants  are

subjected  to higher cuts in their salaries compared  to  junior

officers as announced by DPM Lee in November last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Mr Ong's question on the impact of cost

reduction  resulting from some companies wanting to  return  the

CPF  savings to their employees, I would like to point out  that

only  companies which continue to perform very well would be  in

the  position  to do so.  The CPF Board has so far  received  49

enquiries  by  companies on the possibility of continuing  their

contribution  at  20%.  Another seven companies  have  indicated

that they were considering passing the savings from the CPF  cut

to  their  employees in the form of additional bonuses or  other

benefits.  Such efforts by employers to reward workers for  good

performance under difficult

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1803</b></font><br><br>

market  conditions are consistent with NWC's recommendation  and

will not have any adverse impact on our overall effort to regain

competitiveness.

<div align="center"><b>WAGE GUIDELINES FOR EMPLOYMENT PASSES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Dr Toh See Kiat</b> asked the Minister for Manpower whether

he  will  lower the wage guidelines for the different categories

of  employment passes to reflect the 15% reduction in wage costs

that has taken place.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Encik Othman bin Haron</b>

<b>Eusofe) (for the Minister for Manpower):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a

foreigner seeking to work in Singapore will be considered for  a

work   pass   commensurate   with  his   skills   and   economic

contributions  to  Singapore.  Better qualified  foreigners  are

issued  with  "P" or "Q" work passes.  In assessing the type  of

work  pass to be issued, my Ministry takes into consideration  a

number   of   factors  including  the  foreigner's   educational

qualification, job experience and income as well as  the  nature

of the job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to stress that although the income criterion

is  used  as  a  proxy  to  the  economic  contribution  of  the

foreigner,  it  is, however, not the sole criterion.   The  work

pass  system  is designed to provide flexibility in  considering

all  deserving  applications for work passes.   Foreigners  with

appropriate qualifications and skills may be given  "P"  or  "Q"

passes even though they do not meet the income criterion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness has

recommended to reduce total wage cost by 15%.  Hence, foreigners

working in Singapore may also suffer a cut in income.  But  they

will not be denied a work pass on account of their lower income.

Work  passes  will be issued or renewed based on the  factors  I

have  just pointed out.  Since the bulk of the 15% reduction  in

total  wages  will  come  from the 10 percentage  point  cut  in

employers'

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1804</b></font><br><br>



CPF   contributions  and  a  reduction  in  the  variable   wage

component,  reduction  in  basic wages,  if  any,  will  not  be

significant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will continue to exercise flexibility in assessing

work pass applications.  As such, there is no need to review the

income criterion used in assessing work pass applications.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, the Minister of State has

said  that the bulk of reduction of the foreigners' income would

come  from the CPF cut.  But most foreigners would actually  not

be  paying CPF.  So how would the Minister of State explain  the

reduction?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, let me repeat my answer

again.  Since the bulk of the 15% reduction in total wages  will

come  from  the  10  percentage  point  cut  in  employers'  CPF

contributions  and a reduction in the variable  wage  component,

reduction  in  basic wages, if any, will not  be  a  significant

component.   In that sense, we do not have to review the  income

criterion used in assessing work pass applications.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> But my point is that the foreigners who

need  employment passes usually would not have CPF payment.   So

if  there is a pay-cut, it will be completely from their pay and

not from CPF cuts

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> As I have said, we will look

into the various factors which include the income criterion.  So

even  if  the  income is reduced, it will not be the  only  sole

factor.  There are other factors which we look into in assessing

and considering new applications or renewals of work passes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister of State whether he

would  give  a  comprehensive statement  of  the  guidelines  or

criteria  that  are adopted by his Ministry in the  granting  of

employment passes?

asked  whether we have issued a comprehensive statement  of  the

guidelines on how we issue work passes.  In fact, on  24th  July

1998, my Ministry issued a press statement, which was carried in

all the local press, on the conditions and criteria

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1805</b></font><br><br>

for  issuing of the various work passes.  A press statement  has

been  given  and the details were in the press statement.   This

passes and if they need any clarification, they can always  come

to  the Ministry to get the clarification.  But a statement  has

been  issued  spelling out the criteria for  the  issue  of  the

various categories of work passes.

breath-analyser  tests on motorists against prosecuting  drunken

drivers after an accident.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic Police (TP) implements a range of comprehensive

measures that complement one another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1986, TP has been conducting random breath-analyser

tests  on  motorists throughout the year.  In the  first  eleven

months  of 1998, 1,093 persons were arrested for drink  driving,

including 156 who were involved in accidents.  Closer to festive

seasons  when people tend to drink more as part of  the  festive

celebrations,  TP steps up its public education and  enforcement

against  drink driving.  Anti-drink drive messages are published

in the media, advertised on taxis and buses and screened at pubs

and  discotheques.   Entertainment outlets and  restaurants  are

encouraged  to  provide taxi or car jockey services.    Together

with our deterrent laws, these measures have helped to ease  the

problem of drink driving and it is under control.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Out of the 1,093 cases

which  the  Minister of State mentioned, how many of these  were

persons  who  were arrested for drink driving in  the  first  11

words,  the balance, more than 85%, were arrested and they  were

not  involved  in accidents.  They were stopped either  at  road

the  exercise, ie, to clean up illegal parking.  This is because

they  can  be  a  danger  to other road  users  as  well  as  an

obstruction to other road users.  In any case, while people  who

have  been affected must make the necessary adjustments, on  our

part we have looked at whether or not more parking spaces can be

created.  Wherever possible, URA working with Traffic Police and

park  his  motorcycle  in a parking area  which  might  be  some

distance away would only add to the time factor?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the time factor may not be

very long, depending on what he delivers and for how many people

he  delivers.  It could be five minutes, 10 minutes, 15  minutes

or  20 minutes.  But the point is that if enough people do that,

then  the mischief that is being sought to be addressed  by  the

new measures would still be there.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister of State say whether

there is any policy not to prosecute the motorcyclists who leave

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1808</b></font><br><br>

their  motorcycles only for two to three minutes or  under  five

minutes and they are genuinely carrying out some delivery work?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I think Mr Jeyaretnam should

appreciate  the  intent behind the scheme, in other  words,  the

meaning of the single zig-zag line and the double zig-zag  lines

which are carefully chosen in terms of which areas they would be

put.  The Traffic Police has studied and assessed the situation.

I  think the House will agree that the problem has been  a  long

standing one which must be resolved.  If it is a single  zig-zag

line, the law says you can stop just to alight or to pick  up  a

person and then you have to go.  If it is a double zig-zag line,

you  cannot  even  stop.  So whether it is for one  minute,  two

minutes or three minutes, the law would have been flouted.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  if  the  Land  Transport  Authority   or   other

appropriate  authorities will consider  putting  up  full-height

steel  and  plastic barriers between bus stops  and  the  roads,

which  have been installed in some European countries, in  order

to  protect  passengers from rain and car splashes, as  well  as

possible  tragedies when incoming buses lose control  and  crash

into waiting passengers.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr John Chen Seow</b>

<b>Phun) (for the Minister for Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

barriers  had previously been tried out at some bus  stops.  Our

experience  is  that  these barriers impede passenger  flow  and

result  in  commuters moving into the bus bay  or  road  itself.

Worse  still,  commuters may find themselves sandwiched  between

incoming  buses  and the barriers, especially when  there  is  a

rush.  In such instances, barriers can become an obstacle and  a

danger. Nevertheless, LTA will continue to look into how  safety

at bus stops can be improved. To protect waiting passengers from

rain, LTA has provided screens at the back of our new generation

bus stops.  LTA

<div align="center"><b>CHINESE LANGUAGE IN SCHOOLS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in his National Day

Rally speech in 1997, the Prime Minister spoke of the importance

of   maintaining  our  Asian  heritage,  and  particularly   the

challenge  faced  by  the Chinese community in  maintaining  its

roots.  He highlighted two issues:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, reproducing a core group of Singaporeans who are

steeped  in  the Chinese cultural heritage, history,  literature

and  the  arts.   We need them to be Chinese language  teachers,

writers, journalists, community leaders, MPs and Ministers; and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1810</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, setting realistic standards for Chinese Language in

schools, standards that students of average ability can  achieve

with  a  reasonable  effort, especially students  from  English-speaking home backgrounds.

<br><br><i>The Challenge: Achieving two objectives in parallel</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following this, the Ministry of Education has done a

comprehensive review of the teaching of Chinese language in  our

schools.   The  study involved school principals from  both  SAP

schools   and   English-language   schools,   MOE's   curriculum

development  staff,  its policy officers, MOE's  ministers,  and

myself.  The study covered the following issues:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Encouraging more students to study Higher Chinese (HCL) in

schools, and achieve a deeper understanding of Chinese culture;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Developing a few more schools with a stronger Chinese

environment;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Reviewing the cultural content of the Chinese language

syllabus;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Setting the appropriate standards of Chinese Language (CL)

to be expected of the majority of students; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Addressing the problems of pupils who have difficulty

learning Chinese.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has accepted the study's recommendations.

The  policies  on teaching and learning Chinese have  long  term

implications  and  affect many teachers,  pupils,  and  parents.

Before  I  present the main changes, let me explain our  overall

approach to the problem.

<br><br><i>Constant philosophy; adapting implementation</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's long-standing policy on bilingualism and

learning   of  mother  tongues  in  schools  remains  unchanged.

English is and will remain our common working language.   It  is

the  language of global business, commerce and technology.   But

the  mother tongue gives us a crucial part of our values,  roots

and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1811</b></font><br><br>

identity.   It gives us direct access to our cultural  heritage,

and a world-view that complements the perspective of the English-speaking  world.  It provides us the ballast to  face  adversity

and  challenges with fortitude, and a sense of quiet  confidence

about  our  place in the world.  Maintaining our distinctiveness

and  identity as an Asian society will help us to  endure  as  a

nation.  This applies to all ethnic groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In teaching the Chinese language, we have two objectives:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To develop the pupil's linguistic skills, in terms of

listening, speaking, reading and writing; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) To transmit Chinese culture and traditional values through

the study of CL.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These twin objectives recognise the importance of CL as a

means of transmitting culture and values.  The level of language

skills  we can aim for will vary for different groups of pupils,

depending  on  their aptitudes and abilities.  But  we  want  to

inculcate  these  cultural  values  even  in  pupils  who   have

difficulty learning CL, if necessary, partly by using English.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the strategic goals have remained constant, their

implementation  has  changed over time,  to  adapt  to  changing

circumstances.   Most recently, in 1991 a committee  chaired  by

then  Deputy  Prime  Minister Mr Ong Teng  Cheong  reviewed  the

Chinese   language   syllabus.    It   recommended   significant

improvements to the teaching and learning of Chinese language in

schools.   These  have  since  been  implemented,  including   a

completely  new  set  of  textbooks for all  levels,  with  much

improved cultural content.

<br><br><i>Emerging trends</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the situation continues to develop. Several trends

affect the learning and teaching of CL in Singapore:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the language profile of Singaporean families is

changing  rapidly.   More  Singaporean homes  are  now  English-speaking.  Younger families are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1812</b></font><br><br>

much  more  likely to be English-speaking than older  ones.   In

1988,  only  20%  of  the Primary 1 cohort  came  from  English-speaking homes.  By 1998, the figure was 40%.  In 10 years,  the

proportion  has  doubled.  In other words, if you  look  at  the

children  in  school today, the `O' level group, only  20%  come

from English-speaking homes, but the Primary 1 group, which  has

just  started school, 40% come from English-speaking homes.   In

fact,  that  was last year's figures.  This year, Primary  1  is

43%.   The figure will continue to rise.  This will have a major

impact  on the learning and teaching of Chinese language in  our

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, globalisation and the knowledge economy are

putting  a premium on internationally mobile talent.  Successful

Singaporeans have many opportunities to live and work  overseas.

This  makes  it more critical to develop among them a  sense  of

Singaporean identity and belonging through learning  the  mother

tongue.   But it also means being more careful to make realistic

demands  on pupils learning CL, so that parents do not associate

a Singaporean education with burdensome CL requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, a counterbalancing factor is the continued rapid growth

and opening up of China.  China will be a major global player in

the  next century.  A command of CL will be a valuable asset for

many  jobs and careers, even if the person does not live or work

in China.  This is true of the public service, and will be so in

the  private  sector  also.   Singaporeans  brought  up  to   be

bilingual  will  be at a significant advantage.   This  gives  a

practical  purpose to learning CL, and will motivate  pupils  to

master the language.

<br><br><i>Approach to teaching Chinese</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want every Singaporean to study his mother tongue in school

for as long as possible, and to as high a level as he is capable

of.  The human brain has a finite capacity.  Only a minority  of

people - at most 10-15% of the population - have the IQ and  the

aptitude  for  languages to master two languages  equally  well.

Even fewer can think in more than one

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1813</b></font><br><br>

language.   But  most people can master one language  well,  and

have a working knowledge of a second.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our schools, English is the main medium of instruction, and

must  be  learnt  at the first language level.  For  the  mother

tongue,  we want pupils who can also to do it at first  language

level,  or  close  to  it.  For the rest of the  pupils,  mother

tongue  instruction  will have to be at second  language  level.

What  this  second language level consists of  is  an  empirical

question,  not a matter of opinion or dogma.  It is what  pupils

of  average  ability can achieve with a reasonable effort.   But

whether  a  pupil  learns his mother tongue at first  or  second

language level, we will provide him the support, facilities, and

incentives to make the effort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach to teaching the mother tongue, applied to Chinese,

will  enable us to nurture a Chinese cultural elite,  especially

from  among  those who have taken Higher Chinese and studied  in

SAP schools.  It will also help us build a broad base of Chinese

Singaporeans  who  have  learnt CL, and  will  continue  to  use

Chinese beyond the formal education system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effort required of pupils to study CL must be comparable to

the   effort  required  for  other  subjects.   It   cannot   be

disproportionate.   In  terms  of  results  at   key   milestone

examinations,  there is no major problem with CL.   Most  pupils

score  good  grades for CL, indeed even better than for  English

Language.  But this is not the full story.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education commissioned Forbes Research to do a

survey  of  teachers, students and parents on the  teaching  and

learning  of CL.  The survey found that many pupils are spending

more  time  studying  CL than other subjects.   Pupils  who  are

strong in other subjects but weak in Chinese spend almost  twice

as  much time outside of school studying Chinese as Mathematics.

More  surprisingly, even students who are strong in  Chinese  as

well  as  all other subjects spend almost 40% more time studying

Chinese  than  Mathematics, and 20% more time  studying  Chinese

than English.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1814</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education is working to re-orientate the entire

education system to an ability-driven paradigm.  It is designing

mass customisation models to allow each pupil to proceed as  far

as  he can in the areas in which he excels.  This applies to all

subjects.  We will adopt a more customised strategy to  teaching

CL  in  line with this overall approach.  We will set  different

target  levels of achievement for pupils of different abilities,

based  on what pupils of that ability level can attain  given  a

reasonable amount of effort.  This will encourage each pupil  to

strive for the highest standard that he is capable of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some pupils are not academically outstanding all-round, but they

have  a  strong  aptitude and interest in  Chinese.   We  should

provide them with encouragement and opportunities to study  HCL.

Many academically outstanding pupils do HCL.  But they often  go

on to study subjects like engineering or law, and pursue careers

in business or government where they no longer use much Chinese.

Fewer  take  up  professional  careers  centred  around  Chinese

language or culture, for example, in teaching, the media, or the

arts.  Encouraging more students whose academic results are good

but  perhaps not quite as outstanding to study HCL will help  to

build up a functional Chinese elite.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there are also talented pupils who are not

able  to cope with existing CL standards, even though they  have

high cognitive ability, do well in all their other subjects, and

have  good  potential to contribute to Singapore when they  grow

up.   We  should  not turn these pupils against CL.   We  should

encourage  them  to develop an interest and  a  basic  level  of

mastery, which they can build on later if they need to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pupils who have exceptional difficulties coping with CL are a

small  minority. But we cannot ignore their problems.  They  are

overwhelmingly male (in fact, three quarters or more are males).

Most but not all are from English-speaking homes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all pupils have the same home environment or natural ability

in  learning  CL.  We must recognise the large difference  which

the home language makes to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1815</b></font><br><br>

learning  CL.  A CL syllabus may present no problem to  a  child

who  speaks  Chinese  at home.  Chinese is probably  his  master

language.  His CL lessons reinforce and formalise words, phrases

and  grammar  which, in fact, he already knows.   But  the  same

syllabus  can  be extremely challenging for a child  who  speaks

English  at home, uses Chinese only occasionally outside  class,

and  for  whom  far from being a master language, Chinese  is  a

totally new language which has to be learnt from scratch.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also very significant that most of the pupils who are very

weak  in Chinese are boys.  This shows that the problem of  this

group is not just lack of motivation, or not trying hard enough.

It  reflects  innate differences between males and  females,  in

brain  function and aptitude for learning languages.   It  is  a

well  established fact that girls are much better  at  languages

than  boys.   We  must acknowledge and allow for  this  reality.

Even in this House, the ladies do very well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides customising the CL requirements to suit pupils of

different  abilities,  in teaching CL  we  need  to  achieve  an

appropriate  balance  among the language  skills  of  listening,

speaking,  reading  and writing, what they  call  in  Chinese  (

)  (ting, shuo, du, xie).  In adult life, most Singaporeans will

more  often speak and hear Chinese than read Chinese,  and  more

often  read  than  write  Chinese.   So  CL  teaching,  and   CL

examinations,  should emphasise more on listening  and  speaking

skills,  and  also on reading skills.  For Higher  Chinese,  the

present  emphasis on all four skills, including writing,  should

be maintained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support this approach to CL, we need appropriate

markers,  signals and incentives.  We need to encourage students

through many ways to make the effort to take CL seriously and do

their  best.   We already have schemes to recognise  and  reward

those  who  excel  in  CL.  We must build  on  these.   We  will

maintain key requirements, such as requiring students to meet  a

certain minimum standard in CL

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1816</b></font><br><br>

at  `O'  and  `A'  levels to proceed on to  junior  college  and

university.

<br><br><i>Key Proposals</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me highlight the specific changes to Higher Chinese and

Chinese teaching following from the review:

Encouraging More Students to Study Higher Chinese

Presently,  Higher Chinese is offered by 22%  of  upper  primary

school  pupils  and  12% of secondary school students.  We  will

encourage more students to study Higher Chinese, as this will be

the source of the future Chinese elite.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In primary schools we will relax the criteria for allowing

pupils  to  take  Higher Chinese.  They can do  so  provided  at

Primary  4 streaming they score Band 1 in Chinese Language,  and

at least Band 2 in English and Mathematics.

<br><br><i>Admission to SAP Schools</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be more liberal in allowing pupils to take Higher

Chinese,  at  both  primary and secondary levels.  In  secondary

schools,  currently only students who score in the  top  10%  of

PSLE, or who score within the next 10% and show their ability to

handle  both  English  and  Chinese are  allowed  to  do  Higher

Chinese.   We will broaden this to the top 30% of PSLE students,

subject to similar conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the top 10% of PSLE students are offered a second

chance  to  opt  for  SAP schools after  the  PSLE  results  are

published.  This is called the "Second Option".  We will broaden

this  "Second  Option" to the top 30% of PSLE students  who  are

eligible to offer Higher Chinese.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, these changes should increase the proportion of pupils

studying  Higher Chinese, especially at secondary  school.   How

many  actually opt for Higher Chinese will depend on the pupils'

choices,  but  we  hope  to  raise the proportion  in  secondary

schools from the current 12% to perhaps 15-20%.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1817</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Admission to Junior College</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, all students who obtain a pass in Higher Chinese are

given  two  bonus  points for JC admission.  To  encourage  more

students  to  take  up the Chinese Language  Elective  Programme

(LEP),  we  will award two additional bonus points for admission

into JC to students who enrol in the LEP programme.

<br><br><i>University</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At university, we will follow through to encourage more students

to  continue  doing Chinese at the polytechnic  and  university.

The  number  majoring in Chinese Language or Chinese Studies  is

unlikely to be large.  But our tertiary institutions offer other

courses  where  Chinese is useful, and ECAs related  to  Chinese

language and culture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NUS has undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in Chinese

Language   and  Chinese  Studies.   It  runs  two  popular   MBA

programmes  in  Mandarin which cater to the  needs  of  Chinese-speaking  Singaporeans  and  foreigners.   NTU  offers   Chinese

electives to balance the mainly technological orientation of its

undergraduate   courses,  and  to  broaden   its   undergraduate

education.   The  polytechnics offer electives  and  modules  on

Chinese  language and culture. Some polytechnic courses  contain

modules  conducted in Chinese.  There are active  Chinese  dance

and  drama  groups  and  Chinese orchestras  on  university  and

polytechnic campuses.  A small number of students visit China as

exchange students on study tours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE is exploring with the universities the possibility of

introducing bonus points for entry into Chinese Studies  in  NUS

for  those  strong  in Chinese.  It is also  exploring  offering

bonus  points for those who enter Communications Studies in  NTU

for  those  strong in mother tongue, not just  Chinese  but  any

mother tongue, at the AO- and A-Level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universities and polytechnics will strive to expand the

range  of options available, so that even those students who  do

not focus on Chinese language and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1818</b></font><br><br>

culture  can  keep up their interest in Chinese and  use  it  to

valuable advantage in their careers.

<br><br><i>Developing More Schools with a Stronger Chinese Environment</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we will develop more schools with a stronger Chinese

environment.  We will enhance the SAP programme to  improve  its

effectiveness  and reach. Both good academic performance  and  a

rich  Chinese  environment  are  important  attributes  of   SAP

schools.   The nine schools were chosen in 1979, 20  years  ago.

They  have  helped  to  preserve the best  of  the  old  Chinese

schools.   But  the  list of nine schools has not  been  updated

since,  although the geographical distribution of the population

has shifted, and the schools have developed at different paces.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have reviewed the nine SAP schools. Most are doing well, both

academically  and in terms of cultural enrichment.   However,  a

few  of  them have rather low proportions of students qualifying

to  take  Higher  Chinese,  and have fallen  in  their  academic

rankings.  MOE has discussed the problem with these SAP schools,

and will work with them to help them improve their standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will therefore retain all nine existing SAP schools on the

programme.   But in addition, we will make Nan Hua  Secondary  a

10th  SAP school.  Nan Hua will help to cater for the additional

PSLE students who will now be given a Second Option to apply for

a  SAP  secondary school, but who may not be admitted  into  the

most  popular SAP schools.  Nan Hua is also in Clementi, in  the

Western  part of the island, whereas most existing  SAP  schools

are in the Eastern half of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Junior College level, we will set up a third centre for

the Chinese Language Elective Programme (LEP), at Nanyang Junior

College,  as  the  Minister for Education announced  last  week.

There are two existing LEP programmes which are in Hwa Chong  JC

and Temasek JC.  However, Nanyang JC will continue to accept non-Chinese students.  Indeed it has vibrant non-Chinese cultural

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1819</b></font><br><br>

programmes.   It  organises  a dikir barat  competition  and  an

Indian drama festival every year, and I hope it will continue to

do so.

<br><br><i>Cultural Content of Chinese Syllabus</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the purpose of teaching Chinese is not purely utilitarian,

but to transmit heritage and values, the cultural content of the

textbooks is important. While learning the language, we want the

pupils  to  pick  up stories and fables, learn about  historical

characters, and imbibe lessons for life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have reviewed the contents of the CL and Higher Chinese

textbooks.  Compared to the textbooks which they  replaced,  the

present ones are far richer and more interesting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we can improve the cultural content of the textbooks

further.  MOE will do so progressively as part of its curriculum

review  process.  In addition, we will introduce  an  enrichment

course, "Introduction to Appreciation of Chinese", for all lower

secondary students in SAP schools, that means, Secondary  1  and

2.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have to be mindful to maintain a balance between

including more cultural material, and helping students to master

the  basics  of  the  language.  For example,  we  explored  the

possibility of reintroducing a few passages of classical Chinese

or  wen  yen  into  the HCL textbooks. But  the  advice  of  the

teachers  and  professionals was that the students  today  would

have  difficulty  coping  with them. We  also  cannot  make  the

contents  so  dense with cultural messages and historical  facts

that pupils cease to relate to them.  We must teach Chinese as a

living language to be used in our daily lives, and not something

from the past of antiquarian interest that is no longer relevant

to the present.

<br><br><i>Achievable CL Standards</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new textbooks for CL were written after the Committee

chaired by Mr Ong Teng Cheong had completed work and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1820</b></font><br><br>

published  their report.  Since their introduction of these  new

textbooks in schools, MOE has received feedback from parents and

teachers  that the new textbooks are significantly  harder  than

the  old  ones  which  they replaced.  This  had  not  been  the

intention  of  the Committee. Its aim had been  to  improve  the

cultural  content  of  the textbooks, and  not  to  raise  their

difficulty level.  We therefore convened a panel of professional

educators  to  review  the  level  of  the  new  textbooks,  and

specifically to compare them with old ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panel confirmed unambiguously that the new CL textbooks were

significantly  harder, in terms of words and  phrases,  grammar,

content, length of passages, and overall workload on students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has to be remedied. We will revise the primary and

secondary  CL  textbooks.  We will rewrite them to preserve  the

cultural content, but pitched at a level of difficulty  that  is

realistically  achievable  by  the  majority  of  students  with

reasonable  effort.  Simplifying the language of  the  textbooks

will  make their content more accessible to students.  This will

lighten their load, and restore the CL standard to roughly  what

it was before the present textbooks were introduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rewriting the CL textbooks will take some time. Meanwhile, as

an  interim  measure, schools will continue to use  the  present

textbooks, but will skip certain of the more difficult passages.

MOE  has  identified the passages to be excised, and will  brief

schools and parents and pupils on the details.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for HCL textbooks, the panel has found that the new textbooks

are  also  more difficult than the ones they replaced.  However,

feedback from schools is that HCL students are generally  coping

with them.  We will therefore not be rewriting the HCL textbooks

to reduce their level of difficulty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem of textbooks having become harder raises the

question whether examination standards have similarly crept  up.

Pupils and parents will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1821</b></font><br><br>

be  reassured  to  learn that CL examinations  have  not  become

harder.   We  have  verified  that  examination  standards  have

remained  constant,  especially  the  key  PSLE  and  `O'  level

examinations, as indeed was the intention all along.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we will be revising the design and format of the PSLE

CL  examinations,  to give greater weighting  to  listening  and

speaking  skills,  and  to  test the skills  that  we  want  the

children to learn. The type and nature of examination items will

be  revised.   There  should be a core of  questions  that  most

reasonably  proficient students will be able to  answer,  and  a

number of more difficult questions to discriminate students  who

are  above average and those who are outstanding from those  who

are  average.  The overall standard expected of pupils  will  be

maintained at the present level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will also review the `O' level CL examination

format, but our preliminary conclusion is that the changes  will

be fewer than for the PSLE CL examination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes in examination and textbooks will be introduced and

implemented  with  sufficient  notice  to  pupils,  parents  and

teachers to make the necessary adjustments.

<br><br><i>Pupils Weak in CL</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adjustment to the CL standard will mean the vast majority of

pupils  should be able to cope with CL.  However,  it  will  not

solve  the  problem of the minority of pupils who find  it  very

difficult  to  cope with CL even though they have no  difficulty

with  other  subjects in school.  Their number  is  still  quite

small,  but  the  proportion  of English  speaking  families  is

growing.  If we ignore the real problems these children have  in

learning  Chinese, they are likely to develop a lasting aversion

to  the  language and culture, which will be counter productive.

Worse,  public  support  for the CL  policy  from  parents  will

weaken, and the Government will come under pressure to lower  CL

standards across the board.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1822</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address this problem, we will introduce an alternative CL `B'

syllabus,  at the secondary and JC levels, for these  pupils  to

take.   This  should  help  them to  attain  a  basic  level  of

proficiency  in  CL,  and hopefully instil in  them  a  positive

interest in Chinese culture, traditions and values.  At the same

time,  it will enable us to maintain a higher standard  for  the

majority of pupils who have no difficulty coping with the Higher

Chinese and CL syllabi.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CL `B' syllabus will be similar in teaching and content to

CL,  but  with  simpler  texts and a  smaller  word  list.   The

examination  format will give greater weightage to listening  to

and speaking Chinese, as these are skills that are likely to  be

of most use to this group of pupils later on in life.  A pass in

CL  `B'  syllabus  at  the `O' and `A' level  examinations  will

qualify students to enter JC and university. However, the CL `B'

syllabus  result  cannot  be  used  to  compute  the  `O'  level

aggregate  for admission into JC, or earn any `A'  level  points

used for university admission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We decided against introducing CL `B' syllabus at the primary

level. We want to encourage all Chinese pupils to strive  to  do

well in CL and not give up easily, as our policy objective is to

have  all  Chinese Singaporeans learn CL for as long as possible

and  to as high a level as possible.  Currently, weak pupils are

putting  in extra effort at the PSLE, and the results show  that

the vast majority are coping.  MOE will monitor the situation in

primary  schools  and  re-consider this if  a  problem  develops

later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CL `B' syllabus is not intended as a soft option in lieu of

CL.   MOE will work out safeguards and incentives to ensure that

students who are able to cope with CL will continue to offer CL,

and  not opt for CL `B' syllabus.  MOE estimates that 80-90%  of

each cohort should be capable of doing Higher Chinese or CL,  so

only a minority will need to do CL `B' syllabus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE will work out the implementation details for this new

syllabus.   CL `B' can be made available to pupils  sitting  for

their  GCE  `O'  and  `A' level examinations  in  2001,  at  the

earliest.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1823</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Other Mother Tongues</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our review has focused on Chinese Language, the

philosophy  and  approach behind the CL  policy  framework  also

applies,  with  suitable  modifications,  to  the  teaching  and

learning of other mother tongue languages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE has started to review the Tamil Language syllabus to

ensure  that the standard is appropriate and not too  difficult.

We  will  introduce `B' syllabus for Tamil and  Malay,  if  this

proves necessary.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policies I have outlined are a refinement and updating

of  the  existing framework, not a dramatic change.   They  will

guide  the teaching and learning of Chinese Language in schools.

They  will  provide pupils and parents, teachers and  curriculum

specialists   a  clear  understanding  of  the  principles   and

rationale behind the Government's policies on Chinese Language.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes will help to maintain a Chinese cultural

elite  as  one important component to our multi-racial  society.

They  will also give all Chinese Singaporeans enough mastery  of

CL  to acquire the cultural values and heritage that are part of

our social DNA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shift in language patterns among Singaporeans reflects

the  broader changes in Singapore society.  We have undergone  a

momentous   transformation   in   one   generation    and    the

transformation  is  far  from  over.   Singapore  society   must

continue  to adapt, to stay abreast and relevant to  the  global

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will need to review our mother tongue policies

regularly, to take into account the continuing evolution of  our

society,  changes in the external environment, as  well  as  new

research  into  language  learning.  A  flexible  and  realistic

approach to teaching and learning mother tongues will keep  them

alive  and flourishing in Singapore and help us to maintain  our

Asian heritage and identity in a rapidly changing world.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1824</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand that some Members

would  like  to  debate  my statement  and  in  accordance  with

Standing Order No. 42, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after

hearing  Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, I fully  support

the  view taken in the shift that the Government is to make with

regard to the teaching and learning of the Chinese Language.   I

think the conditions are right for the Education Ministry to set

the  minimum  attainable standards in Chinese  Language  and  to

allow parents the choice to decide the pace and level of Chinese

proficiency  for their children without impacting their  overall

educational attainment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today parents need no persuasion to have their

children  learn  the  Chinese  Language.   I  think  all  of  us

understand the value, the usefulness and importance of  learning

the Chinese Language.  I am glad that the Education Ministry has

taken, as what DPM has mentioned, the ability driven approach in

the  learning  of all subjects, including the Chinese  Language,

and  the ability for the Education Ministry to want to customise

learning to match the pace and capability of the child.  This is

a  very  laudable move and it is not going to be easy.  But  the

fact that the Ministry is emboldened to make this ambitious step

is laudable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other interesting development, as I heard DPM Lee,

is the use of incentives for students.  I think we are trying to

remove the need to use disincentives or, in fact, penalties,  if

students do not do well and instead take the approach of  giving

incentives or, what we heard just now, bonus points for students

who  have  done  well  in language.  This is  a  right  approach

because  if  we were to provide incentives, there would  be  the

commitment on the children and parents in wanting to do well.  I

am  very sure that this will encourage and motivate the students

to  strive  for  even a higher level of attainment.   This  also

recognises that every child has got different aptitudes and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1825</b></font><br><br>

different  talents and it is important for us in our educational

policies  and system to allow for a variety of fields  that  can

accommodate the different talents, capabilities and aptitudes of

our children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, language learning is a life-long effort and what is

very  important is not to kill the interest of our children  and

to  develop an aversion to language learning.  To allow a  child

to  learn a language at his own pace and to give him the time to

do  it is important because later on in adult life, when he sees

a  need in wanting to polish and brush up the language, it  will

not  be difficult for him to do so.  I am glad that while laying

the  foundation of the children for primary education, we  allow

them  the  pace to attain the level necessary later on in  adult

life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that resources and time are limited, and

we  have  to be very focused in the kind of outcomes we want  to

achieve  in  the teaching and learning of the Chinese  Language.

We  have  heard  just now how students have spent an  inordinate

amount  of  time in Chinese with little beneficial  result  and,

worse, at the expense of other subjects.  And we have heard that

what  is  important in the Chinese Language is for us to achieve

listening, speaking and reading skills first, and later  on,  if

they  do  better,  to  move  on to writing  skills.   These  are

generally  the usefulness and the value of Chinese Language  for

the majority of Singaporeans and it is important that we look at

the  needs and usefulness to the average Singaporeans.  I  fully

support this move because it is very realistic and practical.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lastly, if I may add, one of the difficulties with

regard  to  the learning of the Chinese Language by students  is

really  the delivery, ie, the teaching methodology.  It is  here

that  the  teachers  can play their part to make  their  lessons

interesting,  the  subject content relevant, and  encourage  the

children to learn the language.  And I hope that the teachers in

the Chinese Language will do their best in this regard.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Dr Ow Chin Hock)</b>

<b></b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Singa-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1826</b></font><br><br>

pore has pursued the bilingual policy for more  than

30  years.   How  many bilingual talents have we nurtured?   The

population census in the year 2000 will be able to give  us  the

statistical figures with regard to bilingual Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that in the Education Ministry's survey on the

students' background, other than "English", "Mother Tongue"  and

"Dialect", an additional category of "Bilingual" be placed under

"Language Used at Home". I believe that there are many  families

nowadays who use two languages at home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the survival and development of our country and

society,  the bilingual policy should stay. This direction  must

not change. However, at present there are two trends that affect

the  implementation of the bilingual policy. The first trend  is

the  rise of China. As China's international stature grows  with

each  passing  day,  and as it becomes an  economic  power,  the

practical  value  of  spoken  and  written  Chinese  is  greatly

enhanced, and the status of Chinese culture is also raised.  The

result  of  this is that more parents are willing to  let  their

children learn Chinese, even Higher Chinese.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the vast majority of parents agree that by

learning  Chinese, their children can at the  same  time  absorb

Chinese  culture and traditional values. Moreover, Chinese  also

has  practical  value  in economics, the media  and  Cyberspace.

Whatever the motives or intentions for learning Chinese may  be,

this  external trend will have a positive effect on the learning

and the usage of Chinese.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another trend is the change in the linguistic profile

in Singapore homes. In 1988, 15 per cent of the Chinese students

came  from  English-speaking families. In 1998, this number  has

increased  to 33 per cent. If we consider only the  Primary  One

students, the percentage of students who are of English-speaking

family background increased from 20 per cent to 40 per cent over

the  past ten years. This figure will continue to grow with each

passing year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1827</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these Chinese students from English-speaking families face great difficulties when they learn

Chinese  because  they  lack the support of  a  Chinese-speaking

background  at  home.  This trend has negative  effects  on  the

learning of Chinese in Singapore.

<br><br><i>Different students have different abilities</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short run, we cannot determine the net result of the

convergence  of  these two different trends. But the  undeniable

reality  is:  different students will have different  abilities,

interests  and  motives in learning the different subjects.  The

aptitude  for  mathematics and science is often quite  different

from the aptitude for learning languages. Moreover, the language

spoken  at  home and the environment at school also  affect  the

students'   interest  and  ability  in  learning   a   language.

Therefore, it is impractical to demand that all students  attain

similar results in all their various subjects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the focus of Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's

proposed  framework for Chinese education is on  having  a  more

flexible  approach in teaching Chinese. This  puts  into  effect

Prime  Minister  Goh Chok Tong's proposal for a  Chinese  elite,

suggested  in his 1997 National Day Rally. This also solves  the

problem of the difficulties faced by some students from English-speaking homes in learning Chinese, referred to in PM's speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education will allow and encourage more

Chinese  students to opt for Higher Chinese. It  is  setting  up

another  Special Assistance Plan (SAP) school, and starting  the

third  Language  Elective  Programme  (LEP)  at  Nanyang  Junior

College.  It  is also giving these students more incentives  and

rewards   as  they  enter  junior  colleges  and  even  tertiary

educational institutions.  For those students who are interested

in  and have the aptitude for Chinese, this package will provide

them  with more opportunities to improve the standards of  their

Chinese. This package

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1828</b></font><br><br>

should   be  welcomed  by   the   Chinese-speaking

community.  It also satisfies the need for nurturing  a  Chinese

elite for the next generation.

<br><br><i>Fewer candidates for Chinese Literature</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education should also encourage those

students  with the interest and the ability to take  up  Chinese

Literature  besides Higher Chinese. During the opening  ceremony

for the 1997 Speak Mandarin Campaign, DPM Lee mentioned that out

of  28,000  Chinese students taking the `O' Levels,  only  2,500

took  the  Higher  Chinese paper. The number of  candidates  for

Chinese  Literature was even more dismal - a mere 500.  However,

the  number  of  English Literature candidates was  11,000.  The

Chinese   elite  ought  to  have  some  knowledge   of   Chinese

Literature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we cannot ignore those students who have

special problems in learning Chinese. In the announced framework

for teaching CL, they will be allowed to opt for the Chinese "B"

Syllabus  paper  (CLB), so as to reduce the pressure  they  face

when  they  learn Chinese. I believe that this  policy  will  be

welcomed by the parents of these students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the worry of the Chinese-speaking community is

this: if the choice were to be entirely left to the parents, the

number of students who opt for CLB would increase in tandem with

the  increasing  number of English-speaking  households  in  the

years  to come. Will CLB become a "soft-option" subject? Whether

these  students should become part of a "soft-option"  syndrome?

There are causes for worry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Ministry of Education should lay down a

clear  set of rules to prevent such an occurrence. For instance,

the  school  will have to assess and decide whether the  student

who  does  well for all other subjects except Chinese is  unable

and not unwilling (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) to

improve  his or her Chinese grades. Only then can he or she  opt

for  CLB.  Students opting for CLB must also consider that  they

will have to continue taking it in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1829</b></font><br><br>

junior colleges.  Their schools will not allow  them

to  switch to taking Chinese as a Second Language (CL2)  as  and

when they like it. In a nutshell, the framework for teaching  CL

not  only encourages students to take up Higher Chinese and CL2,

it must also set certain restrictions on students taking the CLB

option.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under present circumstances, I believe most Chinese

students  will  still  choose CL2. When the  Education  Ministry

revised  the CL2 syllabus, its guiding principle was to simplify

the  language  to make it easier to learn, without changing  the

cultural content. On the whole, this can be achieved.

<br><br><i>Zaobao's language more accessible</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a precedent. Years ago, the Ministry of Culture

requested  that the Chinese newspapers simplify their  language.

After years of effort, Lianhe Zaobao's language has become  more

accessible   and   readable,  and  its   contents   varied   and

informative. It is also one of the more authoritative newspapers

in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the setting of the syllabus must be guided

by  two  important principles. The first is to transmit  culture

and  the  right  values.  The  other  is  to  make  the  lessons

interesting.  We  need not be too insistent in other  areas.  In

1997, I went through eight Higher Chinese textbooks (a total  of

160  lessons) in two days. I really have to take my hat  off  to

the people who compile these textbooks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only do these lessons have to transmit cultural content

and  values, the lessons themselves aim to be as diversified  as

possible  in  literary form. Besides poetry, novels and  essays,

they also include formatted writing such as notices and letters.

In  terms  of subject matter, these lessons also aim to divesify

to  meet  different needs, and they include issues ranging  from

ASEAN   economic  cooperation  and  Southeast  Asia  non-nuclear

proliferation zone, to environmentalism and trade protectionism.

But  this is a thankless task.  The end result is that  some  of

the  lessons are boring and are not likely to stir the student's

interest.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1830</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the compilation of Chinese lessons, there is

actually  a  wide range to choose from . Besides Chinese  idioms

and  popular poems, excerpts from vernacular novels of the  Ming

and  Qing  Dynasties, Jin Yong's kungfu novels, the translations

of  "Aesop's  Fables"  and Edmondo De  Amicis'  "Cuore"  can  be

included,  as well as works by Yu Qiuyu, Cai Zhizhong,  Li  Lien

Fung,  You Jin, Ng Wai Choy and so on. The question is  deciding

which  ones to use and how to get the students interested.  Most

of  the  lessons must also include cultural content and transmit

values.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hope of the Chinese-speaking community is that all

Chinese students can achieve the highest achievable standards in

CL.  All  the  Education Ministry can do  is  to  encourage  the

majority  of the Chinese students to try their best  to  achieve

the  highest  standards  they  can  possibly  achieve.  But  the

ministry  can also encourage the more able students to  aim  for

higher standards, while at the same time enabling the less  able

students to grasp the most basic Chinese.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using such a flexible method to teach Chinese will not only

make learning Chinese in schools more effective and interesting,

more  importantly, it can make them use Chinese even after  they

leave their schools and make Chinese a living language.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in 1979 the

Government  officially merged all the schools into one  national

stream, with mother tongue listed as a compulsory subject in the

school's curriculum.  The Government also appointed a number  of

traditional  Chinese schools to become Special  Assistance  Plan

(SAP)  schools to preserve the fine Chinese culture and  values.

This  bilingual policy has been in implementation for 20  years.

Today, more people are speaking Mandarin than before.  In  terms

of  quantum, the usage of Chinese has indeed increased. However,

with  the retirement of the older generation of Chinese-speaking

intellects  who  had  worked  in the  cultural  and  educational

fields, there seems to be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1831</b></font><br><br>

a situation of the "the new crop is  still  in  the

blade  while the old one is all consumed".  Despite the increase

in  quantity,  the  quality  standard  of  Chinese  may  not  be

maintained.   On the other hand, some students have  encountered

many  difficulties in learning Chinese language, it is therefore

necessary to review and adjust Chinese curriculum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his policy statement today, DPM Lee points out that

although some students spend more time learning Chinese than  in

other  subjects, the result is not satisfactory.  In fact,  some

students could not even attain the lowest passing grade, but may

be quite good in other subjects such as Mathematics, Science and

English.  This  is  an illustration that the  ability  to  learn

Chinese  does not completely coincide with the ability to  learn

other  subjects.   In  order  to  prevent  having  the  students

spending  too  much  time on Chinese at  the  expense  of  other

subjects,  and to avoid the less-than-ideal results  in  Chinese

hampering  the  academic future of some good students,  DPM  Lee

proposed:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Revise the Chinese course curriculum to lighten the burden

of learning; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Introduce a new CL `B' paper for those students who could

not cope with the learning of the ordinary CL course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These proposals warrant our careful consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many students are having difficulty learning Chinese, and

sometimes  the  parents do complain about it. This  is  a  fact.

Therefore, we must prescribe the right medicine for the ailment.

Making  the  appropriate revision and adjustment is a necessity.

The  question  is how to revise the curriculum without  lowering

the standard of Chinese. Will the introduction of CL `B' make it

too  convenient for the students to swamp into opting  for  this

easy  way out in place of CL?  Then, it will actually lower  the

standard  of Chinese!  Therefore, I hope that when the  Ministry

of  Education is revising the curriculum they will make  Chinese

easy  to  learn, easy to understand, and yet at  the  same  time

maintain the present standard.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1832</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Dr Ow that the revision must be

carried out with caution. The conditions for switching to CL `B'

should  be  restrictive and not too relaxed, so that there  will

not  be  too many students attracted to it.  If the Ministry  of

Education can provide more incentives for those who stay  on  to

do  CL, then the number of students who want to shirk hard  work

and take an easy one will naturally be less.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether it is necessary to maintain the standard of

Chinese,  different people may have different views.  Some  feel

that Chinese is not an administrative or business language.   So

learning  Chinese is of no practical use.  That being the  case,

why should we force all the ethnic Chinese students in Singapore

to  learn Chinese?  If you go to China to do business,  you  may

need  to use Chinese.  But they are only the minority.   Such  a

reasoning  is not entirely groundless. As a matter of  fact,  in

Singapore, using English alone, you can still carry on with your

career development.  However, the choices before us are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Continue to implement our bilingual policy; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Let it be gradually transformed into a monolingual policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to develop into a monolingual society where

everyone  speaks only English, then our whole spiritual  outlook

and  characteristics will be changed.  It will be more difficult

for  us  to  maintain our cultural traditions and  to  inculcate

traditional values.  Our linkage with the ethnic Chinese  people

all over the world will be weakened.  It will be a great loss to

our  personal development and collectively it will not  be  good

for the long term benefit of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Chinese community there may be some people who are

still  worried  that  this policy adjustment  may  result  in  a

lowering  of  the  standard of the Chinese  language.   This  is

surely not the intent and purpose of the new measures.  DPM  Lee

has  just announced that the Government will be encouraging more

students  to  take  Higher  Chinese, and  the  Chinese  Language

Elective  Programme  (LEP)  will be introduced  at  the  Nanyang

Junior College.  These new measures will be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1833</b></font><br><br>

conducive to the maintenance  of  the  standard  of

Chinese,  and  have  a positive impact on  the  nurturing  of  a

Chinese elite.  Therefore, the worry is unnecessary.  As for  30

years  from now, would the status of the Chinese language remain

the  same as it is now in Singapore?  That would depend  on  how

our next generation evaluate the value of Chinese.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the revised policy annonced today, we would

enable  the  students to learn their mother tongue according  to

their  abilities, bearing in mind that at least  a  basic  level

must be maintained.  This is a sensible and flexible policy, and

it is worthy of our support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the policy statement by the

Deputy Prime Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  welcome  and  support  the policy statement  by  DPM  Lee  in

nurturing  a new generation of Chinese elite.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised mother tongue policy will, on the one hand, give

more  students the opportunity to study Higher Chinese in  order

that a group of  Chinese elite may be nurtured in Singapore, and

on  the  other hand, continue to look after the interest of  the

majority  of students who are taking  CL so that they  will,  in

the  process  of learning Chinese, generate certain interest  in

Mandarin  Chinese, let them appreciate the connotative  meanings

of the Chinese culture, and thereby moulding their integrity and

fine cultivation. This is indeed commendable!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those who have special difficulty in learning Chinese, we

have also made special arrangement for them to take a simpler CL

`B' paper, to lighten their burden of learning, and to encourage

them to continue to keep in contact with their mother tongue.  I

think this is also something that cannot be faulted.  As such, I

support the policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in implementing this new policy, I have the following

suggestions for the Ministry of Education to study and consider:

In  the Higher Chinese lessons, students should be appropriately

taught the poli-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1834</b></font><br><br>

tical, economic, cultural and historical background

of  China.   This  will  help the Chinese elite  have  a  fuller

understanding of China by simultaneously adopting  the  Oriental

and  Western perspectives.   To a certain degree, they  will  be

able  to look at things Chinese - China's social formation,  the

Chinese  way  of thinking, the Chinese way of doing things  from

the  viewpoint of the Chinese people, and not just make comments

or pass judgement from the angle of Singaporeans or Westerners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my experience in investing in China, I truly

understand  that  the  Chinese-educated from  Singapore  have  a

distinct advantage over others in China. They are like  fish  in

the  water.  They  have created many business opportunities  and

interests  beneficial  to Singapore.  But,  for  those  English-educated  from  Singapore,  they do not  understand  the  actual

conditions  in  Singapore, and tried to apply the Singapore  and

western management model and investment style in China.  In  the

end, they run into a lot of trouble and problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the adaptability of the Chinese-educated

and the English-educated in the China market and the reading  of

the  investment environment in China are closely linked to their

educational background.  The Chinese-educated  are in  a  better

position  to  understand the Chinese culture, language, thinking

and  way  of  doing  things, and make  flexible  adjustment  and

coordination  to  deal  with the problems encountered  in  their

investment  projects.   I feel that for  Singaporeans  to  work,

invest  or do business in China, they must, first of all,  spend

some  time  to  study the four "Great Classics" in  the  Chinese

literature:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Dream of the Red Chamber. This thick book of a few

thousand  pages paints a picture of the complexity of  the  huge

extended family in ancient China. The story evolves around a big

family  compound  known as Dai Guan Yuan  and  talks  about  the

conflicts  and struggle among the clans within the  family,  and

the intricacies in coordinating and resolving these problems;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1835</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The Water Margin. It enables you to

understand the meaning of yi qi (righteousness), and  learn  how

108 heroes' vastly different backgrounds could come together and

be united like brothers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Journey To the West. It tells you how imaginative the

Chinese  people were, even some centuries ago.  The  Monkey  God

could  pluck  a few hairs from his body, give them  a  blow  and

hundreds  of little monkeys were cloned.  As far back as  a  few

thousand  years  ago, the Chinese people had  already  had  this

imagination of human-cloning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Romance of the Three Kingdoms. By reading this book,

you  will appreciate the high intelligence and clever strategies

of  the  Chinese  people in their struggle for  power,  and  arm

yourself with the proper tools to do business with the people in

China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can enhance our students' knowledge of the Chinese culture

through  our Higher Chinese lessons, this will be of great  help

to  our  grooming  of  Chinese elite.   We can  also  choose  to

publish simplified versions of all these four books suitable for

children  and  teenagers, make them easier for our  students  to

study them and thereby  enhancing their interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second approach is to find out the real reason why our

students   are   having   problems  learning   Chinese.   Today,

Singaporeans  who  learn Chinese basically have  no  problem  in

listening  and speaking.  Most of them can understand and  speak

some  simple Mandarin.  But in reading and writing, they face  a

lot  of  difficulties.  This is mainly because they do not  have

too  many  opportunities  to get in  contact  with  the  Chinese

language but have generally more exposure to English language.

When  I  discussed the problem of the learning  of  the  Chinese

language  with my children, they told me that their standard  of

English  is much higher than that of their Chinese.  Even  then,

compared  to  other  students, my children are  more  fortunate,

because in school, they have ample

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1836</b></font><br><br>

opportunities to be exposed  to  English.   So  the

standard  of  their English is quite good.  However,  they  were

born  in  a  Chinese-speaking family which is  rich  in  Chinese

cultural  atmosphere.  Apart from good English, they  also  have

quite  a  lot of exposure to Chinese (although I often criticize

their   writing in  Chinese as being unreadable rubbish).  Their

classmates always feel that they are at a disadvantage when they

come to the learning of Chinese, because they were not born in a

Chinese-speaking family, and they therefore claim that it is not

fair to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to urge the Government not to make it

too easy for students from English-speaking families to drop the

learning  of  their  mother tongue.   Unless  it  is  absolutely

necessary,  the  Government should  not  allow  the  parents  to

withdraw  their  children from the normal CL course  and  switch

them  over  to  the lower CL `B' course. At the same  time,  the

Government  should  prescribe  the  medicine  according  to  the

ailment  and find out the reasons for these students' difficulty

in  learning  Chinese.  Is it the textbook, the teaching  method

and environment, or the attitude of the parents themselves?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, I would like to raise another point concerning

the  teaching  of functional words, grammar, word discrimination

and  rhetoric  in  Chinese.  I feel that we should  not  rigidly

teach  these  things in our teaching materials. As a  matter  of

fact, even after my graduation from the senior middle school,  I

did  not  know  there  were  such things  as  functional  words,

grammar, word discrimination or rhetoric in Chinese.  But  after

I  graduated,  I  could write Chinese, I could read  Chinese,  I

could understand Chinese, and I could speak Chinese.  Therefore,

in  the  teaching of Chinese, all materials  which unnecessarily

add on to the burden of the students should be expunged from the

textbooks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese word is an ideograph. Chinese is not a romanised

language.  One has to learn the individual Chinese characters to

build  up  his vocabulary. There must be some ways to  make  the

learning  of Chinese characters interesting.  This is  something

that is lacking in our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1837</b></font><br><br>

Chinese  textbooks. Perhaps  we  should  set  up  a

committee  to oversee the preparation of textbooks, particularly

their  contents.  The Government should not just  formulate  the

policy  and  let the writers have a free hand to write  whatever

they like.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third suggestion is that we should not let the Chinese

community  feel  that the standard of Chinese will  be  lowered.

The  Chinese  community  is  most concerned  about  the  Chinese

culture, Chinese values and the Chinese language, and they  have

been  working very painstakingly and faithfully in  helping  the

Government  preserve the Chinese cultural heritage.   Therefore,

when  we  promote Higher Chinese, we must also  look  after  the

small  minority  of  students who have  difficulty  in  learning

Chinese.  That is why the Ministry is setting a simpler  CL  `B'

paper   for  these  students.   We  should  assure  the  Chinese

community  that the standard of mother tongue in Singapore  will

not be lowered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, we must restrict the number of students opting

for  CL `B', as suggested by Dr Ow Chin Hock.  Only students who

have  good  learning ability for other subjects,  but  for  some

reasons  could not cope with the learning of Chinese,  shall  be

allowed to opt for CL `B'. It is only with the recommendation of

the  teachers that they are allowed to take CL `B' in  place  of

CL.  Otherwise, many ethnic Chinese students will use the excuse

of having come from English-speaking families to readily give up

CL and switch to CL `B'.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, I feel that the contact time should not be reduced for

the  learning of Chinese.  I was educated in the Chinese stream.

During my school days, Chinese was the medium of instruction for

all  the  subjects,  such as history, geography,  science,  etc.

Only  EL2  was taught in English.  Consequently, no  matter  how

much  time  I  spent, how much efforts I made to  learn,  I  was

unable to master my English.  This was because I did not have  a

really good environment to be in contact with English

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1838</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the situation in Singapore is just the reverse. Other

than  the  subject "Chinese", the textbooks and the teaching  of

all the other subjects are in English.  English is the medium of

instruction.   In  the  circumstances, with  only  one  subject,

Chinese,  how can you expect the students to master the  Chinese

language?   It  is  certainly not easy!  More  importantly,  the

Government  must ensure that the students have enough  time  and

opportunity  to  learn  Chinese.   Therefore,  I  suggest  that,

whether it is Higher Chinese, CL2, or CL `B', the exposure  time

should  not  be  reduced.  The teaching periods  should  not  be

reduced  for  diverting to the other subjects.   If  any  school

wishes  to reduce the Chinese periods, its principal must  first

seek  the  approval of the Ministry of Education,  stating  very

valid  grounds, before it can be done.  The opportunity to learn

Chinese must not be sacrificed in order for the school to strive

for higher ranking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, we must place more emphasis on the economic value of

Chinese language.  Over the past few decades, the Government has

been  doing  a lot for Chinese Language and this is for  all  to

see.  We often emphasise that the importance of learning Chinese

is  in  the preservation of our Chinese culture, Chinese values,

Chinese  tradition  and Chinese heritage.   However,  today,  we

should  go one step further to emphasise the economic  value  of

the  Chinese  language,  and  the impact  it  may  have  on  the

individuals, the society, and the nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always feel that during our past 30 years of nation-building,

if  we did not have English, we would not be able to achieve the

sort  of  economic development we have today.  Our people  would

not be able to enjoy such a high standard of living.  But in the

next  30 years, if we do not add in the Chinese language to  the

English  Language, there will be great obstacles to  our  future

prosperity and progress.   We may find it very difficult to move

one  step higher in our economic development, and there will not

be  good  years, year after year.  This is because  the  Chinese

language will play a very important economic role in the 21st

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1839</b></font><br><br>

century.  If our parents and  students  today  only

recognise  the  economic  value  of  English,  and  neglect  the

economic  value  of  the Chinese language  in  the  Asia-Pacific

region,  we  will  be  lagging behind  others  in  the  economic

environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore suggest that, apart from emphasising on the

intrinsic values of the Chinese language in preserving  cultural

and traditional values, the Government should also emphasise the

economic  value and importance of the Chinese language  so  that

students  will be more pro-active in taking a positive  attitude

towards  the  learning of Chinese, just as the  way  they  learn

their  English,   rather  than taking  a  passive  and  negative

attitude.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, review and re-study the possibility of reviving

the Chinese school. Some 20 to 30 years ago, because of the poor

employment  prospects  for  the graduates  of  Chinese  schools,

parents sent their children to English schools, resulting in the

survival  of the Chinese schools being threatened.  The  Chinese

schools   were   facing  extinction.   Fortunately,   with   the

Government's strong defence of the Chinese language to  preserve

the  excellent  heritage of the Chinese  culture  and  the  fine

traditional values, the Chinese language has been able  to  grow

steadily and healthily in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the economic reform and open-door policy of China, the

economic  value  of the Chinese language has become  higher  and

higher.  Learning better and more Chinese is very  important  to

the   future   economic  development  of  Singapore.    In   the

circumstances,  this may be an appropriate time to  re-open  the

case   for  us  to  re-study  and  review  the  feasibility   of

establishing one or two Chinese schools in Singapore.  For those

who  excel in Chinese Language, they can concentrate on majoring

their CL1, with  EL2 being offered as an optional subject.  This

is  to deal with the changes in the economic development of  the

Asia-Pacific region.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1840</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten years ago, if I were to make this suggestion, I would be

accused  of  turning back the wheel of history or following  the

beaten track.  But today, if we can coolly and objectively study

and  review  this matter, it will be of benefit  to  the  future

economic  development  of Singapore.  I  urge  the  Ministry  of

Education to consider this suggestion of mine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the policy statement of the Deputy Prime Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, I would like to join the debate

to welcome the policy, not as the Members who have spoken before

me,  as  a  bilingual person, but as, practically, a monolingual

Singaporean.   I come from a family where for three generations,

they  have  spoken English in the home and this has disarmed  me

for  bilingualism, especially in Chinese.  But I had, in my  own

life  time, come to appreciate Chinese literature in translation

as  well as to feel, over the last years, a certain disadvantage

in simply having ordinary discourse and discussions and dealings

with  my  fellow  Singaporeans.  So I found  myself  in  America

trying  to  learn Chinese because there they start  from  ground

zero.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I welcome the policy, in the sense that the future will

be  better  for  people like me.  Not that  we  will  take  easy

options.  Recently, my wife and I have had a child and the  idea

of  putting  the  child through the rigorous  Chinese  Language,

which  is now required in school, was of great concern to us  as

with  all  parents in Singapore.  Coming from a purely  English-speaking  background,  the effort of the child  would  be  quite

tremendous  as the report suggests sometimes is the case.   More

than that, we are concerned that the child will be a drag on his

fellow  students.   Being  a teacher myself,  we  know  how  the

slowest  child  sometimes holds back the whole class.   We  have

also  come to find from our friends that parents themselves make

an  effort, in the sense that they too have to relearn the basic

Chinese  to  pass it on to their children.  And after  this,  we

thought perhaps the only happy person in this whole exercise was

the private tutor who would be well employed for many years with

my child.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1841</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been unintended consequences of a very good bilingual

policy.   There  have been concerns that people might  think  of

migration  because  of the Chinese Language  requirements.   And

there  has been concern that the increasing emphasis on  Chinese

would  create  some  unintended divisions  between  the  Chinese

Singaporeans  and  other  non-Chinese  or  non-Chinese  speaking

Singaporeans  and  I think the new policy must  be  welcomed  in

attending to these unintended consequences.  I think that it  is

correct   also  that  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  has   spoken

straightaway of disincentives so that Singaporeans will not  opt

for  soft options.  There must be sufficient incentives to study

Chinese  and sufficient disincentives to make sure none give  up

without sufficient effort.  In other words, I am cognisant, as I

am sure the Deputy Prime Minister is, that this is not the start

of  a  monolingual Singapore, which I will not welcome.   But  I

think  similarly, it should not be too much on the  other  side,

that  it cannot be too hard to opt for the CL `B'.  And so, this

will  require a fine balance by the Government and the  Ministry

concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there are two things, if I may suggest. The first is

that  in CL `B', the question of cultural content must be looked

at using English or bilingual text.  The second is that this new

policy  may be a good opportunity to reassure Singaporeans  that

in  the  same school, we can cater to different needs,  that  in

addition  to  the  SAP schools, which are predominantly  Chinese

pupils  of Chinese-speaking backgrounds, in the same school,  we

can  accommodate  many more Singaporeans of  different  language

abilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Chinese elite, I, as an English-speaking Singaporean,

would  hold  out a reassurance that there are incentives  and  a

growing social importance to speak English, which is why I tried

to  learn Chinese at my late age.  And similarly, that is why  I

would  like my child to learn to speak Chinese.  People want  to

speak  Mandarin  and  Chinese.  The  rise  of  China,  which  is

foretold  by  many  people,  will  not  mean  just  an  economic

incentive to speak Chinese.  The rise of China will lead to a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1842</b></font><br><br>

rise in soft power, that is power in terms  of  the

politics  and  economics will translate to a growing  importance

attached  to the language, to the culture, and not just  to  the

traditional culture, but new popular cultures emerging from East

Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The social preference in Singapore for bilingualism and for

Chinese-speaking exists and should continue.  But what I welcome

in  the  new  policy is a reduction of compulsion.   As  for  my

little  son, I want him, like all good Singaporeans, to  try  to

succeed  despite whatever disadvantage my unfortunate upbringing

has  given  him.  And, therefore, I welcome the new policy.   We

will  reward him for his efforts but I think we will not  punish

him  for his background.  We will allow him to try his best  but

will  give  him a chance to succeed when he cannot be among  the

very best in Chinese.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do

not   think  that  many  Singaporeans  will  argue  against  the

bilingual  policy adopted in our current education system.   The

objective of such a policy is very clear.  It is necessary for a

multiracial  society  to  possess a common  language  that  will

bridge  cultural differences and ensure a mode of  communication

between  ourselves and the rest of the world.  Yet, at the  same

time,  our roots and Asian heritage should not be sacrificed  in

lieu of this practical necessity.  But while we are very certain

that  our  objective  and  goal  is  to  achieve  an  acceptable

bilingual  ability  in all our students, the  implementation  of

this goal and objective may not be as straightforward a task  as

one  may  assume.  In fact, it has proven to be the most complex

and difficult task for the Ministry of Education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everchanging circumstances in this world call for a dynamic

and  fluid  education  system which our population  can  benefit

from.   Language has always been a very emotive issue to  tackle

in  a  multiracial  society like ours.  I  must  compliment  the

Ministry for its tenacity and single-mindedness in pursuing  the

best solution towards the attainment of our national objectives.

But such is the immense nature of this mammoth task

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1843</b></font><br><br>

that the results of its effort may  sometimes  turn

out to be less than perfect.  What is comforting to note is that

the  Ministry  has not been afraid of changing course  when  the

situation has called for it.  The change that is being  proposed

by  the  DPM's Ministerial Statement is therefore another effort

in  fine-tuning the existing bilingual system in order that some

of the problems can be addressed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It recognises that not all students can be proficient in

two   languages  and  these  include  even  some  of  the   more

academically above average students.  The proposal  to  increase

the percentage of students in taking up Higher Chinese should be

welcomed  as  it  offers more opportunities to  those  who  have

proven to be competent and have the inclination and interest  to

take  up  the  challenge  of learning the  Chinese  Language  in

greater depth.  Here, I do not want to elaborate on the benefits

from being able to study Chinese at a higher level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of CL `B' to those less endowed with this

special skill will  enable them to have at least the opportunity

to  acquire a certain working knowledge of the language  without

being  pressurised, to study something which they  perceive  for

whatever reasons they are incapable of.  This would ensure  that

they  can  concentrate their best effort on  other  subjects  of

their choice.  This basic working knowledge will also be able to

provide them a foundation that will allow them to improve  their

proficiency  in  the  language at a later stage  in  their  life

should a need arise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point of time, I would like to share a personal

experience  regarding the study of Chinese Language.   My  son's

academic  achievement in school had been quite  good,  but,  for

some  inexplicable reason, he developed a mental  block  towards

the  learning of Chinese.  I do not think it is because  of  his

family  background because both my wife and I are more  or  less

effectively  bilingual  and  our daughter  has  managed  to  get

through  the `O' level Chinese without much problem.  But  after

much effort and frustration, we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1844</b></font><br><br>

tried  to  remove this mental  block.   With  great

regret, we had to advise him to drop the subject during the  `O'

level  examination in order that he could concentrate  on  other

subjects as it was obvious that in no way he could obtain a pass

in  Chinese  in  the  `O' level at that time  when  the  Chinese

syllabus was quite heavy, the teaching method very rigid and the

examination process uncompromising.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the greater consideration was that we had to ensure

that  he  would  not be unduly pressurised into doing  something

that  would have an adverse effect on the progress of his  other

subjects.  It has proven to be the right decision as after being

released  of  the  unnecessary pressure, he  managed  to  obtain

fairly  good  results in all his other subjects.  Unfortunately,

because  of the lack of a pass in Chinese, he was unable  to  be

admitted  to a junior college.  Until today, he still carries  a

certain  amount  of bitterness in him and an anger  towards  us.

Because at that time, he just could not accept the unfairness of

it all that some of his classmates were admitted into JC with 15

or 16 points, whereas a 8 pointer like him was refused admission

and deprived of his chance of going into a local university, all

because he could not master a subject which he considers  of  no

apparent relevance to his future career.  I must say that he was

lucky  because  we were in a position to send  him  overseas  to

complete   his  higher  education.   He  is  now   a   qualified

professional with a Masters degree in architecture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder how many less fortunate bright students have

missed out the opportunity to further their education because of

this.  However, the twist of the whole story is that now my  son

has  to  go to China to do business.  How he had wished that  he

has  at  least  some basic working knowledge to  build  upon  in

acquiring   a   higher   proficiency  in  the   very   important

communication  tool  in order to help him in  dealing  with  his

counterparts  in China.  I am sure now he has a torrid  time  to

make  himself  understood or to understand his  counterparts  in

China  when he is over there doing business.  I suppose  now  he

will have to find a way to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1845</b></font><br><br>

re-immerse himself into the task of  studying  this

very complex language.  How?  I do not know.  Therefore, I think

the  latest move by the Ministry will definitely improve greatly

the  chance of us achieving our national objective, and  at  the

same  time,  ensuring  maximum opportunity  in  giving  to  each

student to exploit his potential to the fullest according to his

ability and pace of learning the Chinese language.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to conclude by sounding a word of caution.

One  can  have  a  perfectly correct policy  and  a  very  clear

objective  and  even a well worked out system  in  reaching  our

goal,  but  without the correct implementation programme  and  a

team of highly efficient teachers to carry out the task, all the

effort  and  time  spent  in drawing up the  blueprint  will  be

wasted.   The teaching of Chinese, more than any other  subject,

needs  creativity and flexibility.  How to sustain the  interest

in  learning  this  very  complex and  difficult  subject  is  a

challenge  in  the  Education administration  and  the  teaching

profession.  I hope that with the latest improvements  made,  it

will  bring us nearer to our goal of achieving a truly bilingual

education system that can carry us towards the next millennium.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,   every  time  when  we  talk  about  the  language  issue,

particularly the Chinese language, people will say it is a  very

sensitive issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever we talk about revising the curriculum for the

teaching  of  Chinese, the Chinese-educated would say  that  the

Government is going to lower the standard of Chinese  again.  As

for  the English-educated parents, their concern is whether  the

standard of Chinese is too high for their children to pass.  But

after  some  20  years of fine-tuning, some 80% to  90%  of  our

students  seem to be quite comfortable with the present standard

of the Chinese language in our schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Dr Ow mentioned that in Chinese, we learn to

talk,  listen, write and read.  But there are many  Singaporeans

who  never  studied  Chinese  in school.   They  may  not  speak

Mandarin well, but

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1846</b></font><br><br>

they  can  certainly sing well  in  Chinese  during

karaoke  sessions!  Our MP for Potong Pasir, Mr Chiam  See  Tong

who  is a typical English-educated, may not speak Mandrain well,

but  we all know that he sings the famous Chinese song, Rong Shu

Xia  (Under the Banyan Tree) very well and raised a lot of funds

in the process.  To sing this song well, you need not only a lot

of  stamina  but  also a good understanding of  the  lyrics  (in

Chinese)  in  order that you may express your feelings  in  your

singing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, on the whole, we have catered to the needs of the

majority  of Singaporeans.  Perhaps many Singaporeans are  still

having  difficulties  learning  Chinese  and  do  not  have  the

necessary breakthrough in their mentality.  So this announcement

by DPM is very timely.  In other words, it will not only be able

to cater for the majority of Singaporeans, but in fact, everyone

in Singapore.  Yet, many people are still worried that under the

new  policy  CL  `B' may result in the standard of  the  Chinese

language  being  lowered once again. On  the  other  hand,  many

Singaporeans  are worried because more and more  youngsters  are

speaking  Mandarin. You hear people speaking Mandarin everywhere

-  in  the  buses,  in  shopping  complexes,  and  even  in  the

university  campus.  They fear that the standard of English  may

be lowered.  This is characteristic of our Singapore society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look around the other countries, lowering of the

standard  of  languages is a universal problem.  In  China,  the

parents  are  complaining that their children are  not  learning

Chinese  well enough, while the English people are worried  that

their  children do not speak good English.  This  is  a  general

trend.  When we go into the 21st century, what is the  challenge

for  Singapore?  We want to compete in the market.  We  want  to

compete for talents.  We want to attract foreign talents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, a few Members have spoken about the emergence of

China  as  a  new economic power.  The situations all  over  the

world  are  different.  We want to develop a  Chinese  elite,  a

Malay  elite, a Tamil elite.  We want talents. Whether they  are

the  elites in the field of language or in the field of  science

and technology, we want these talents.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1847</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM Lee mentioned that we are going to have one

more SAP school.  Is it a good thing or a bad thing?  I think it

is  a  good  thing,  in  terms  of  quantity  and   geographical

distribution.  We feel that the SAP school is a pillar  for  the

Chinese  community.  I think we should not allow this pillar  to

lose  its  significance.  Just now, DPM has said that  some  SAP

schools  are not doing well academically.  This is a  matter  of

great concern to the Chinese community.  For those schools which

are  not doing well, they should ask the Board of Governors  and

their  Old  Boys Association to find some ways to bring  up  the

standard,  and  ranking, of these schools, so that  the  Chinese

community will not feel that they are losing this pillar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, within the last two to three decades, we

have  already evolved into a bilingual society.  This is a  good

thing  because  in  such an environment, we  would  be  able  to

develop multi-lingualism.  I think Singaporeans should help  our

fellow  Singaporeans.  We should support fellow Singaporeans  so

that everyone would be able to develop our own potentials.   For

those who may be weak in the language, we should find some  ways

to  help  them  clear  their obstacles,  so  that  their  future

development will not be hampered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the policy statement.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support

the mother tongue language policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that the Singapore students have done very well.

The  more able ones who are good in Chinese should be encouraged

to   do   Chinese.  In  other  words,  they  should   be   given

opportunities to study Higher Chinese at our SAP schools and  at

junior  college,  these students should  be  enrolled  into  the

Language Elective Programme.  They will then be able to continue

to   teach   and  promote  our  Chinese  language  and  culture.

Moreover,  they  should be able to conduct businesses  in  China

with a knowledge of Chinese.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have listened to Dr Ow Chin Hock and I think Mr Peh Chin

Hua and also DPM and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1848</b></font><br><br>

the  words "Chinese elite" kept  cropping  up.   In

fact,  we  should  avoid labelling such group as  Chinese  elite

group.  Being proficient in Chinese do not qualify them as elite

Chinese.  What do we call those Singaporeans later on who do  CL

`B'?   For  that matter, what type of Chinese  am  I?   I  am  a

Singapore  born  Chinese, educated in English, I speak  Hokkien,

Malay  and  a  few words of Mandarin.  I do not belong  to  this

elitist  group.  So what type of Chinese am I?  I  therefore  am

not comfortable with the words "Chinese elite".  I think it is a

very  divisive term and we should in fact do away with this term

and  just  continue with what we intend to do, that is,  to  get

able Chinese students to do Higher Chinese so that we can have a

group  of good Chinese educated Singaporeans to help us to teach

our  next generation of Chinese better and also to encourage our

Singaporean Chinese who have to do business in China to do well.

I  think  that should be it.  I do not think we should use  such

words  like  "elitist"  But when we make this  call  to  improve

Chinese  teaching among our Chinese, I think we should  also  be

aware that in a multi-racial country like Singapore, we must not

give  the  non-Chinese the impression that we are  doing  it  at

their expense.  Therefore, I agree with DPM that those Malay and

Tamil   students  who  do  well  should  also  be  given   equal

opportunities to pursue their course of study in Tamil or Malay.

If  there should be sufficient numbers, like DPM said, we should

actually form a class to take them in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Singaporean English-educated Chinese whose

children are not very good in Chinese, I welcome the DPM's  call

that  we should have another syllabus, CL `B'.  But I also agree

with  some  of the Members who have called for caution  that  we

must  not  allow  these English-educated Chinese  to  let  their

children  do  this  softer option of CL  `B'.   As  an  English-educated   Chinese,  I  realise  that  I  am   at   a   terrible

disadvantage.  If I had not known Hokkien, I do not think I  can

harness the number of votes in Ayer Rajah.  But that also is not

a   consolation.    I   would  really  encourage   Singaporeans,

especially  the  English-educated Singaporeans, to  continue  to

strive hard to ask

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1849</b></font><br><br>

their children to do Mandarin well.  Mr Simon Tay is

an  English-educated Chinese and, he, like me,  would  want  our

Singaporeans to continue to do Chinese as well as their English.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome the

DPM's  timely announcement on the change of the teaching of  the

second language in our schools.  I support the proposal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been nearly 20 years since this House last

considered  any  major policy announcement  which  affected  the

teaching  of  the second language in our schools.  If  you  will

recall Sir, the then Education Minister Dr Goh Keng Swee and his

team of systems engineers went about reviewing our strategies to

streamline our efforts to bring about an efficient and effective

education policy for the country.  While the Goh Report  brought

about  many  changes, the one major impact  which  left  a  deep

impression in our schools relates to streaming and the  teaching

of  the  second  language.  The report had laid  the  foundation

today  for the teaching of the second language at the two levels

as we know it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underlying the report is the assumption that students must

know their mother tongue to preserve their cultural roots.   The

fear, as I understand then, was that we did not want our society

to become a loose limb calypso society speaking a pidgin form of

Chinese,  Tamil or Malay and without any real cultural  link  to

the  countries of origin.  Certainly, we did not want  to  be  a

West  Indies  of the East.  However, because we appreciated  the

different learning abilities of our students, we allowed them to

learn  the  second  language according to  their  ability.   The

objective  then  was to let the children know  enough  of  their

second  language so that they should be able to read a newspaper

published  in  the  second language.   Indeed,  the  object  was

ambitious, to say the least.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty years on, and I am glad to note that the Minister

has  announced that the Government intends to change some of the

existing  policies  relating  to  the  teaching  of  the  second

language.  After

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1850</b></font><br><br>

20 years, I would say that the review is timely  as

we  would have had sufficient experience from our implementation

of the second language policy to fine tune its application.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How have we fared thus far? Overall, I believe that had we

not  embarked on the policy of learning the second  language,  a

whole  generation  of  school  children  would  have  lost   the

opportunity  to  imbibe the inherent cultural values  that  came

with  the mother tongue.  Indeed, it is my observation  that  we

have  been so successful at the teaching of the second  language

that  in the case of Chinese we have wide acceptance and use  of

the  second language among Singaporeans today.  In fact, we find

more students using Mandarin as the lingua franca in schools and

in  the universities.  Even in schools which traditionally  used

English  as the spoken language, Mandarin is increasingly  being

spoken  freely.  Among the HDB heartlanders, Mandarin  is  often

used as a main language of communication.  I know because when I

go  on  my  house  visits,  I  find  myself  using  Mandarin  to

communicate with my residents more than I use English.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we may have achieved some degree of success in

getting  the second language across to the students, we have  to

ask  ourselves, as indeed we are now asking ourselves, the price

which  we have to pay in order to get there.  For many students,

especially  those  whose parents speak  Mandarin  at  home,  the

learning of the second language does not appear to be a problem.

You see, exposure to a bilingual education is not evenly placed.

The  student has, in the case of one who comes from a  Mandarin-speaking  background,  every  opportunity  to  learn  a   second

language  at  home and to brush up his English in  school.   For

this  child, learning Chinese, as our DPM has said, is merely  a

matter of formalising what he already learns at home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, a child coming from an English-speaking

environment  suffers  the  distinct  disadvantage  of   treating

Chinese  as  a  new  language, a language  that  is  perhaps  no

different than if you were to take up Tamil or Thai. To him, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1851</b></font><br><br>

Chinese language may be a totally new language  and

his  exposure to the language may be confined to just  what  has

been  taught  in  the  classroom.   Unless  the  child  has  the

discipline  and  makes  a  conscious effort  to  retain  and  to

practise  the language in order to master it, and I  can  assure

you,  Sir, for a hyperactive 10-year old is almost an impossible

undertaking, he will not be able to master Chinese  as  well  as

his  classmates from a Mandarin-speaking environment is able  to

master  his English.  In other words, the child from an English-speaking  environment  operates under a real  handicap  when  it

comes  to learning of the Chinese language.  This is not  helped

by  the  fact  that  the Chinese language is  one  of  the  most

difficult  languages to master. After all, the Chinese  ideogram

requires  more rote learning than romanised languages, like  the

English language.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore, as it is, is already a very competitive

society.   Our  values reflect the virtues  of  meritocracy  and

equality.   Education  has  long  since  been  recognised  as  a

principal  means  by  which  social  mobility  and  success   is

attained.   For  many Singaporeans, being a parent  of  a  child

winning a President's scholarship and succeeding through his own

sheer effort and talent afterwards in life is a natural thing to

wish  for.   Because of the emphasis on excellence in education,

schooling becomes an extremely competitive undertaking for  most

students and parents.  Many parents will be anxious to put their

children  nearer  the  top  of  education  success,  and   would

logically not spare any effort to ensure that their children  do

not  suffer from any disadvantage.  This includes ensuring  that

the relative disadvantage that comes from learning Chinese as  a

second  language  is  overcome. This may  be  attempted  through

tuition and remedial classes in Chinese.  For many, this may  be

a desperate act as the small difference in marks can well mean a

great difference in ranking in class and in school.  Such is the

extent of the competition in our schools today.  This concern is

certainly  not  helped by the fact that Chinese and  English  as

language subjects

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1852</b></font><br><br>

carry the same weightage. So for a child struggling

with  his  Chinese, attaining a mere pass for his Chinese,  will

inevitably pull down his overall average marks, even  if  he  is

good  in  his other subjects.  I am told that this is  the  case

with  many  ACS boys.   The sad truth is that these boys,  while

they  may  have  done  well in the other  subjects,  have  their

overall  average  marks  pulled  down  because  of  the  Chinese

language.    As   a  result,  they  do  not  qualify   for   ACS

(Independent) which is widely seen as a better school  but  have

to settle for ACS at Barker Road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many students know this and in order that they do not

suffer  from  the  fate of a lower average because  of  Chinese,

parents  and students invariably spend an inordinate  amount  of

time  learning the language, and often times at the  expense  of

the  other  more useful and fruitful pursuits.  In other  words,

the  students  do  not  have a life as a result;  and  for  many

parents, this is an additional contribution to stressful  living

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis on the second language also means that

students may have less time for the other subjects, particularly

the English language.  Sir,  I have heard many times the comment

that the quality of the written and spoken English among younger

Singaporeans  today  has dropped.  In  fact,  in  terms  of  the

technical  command of the language, the younger Singaporeans  on

average  do not seem to have as adequate a grasp of the  English

language  as  those  who  had gone to school  perhaps  10  years

earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to learn our mother tongue in order that we can

preserve our roots and our values.  As it is, our present policy

is  fundamentally sound.  Requiring our students  to  learn  the

mother   tongue  has  the  effect  of  achieving  our  principal

objectives.   The effort that some of our children  have  to  go

through  seems tremendous.  One might ask whether a sledgehammer

has  been  employed to kill an ant.  It is right that we  should

now  stand  back  and ask ourselves whether this  policy  should

stand and whether it should not be refined further.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1853</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in reviewing the teaching of our second

language  and our language policy, in particular, we should  ask

ourselves the basic question of what we want our society  to  be

in the next millennium.  I think we have to accept the fact that

we  can  never replicate, in the case of the teaching of Chinese

as  a  second  language, the full extent of Chinese civilisation

and culture in Singapore for posterity, and should we?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are an independent country. Our people may have come

from  many  lands.    Whether  we  are  here  by  choice  or  by

circumstance, we have to decide on our own common  destiny.   We

have  to  build  a  multi-racial nation  that  is  uniquely  and

distinctly  Singapore.  While we may each  retain  our  distinct

ethnic  grouping,  there is an overarching need  to  subordinate

this  to  the  higher  need of forging common  bonds  among  the

different  races,  which transcend ethnic  ties.   Our  language

policy must therefore serve that purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our case, we need to understand that our cultural values

are  evolving all the time.  As a fourth generation  Chinese  in

Singapore,  I  am proud of my Chinese heritage and  culture.   I

went  to  an  English  school and learnt  Chinese  as  a  second

language, although I cannot say I am very good at it.  Yet, as a

fourth generation Chinese in Singapore, I cannot say that  I  am

as  much a Chinese as my fellow Chinese in China, Taiwan or Hong

Kong  are.  I am not sure whether I want to be.  While  we  make

every  effort  to  preserve our heritage with our  children,  we

cannot fight against the tide of change, especially when we  are

cut  off  from our roots.  I wonder sometimes whether  practices

like  the mid-Autumn festival, wherein we tell our children that

in  China  this  is  a time when the harvest is  gathered,  will

continue  to have the same significance for us three generations

or four generations down the road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language must serve the purpose of nation building. There

are  inherent values which we should seek to promote  that  will

preserve  our  East  Asian  way of  life.   These  include,  for

instance,  our  communitarian values, respect for authority  and

care and concern for the family.  These values may

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1854</b></font><br><br>

be distilled from the language and be  imparted  to

our  children.  Through the teaching of the second  language  in

our schools, these values are reinforced and in the process help

to promote our nation building efforts.  Therefore, not just the

case of the teaching of the Chinese language alone, the teaching

of  the  other  mother tongues such as Malay and  Tamil  in  our

schools should work towards the goal of building and reinforcing

our common national values.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we should preserve our Chinese values and roots for its

own  sake,  we  may  run  into the danger  of  raising  language

chauvinists.   This  will  not  be  in  our  national  interest.

Therefore,  in  looking  at the issue of  the  teaching  of  the

Chinese language, we should look at it from the context and  the

purpose  which it intends to serve.  We should accept the  basic

proposition  that our second language should seek  to  reinforce

our  nation building efforts and incidental to that, to preserve

our  cultural heritage while recognising that our heritage  will

continue  to evolve in a way that makes it uniquely Singaporean.

For  this  reason, the changes to our policy on the teaching  of

Chinese as a second language is welcome and I support it.

<div align="center"><b>CHINESE LANGUAGE IN SCHOOLS</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign

Affairs  (Mr  Zainul Abidin Rasheed):  Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  will

speak  in Bahasa Melayu.  But before that, I beg your indulgence

to  say: (In Mandarin) Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you very much  for

allowing me to use Malay to speak here today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is definitely not CL3 in pronunciation. But I hope you

understand the spirit behind that introduction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Malay) To those who do not understand Mandarin, what I have

said  just  now  is "Thank you, Mr Speaker, for allowing  me  to

speak in the Malay Language".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the uniqueness of a multi-lingual, multi-racial and

multi-religious Singapore.  Unfortunately, I could not speak the

Tamil Language, another official language of Singapore, but  the

concern  that  I want to highlight now is also relevant  to  the

Indian  community here.  However, allow me to say "Wannakam"  to

complete the spirit of our multi-lingual Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak not on the aspect of the

details of the policy that was put forward by DPM BG Lee but  on

the spirit behind that policy, especially in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1856</b></font><br><br>

the context of the concept of multi-racialism in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, when the Speak Mandarin Campaign was hotly talked

about,  I  had the opportunity of attending a forum (in English)

about multi-racialism in Singapore.  On that occasion, a Chinese

activist  asked  me why was the Malay community concerned  about

the  Speak  Mandarin  Campaign.  It is not my  purpose  here  to

comment  about the question of the Mandarin Campaign,  but  what

the  Chinese leader told me is most interesting.  He said  those

from  the Chinese stream supported the efforts of the Malays  to

improve  the  use of the Malay language, and the  Malays  should

also not harbour any suspicion about the Mandarin Campaign.   He

further added that those who were from the Chinese stream are in

the  same  predicament  as the Malay community,  especially  the

Malay-educated.  We are both minorities in Singapore,  he  said.

He  supports the campaign to promote the Malay language and  the

Malays should also support the Speak Mandarin campaign, he said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Speak Mandarin Campaign for the Chinese

community.  In fact, for me, if there were Malays who can  speak

Mandarin fluently, it is an advantage -- an asset for them.  But  I

am  confident that it will be done without that Malay man losing

his  mother  tongue  and his identity, ie, the  Malay  language.

Obviously,  my  support is not because I am defending  what  was

said as the fate of these two minority groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look around in this region, the majority-minority

situation is actually subjective.  The Chinese community is  the

majority  in Singapore, but they are a minority in this  region.

The  Malay community, on the other hand, is a minority group  in

Singapore, but they are a majority in this region. Nevertheless,

if  we  look at  Singapore in the context of Southeast Asia  and

East Asia, the Chinese are a big majority if China is taken into

account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is important, Mr Speaker, is that we should see this aspect

of learning of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1857</b></font><br><br>

language according to the needs of  Singapore.   We

should have an open mind and be pragmatic.  In understanding the

approach  needed for our language policy, whether in  school  or

generally,  avoid  sentiments. For example, although  the  Malay

community is concerned about the erosion of the command  of  the

Malay  language among the younger generation and Malay students,

it  did  not  get  the Malays worked on the sentiments  of   the

question  of  language.  The  Malay  community  understands  the

importance of English for the students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Malay community had taken the initiative to ask the

Government  to  restrict the registration of Malay  students  in

schools  up  to  a maximum of 25%, in order to allow  the  Malay

students  to  mix with students from other communities  so  that

they can improve their command of the English Language.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the issue of SAP schools was debated, the concern of the

Malay  community  was not to arouse the sentiment  of  awry  but

rather  the  anxiety as to whether the students in  SAP  schools

will  be  conscious of the concept of multi-racialism,  if  they

were to be cut-off from the mainstream of the ordinary schools.

When  the  number of PSLE students who were allowed to take  ML1

was  limited to 10% of the best, the Malay community  and  their

leaders  appealed  for  this figure to be  increased.   This  is

because  the  community felt that the home environment  and  the

ease that the Malays have with the Malay language will help more

Malays to master ML1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MOE, though concerned about the effect of this change on the

overall performance of the students, had moderated the policy on

a case-by-case basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of language education and its deciding factors are

not  necessarily the same for all the communities in  Singapore.

If  it was felt that the Malay community had better home support

than  the Chinese or Tamil community with regard to their mother

tongue,  the situation has also begun to change.  Now there  are

more Malay families using English at home.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1858</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that, Mr Speaker, I value the Government's decision to

revise the question of language for all the languages from  time

to  time and to make changes, when necessary.  Besides,  I  also

hope  that the review made for the learning of Mandarin and  the

ancillary changes of entry policy for admitting students  to  JC

and  university  will  not place the Malay  and  Tamil  Language

students at a disadvantage.  This also needs to be reviewed from

time   to   time.    If  it  was  to  bring  about   inequitable

consequences, it would affect the credibility of the  policy  of

multi-racialism in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the need for us to facilitate the development of the

cultural elite for the Chinese community, and similarly for  the

Malay  and Indian cultural elites.  The important thing is  that

it  is carried out with the full understanding to strengthen the

basis and the pillar of multi-racialism policy in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, in his speech, DPM Lee clearly explained  the

policy  on  the teaching of Chinese language in future  and  the

changes  involved.   He wants more students to  take  up  Higher

Chinese  and to facilitate that, one more school will  become  a

SAP  school,  and  another  junior college  will  offer  Chinese

Language Elective Programme. At the same time, he is also trying

to  reduce  the burden on those students who have difficulty  in

learning Chinese, by making Chinese lessons more streamlined and

less  difficult while maintaining the standard.  For  those  who

are having difficulty coping with CL2, they will be offered a CL

`B'  course so that they will be able to get through  this  less

difficult  paper  and proceed to junior college and  university,

that is, if their results in the other subjects are good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think these proposals are very timely because basically, it

makes  a very important educational objective, that is, to allow

the  students to learn according to their ability by giving them

an  option  to take a lower-level Chinese paper, so  as  not  to

frustrate their efforts in the other subjects.  I think this  is

a very correct decision.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1859</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of CL `B' is very timely and wise. At the

moment,  some  students may be doing reasonably  well  in  other

subjects  but,  for  some reasons, just  cannot  cope  with  the

learning of Chinese.  We recognise that the ability to learn the

mother  tongue language may differ from the aptitude  for  other

subjects. We also understand that it is never easy to learn  the

Chinese  language. For that matter, the language environment  is

very  important  for the learning of any language.   As  we  all

know,  Chinese  language is composed of words or characters  put

together.  Every character is an ideograph.  So we just have  to

memorize  them,  character by character.  You have  to  keep  on

using  these characters repeatedly so that they become  embedded

in  your memory. Only then can you master the use of the Chinese

language.    If certain words are not used for a long time,  out

of  sight  out  of mind, they will soon be forgotten.   When  my

children  were learning Chinese in school, they have  to  revise

the  lessons they learnt in Primary 2 when they were in  Primary

3, and Primary 3 lessons at Primary 4, and so on. If they do not

do  this,  they will not be able to build on the word bank  they

have  accumulated  in the past years and continue  learning  new

words to add on to their vocabulary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know this because I came from a Chinese school and I am

speaking  from my own personal experience. In 1968, I left River

Valley  High  School and joined the university where  everything

was  taught  in  English. After my graduation,  I  worked  in  a

completely English-speaking environment.  In 1988,  I  became  a

Member  of  Parliament and I had to use Chinese  to  communicate

with  my  constituents. I had to speak in Chinese and  write  in

Chinese. It was then that I realised that a lot of Chinese words

which  I  had learnt had been forgotten. When I tried  to  write

Chinese,  out of 10 words, I had forgotten at least  two.   Even

today,  I  am  still using the wrong words or writing  with  the

wrong strokes. I think those of us here who have learned Chinese

as the first language will also have this similar experience.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1860</b></font><br><br>

Students in Singapore come from various language-speaking  backgrounds. For those whose parents  speak  Mandarin,

live in a Mandarin-speaking neighbourhood watching Channel 8 and

listening  to  radio programmes on FM95.8, they have  a  perfect

Mandarin-speaking environment. To these students,  speaking  and

listening  to  Mandarin is of no problem.  If you want  to  talk

about  the standard and level they would have attained, I  think

they  should  have  attained  the  CL1  level.   To  them,   the

environment is conducive to their learning of Chinese.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, with more and more young parents speaking

English  at  home,  the  language spoken at  home  is  naturally

English. They speak English in school, and when they go out with

friends, their friends would be speaking to them in English too.

When they turn on the TV, it is Channel 5 that they go for.   On

radio,  it  is 95.0 - English channels too!  To these  students,

the  opportunity to speak Mandarin or use Chinese is very  rare.

In  other words, they do not have the right environment to learn

Mandarin.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the survey report, some 10 years ago, among the

Primary  1 students, only 20% of their parents spoke English  at

home.   Right  now, 10 years later, the number is 40%.   It  has

doubled.   The  family  language  background  in  Singapore  has

changed.   More  and more children are coming from  non-Mandarin

speaking  family  background.  In fact,  it  has  doubled  in  a

decade.   As  I  said,  those  who  come  from  Chinese-speaking

families will not have much difficulty learning Chinese.  As for

those whose family background is not Chinese-speaking, they will

find learning Chinese more difficult.  More often than not, they

have  to  spend more time on Chinese than on the other subjects,

and yet the result in CL is not satisfactory. Some even give  up

Chinese completely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of CL `B', these students will have

an  opportunity to tackle Chinese at a basic level which is more

attainable  by  them.    They do not have  to  give  up  Chinese

completely and be disqualified for admission to the JCs  or  the

university.  Some people may say that the number of  such  cases

is small. But if

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1861</b></font><br><br>

you look at the statistics, more and more  students

are coming under this category.  40% of students in a cohort  is

certainly  not a small number in absolute terms.  It  is  by  no

means negligible.  So the CL `B' can be said to be targeting  at

this  reality, as a practical solution to reduce the  number  of

students opting out of the learning of Chinese.  In other words,

the parents of such students will have a mental relief.  They do

not  have to worry about their children failing to secure a pass

in CL2 and a place in the junior college.  So this approach is a

very  good solution to cater for the changes in family  language

background in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Chinese as a second language, according to my understanding,

even  students who have the aptitude to learn CL2 have to  spend

more time on the subject than on the other subjects.  If this is

the  case, then something must be wrong in the curriculum of the

CL  subject.   Perhaps,  the standard of  CL2  is   higher  than

necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to hear DPM Lee saying that the level of difficulty of

the  Chinese textbooks will be reduced.  After revision, the new

textbooks  to be published will be less difficult to  learn  and

understand.  I  think  this  is  a  right  thing  to  do.   More

importantly, if you look at the present textbooks, we must  take

into  consideration the amount of time spent by the students  in

learning and understanding them.  I think it is a very important

factor.   If the time spent is much more than the time spent  on

the  other  subjects,  or out of proportion,  then  we  have  to

consider  whether  we should make the new textbooks   easier  to

understand,  so  that the average students will  be  spared  the

agony of labouring over them

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, it was mentioned to extend the shen guang jiao

cai (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) textbook currently used by the SEED

schools  to  other  schools.  On the  question  of  quality  and

quantity,  they are all very high.  If we were to introduce  the

shen guang jiao cai (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) or enrichment

materials to the non-SEED schools, or the neighbourhood schools,

then  we  are  going  to  run into big problems.  It  will  most

certainly increase the burden of the students.  Once the  burden

is increased,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1862</b></font><br><br>

those who could previously manage  to  just  scrape

through,  will  now find a pass in Chinese beyond  their  reach.

We  frequently talk about teaching according to the  ability  of

the  students, so these enrichment materials should be used very

selectively.   Only those who are outstanding in their  learning

of Chinese shall be asked to take on these enrichment materials.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there is a lot of pressure from the Chinese

community on the Ministry of Education to raise the standard  of

Chinese  in  our  schools.  They will be  very  unhappy  if  the

Ministry  of Education does not or could not do something  about

it    Among  my  friends, there are quite a number of  graduates

from  the  former Nanyang University or universities in  Taiwan.

Their  command  of Chinese is generally stronger  than  that  of

English.   These people are always very critical of the standard

of   Chinese  in  Singapore.   They  often  complain  about  bad

pronunciation by the broadcasters, wrong or misused words in the

Chinese  newspapers,  and  students,  undergraduates  and   even

graduates  being  unable  to  express  themselves  properly   in

Chinese.  They  often  lament the decline  in  the  standard  of

Chinese in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the level or standard of languages is relative. It

is  not fair for us to complain that the standard of Chinese  in

Singapore is not as good as the Chinese of China, Taiwan or even

Hong  Kong.   It is not realistic for us to demand that we reach

the  same  standard of these people, because  Chinese  is  their

working  language.  They speak and write  Chinese  at  home,  in

school,  at  work and for every purpose.  This is their  natural

environment.   For us, even if we have a distinction  in  Higher

Chinese,  at  first  language level, LEP or whatever,  we  still

cannot look at Chinese as our working language.  Whatever it may

be, the level of Chinese of those students that we are training,

the  so-called Chinese elite, will never be the same as that  of

Chinese students in the Chinese schools of the old days. This is

a  fact,  and  a reality.  Once you understand the reality,  you

should not be over critical of our system.  I think it would not

be realistic to do so.  I hope the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1863</b></font><br><br>

Ministry of Education can resist  the  pressure  to

blindly  raise  the  standard  of teaching  of  Chinese  in  our

schools,  especially in the Language Elective  Programme  (LEP).

We  must allow our students to learn at a pace commensurate with

their  individual  ability  to  learn.    Only  those  who   are

competent and have the right aptitude to take on Higher  Chinese

shall be subjected to a higher standard of Chinese in school.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to speak in strong support of the policies contained in the

statement of the Deputy Prime Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I speak as one who has had very little opportunity during my

school  days  in  the distant past of learning  Chinese.   I  do

remember  my  Chinese teacher.  His primary contract  was  as  a

physical education instructor and he was more comfortable in the

playing  field  than in the classroom.  His method  of  teaching

Chinese  was to get us all to learn the names of each  other  in

written Chinese and then he would set an examination in multiple

choice.  The questions would have one right answer and the  rest

he  would  put down our names so that if we figure out  that  we

knew  each other's names, we would be able to pass, even  though

we did not know what the question actually asked for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought up in this second English-speaking environment, I

was  never encouraged to take the learning of Chinese seriously.

It  was  no  secret that if one were to do well in English,  one

could have many more opportunities for success.  Imbuing Chinese

culture  and  language  was regarded as secondary  and  left  to

grandparents entirely in dialect.  I hasten to add  by  the  way

that of course the school I was speaking of is not a Singaporean

school.   It  is so different these days.  Given the  chance  to

study  Chinese in school, students, including my children,  have

enjoyed  the  opportunity to study Chinese in a systematic  way.

The  study  of  language  opens new  vistas  of  experience  and

knowledge.  I confess to feeling

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1864</b></font><br><br>

extremely inadequate, as some of the other MPs  have

said, when I have to read Chinese literature and history through

English translation, even worse, Chinese poetry translated  into

English.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I should like to make my first point, not to Members

here  but to all students who have been given a chance to  study

their  mother tongue:  do not treat that as a chore as any other

subject.   It  is a golden opportunity to understand  one's  own

culture,  to participate in it, to live in it.  All  too  often,

students think that they need not do well in the language as  it

does not count.  It may not count for so much in terms of points

but  it  does count for a great deal subsequently in life.   Now

that  those  who find great difficulty in learning the  language

have  been given a chance to still continue to learn it  through

CL  `B',  I  would  certainly say that  that  should  be  warmly

welcomed.  I know parents who have had to send children overseas

to  study  because  Chinese, as it is taught in  Singapore,  had

proved  daunting for them.  Now, these parents may be  persuaded

to  let  their  children take the new course  without  fear.   I

assume  that  those  Singaporeans whose  students  are  studying

abroad may also feel more confident and may allow their children

to return to Singapore to take the less difficult option.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to some issues that I am sure parents may

want  to know about and quickly.  First, how much easier is  the

CL  `B'  option likely to be as compared to, say, CL2?   Second,

will all schools offer the CL `B' option?  Third, will there  be

an  opportunity to upgrade to CL2 if the students  do  extremely

well  at  CL `B'?  Fourth, the converse of the third query,  how

will the school deal with students who choose CL `B' instead  of

CL2 deliberately, even though he or she may be able to cope with

CL2?   For instance, a student might say, "I can only get a pass

grade  in CL2 but I may do very well in CL `B'.  So I prefer  to

do  that."   Is  this practice acceptable or to be  discouraged?

Here, another matter of concern is the teaching of CL `B'.   Are

the teachers to be specially trained to appreciate that they may

be dealing with a class that has difficulties in coping with the

Chinese language?  Will the materials also reflect

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1865</b></font><br><br>

this?  Can the Ministry of Education cope with  the

additional demands for language teachers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I should like to say that there may be those who

feel  that this CL `B' is a watered-down version of the language

requirements  and therefore to be deplored.  I  prefer  to  look

upon  this  positively and say to those who take  such  a  view:

consider  how  many more students would now have the  chance  to

learn  and use Chinese.  I would say that the CL `B' is a strong

plus policy to be warmly welcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the statement.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  support  the  policy  statement  by  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister.   But  on his new proposals, I would like  to  present

some of my views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, our bilingual policy. Singapore is a multi-lingual, multi-racial society. The Government has encouraged

the  various races to maintain their traditional values  and  to

have  a  better  sense  of belonging.  In 1966,  the  Government

implemented the bilingual system in our schools.  Everybody must

study  English as the first language, with mother tongue as  the

second  language.  For the Chinese, they have to study CL2,  the

Malay  would  do ML2, while the Indians do TL2.  This  bilingual

policy  has  been implemented for 32 years.  We have  cultivated

many bilingual talents, and with good results.  Now every one in

school  can  speak  two languages.  This is good  not  only  for

understanding both the western and oriental cultures,  but  also

for  better communication with our friends from other countries.

This  helps  in our nation building. I feel that the  Government

should   enhance  our  bilingual  policy  and  give   a   better

affirmation  for  the  results that we have  achieved  over  the

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the standards of Chinese language in school.

According  to  statistics of the Ministry of Education,  98%  of

ethnic  Chinese  students did Chinese either as  HCL  or  CL  in

secondary  schools, and 95% obtained at least  a  pass  for  it.

Among  them,  71%  had  A1  or A2.  In other  words,  among  the

students who did Chinese,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1866</b></font><br><br>

only  5% failed to secure at least  a  pass.   This

result is encouraging and we would like to thank all our Chinese

language teachers for their efforts which resulted in such  good

results.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday was Hari Raya Aidilfiltri. I visited a Malay

grassroots leader's home where I met a group of school teachers,

among  whom  were a number of Chinese teachers. They  knew  that

Parliament would be discussing a new policy on the teaching  and

learning of Chinese, and showed great concern about it.  I had a

discussion   with  them  for  about  half  an  hour.    In   our

conversation,  I gathered that these teachers had realised  that

nowadays, with most parents speaking in English, it is not  easy

for  them  to  teach their students to speak good Chinese.   The

students  have  to spend double the time to learn the  language,

and  the  teachers  have to take twice the  amount  of  time  to

prepare their lessons.  They have not only to teach the language

but  also  to  make  sure that the students  would  be  able  to

understand  and  to  put  to use what they  have  learnt.  These

teachers have been working very hard.  They deserve our respect.

Now,  because of these 5% of the students who are unable to pass

their CL2, MOE is introducing a new subject, CL `B', so that the

students  could  continue learning Chinese, albeit  at  a  lower

level,  without  fearing that they may not make the  grade,  and

hence  denied a place in the junior college and the  university.

If  MOE's  intention  is  to help these  5%  students  who  have

difficulty  in studying Chinese and to help them  so  that  they

would  not give up Chinese completely and face elimination  from

the mainstream of education, I think it is a good thing.  It  is

a move in the right direction and this is a feasible policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we must ensure that those who have the ability to

carry  on doing CL or even HCL do not take the easy way  out  by

opting  for CL `B' in place of CL. This is because, if  they  do

so,  it will lower our standard of Chinese and will run contrary

to  our Prime Minister's appeal to nurture our Chinese elite. We

should  let  the  Chinese teachers be the assessors  or  form  a

special  committee to decide which students should be downgraded

to CL `B' and who should remain in CL2.  I also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1867</b></font><br><br>

suggest that in the initial stages, MOE should  take

this  5%  as  the target group, because from present statistics,

only  5%  could  not pass their CL2. At the same time,  I  would

suggest that those who do CL `B' and show marked improvement  in

their standard of Chinese, they should be allowed to go back  to

CL.  In fact, they should be encouraged to do so.  Only then can

we  enhance,  or at least maintain, the standard of  Chinese  in

school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we must groom a group of elite Chinese teachers.

In  the National Day Rally in 1997, the Prime Minister mentioned

that with English being used as the medium of instruction in all

our schools, there might come a time in, say, 20 years from now,

when we will have no good Chinese scholars to teach Chinese, and

this  will  be  a major problem to our preservation  of  Chinese

traditional  culture.   We should cultivate  a  group  of  elite

Chinese teachers who would be charged with the responsibility of

maintaining  our  Chinese  traditional  culture.   In  order  to

cultivate a Chinese elite, we must have a group of elite Chinese

teachers.   If  we want to have good martial art  exponents,  we

must  have  good  gungfu  masters. If  you  want  to  have  good

athletes,  we  need  to have good coaches.   Without  them,  our

skills will never improve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early days, we had the Nanyang University where many

good  quality Chinese teachers were trained and they formed  the

core  of  Chinese  teachers.  But nowadays, we  do  not  have  a

Nanyang University to cultivate these Chinese teachers.   So  10

or  20  years down the road, are we able to train up a group  of

elite  Chinese  teachers  in order to train  up  this  group  of

Chinese elite students?  So this may be the appropriate time for

us  to  consider opening a Chinese university to cater  for  the

needs  of the 21st century.  To learn traditional values and  to

have  a sense of belonging, by just taking a Chinese subject  is

not  enough.  If we want to learn the Chinese traditional values

and  sense of belonging, we have to study from all aspects, like

History, Geography, Economics, Literature, Arts so that we can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1868</b></font><br><br>

have  a comprehensive view of the Chinese  culture.

Only  then  can  we  be able to inculcate in  our  students  the

traditional  Chinese  culture, Chinese values  and  a  sense  of

belonging.   This  is  a critical moment.   I  suggest  that  we

cultivate  a  group of elite Chinese students who are  not  only

proficient  in the Chinese language but also good in  the  other

subjects,  to  be trained as Chinese language teachers  so  that

later  on when they teach Chinese, they can introduce a  variety

of  subject  matters  relevant to our modern  world  during  the

Chinese lessons.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir,  having listened carefully to the policy statement

by  DPM  Lee,  I  feel that the proposed policy to  change  some

aspects  of  the teaching of Chinese in Singapore schools  is  a

very balanced one.  On the one hand, it tries to strengthen  the

nurturing of a Chinese elite, by opening one more SAP school and

by  providing more opportunities for Chinese students to take on

Higher Chinese (HCL).  On the other hand, it also tries to  look

after  the very small minority of students who have difficulties

in  learning Chinese, even as a second language.  A new  CL  `B'

course  will  be  offered to them.  This  is  a  very  realistic

approach.  The whole series of new measures can be said to be  a

flexible and comprehensive approach which is in keeping with the

principle of teaching according to the student's ability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been implementing the bilingual policy for

some  30  years.   I  have been working as a journalist  in  the

Chinese  newspapers  for more than 20  years.   I  have  on-hand

experience in the implementation of this policy, and  also  some

experience in the use of computers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human brain is not unlike the computer, which the

Chinese  described as dian nao (electronic brain).  When  I  was

first  asked  to  use the Chinese word-processing  software,  my

computer  was a 386, which was basically meant for  software  in

the  English  language only.  At that time the Chinese  software

was just still in its infancy stage of development.  Because the

nature  of our work in the Chinese newspaper office required  us

to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1869</b></font><br><br>

use Chinese word-processing technology, we were told

to  install  the  Chinese software into our  English-environment

computers.  Disaster struck. The 386 did not have enough  memory

and  capability to support the additional Chinese software.  The

computer "hanged" all the time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same goes with the human brain. Just like the

`electronic  brain', the absorption power, retention  power  and

the  power to accommodate data and operations differ from person

to  person.   Some people are born 286s or 386s.  But  some  are

born 486s, and the exception ones may be born Pentiums. Some  of

us may be able to say, "I am proficient in one language and have

some  working  knowledge of another language.   But  nobody  can

truthfully swear that he or she is perfectly bilingual.  No  one

dares  to  lay claim to that. This is because we are constrained

by our endowed capability, our learning capacity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum capacity of the hardware of a computer is

finite   and   fixed,  while  its  software  may  have   certain

operational capacity.  These two factors together  constrain its

application.  The same applies to the human brain.  If you  want

to  insist on one model of language policy for all students  and

fix  a  uniform  standard  for all, it  will  not  work.   After

implementing  our  bilingual policy for some three  decades,  we

have  learnt  to  be  flexible and sensitive  to  the  different

capacities  of  the students.   This is to reduce the  attrition

rate in our education system because if the policy is too rigid,

certain  people  will be sacrificed. With  this  new  policy,  I

believe we will be able to encourage all students to learn their

mother tongue according to their aptitude and ability.  This  is

the advantage of this new policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good policy is one that is realistic and capable of adapting

to  the different situations.  At the same time, I would like to

point  out  that  the  Government must  adopt  a  more  positive

approach to ensure that our society will not suffer in the  long

run.    In  other words, our bilingual policy will  be  able  to

continue  unshaken  for a long time to come.   From  the  policy

statement of DPM Lee, it is noted that the Government

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1870</b></font><br><br>

has already paid attention to the fact that a  small

group of students have  difficulty in learning Chinese.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, it is noteworthy that more and more Chinese

families  are  switching to English as the  language  spoken  at

home,  unlike  in  the  past  when  dialects  or  Mandarin   was

predominant.   In  other  words, for  children  born  into  such

families, their mother tongue is English and not Mandarin or any

of  the Chinese dialects.  The emergence of such a situation has

a  very  serious effect on our language policy.  It is  a  great

challenge  to  us.  It will possibly give rise to the  following

situations:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Parents of English-speaking families, because of their

prejudice against the Chinese language, will resist it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Parents themselves realise the importance of their

children  learning Chinese. Subjectively,  they hope that  their

children  will  learn and master the Chinese language.  But  the

students  themselves encounter difficulties in  the  process  of

learning  Chinese  in school.  There is a sort of  psychological

pressure  on  the  parents.   The parents  will  then  turn  the

pressure on the Government to lighten their children's burden on

the study of Chinese language.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am worried about the second situation because children from

the  purely  English-speaking families  tend  to  find  learning

Chinese  more  difficult because they have to start  from  zero,

unlike  those who come from Chinese-speaking families  who  must

certainly enjoy a head-start.  In these circumstances,  does  it

mean  that the bilingual education policy will one day face such

great  pressure from the anxious English-speaking  parents  that

the  Government will be forced to lower the standard of  Chinese

in  school.   Even at this present moment when we are having  an

established bilingual education policy in place, we are  finding

the  grounds more and more difficult to defend.  In  future,  we

may  even succumb to pressure and go into a monolingual society.

I believe we do not like to see such a situation arising.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we are introducing CL `B' for students who have

difficulty in learning Chinese.  According to the present

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1871</b></font><br><br>

estimate,  the  number  of  such  students  is  not

significant.   But,  with  the transformation  of  the  language

background of the younger families, the number of such  students

is  bound  to increase in future, that is to say, there  may  be

more  and  more students opting for CL `B' in future.   If  this

happens,  we  can foresee that by that time, these students  and

their  parents  will  be putting pressure  on  the  Ministry  of

Education  to  recognise  the result of  CL  `B'  at  `O'  level

examination  for admission to the junior college,  and  at   `A'

level examination for university matriculation.  I certainly  do

not  wish to see this situation arising.   However, we  must  be

psychologically prepared for such a situation to  arise  in  the

future.   In  the  interest  of our nation,  apart  from  taking

preventive  measures, we must also take positive  and  proactive

measures   to  strengthen  the  overall  environment   for   the

development of bilingualism in our society.  In other  word,  we

must continue to insist on making Mandarin work in our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people say we have been very successful in our Speak

Mandarin  campaign.  I  do not think so.   I  think  the  future

challenge  is even greater, especially in the Chinese community.

The  promotion of Mandarin-speaking is still a very big task  to

accomplish.    The  Chinese  community  should   recognise   the

transformation  of  language background of  the  ethnic  Chinese

families in Singapore. The Chinese community should put in  more

efforts  to promote the use of Mandarin in our society.  Chinese

should  not  be  treated merely as a subject  to  be  learnt  in

school.  It should be promoted as a useful tool of communication

in  our  society.  It  is only then that  we  will  be  able  to

effectively preserve our bilingual education policy.  It  is  in

the  long-term  interest  of  our country  that  the   bilingual

education policy be maintained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the policy statement.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I have three

regrets.   The  first regret is that we have to debate  such  an

important  issue  in Parliament without due notice  in  advance.

There are so much

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1872</b></font><br><br>

materials for us to absorb and analyse,  yet  these

materials  were distributed to us only when DPM Lee  was  making

his  speech in Parliament. We have no time to digest  all  these

materials.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I heard Mr Kenneth Chen talking about his son who was

denied a place in our local university because he could not pass

his CL2, and had to send him overseas to get his degree.   In my

generation,  many of my classmates could not gain  admission  to

university because their English was no good, and they  did  not

have  the  means to go overseas for further study.  This  is  my

second regret.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we need to bring this issue on the standard and

learning of Chinese in our schools to this House for discussion.

I  have  never  heard  of the Japanese complaining  about  their

children  having problems coping with the Japanese  language  in

school, or the children in Germany having difficulty coping with

the  learning  of their own language.  I think  the  Chinese  in

Singapore  should  ponder  over this  question:  why  does  this

problem  arise at all?  Perhaps our situation is unique.    This

is something that we need to think about seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the language policy is a very important

policy of the nation.  It is not just a superficial policy  that

involves  just  the application of a language in  our  education

system.    It   actually  involves  our  people's   ability   of

expression, their upbringing, and the differences in our values.

What  is  the direction in which our language policy is heading?

Shall  we use Chinese as a mainstream language or English  as  a

mainstream  language,  or  any other language  as  a  mainstream

language?  Of course, the value will become the mainstream value

of our society.  So the direction we take will eventually decide

what  type of society we will develop into. So I feel  that  the

language  policy  is  not just an education  policy.   It  is  a

national policy of great importance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have been implementing the so-called

bilingual  education  system for  the  past  few  decades.   The

question  is: what is the definition of a bilingual system?   In

the old days, students

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1873</b></font><br><br>

in  the  Chinese schools used Chinese  as  a  first

language  and  English as a second language.  For those  in  the

English  language  schools, English was the first  language  and

Chinese  was  promoted  as one of the second  languages  or  not

promoted  at  all.   Now we do not have the  so-called  "Chinese

stream" or "English stream".  The first language is English  and

apart  from  those  taking  Higher  Chinese,  mother  tongue  is

basically  a  second  language.  So, is our so-called  bilingual

education a misnomer? It gives people the misconception that  we

are  bilingual.  But, in fact, the levels of our  languages  are

vastly  lopsided.  So we should not call it a bilingual  system.

It  should be more appropriately known as a mother tongue system

where  Malay, Tamil or Chinese is a second language.   Actually,

what  we  should  be  concerned  with  is  the  effect  of   the

introduction of CL `B' on the future development of our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am more worried about the ability of expression of our people.

For  English-speaking  people, they may not  be  able  to  speak

Chinese because their standard of Chinese is no good.  But  most

of  the  time,  they will be able to absorb the essence  of  the

English  language.   They  will be able  to  express  themselves

fairly  well in English.  But, on the other hand, for those  who

come  from Chinese-speaking families, they cannot speak  English

well,  and because of the second language system in our  school,

their  standard of Chinese is also not good enough for  them  to

express  themselves  well.  So it results in  neither  here  nor

there.   In the end, their Chinese is no good and their  English

is  also  no good.  From the younger generation that I  know,  I

have  already  noticed that this problem is  very  serious.   In

their  conversation, they mix Chinese with  English.   They  are

unable to speak and express eloquently in one language.  This is

something that we should be worried about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the standard of Chinese language, first of all,

the  Government  has  to decide what is the bottomline  for  its

desired  level of the Chinese language.  Is the bottomline  such

that  Chinese, being one of the official languages in Singapore,

will continue to be used in Singapore or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1874</b></font><br><br>

do  you want to promote Chinese  as  a  gateway  to

understanding Chinese culture or to use it as a means  to  train

the  so-called  Chinese elite?  I think the  different  purposes

will  decide  what will be the appropriate standard  of  Chinese

language we want to have.  If Chinese is just to be regarded  as

an  official language so that it could continue to  be  used  in

Singapore,  then very simply, a lower standard would suffice  to

serve  the  Government's policy.  As long as you can  speak  and

understand it, that is enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you want to use Chinese as a means to enhance our

understanding of the Chinese culture, what standard do you need?

If  you  want  to cultivate a Chinese elite, what would  be  the

appropriate  standard we must achieve?  If we want  to  train  a

Chinese  elite,  do  we  not want to have  more  ethnic  Chinese

students  attaining  a  certain level of  proficiency  in  their

Chinese,  or  just a handful of elite who can  attain  a  higher

level  of  Chinese language proficiency?  I think the Government

should look into it, because different people may have different

needs.  If you say  you require our students to learn only up to

primary  school level or, say, 1,000 words, then so be it.   But

let  everybody be very clear about it.  Let us know what is  the

bottomline,  what is the requirement.  On the  other  hand,  for

those who are very keen to learn the Chinese language, let  them

know the limits that can be offered in our schools, so that they

will  not  have false hope.  The Chinese language teachers  will

also have a good idea of the standard they must achieve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem is, like what Mr Goh Choon Kang has said just

now, the proposed CL `B'.  There would be some inherent problems

that come with the introduction of CL `B'.  Would this be a  new

standard   of  requirement  of  the  Government?    Would   this

bottomline  be further lowered because of pressure from  certain

quarters?   If  we look at the background of the students,  they

have  this  problem  because they come from an  English-speaking

family.   This  is something that is inevitable,  but  it  is  a

vicious cycle.  Now, just because these students come from  such

a  background,  we provide a lower level CL `B'  to  suit  them.

Eventually, it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1875</b></font><br><br>

would  come a time when there  are  more  and  more

students opting to go into CL `B'.  Later on in life, when these

students  get married, have children of their own, the  language

of  communication  will  again be English,  and  more  and  more

families  will be speaking English.  So this becomes  a  vicious

cycle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the survey report, when the students grow older,

their  interest  in  learning  Chinese  becomes  more  and  more

minimal.  In Primary 2, 51.3% of students say they like  Chinese

very  much.   But when it comes to junior college,  only  5%  of

students  are very interested in Chinese.  Why is there  such  a

situation?  I think we should look into this matter from liking,

very  fond of the language, until a point where they do not like

the  language,  or even hate the language.  We should  find  out

what  is  the  reason for this.  If we want to cultivate  a  so-called  Chinese elite or to enhance the standard of Chinese,  it

is  not only just to speak Chinese but to attain such a standard

where  you  will  be able to read, understand and  analyse  some

articles  in Chinese.  Teaching Chinese as a subsidiary  subject

in school is just not enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should consider having some other examination

subjects,  eg, history or literature, being taught  in  Chinese,

and  examined in Chinese. Through the learning of these subjects

in  Chinese, those students who are interested in Chinese  would

be  able to attain a certain standard in the language that  will

enable  them  to  read  Chinese  as  a  major  subject  in   the

university.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, the crux of the matter is, basically, people

who  have  very  little  contact with Chinese  will  have  great

difficulty learning it. I must admit that Chinese is not an easy

language  to  learn because it is a very different  system  from

English  and the other western languages. The Chinese  word,  or

character,  is an ideograph, unlike romanised spelling  like  in

English.  Chinese is more difficult to learn, but then we should

not emphasise on the economic value of Chinese all the time.   I

think we should ask ourselves this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1876</b></font><br><br>

question:  As an ethnic Chinese, should I not  know

Chinese?    This is a basic question.  It is not a  question  of

whether  it has any economic value or not.  The correct attitude

should  be:  I need to, at least, have a basic understanding,  a

basic  level of competence, in handling the language.   I  think

the  question of level, how to adjust, to fine-tune and to adapt

to  the needs of the students from the different backgrounds, is

secondary.  Most  importantly, we  must  cultivate  the  correct

attitude.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few things that we have to pay attention to. First,

the  Government's  stand on Chinese.  What is  the  Government's

stand?   What  is  the Government's expectation  of  Chinese  in

Singapore?  What is the basic requirement?  Will this bottomline

be changing all the time, and eventually it will come to a point

where  you  may or may not have Chinese at all.  So I think  the

Government  should  take  a very clear  stand  on  its  required

standard that is expected of the Chinese students in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Chinese language teachers are also a very

important  factor.  Traditionally,  Chinese  teachers  are  more

serious  in  nature.   But it is common knowledge  that  when  a

student does not like the teacher, he or she will also hate  the

subject  he  teaches.   So if you want  the  students  to  enjoy

learning Chinese, the Chinese language teachers should also  try

to  be  more relaxed in their teaching.  They should not  be  so

stern   all  the  time.    They  should  introduce  more  lively

materials.   I  think  the  Chinese  language  teachers   should

seriously look into this matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, for the people who work in the Chinese educational,

cultural  and  journalistic fields, we should try  to  tell  the

stories  from ancient China in a more lively mood, so that  they

can be accepted by the younger generation.  We all know that the

animated movie Mulan, which is a Walt Disney production  in  the

USA,  was  taken from a traditional Chinese story.  But  it  was

translated  and  produced as a full-length Walt Disney  animated

movie.  Students  from Chinese-speaking background  or  English-speaking environment alike fall for the repackaged story.  It is

the new packaging that makes the difference!

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1877</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, for giving

me  these  few  moments.  I just want to seek a  few  points  of

clarification and make some suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already there is a certain degree of stigmatisation amongst

students  in CL1 and those in CL2.  By creating another syllabus

`B'  and category of students, will we create another stigma and

risk  overall demoralisation?  I hope the Minister will  comment

on  this.  As I read here, he said that while a pass in  CL  `B'

syllabus  at  the  `O' and `A' level examinations  will  qualify

students to enter JC and university, the CL `B' syllabus  result

cannot  be used to compute the `O' level aggregate for admission

into  JC  or  earn  any  `A' level points  used  for  university

admission.   Are we having another ranking order as  to  who  is

good and who is not good enough?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to raise is: could the Ministry

of  Education  take  the lead in reviewing  the  methodology  in

teaching language in schools and commit resources for retraining

of  teachers  and new pedagogic equipment to make learning  more

interesting?   I  suggest  that  the  Review  Committee  involve

student  bodies  to  give their reflections and  suggestions  on

their experience of learning Chinese.  Take my own example.   My

children  learn  Chinese better with songs and  by  watching  of

Chinese  TV programmes.  Maybe we should encourage some watching

of  TV programmes in schools at certain hours and use that as  a

basis for discussion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I would like to bring up is that I do not

disagree  about Chinese classics being important, as brought  up

by Mr Peh Chin Hua on Shui Hu Zhuan (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) and Hong

Lou Meng (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). But I urge the Education

Committee not to stress the messages in the stories but  instead

focus on the literary interest of the stories because it is very

boring and, from the way I do it with my children, it is a  hard

uphill struggle.  We need creative approaches and I think Mr Low

Thia Khiang's suggestion like Hua Mu Lan (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)

is a very good one.  We need new

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1878</b></font><br><br>

packaging.   We  need to review the whole lot of  materials  and

find creative pedagogic materials for teaching this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I would like to try and disentangle is the

notion  of  a  language  and culture.   When  does  learning  or

stressing  a  language  become  divisive?   I  feel  learning  a

language  is  just  another  tool  towards  understanding  one's

culture.  It only becomes divisive if we use language to exclude

segments   of  Singaporeans  from  the  mainstream  agenda   and

programmes. I do not think this is what we set out to do.  But I

like  to  say that we need to be a little relaxed about language

and culture.  We can learn about Chinese culture without knowing

Chinese, through translation.  It will be better if we can learn

a  culture  through the language.  But today, in the newspapers,

we  learn  of  a whole group of scholars talking about  Mencius.

And  they  are  Americans.   Yes, some  of  them  speak  Chinese

language but a lot of them do not.  But they learn it.  So I  am

saying  that, besides looking at the language barrier, maybe  we

should  look at our own interest.  And I would like to  echo  Mr

Low  Thia  Khiang's call just now that we need to  develop  that

interest first even for those English educated.  If we have that

interest, we will get to any culture.  Like all of us know a lot

about English Literature, we are not English.  Some of us know a

lot  of  French Literature, but we do not speak  French.   So  I

think we need to disentangle that.  Having said that, I must say

learning  a  language  does create the intimacy  and  depth  for

learning the culture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is we must first define ourselves as Singaporeans,

besides  being Chinese, or Malay, or Indian.  And I think  being

Singaporean  is more than speaking a specific language.   So  on

the  concerns raised by Mr Simon Tay earlier on, I feel that  if

we  all  share  in  a  common identity and  try  to  hone  that,

specialising in a language is not a threat.  And here,  I  would

like  to take up Dr Tan Cheng Bock's point on the Chinese elite.

I  am  uncomfortable with the word as well because it  reeks  of

class status.  And I have in other occasions suggested the words

"Chinese  specialist",  "Malay specialist",  "Tamil  specialist"

instead of using the word "elite".  My

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1879</b></font><br><br>

vision  for  Singapore  is  really a multi-cultural  and  multi-lingual  Singapore characterised by all these  specialists,  who

standing  on  their own cultural heritage, are able to  appraise

the world and the other cultures around them and help to nourish

a Singapore identity that can be shared.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take my own example. I grew up in Little India. I was in a

Chinese  language school and my parents, being kiasu, pulled  me

out  from Nan Hua and put me in Raffles where I learned English.

I had wished that I had continued with a Chinese language school

so  that I will be steeped in one language because it is easy to

pick  up  English.   So I hope this policy is one  step  towards

redressing  some of the challenges we faced decades  earlier  by

creating cultural or language specialists that will be  good  in

one  language and reasonably and acceptably good in another, but

first  and foremost, they use the language to express themselves

as Singaporeans.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

personally delighted by the changes contained in the Ministerial

Statement.   I  am  assured  by the  spirit  and  commitment  to

bilingual policy.  It has served us well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the problems confronting the Chinese community which

necessitate  these  changes  are not  peculiar  to  the  Chinese

community.   It  is a nationwide phenomenon affecting  both  the

Indian  and  Malay  communities although these communities  have

been far more successful in insulating themselves from otherwise

negative  consequences to their culture, language and tradition.

And  I  think  this  is how other communities should  see  these

changes.  However, I hope that references to China as a dominant

economic power does not detract from the fact that Malaysia  and

Indonesia today remain one of the largest trading partners, that

Malay  and  Tamil still possess strong economic  value  so  that

Malay students and Indian students are not unnecessarily tempted

to learn Chinese for the wrong reasons.  It is just

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1880</b></font><br><br>

that  businesses with these countries are concluded in  English,

especially  among  MNCs, and in Chinese among the  smaller  SMEs

simply  because  Chinese businessmen are still  the  predominant

business  community  in the region.  The  Malay  community,  for

example,  should feel assured that proficiency in Malay language

is  not  only  important  for  culture  and  tradition  but  has

important  economic implications and value to  Singapore.   They

must continue in their stride to excel in these languages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plans to better accommodate non-Chinese students in SAP

schools  are  indeed very reassuring.  I am therefore encouraged

by the assurance given by DPM that similar reviews would be done

for  the  learning  of  Malay and Tamil because  the  issues  of

language  are also important and sensitive to the Malay,  Indian

and  Eurasian  communities.   The communities  would  indeed  be

interested to know how different these students are compared  to

Chinese students in coping with, say, Malay or English.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to another point about the peculiar problems of

children  from mixed marriages.  They, like me, do not have  the

benefit  of  having both parents competent in  the  same  second

language.   These students need a scheme similar to  CL  `B'  in

Malay  and  Tamil - a development, Sir, which I personally  wait

most eagerly.  As mixed marriages become more prevalent, a multi-racial and multi-cultural family is a natural phenomenon of  our

society.  CL `B' and, hopefully, ML `B' or TL `B' should be seen

and be made part of this phenomenon.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Thank you, Sir, for allowing

me to join in this debate.  I have to mention that I regret that

the  Opposition was not informed of this important debate  prior

to the announcement.  I believe Mr Low and I come unprepared for

this  important debate.  So far, it has taken almost  the  whole

day to show the interest it has generated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am basically monolingual and even my dialect, Teochew, is

rather weak.  I have gone through four elections and I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1881</b></font><br><br>

managed  to win four elections.  But, please, I tell the younger

Singaporeans, do not take me as an example.  They  should  learn

their  second  language or their mother tongue because  it  will

widen their horizon and open new vistas, as other speakers  have

said.   I remember in the 60s, after Stalin had died, there  was

one  Mr Khruschev who took over from Stalin.  He visited America

and of course he was remembered for banging the shoes at the  UN

meeting.   But  I  remember him saying, when the reporter  asked

him,  "Do  you understand, or can you speak English?"  He  said,

"Not   yet."    He  said,  "Why  bother?   I  have  always   got

interpreters  to do it for me."  That may be good  for  leaders.

But  for  the  ordinary person, we cannot  have  an  interpreter

moving with us all the time.  We must know the language.  If  we

want  to communicate with somebody, it is better to speak  their

language.   We  have  to  know  the  language.   Languages   are

important.  In fact, we should not only learn one mother tongue,

but if given the opportunity, we should learn other languages as

well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just visited Japan. Fortunately, I have already taken up

learning of Mandarin and I do not understand a word of Japanese.

But  I  managed  to  get around because I  could  recognise  the

Chinese  characters which they use.   They call  it  Kanji.   So

language is important.  There is no doubt about that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message that I want to make is: do not leave it until

it  is  too  late, like in my case.  I find it  a  big  struggle

learning  Mandarin  because our muscles, especially  around  the

jaw,  are already sagged and it is difficult for me to pronounce

some Mandarin words like si shi, jue de, jian kang.  There is no

equivalent in English. Even at my age, I have got to go  through

these lessons.   If I read for half an hour, my jaw is all tired

after pronouncing the words.  So do not leave it until it is too

late.   What  should we do then if we really want to  teach  our

children the language?  I would say, start them off as early  as

possible, even at 2 1/2 years old.  Of course, the best  way  to

teach  a  child or a person a language is what they call  "total

immersion".  If you want to learn a language, if you are already

an adult, the best place is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1882</b></font><br><br>

to  go  and stay in that country for 3 months, 6 months  or  one

year, and you will master the language.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a child, those from English-speaking

background,  I would advise that they send their children  to  a

Chinese-speaking  kindergarten, if there is any,  and  put  them

through  a  Chinese-speaking kindergarten, if possible,  through

Chinese  primary school.  By the time they come out from primary

school,  they can already speak Chinese for sure.  And at  home,

of course, if they speak English, they will have no problem with

English.  I think that is the best solution.  But I do not  know

whether we have this kind of system in Singapore.  Actually,  Mr

Goh Choon Kang said just now that the Speak Mandarin Campaign is

not  going on too well.  The statistics show it.  In 1998,  20%;

10 years later, 40% English-speaking homes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid that the Government is losing the battle as far

as promotion of Mandarin speaking is concerned.  So what must it

do?   As  Mdm Claire Chiang has rightly pointed out, they should

make  the  language more interesting.  Look at  the  methodology

and, above all, you must make the child love the language.  Once

he  has got a love for the language, it will be much easier.  It

is  of  course good for adults if we tell them that it  will  be

useful  if they are going to China to do business.  But  if  you

tell  a six-year old child that if he can speak Chinese, it will

be  useful next time if he goes to China where he can earn a lot

of  money, he will not understand.  So you must find  a  way  to

make  the  language or subject more interesting, and  make  them

love it.  This was what I was taught when I was in the Teachers'

Training  College.   Whether  it  is  Mathematics,  Science   or

language, these are the more difficult subjects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message is that you must alter our methodology rather

than  use a popular policy to lower the standard of Chinese.   I

do  not  think  that will be a solution.  In fact, our  standard

must   be  maintained.   If  the  children  cannot  attain  that

standard,  we have to look at the educational reasons  why  they

cannot  reach  that standard, rather than to take  a  convenient

route out

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1883</b></font><br><br>

and  lower  the standard.  How low can we go?  CL2, CL  `B'  and

then what, CL `C'?  I do not think that is the correct way.   No

doubt  it is a popular method of lowering the standard and  say,

"Look,  my  child has passed Chinese, but do not  say  "B"."   I

think  the  solution  is  to find a good  methodology,  make  it

interesting, make the children love the subject.   That  is  the

way.   And of course, if you can have total immersion when  they

are young, that would be even better still.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like myself, I come from an English-speaking background and

my   daughter   managed   to  go  through   a   Chinese-speaking

kindergarten  and  a  SAP primary school.   And  when  she  took

Chinese, there was no problem.  Maybe she is a female, I do  not

know.   Anyway, she got through her Chinese and she  did  rather

well at it, and she is also learning French and other languages.

I  think  it is the motivation.  As for myself, I was in  school

when  Singapore  was still a colony and I went to  a  well-known

mission  school  which did not seem to encourage  the  study  of

Chinese.  In fact, it was not prestigious at all when I  was  in

school to study Chinese.  It was more prestigious to study Latin

and  of  course I managed to get through Latin which I  am  very

proud.   But  if  I had spent the same time and effort  studying

Chinese, I think I would be very much better off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a monolingual person, I do not think that is a very

good  thing.   We  should study Chinese and being  in  a  multi-lingual  place  like  Singapore, our  children  should  also  be

encouraged to study Malay.  I know DPM has said that  our  brain

is  finite and we cannot study too many languages, but if it  is

possible,  we  should  master a  little  bit  of  Malay.   I  am

surprised  that when young Singaporeans today, going across  the

Causeway, see a notice in Malay, they are completely at a  loss.

They cannot recognise even a few words.  That is very bad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are serious about promoting the Chinese language, I

agree with Mr Ang Mong Seng who said that we should have another

university, a Chinese university.  If

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1884</b></font><br><br>

that  is  not  possible,  then  we should  enlarge  the  Chinese

Department  at  NUS, make it a bigger department  to  train  the

necessary journalists, teachers, broadcasters and the like.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think these are all the points I want to make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Information  and  the Arts (Mr Yatiman Yusof)  (In  Malay):   Mr

Speaker, after listening to the speeches on the Chinese language

in  Singapore, and the supportive speeches made by my friends in

this House, I would like to contribute my views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the question of language is important because

it  is  a matter related to the teaching, absorption and efforts

to  learn  a language.  It is important because language  is  an

important  factor  in  developing the  mind.   It  is  important

because  our attitude towards language will help the development

of  our  community - either it is very close in its  outlook  or

very  open.   Thirdly, the question of language policy  requires

long-term  consideration.  An example is when we introduced  the

multi-lingual policy in 1959, where the schools were  encouraged

to  teach  in  various  languages - Malay,  Tamil,  English  and

Chinese - it produced people like Mr Opposition here and myself.

As  a  result  of this multi-lingual education system,  we  have

Singaporeans  with different viewpoints but  at  the  same  time

sharing what is fundamental to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of language is important in that it is closely

related to the thinking process and culture.  Language taught us

the  norms  and what is culturally acceptable.  Our  ability  to

command  a  language will reflect our views on development  from

the  perspective of the culture of our upbringing.  That is  why

we should find ways now to provide the solutions to questions of

language that we face in schools.  We have, at some early  time,

introduced a language policy.  The language policy of  1959  and

its emphasis was meant to achieve political objective as part of

our  merger plan with Malaysia and in 1965 when we got out  from

Malaysia,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1885</b></font><br><br>

we  changed the language policy because Singapore would have  to

face  reality  as  an  independent  state.   We  introduced  the

bilingualism  policy  in  order  to  achieve  a  city  state  of

excellence  and  at  the  same time,  created  our  own  special

identity.  As a country in the East, we use the English language

as  the  working language and mother tongue as a bridge  to  our

cultural values.  This is important because we do not want to be

like  the  people  in  the Caribbean or in  South  Africa  where

English  is  the  main language - an important language  in  the

countries  and  that their local culture and language  ties  are

completely removed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore learns from the experience of these foreign

communities and we are confident that we can always  avoid  this

division  of  monolingualism becoming relative by upholding  the

policy  of bilingualism.  Our problem  now is not only to  cater

for  the  different  abilities to learn the language  among  the

children  in  schools,  but to fulfil  our  aspirations  and  to

encourage  efforts from parents and the community at large.   We

have  to  accept the different attitudes towards and the ability

to  learn the language.  And I see the statement by the  DPM  as

the  way  to achieve this basic objective - a community that  is

multi-racial  yet united, one that can understand the  situation

surrounding ourselves and, at the same time, able to acquire the

latest technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stress on such a policy is a practical way in securing

our economic interest, and we have got an excellent and balanced

approach.  And this balanced approach is the provision  of  full

opportunity  to  learn  English as the first  language  and  the

mother  tongue (Mandarin, Malay and Tamil) as a second  language

to  satisfy  their cultural, language and heritage requirements.

It  is  not easy to produce an efficient bilingualist.   Mr  Goh

Choon Kang has explained that efficient bilingualism can only be

practised  by  a  small  section  of  our  community.    To   be

efficiently  bilingual,  one not only  can  fluently  speak  the

language, ie, speak in both languages but, at the same time,  is

able to think quickly in both languages and is able to relate on

matters

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1886</b></font><br><br>

of in-depth cultural heritage.  Such efficient bilingualists are

able  to understand the deep, intricate philosophical issues  in

two  languages as well.  That is why they are rare  a  breed  of

people  and  because of this, professionalism in  the  study  of

language, as proposed by DPM, is the best way out and should  be

supported.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, I am happy that the bilingualism

policy  gives equal opportunity to learn not only Mandarin,  but

Malay and Tamil as well, through what they call, the possibility

of  E/ML2,  E/ML2B,  TL2  and TL2B, and in  this  connection,  I

understand the problem has not arisen yet.  The results of Malay

language  students  show that Malay students  have  got  a  good

command and performance of their language compared to the  other

students.   At the same time, there are already increased  signs

of  problems facing the second and third generation of the Malay

community and this trend is also at present faced by the Chinese

community.  In future, it is better that we have flexibility for

Malay and Tamil students as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the statement by the DPM.

<br>5.30 pm

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr

Speaker,  allow me to address some of the issues that have  been

raised  by Members today before the Deputy Prime Minister rounds

up the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, what is our language policy and what is the

standard  we  strive for in Chinese?  Sir, we live in  a  multi-racial   society.   Bilingualism  is  the  cornerstone  of   our

education  system.   Our  policy is for  English  as  the  first

language  and  the main language of instruction in our  schools.

This  policy  has  served us well.  It has given  us  access  to

technology in the world.  It has served us well in business  and

in  foreign relations.  It has also been a unifying factor among

all the races in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policy for the mother tongue, Chinese as well as Malay and

Tamil, and the other non-Tamil Indian languages, is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1887</b></font><br><br>

for  every  child  to learn his mother tongue  for  as  long  as

possible and to as high a level as possible.  There is therefore

no  one standard that we can apply to the learning of the mother

tongue.  We are not a homogenous society, like Germany or Japan.

We  are  a  multi-racial society.  Perhaps, if our society  were

homogenous and we were several degrees of latitude further north

and  several degrees of longitude further east, we might be able

to  achieve the aspirations that Mr Low Thia Khiang talks  about

of  having  Chinese as the language in Singapore.   Instead,  we

need  to set standards that are appropriate.  Therefore, we have

the  standard bearer (we are talking about the Chinese  language

now)  and  the standard bearer is Higher Chinese, then  a  level

which is suitable for the vast majority of Chinese Singaporeans,

which is CL, and for those who despite putting in a considerable

effort  are  unable to make it, CL `B'.  This set of  principles

will  also  apply  to  the  other  mother  tongue  languages  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address the specific issues that have been

raised  within this context and this structure of  the  language

policy  in Singapore.  First, CL `B'.  Dr Ow Chin Hock,  Dr  Ker

Sin Tze, Mr Peh Chin Hua and others have asked whether or not CL

`B'  will  become  a soft option.  There is a remarkably  strong

desire  among Chinese Singaporeans today to study Chinese.   For

example,  at the PSLE, at the streaming at Primary 4,  something

like 13-14% of students qualify to do Higher Chinese in the  EM1

stream, but in fact many parents opt for their children to study

Higher  Chinese, so that something like 22-23% opt to do  Higher

Chinese.  This is one illustration of the strength of the desire

for  students in Singapore and for parents in Singapore to  want

their children to study Higher Chinese.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only incentive that they have for this is really a couple of

bonus points if they do decide to go to one of the nine, now 10,

SAP  schools.   Otherwise, studying Higher  Chinese  in  primary

school gives them no other benefit beyond taking standard CL  in

primary school.  So even

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1888</b></font><br><br>

relatively small incentives do encourage parents to want to have

their  children  do Higher Chinese and also there  is  a  strong

desire,  other than incentive reasons, that parents  want  their

children  to do Higher Chinese.  In fact, it would  seem  to  me

that  the  desire is so strong that even Mr Chiam is  trying  to

crack  his jaws to learn Chinese at his age.  It shows that  the

Speak  Mandarin  campaign does work, Mr Chiam, if  you  too  are

struggling to learn Chinese.  When we implement CL `B', we  will

still continue to encourage students to go as far as they can in

Chinese.  We have put in a number of incentives for students  to

study  Higher  Chinese. Similarly, there will be incentives  for

students to study CL as opposed to CL `B'.  Let me give  Members

a few examples.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we would do is to implement CL `B' from Secondary 3

upwards, which means that students from Primary 1 to Secondary 2

will  study CL or HCL, and only if they are unable to cope,  the

teachers  will of course be involved with this assessment,  will

they  be  given the option of taking CL `B'.  CL `B'  will  also

only  meet the qualification requirements for JC and university,

which  means  that students give up something quite considerable

when they take CL `B'.  This means that for JCs, they are unable

to count their CL scores for admission to JC, and for university

they  do not get any point in the calculation of those 76 points

for  admission to university.  So when a student takes up CL `B'

at  Secondary 3, he knows that there are implications along  the

way.   The  benefit for him is that he will be able  to  do  the

language at the level which he can probably cope with and  would

get  a  pass that would qualify him to JC or university, but  he

will  not get points which will give him an advantage over other

students.   So  these are already fairly strong incentives,  and

disincentives, if you like, for taking CL as opposed to CL `B'.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin has asked what schools would offer CL `B'. Our

intention is that CL `B' would be available in all schools where

there  is a demand for it.  Of course, the SAP schools will  not

be  offering CL `B', as that would be running quite  counter  to

what the SAP schools are there for.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1889</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chiang talks about stigmatisation and whether or not we

would be creating even more groups of students by introducing  a

CL  `B'.   I would urge Mdm Chiang and all parents not to  treat

streaming and grouping of students in this rather, I would  say,

old-fashioned way.  What we are trying to build in our education

system  is  an  ability-driven system  where  we  will  try  and

customise the courses and the programmes that the students take,

according  to  their  ability in those particular  subjects.   I

would  rather move away from this idea of stigmatisation and  to

look at it from the point of view of providing opportunities for

students to play to their strength and still learn a basic level

of other subjects where they are not as strong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move now to the opposite set of issues from CL `B',

which is whether or not we can re-create Chinese schools of  the

past.  I am surprised that Mr Chiam is advocating such a policy.

As I said, the bilingual policy has been in place for many years

in Singapore and has served us well.  I do not see us going back

on that.  In fact, when given a choice today, parents opt to put

their children in English stream and to study as much English as

possible.   In  fact,  that  is one of  the  major  concerns  of

parents.   We  do  have  a  stream  called  ME3,  which  is  the

complement  of  the  EM3 stream in primary  school.   I  am  not

surprised that most Members have not heard of this, but  it  has

been  in existence since 1991.  In the ME3 stream, students  can

offer mother tongue at first language level and basic English at

a  lower level.  But since it was introduced in 1991, no one has

opted for this stream.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what we can do and what we will do is to create a strong

environment for learning Chinese, for promoting Chinese  culture

and  values  in  our  10  SAP schools.    We  will  continue  to

strengthen  these schools.  We have also opened up the  Language

Elective  Programme  in another junior college,  Nanyang  Junior

College, and I am quite optimistic that this junior college will

be  able  to generate the functional specialists, if you prefer,

that  we would desire in our society.  In fact, quite at random,

I  asked  two  students whom I met when I  visited  the  Nanyang

Junior

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1890</b></font><br><br>

College  what  they would like to do after they  have  finished.

Both  of them told me: to teach.  I was very heartened by  this.

Three of the nine journalists who were there on that day for the

press  conference came from Nanyang Junior College.  I was quite

heartened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another set of issues was with regard to whether or not we

could  take  other subjects in Chinese as this would  provide  a

broader  range of experiences and a broader range in  which  the

language is used beyond just studying it as a language.  Mr  Peh

Chin  Hua,  Dr  Ow  Chin Hock and others raised  this.   Chinese

Literature is already available in our schools.  We are going to

make an Introduction to Appreciation of Chinese as an enrichment

course  in the SAP schools for all the lower secondary students.

We  hope  that with this more of the students in the SAP schools

will be encouraged to take Chinese Literature.  We also have, at

the  junior college level, General Studies in Chinese.  This  is

like  GP,  but in Chinese.  Those students who have a particular

love  for  Chinese  and  a facility with the  language  do  take

General Studies in Chinese.  We hope that with the encouragement

of a broader band of students taking CL in secondary schools and

at  junior  college more students will be motivated to  take  up

these subjects as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third type of issue that I would like to raise is on

teacher  and teaching methodology.  Mr Loh Meng See, Mr  Kenneth

Chen,  Prof.  Chin and Mdm Claire Chiang, among  others,  raised

this   issue.   I  particularly  welcome  Mr  Ang  Mong   Seng's

encouragement  to our CL teachers. They work  very  hard.   They

have a difficult job to do and they try very hard to do it well.

I  have spoken to the Teachers' Unions and I have spoken to many

of  the  teachers, and they are putting in a lot  of  effort  to

improve  the teaching methodologies in the school.  The Ministry

is  doing its best to recruit good Chinese teachers and for that

matter,  good  mother tongue teachers in all the  mother  tongue

languages.   Again,  we  hope  that with  this  regeneration  of

specialists in Chinese we will be able to have a bigger pool  to

draw upon in order to recruit our Chinese language teachers.  In

fact, when I visit the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1891</b></font><br><br>

schools, I see both young and enthusiastic Chinese teachers, and

I  see  also old and enthusiastic Chinese teachers.  It  is  the

approach  that  they take and not their age, which  is  a  major

factor.   And in this area, both the Ministry and the  Teachers'

Unions have been quite proactive in getting the teachers  to  be

trained and re-trained, in teaching methodologies, as well as in

teaching  technologies, for example, in the use  of  information

technology and computers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education, as you know, is putting in

computers and information technology in schools in a major  way,

and  we  are  also developing a lot of software for use  in  the

mother  tongue languages.  This, I hope, will help to  make  the

teaching and the learning of mother tongue more interesting.   I

am  not sure if all the CD-ROMs will turn out like Mulan, but  I

hope that the interactive nature and the fact that students  can

learn on their own, at their own pace, do revision, and look  at

the  things again and again if they want to, will help  them  to

learn better and to improve their standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said again, Sir, the basic principle upon which the

language policy in our schools is founded is quite clear.  There

is  no  doubt  that we have bilingualism - English as  the  main

language, mother tongue to as high a level as possible.  We live

in  a multi-racial society.  These are the facts that we have in

Singapore and these are the factors upon which we have to try to

build  both  a modern society open to the world, as  well  as  a

society that is well-rooted in its traditions and its values.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> May I seek a clarification from the

Minister?   The Minister has mentioned in his speech that  there

is  a standard bearer of the Chinese language.  I would like  to

know from him what is the basic standard of Chinese that will be

attainable, let us say, under the new scheme of CL `B'.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have just explained

that we have to customise education in Singapore to students  of

different ability levels.  So Higher

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1892</b></font><br><br>

Chinese  is  a  standard bearer, CL is a level  which  the  vast

majority of students can reach, and CL `B' will be a basic level

which  students who face difficulties and have put in a  lot  of

effort  should  be able to reach.  We expect  that  the  CL  `B'

standard will be somewhere about the Secondary (Normal) standard

for  Chinese,  but  with a heavier emphasis on  aural  and  oral

skills.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Admiral Teo has

addressed  most  of the points raised by the Members.   I  would

like  to sum up in Mandarin.  But before I do that, I just  want

to  take up one important point which Admiral Teo did not cover,

and  this was the remark by Dr Tan Cheng Bock that we should not

talk  about Chinese elite, and this was picked up by Mdm  Claire

Chiang.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can change the word, if you find another word more

convenient.   But  I think the argument is not about  vocabulary

but  about  a very important concept, which is this -  Singapore

society  is  not homogenous.  It is multi-racial; it  is  multi-religious;  it  is multi-cultural.  And indeed even  within  the

Chinese  society, there is quite a clear differentiation between

the Chinese language group and the English-speaking group.  This

diversity, this variation, is in fact one of the sources of  our

strength.   It  is  like a rope with many fibres  in  it,  wound

together, and therefore deriving strength from one another.   If

we  were homogenous as one Chinese-speaking society amongst  the

Chinese, I think we will be weaker as a country, because I think

the   link  between  the  Chinese  community  and  the  minority

communities  will he harder to establish without  English  as  a

common  ground.  If we were completely English-speaking  amongst

the  Chinese community, or minimally Chinese literate and mainly

English-speaking,  I think we would also be weaker,  because  we

would  not  have that cultural anchor, that root, that strength,

which  hold us in time of difficulty.  The people who  come  out

from  the different streams come out in different moulds.   They

are  different.   You  look at him, you watch  him  walk  a  few

metres, and you say, "This one is a Hwa Chong child or Hwa Chong

alumnus."  Or that is RI, and that one looks very much like  ACS

- Mr

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1893</b></font><br><br>

Chiam.   You can tell, they are different.  ACS is a  very  good

school; RI is an even better school.  Probably so, but if all of

Singapore were ACSians and Rafflesians, I think we would be  the

poorer  for it, because we would be without the Chinese schools,

we  would  be  without the people with the Islamic  culture,  we

would  be  without the Hindu culture.  And you would  lose  that

ballast and that sense of continuity and Asian roots, which  are

important to our survival as a nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think in the future that Chinese component of our

society will be exactly the same as it was in the past.  Because

the   historical  past  is  different,  the  circumstances   are

different,  the  situation  which made  the  Chinese  elite  and

establishment what it was before and after the world and in  the

1960s  has changed.  We are in the 1990s, about to go  into  the

21st century.  So the challenges are different.  But to want  to

maintain  that,  so that you not only have individuals  who  are

very  proficient  in  Chinese and can make  speeches;  not  only

teachers,  journalists and Ministers but  also  a  certain  sub-segment  of  our society with a certain cohesion of itself,  and

with  the  individuals to be at the top of that  segment  to  be

teachers,  to be principals, to be in the clans, to  be  in  the

Chambers  of Commerce, to be in the literary arena to write,  to

paint,  to  put  on drama; I think that is something  extra  and

different.  If you do not like the word "elite", you think it is

elitist, change it to something else - Top of the Pyramid, those

who are natural leaders of the community, if you will - but that

is what we want to preserve and it goes beyond Chinese language,

and it is a very important motivation for what we do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let me summarise in Mandarin, because I think the

points  which MPs have raised have already mainly been  met  and

also  because the MPs have been supportive and understanding  of

the purpose of this exercise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin) Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the

Members who have spoken in support of the Government's policy on

the teaching of  Chinese language.  The response from the MPs is

very  encouraging.  Teaching and learning of Chinese is  a  very

important issue in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1894</b></font><br><br>

Singapore.   Before deciding on the changes, we  have  requested

for  and  received feedback from the various quarters.   I  have

personally spoken to the editors and journalists of the  Chinese

newspapers,   the  Chinese-educated MPs and  listened  to  their

views.   Admiral  Teo  has also spoken and  discussed  with  the

Chinese  Teachers' Union and their leaders on this issue.   They

all  know  where the crux of the matter is, where  the  question

lies, where the problem is.  Therefore, they also agree that  it

is necessary to revise the contents of the Chinese curricula and

our   policy  on  Chinese  language.   Of  course,  the  Chinese

community  is very concerned about the adjustments to the  level

of   Chinese   language  in  our  schools,  and   the   proposed

introduction  of  the  CL `B' paper, and  the  impact,  possibly

negative  impact,  thereof.  This concern  is  valid  and  quite

understandable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are making this adjustment to the level of Chinese language

with  two  objectives.  First, to nurture  a  group  of  Chinese

elite, and secondly,  to provide all students, especially  those

from the English-speaking families, a realistic level of Chinese

for them to study and pass the examination set at this level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bilingual education policy and the policy to learn

mother tongue in schools will remain unchanged.  The main policy

will  remain  unchanged, but the details can  be  adjusted.   In

implementing  this  policy, we must do so in  keeping  with  the

changes  of  times  and circumstances.  We are a  multi-lingual,

multi-racial  and  multi-religious society.  A Chinese  cultural

elite in this kind of a society has got a very important role to

play.   The  spirit,  the outlook in life  and  the  social  and

political  values of the Chinese-educated and Chinese elite  are

different   from   those   of   the   English-educated.     But,

nevertheless,  they complement one another.   For  example,  the

Chinese High School and RI are both excellent schools.  Yet, the

students  they  produce  possess different  characteristics  and

dispositions.  We will be so much poorer if we have one  without

the other, and it will be a great loss.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in this regard, I agree with Dr Ker Sin Tze. We

are not Japan.  We cannot

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1895</b></font><br><br>

use  Japanese as our national language.  We are not Germany,  we

are  not  France.  We are a multi-racial Singapore  situated  in

Southeast  Asia.   Our  working  language  is  English  and  our

international environment is also quite westernised.  Therefore,

it  is  not an easy thing to nurture a group of Chinese cultural

elite  here, but we are making efforts to make some  changes  to

our  education  policy, and these are some of the  examples.   I

think  to  increase the number of SAP schools and through  other

changes  and  all  that I have announced, we can  have  positive

results.  I am confident of that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we cannot go back to the old ways of the 1950s and

1960s.   The  Chinese schools then and the Chinese  elites  were

products of certain historical circumstances.  At that  time  we

were a colony.  The Chinese students were anti-colonialism and a

mainstay in the fight for independence.  Contributions from  the

English-educated in those days were relatively little.   Amongst

the  Chinese-educated students, some were communists, some  were

not.   After  the  merger with Malaysia, in  the  drive  against

communalism, the Chinese community also played a very  important

role.   Because had the Chinese community bowed to the political

pressure then, Singapore would be finished.  But, now, that sort

of  situation  has already passed us, it must therefore  be  put

behind us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that even in China or Hong Kong or Taiwan, values

and  traditions  do  not  remain unchanged.   So  under  certain

political,  social  and  cultural conditions,  there  are  three

different   developments.    The  Chinese   in   Taiwan   become

"Taiwanised", even the Mandarin they speak is contaminated  with

the  local  Taiwanese dialects.  In Hong Kong, you have  a  very

strong  local indigenous culture - the Cantonese culture with  a

very strong commercial flavour.   This was because Hong Kong was

a  colony, an economy but not a sovereign nation.   Now that  it

has become a Special Autonomy Region of China, it is also in the

process of transformation.  China has been opening up after  the

cultural revolution.  With the economic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1896</b></font><br><br>

reform  and open-door policy, their culture and values are  also

evolving  and  changing.  Therefore, the  Chinese  elite  cannot

remain  unchanged.   Our  Chinese elite  should  move  with  the

development  of the Chinese culture and play an active  role  to

promote  and  shape  Singapore into  a  metropolitan   city  and

economy in the 21st century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our mother tongue policy must be realistic with the standard

level  of teaching and learning set at a level relevant  to  our

students.   Because of the limitations to our human brains,  not

many   people  have  the  capability  to  master  two  languages

effectively, just as our computer does not necessarily have  the

capability  to run every type of software, and if  you  overload

it,  things  do not work out so well.  So this is a question  of

brain, not a question of mouth and jaw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked what is the bottomline for our

Chinese  education.  He seems to imply that the  Government  has

been  too accommodating and has fixed too low a bottomline.   My

answer is that our bottomline is one that is achieveable by  our

average  students with reasonable efforts in learning.  This  is

our   bottomline.   We  all  have children.   Most  of  us  have

children.   We all know there are children who may be strong  in

certain  subjects, and not so strong in some other subjects.   I

believe  that  the  children of Mr  Low  Thia  Khiang  are  also

studying in our schools.  But what are their results?  What kind

of  problems do they face?  Can you keep on applying pressure on

them,  just like the way you  pump up the balloons?  Your  blood

pressure will rise too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our Members of Parliament learn through their own

personal  experiences that it is not easy for  our  children  to

master both English and Chinese at the same time. Even those who

were  educated in Chinese and who speak Mandarin  at  home  also

discover that the standard of Chinese of their children is lower

than  the good old days.  Mr Peh Chin Hua has expressed  regrets

that although his children have been doing well in their Chinese

examinations,  their standard was still not to his satisfaction.

Just imagine, what will be the level of Chinese in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1897</b></font><br><br>

Singapore  at  the  time  of our grandchildren.   What  kind  of

problems  will  they face?  Although we have not  come  to  that

stage, the time will come.  So we have to face this reality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the primary schools, I do not think there is much

problem.  But when you come to the secondary schools, it is more

difficult.  Let me tell you my personal experience.  I spent  13

years learning Chinese, six years in a primary school, six years

in a secondary school, and one year in the Junior College.  They

were  all Chinese schools: Nanyang Primary School, Catholic High

School  and National Junior College.  At home, I spoke  Mandarin

to  my  father.   I  learned Chinese, and he was  also  learning

Chinese.  But when I reached the secondary school level, I began

to  find it difficult.  For the primary school level, I  had  no

problem passing my Chinese examinations.  At the Secondary  Four

`O' level examination, I worked very hard, but I managed only  a

C4.   I was dissatisfied with myself.  I worked harder.  When  I

was in junior college, I had tuition and worked even harder. For

the  General Paper, known as Comprehension and Essay Writing,  I

had  only a 6.  Comprehension, no problem!  Essay writing, there

were problems.  In a Chinese school, a "6", almost failed!  If I

had  failed, there would be no scholarship for me.  Fortunately,

I passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, one year, I went to NJC. I was not satisfied with

my  "6".  I wanted to improve my Chinese.  So I decided to  take

Chinese  as  a  principal subject, or "A" level.  For  principal

level  Chinese, we had to learn classical Chinese (wen yen  wen)

and Chinese literature.  After a few months, my teacher told me,

"Your  Chinese is not so good.  Your lines of thoughts expressed

in  your  essays are very messy."  But I never had that kind  of

problem  with my English essay writing.  Why should I have  this

problem  when  I  wrote in Chinese?  It was not  a  question  of

content,  but a question of language.  However, the content  and

the  language are closely linked because your brain has  only  a

limited  capacity. You are unable to express  the  idea  clearly

because you are too handicapped in your command of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1898</b></font><br><br>

language.  So after a few months, I gave up.  I did not take the

principal Chinese paper in my `A' level examination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I am convinced that learning Chinese is not an easy

task.   Even now, I read Lianhe Zaobao every day, and listen  to

news  over Channel 8 every night.   Yet, every time when I  want

to make a major speech in Mandarin or to be interviewed, I would

still  have  to  spend  some time to  prepare  and  practise  in

Mandarin.  Otherwise, my expression, my sentences will  not  run

smoothly and fluently.  Expressions in English, and even English

grammar  will  seep in, even the words I utter  may  not  be  in

English.   So I think it is not an easy problem to solve.   Some

students  are  learning their languages better  than  I  do.   I

always  admire  those  students who score distinctions  in  both

languages,  because I failed to do it.  But  I  also  know  that

there  are many other students who are just like me, finding  it

difficult to learn Chinese.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our teachers have already known this as a fact. When I

studied  this problem, I asked some teachers, some  Ministry  of

Education  officials  to  introduce articles  from  the  ancient

Chinese  classics in the curriculum of Higher Chinese.   I  told

them  that  some of these Chinese classics were very  meaningful

and  could  have great impact on the students. If we can  expose

our   students  to  these  articles,  this  essence  of  Chinese

literature  will be of great benefit to them.  But the  teachers

told  me  that this was not realistic, not quite possible.   The

simple  reason is that the students may be taking Higher Chinese

but  if  you  want  them to study classical Chinese,  they  just

cannot  cope  with  it.  In formulating the  curricula  for  our

Higher Chinese, we face this restriction and constraint.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we must fix the level of Chinese at an appropriate

and  suitable level.  This level cannot be decided by our  likes

or  dislikes.   It must go according to our experience  and  the

level that is attainable by the students.  If we can incorporate

advanced  technology into our teaching methods, then  the  level

can  be  enhanced.  If you tell me that you want  to  raise  the

standard of teaching, improve

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1899</b></font><br><br>

the quality of teachers without adjusting the difficult level of

the Chinese paper, I think it cannot be accepted.  We have tried

to  improve the teaching method. Yes, we must do that, but it is

not the panacea to all our problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Chinese-educated Members of Parliament also show their

concerns about the curricula of the Chinese Language for EL  `B'

in  that it should not be regarded as a "soft option".  I  agree

with  their  views  and we will pay specific attention  to  this

aspect.   But with our past experience in handling the level  of

Chinese  teaching  and learning in Singapore, we  are  confident

that  the  situation  will  improve,  because  the  parents  are

supportive  of  the  idea  of their children  learning  Chinese,

albeit  some  may wish that the burden would not be  too  heavy.

But, as the Minister has mentioned, according to our guidelines,

at  the  Primary 4 streaming, about 13% to 14% of the cohort  of

students should qualify to take Higher Chinese.  But because  of

the  insistence of the parents, there are about  22%  of  ethnic

Chinese  students actually taking Higher Chinese,  and  most  of

them can cope with it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents encourage the students to take EM1 because they believe

that  it  is better for their children to learn more.  Moreover,

most parents feel that their children are intelligent and should

be  encouraged  to  do EM1.  I think this is  some  good  social

pressure which is acceptable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our recent survey, 88% of parents feel that Chinese is an

important subject.  Students may or may not like Chinese but 80%

to  90% recognise that it is an important subject.  They may not

know  that they have to use Chinese to make big money in  China.

But  they  share the views of their parents, teachers,  and  the

whole  society.   So we must take Chinese.   If  we  do  not  do

Chinese  or  do  not do Chinese well, although you  may  not  be

denied  a place, you will feel a little uncomfortable or  rather

ashamed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do more than 90% of the parents endorse the values from the

Chinese

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1900</b></font><br><br>

culture?   All these facts prove that the parents  know  that  a

knowledge of Chinese is an important and helpful thing to  their

children.   They  also know they want their  children  to  learn

Chinese.   They are using all kinds of methods to supervise  and

encourage  their children to master the Chinese language.   They

may  engage  a  tuition  teacher,  even  two  or  three  tuition

teachers,  to  coach  their  children.   Some  even  send  their

children  to  Taiwan  or China for  "immersion  courses".   They

offer  all kinds of incentives and rewards - score 90  marks  in

your  Chinese dictation, and I will buy you a Chinese  software.

They  use  all kinds of incentives, ways and means to  encourage

their  children  to learn Chinese.  But if the pressure  is  too

great,  I  think  the children's attitude may  change  or  their

parents'  attitude may change.  Although they say they  support,

the  feasibility must be studied.  We cannot overlook or neglect

the feedback from such parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the changes that we are making to the Chinese curriculum

will  help  maintain our mother tongue education policy  in  the

ever-changing  circumstances.  We must  frequently  discuss  and

review  our mother tongue policy.  This debate will not  be  the

last  one  in this House.  But so long as we continue to  adjust

our   policy  according  to  objective  circumstances  and  make

realistic  approaches, we will be able to maintain  the  Chinese

culture, Chinese traditions and Chinese values in us.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, could I seek some

clarifications from the Deputy Prime Minister?  According to DPM

Lee,  under  the new policy, the Government will allow  children

from  an English speaking home who have encountered difficulties

in coping with Chinese to opt for a new CL `B' paper. So long as

they  pass  the  Chinese paper at this level, it  will  be  good

enough  and  they can carry on with their studies  in  a  junior

college.    I  would  like to know whether the Government  would

also  consider  allowing those children  from  Chinese  speaking

families, and who encounter difficulties coping with English, to

sit for an English

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1901</b></font><br><br>

paper, such as EL `B', at a lower level so that they could  pass

English at a basic level and proceed to a junior college?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, actually the

question  has  already been answered by the Minister  just  now.

The  answer is quite straightforward.  The Government  does  not

have any particular view on it. But, I believe it is the parents

who are more concerned with the matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister has said, we do have a ME3 course where the

students  can  take his mother tongue as the first language  and

English  as a second language.  We offer this option, but  there

is  no  taker.  For students who cannot get through  the  normal

streaming,  then they can opt to to do ME3 - take mother  tongue

as  the first language and English as a second language.  We let

the  parents  have a free choice.  However, it  has  been  eight

years  since 1991 when we introduced this option, and the number

of  enrolment is still zero.  Nobody has enrolled for this  type

of course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are looking for a realistic approach. What are the

expectations  of the parents?  What can we teach  the  students?

If  we put all these together, we would be able to settle on  an

appropriate level.  This is an objective fact of life.   We have

looked at the quality of our students.  We know their abilities,

we  can  assess them and say that they can more or  less  attain

this  level.   We  are  not  taking the  weakest  student  as  a

benchmark.   We are looking at those students who  are  weak  in

Chinese but whose other academic results are not too bad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese is not the only second language subject our

students  are  taking for their examinations. Some students  are

doing  German, French, Japanese and Malay as a second  or  third

language.   They have to reach a certain level of competence  to

pass  their examinations.   There must be a certain level  which

is  attainable by them.  I feel that we would be able to  set  a

level that is reasonably attainable.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Perhaps the DPM did not

quite  understand my question.  In the past, for Chinese  school

students to go from Secondary 4 to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1902</b></font><br><br>

Pre-University,  they  had to score  a  credit  in  the  Chinese

Language,  otherwise  they  did not  even  qualify  for  a  full

certificate.  In those days, even the ordinary Chinese  language

paper  was  of a much higher standard than the so-called  Higher

Chinese paper today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question was: what about those students who come from

Chinese-speaking families?  If their English is  no  good,  they

are  disqualified from enrolment in a junior college.  Will  the

Government also consider setting a English `B' paper  for  these

students  to pass at a less demanding level for admission  to  a

junior college?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If you have a junior

college where all the subjects are taught in Chinese, then  such

a policy would be feasible.  But now, in all the junior colleges

and  Pre-U  centres, the medium of instruction is  English.   If

your  English is no good, then it will be difficult for  you  to

cope with the learning of the various subjects.  This is a basic

principle that we must accept.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether it is fair or unfair to allow those who pass

their  CL  `B' to go further in their studies, we must first  of

all  understand that there is a price to pay for these students.

This  is  because the CL `B' result cannot be taken to calculate

their aggregate.  This will affect their chances of getting into

the  more popular junior colleges because they lose one  subject

for  consideration.  Likewise, in the `A' level results, CL  `B'

result  cannot  be  included  in the  score  for  entry  to  the

university, and they may have difficulty getting places  in  the

more popular disciplines. We are giving some incentives and some

disincentives to discourage  the students from taking the CL `B'

as a "soft option", or an easy way out.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): However, I would like to

seek   clarification  from  the  DPM.   According  to  him,   in

principle, our language policy is such that the level of Chinese

can  be  lowered but the standard of English cannot be  lowered.

Is that what he meant?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Our policy is that the

level of any language

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1903</b></font><br><br>

should  be  determined by the ability of our students.   Whether

our standard of English language should be lowered or not, it is

for the parents to decide.  Do you want to lower the standard of

English  and  maintain the standard of Chinese  by  cutting  the

English  periods  and transferring them to the Chinese  periods?

Alternatively,  should we offer a Chinese paper at  a  realistic

level  to  alleviate the burden of those who have real  problems

with  their learning of Chinese?  Let the parents decide, and  I

believe we can have a very clear answer from them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In English): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to withdraw my

motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion, by leave, withdrawn.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill amends the Probate and Administration Act

and  the  Reciprocal  Enforcement of Foreign  Judgments  Act  to

enable  Singapore  to  restore certain  reciprocal  arrangements

which  existed between Singapore and Hong Kong before Hong  Kong

became  a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic

of China, thus ceasing to be part of the Commonwealth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislative approach employed to achieve this aim is

similar to that employed in the Extradition (Amendment) Act 1998

to  restore  the  pre-existing extradition arrangements  between

Singapore and Hong Kong.  Members may recall that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1905</b></font><br><br>

the  approach  taken  was  to amend the definition  of  "foreign

State" to include territories which are not states in their  own

right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first set of amendments concerns the Probate and

Administration  Act.   Section  46  currently  provides  that  a

probate  or letter of administration granted by a court anywhere

in  the  Commonwealth can be re-sealed by our High Court.   Upon

such re-sealing, the probate or letter of administration will be

recognised by our courts as having the same effect as if  it  is

granted  by  the  High  Court  in Singapore.   At  present,  the

procedure  of  re-sealing under section 46 is not available  for

probate  and  letters of administration granted in countries  or

territories outside the Commonwealth.  In other words, there  is

no  provision  under our law for the recognition of  probate  or

letters  of  administration granted in countries or  territories

outside the Commonwealth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Bill proposes to do is to allow the re-sealing

procedure to be extended to any country or territory outside the

Commonwealth.  This is done by allowing the Minister to declare,

by  a notification in the Gazette, that the re-sealing procedure

will  apply  to  a particular country or territory  outside  the

Commonwealth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final amendment concerning the Probate and

Administration  Act  is the repeal of section  47.   Section  47

applies  to  probate  and letters of administration  granted  in

British  protectorates, which are not part of the  dominions  of

the  British Crown.  This provision is obsolete as there are  no

such protectorates today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second set of amendments relates to the Reciprocal

Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act.  The Bill amends section

2(1) by inserting definitions of "country" and "foreign

country", to make clear that the term "foreign country" includes

a territory which is not a state in its own right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, for consistency, the Bill will also amend section

31  of the Regulation of Imports and Exports Act by defining the

term  "foreign  country",  which is used  in  that  section,  to

include any territory outside Singapore.  This will enable the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1906</b></font><br><br>

Singapore Government, if it wishes to do so in future, to  enter

into  reciprocal  arrangements for the exchange  of  information

with  governments of territories which are not considered states

in their own right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill.  - [Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee].

<div align="center"><b>LAYOUT-DESIGNS OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill, just like the Trade Marks Act, Geographical

Indications  Act and Copyright (Amendment) Act  passed  by  this

House last year, is a product of an Inter-Ministry Committee  on

the Implementation of the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects

of  Intellectual  Property Rights or the  TRIPS  Agreement,  for

short.   The  Committee has been reviewing  our  legislation  on

intellectual  property  rights  (IPR)  to  give  effect  to  our

obligations under the TRIPS Agreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to fulfil Singapore's obligations under

Article  35  of  the  TRIPS  Agreement,  which  requires  member

countries  to  provide  protection  to  the  layout  designs  of

integrated  circuits in accordance with the  provisions  of  the

Treaty   on  Intellectual  Property  in  Respect  of  Integrated

Circuits, 1989 (IPIC) and certain additional provisions  in  the

TRIPS Agreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, "layout-designs of integrated circuits" refers

essentially to the 3-dimensional disposition of the elements and

interconnections making up an integrated circuit or "IC".  An IC

is  an  electronic circuit in which the elements of the  circuit

are  integrated  into  some  medium  and  function  as  a  unit.

Currently,  the  medium  used is a solid semiconductor,  usually

silicon.  The manufacturing technology allows the circuit to  be

integrated into a piece of silicon which is small and thin, like

a wafer, commonly called a "chip" or "silicon chip".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protection of intellectual property right in ICs is an

important step.  ICs have a growing market as they are  utilized

in  many  products from watches to television to traffic  lights

and  of  course  computers.  The design and  production  of  ICs

require heavy investment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1908</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now highlight the main provisions of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill protects a layout-design that is original in the

sense  that  it is the result of its creator's own  intellectual

effort  and is not common place among creators of layout-designs

and  manufacturers of integrated circuits at  the  time  of  its

creation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the owner of a protected layout-design has the right

to   reproduce  it  and  to  commercially  exploit  it  and  any

integrated  circuit in which the layout-design is  incorporated.

Others may only do so with his consent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no requirement for registration or deposit of the

layout-design for the purposes of protection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides a range of defences to infringement

proceedings which are common with other branches of intellectual

property  law.  For example, the owner's right is not  infringed

if  the  reproduction is done for a private purpose or  for  the

sole purpose of evaluation, analysis, research or teaching.  The

Bill  also allows the use of an evaluation or analysis to create

a  different  layout-design that satisfies  the  requirement  of

originality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with the position in other branches of our

intellectual  property  law, parallel import  of  an  integrated

circuit  in which a layout-design is incorporated or an  article

that  contains  an integrated circuit in which the layout-design

is incorporated would be allowed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent with the provisions of the TRIPS Agreement and

established practice in major WTO countries, the Bill allows the

Government to use a layout-design without the permission of  the

owner  for the defence or national security of Singapore, or  to

assist in the exercise of powers and the implementation of civil

defence  measures during a state of emergency or state of  civil

defence emergency.  As is usually the case with such provisions,

the Bill requires the Government to pay appropriate compensation

to  the owner for such usage.  This is the approach we have also

taken in the Copyright Act and Patents Act.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1909</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court is empowered to grant a compulsory licence for a

person  to reproduce or commercially exploit a layout-design  to

remedy  an anti-competitive practice.  Such remuneration as  may

be  considered reasonable by the Court must be paid to the owner

of the layout-design for such usage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A layout-design would be protected for 10 years after the

first  commercial exploitation, if the exploitation takes  place

within  five years of its creation.  In other cases it would  be

protected for a maximum period of 15 years after its creation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of a layout-design may take proceedings and seek

whatever  remedy  by  way of damages, injunctions,  accounts  or

otherwise in regard to an infringement of his rights in a layout-design  as  are  available with respect to  any  other  property

rights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill. - [Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br>6.37 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Road Traffic Act (RTA) was last amended in 1996,

the  number  of fatal and injury traffic accidents has  remained

fairly constant.  There were 5,700 such accidents in 1996, 5,600

in 1997, and 5,200 for the period January to November 1998.  Our

roads are generally safe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is due to the success of the two-pronged strategy of

public  education and strict enforcement adopted by the  Traffic

Police (TP).   For many years now, TP has been organising annual

campaigns to educate motorists on road safety.   In May 1997, TP

organised  the  Speed Management Campaign  for  the  first  time

because  speeding has become the single most prevalent cause  of

road  fatalities in Singapore.  It also organises  annual  Anti-Drink  Drive  Campaign  to coincide with  the  year-end  festive

season.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although most motorists have responded positively to TP's

public  education campaigns, a minority has continued to display

irresponsible  and  dangerous  driving  habits.   The   proposed

amendments in this Bill are targeted primarily at four groups of

such  motorists, namely, foreign motorists who  flout  our  road

traffic  laws,  motorists  who cause  death  or  serious  injury

through   dangerous  or  reckless  driving,  handphone   driving

offenders and road bullies.

<br><br><i>Extension of the Driver Improvement Points System to holders of foreign driving licence</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Driver Improvement Points System (DIPS) will

be extended to include holders of foreign driving licences.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1911</b></font><br><br>

Currently,  the  TP administers the DIPS, which  awards  demerit

points  for the more serious traffic offences such as  speeding,

dangerous or reckless driving, beating red lights and failure to

give  way.     Singapore driving licence holders can have  their

driving licences suspended once they have accumulated 24 demerit

points  or  more over a two-year period under  the  DIPS.     In

addition,  Singapore driving licence holders who commit  serious

traffic offences can have their driving licence suspended by the

Deputy   Commissioner  of  Police  (DCP)   pending   trial,   or

disqualified from driving by the Courts after conviction for the

offence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore is not the issuing authority for foreign

driving  licences,  our  laws do not currently  empower  DCP  to

suspend  these licences nor the Courts to disqualify holders  of

foreign  driving  licences from driving on our  roads.    It  is

timely  to rectify this anomaly because a significant number  of

foreign  motorists  have  been  involved  in  fatal  and  injury

accidents  on  Singapore  roads in recent  years.   Of  the  271

motorists  who  were  involved in fatal  accidents  in  January-November  last  year, 67, or 25%, of them were  foreigners.   In

fact,  since 1994, roughly one in five motorists who were killed

on our roads were foreigners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 will introduce a new section 47F to empower the

Court  and  DCP to prohibit holders of foreign driving  licences

from driving on our roads if they accumulate a certain number of

demerit  points under DIPS to attract suspension by DCP,  or  if

they  are  convicted  or have committed  offences  in  the  Road

Traffic  Act that attract suspension or disqualification.    The

penalties  that  currently  apply to  a  motorist  convicted  of

driving   while  under  suspension  or  disqualification   shall

similarly  apply  to  holders of foreign  driving  licences  who

breach the prohibition order.   For example, the penalty  for  a

first-time  offender  who is convicted of  driving  while  under

suspension  is a fine of $5,000 or a jail term of one  year,  or

both.  Hence, a holder of a foreign driving licence who is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1912</b></font><br><br>

convicted  for  the  first time for driving on  Singapore  roads

despite  being  prohibited from doing so would  face  a  similar

penalty.

<br><br><i>Motorists who cause death or serious injury through dangerous or reckless driving,  etc.</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, motorists who cause death or serious injury

through  dangerous  or reckless driving, etc,  will  have  their

licence  suspended  once  they  have  been  charged  in   Court.

Currently,  under section 47C of the Road Traffic Act,  DCP  can

suspend the driving licence of a motorist once the motorist  has

been  charged  in  Court for the offences of  causing  death  or

serious  injury  while  driving under the influence  of  alcohol

exceeding  the  prescribed  limit, a  drug  or  an  intoxicating

substance,  or  without  insurance coverage.     The  suspension

prevents the motorist from driving and endangering the lives  of

other motorists and road-users, pending trial.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, DCP is not empowered to do so for all other

offences, no matter how serious they may be.  What this means is

that  until the Courts decide on the case, which may be up to  a

few months, the motorist can still drive if he wants to although

he  is  a  proven risk to other road users.   This situation  is

clearly unsatisfactory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House may still recall the tragic accident

that  occurred  at Bendemeer Road in May last  year,  which  the

Court  dealt  with recently.    In that accident, a  sports  car

ploughed  into  a  crowded bus stop at Bendemeer  Road,  killing

three  women and injuring six others, some permanently disabled.

The  Court  has  sentenced the accused to two  years'  jail  and

disqualified him from driving all classes of vehicles for  life.

But it took six months for the case to be concluded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill seeks to amend section 47C to empower

the Deputy Commissioner of Police to suspend the driving licence

of  a motorist once he has been charged in Court for any of  the

following offences:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1913</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Causing death to any person by dangerous or reckless driving

under section 66 of the Road Traffic Act;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Causing death to any person while committing a rash or

negligent act under section 304A of the Penal Code;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Causing serious injury to any person by dangerous or

reckless driving under section 64 of the Road Traffic Act; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Causing serious injury to any person while committing a rash

or  negligent act which endangers life under section 279 of  the

Penal Code.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal will give the Traffic Police more flexibility in

dealing  with motorists who threaten the safety and security  of

other road users.   However, I would like to assure Members that

the  Traffic  Police will exercise these powers judiciously  and

only in clear-cut cases, like the Bendemeer Road case.

<br><br><i>Handphone driving offenders</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, making handphone driving a specific offence.

Handphone   driving   offenders  are   currently   charged   for

inconsiderate driving under section 65 of the Road Traffic  Act.

First-time  offenders  are  usually offered  composition,  which

attracts  a  fine  of  $170 and 9 demerit points.     Subsequent

offenders are charged in Court and, if convicted, the Court  can

order the forfeiture of their handphones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handphone drivers are a menace to other road-users as they

are  less  likely to be able to control their vehicles properly.

With  handphones becoming very affordable today, the problem  of

handphone driving is likely to worsen unless we nip the  problem

in  the bud.  The problem is clearly manifested in the number of

summonses  issued  by the Traffic Police for handphone  driving,

which has surged from 400 in 1993 to 2,100 in 1997.   In January-November last year, 1,700 summonses were issued to motorists for

handphone driving.  Just imagine the number of handphone drivers

who have not been caught.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To signal the seriousness of the offence, clause 12 of the

Bill introduces a new

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1914</b></font><br><br>

section  65B  to  make  the act of using a  mobile  phone  while

driving  a specific offence in the Road Traffic Act.   The  Bill

defines "use" of handphone to mean holding it in one hand  while

using  it  to  communicate with any person.  The amendment  will

also  give  the Traffic Police greater flexibility to  vary  the

penalties  for the offence of handphone driving to  ensure  that

they are adequately deterrent.  The penalty for a first offender

upon  conviction in Court is a fine of up to $1,000  or  a  jail

term  of up to six months, or both.  For a repeat offender,  the

penalty  is a fine of up to $2,000 or a jail term of up  to  one

year,   or  both.   These  penalties  are  similar  to  existing

penalties for inconsiderate driving.

<br><br><i>Road bullies</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, road bullies. Empowering the Court to disqualify

drivers  who are road bullies.  Road bullies were a major  cause

of  public  concern in the late-eighties and early-nineties.  In

1991,  for  example,  35 motorists were  charged  in  Court  for

causing hurt to fellow motorists.  Fortunately, a combination of

tough Police enforcement and deterrent sentences handed down  by

the  Courts,  including  jail terms, have  helped  to  keep  the

problem  in  check.  But the problem still rears its  ugly  head

from  time  to time.  In June last year, for example, a  trailer

driver  was  attacked with a screwdriver by  a  road  bully  and

warded  in  the hospital for two days for injuries to his  head,

back  and neck because of a dispute over the right of way  along

the  East  Coast  Parkway.   The road bully  was  convicted  and

sentenced to eight months' jail by the Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Courts are currently empowered to disqualify driving

licences   of   motorists  for  driving-related  offences,   eg,

dangerous  driving,  but not for their conduct,  eg,  assaulting

another  driver or his passenger.  We are proposing  to  empower

the  Courts  to  disqualify drivers who are  road  bullies  from

holding driving licences if they are convicted of various  Penal

Code   offences,   including  voluntarily   causing   hurt   and

voluntarily  causing  grievous hurt to other  drivers  or  their

passengers, arising from disputes over

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1915</b></font><br><br>

the  use  of  a  road or public place, such as  road  accidents.

Clause 5 of the Bill seeks to amend section 42 to give effect to

this.   The period of the disqualification will be left  to  the

Court to decide.

<br><br><i>Proposals to reduce the number of motorists with outstanding warrants of arrest</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the amendments relating to the proposed

measure  against motorists with outstanding warrants of  arrest.

There  were  54,000 outstanding warrants of arrest  relating  to

traffic and parking offences as at 30th November last year.  300

motorists had 10 or more outstanding warrants of arrest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warrants of arrest are issued against persons who fail to

turn up in Court when ordered to do so by the Courts.  We should

take  a serious view of such people because they basically  have

no  regard  for  our  Courts.  On its part,  the  Police  mounts

regular operations to arrest motorists with outstanding warrants

of arrest, including paying house visits to their homes.  But it

is  not  always  able  to  arrest  them  because  the  motorists

concerned may have either shifted homes or do not reside at  the

addresses provided in the official records.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a motorist with an outstanding warrant of arrest

relating  to  an offence under the Road Traffic Act  or  Parking

Places Act is allowed to renew his driving licence as soon as he

has  executed  his  warrant  of arrest.   Execution  here  means

surrendering  himself  to  a  Police  station  or  the   Warrant

Enforcement Unit, and he is formally arrested.  But  during  the

period  when the motorist is released on bail pending the  Court

hearing,  some  jump bail and do not attend the scheduled  Court

hearing,  thus  necessitating the issue of a  fresh  warrant  of

arrest.  This is a blatant abuse of the Court process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To curb such abuse, a motorist with outstanding warrants of

arrest  will  not be allowed to renew his driving licence  until

the Court has conclusively dealt with the case.  Firstly, clause

3 of the Bill seeks to amend section 35(8) to empower the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1916</b></font><br><br>

Deputy  Commissioner of Police to refuse to  renew  the  driving

licence  of the motorist until after the offence has been  tried

and  determined  by  the Court.  Secondly,  clause  6  seeks  to

introduce a new section 42A in the Road Traffic Act to give  the

Court the discretion to disqualify a motorist possessing a valid

driving  licence from driving if he has failed to  attend  Court

after  being arrested under a warrant and released on bail.   In

the case of a foreign driving licence holder, the Court will, in

lieu  of  disqualification, issue a prohibition order under  the

new  section  47F  to  prohibit him from driving  on  our  roads

pending   the  determination  of  his  case.   The   period   of

disqualification  or  prohibition will be left  to  the  Court's

discretion.

<br><br><i>Other amendments</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now I come to other amendments. The Bill also

proposes  a  number of other minor amendments.  For example,  to

address the Singapore Civil Defence Force's operational need for

more  drivers, especially heavy-vehicle drivers, clause 9  seeks

to  amend section 49 of the Road Traffic Act to include SCDF, in

addition  to  the  SAF,  as a competent  driving  authority  for

certifying  and  issuing  restricted  driving  licences  to  its

personnel  to drive vehicles owned by SCDF.  Clause  10  of  the

Bill  seeks  to amend section 62 so that the minimum  qualifying

age  for driving licence holders of invalid carriages is  raised

to  18  years  old,  similar to that  of  the  existing  minimum

qualifying age for a motorcycle licence and a motorcar  licence.

To clarify the legal position for foreign motorists and visiting

forces,  clause  4  of  the Bill seeks to  repeal  and  re-enact

section  38 to consolidate the laws relating to foreign  driving

licences and driving licences of members of the visiting forces.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will send a strong signal to all motorists

that  we do not condone bad driving habits and take a stern view

towards  irresponsible behaviour that puts the safety  of  other

motorists and road-users at risk.  The Traffic Police will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1917</b></font><br><br>

continue  with its public education programmes and  messages  to

drive home the importance of road safety and safe driving.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments cover two specific types of behaviour on the

roads  - not just anti-social behaviour, but behaviour that  may

endanger both life and limb, namely, "road bullies" and  drivers

who  use  mobile  phones without proper  hands-free  kits.   The

legislation in this regard is to be particularly welcome.   Road

users   must   be   protected  from   the   irresponsible,   the

inconsiderate  and  the insensitive.  There are  several  points

that I would like to raise, not in objection to the legislation,

but to clarify the provisions and intention of the legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, road bullies - clause 5. This new provision is

complicated.  It refers to several provisions in the Penal  Code

regarding the causing of death, grievous hurt or hurt.  It  then

provides  that if a driver or a person in charge  of  a  vehicle

were to commit any of the offences referred to, in relation to a

dispute  on  the  road, he may be disqualified  from  holding  a

licence, if the judge is of the view that "it is undesirable for

the offender" to drive a vehicle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the reference to only certain Penal Code offences.

It  is  quite likely that in a dispute between road  users,  the

hurt  caused by one may be the result of provocation by another.

The  Penal Code provides for voluntary causing hurt and grievous

hurt  due  to  provocation in sections 334 and 335 respectively.

These  provisions  which  allow for  lighter  punishments  where

provocation exists are not mentioned in the new section 42(1A).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to ask the Minister whether these provisions

are  deliberately excluded from the amendments - so  that  those

convicted   under  these  sections  will  not  be   subject   to

disqualification of licence.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1918</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would support such exclusion. What I would not like to

see,  however, is a situation where the prosecutors  charge  the

drivers  under the sections mentioned in the amendment, but  not

sections 334 and 335, even though the facts suggest the presence

of  provocation.   This  may result in the  offender  getting  a

heavier  sentence  and disqualification even  though  there  was

provocation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I turn to the types of punishment. The technique

adopted  to  control  traffic  offenders  are  fines,  terms  of

imprisonment and/or disqualification.  That there must  be  such

types of punishment, there can be no doubt.  But I would like to

say that we should look into alternative means of rehabilitating

the  offenders.   This  may include the requirement  to  undergo

social  counselling, a course on road manners,  or  a  stint  in

community  service.   The  intention is  to  make  drivers  more

socially  conscious.   I  believe that many  Members  have  come

across in their Meet-the-People sessions, drivers who have been,

or  are  facing, disqualification.  More often than  not,  these

drivers  are  the  sole breadwinners in fairly  large  families.

Disqualification, even for a short period, directly affects  the

welfare  of  the  family  in general.   Disqualification  should

therefore be used after all other means of educating the  errant

driver have failed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangerous driving: I turn next to clause 11 purporting to

amend  section  64  of the Act to allow for the  arrest  without

warrant  of drivers charged for "reckless or dangerous driving".

My  first  question is: why is there a need for  such  a  power?

Have there been occasions where the offender on the road has  to

be  immediately apprehended?  How will officers be advised to be

cautious  about  the  use  of this power  to  arrest  without  a

warrant?   Perhaps,  the  Minister can let  us  know  how  these

matters will be dealt with by the Police.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, I believe it is unfortunate that the

opportunity  has  not  been  taken  to  review  the  offence  of

"reckless  or  dangerous driving".  The  language  defining  the

offence  is  couched  widely  and very  much  dependent  on  the

officer's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1919</b></font><br><br>

perception of what constitutes driving that is "dangerous to the

public".   This  is always an unsatisfactory situation,  because

views  may differ from officer to officer, and drivers may  feel

genuine  grievance  in  being  charged  with  such  an  offence.

Indeed,  if the Bill is passed today, the driver can be arrested

on  the  spot without a warrant.  I would like to appeal to  the

Minister  to  consider  redefining  this  offence  at  the  next

available opportunity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobile phones: Clause 12 enacts a new section 65B that

makes it a specific offence to use a mobile phone while driving.

This is especially welcome.  Cases have been reported where  the

use   of   handphones  had  distracted  drivers,  resulting   in

accidents, sometimes serious; sometimes fatal.  However, I  have

a  few  queries relating to the new provision that  I  hope  the

Minister will address.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, car phones. Before the advent of the handphone or

mobile  phone,  some cars may have car phones installed.   These

phones  are  similar to desktop phones, that is, the driver  may

still  need  to  hold the handset to speak.  He  then  is  still

"using"  the  phone,  as defined in the amendments.   Are  these

types  of  car phones still in use, and, if so, are they  exempt

from  the legislation?  The new definition of "mobile telephone"

is certainly wide enough to cover this - is this intended?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the offence, as defined, is a "moving offence",

that is, no offence would be committed if the driver were to use

his  mobile phone at any time while the car is stationary,  such

as  waiting at the junction for the lights to change.   Can  the

Minister  confirm  that  that  is  also  the  intention  of  the

legislation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, are persons convicted of using mobile phones under

this provision subject to disqualification of licence?  It would

be  good  if  such  an  option were present to  deter  offenders

repeating the offence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, given the potential dangers of using handphones

and being distracted by them in high-density populated areas

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1920</b></font><br><br>

or  fast  expressways, and given the ubiquitous  nature  of  the

handphone  these days, is it not time to require car sellers  to

ensure that any car they supply should be provided with a mobile

phone car kit?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendments to the Road Traffic Act are

important  measures  to  improve the safety  of  our  roads.   I

support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

to  speak in support of the amendments to the Road Traffic  Act.

I  would  like, however, to express my views over  some  of  the

proposed  amendments  and to indicate my concerns  over  certain

areas of the new proposals.

<br><br><i>Amendment to section 35(8)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that this amendment is good. The amendment

appears  to provide that the Deputy Commissioner may  refuse  to

renew  the  driving licence of a holder if the holder  has  been

arrested  under a warrant but before trial.  Unlike the existing

section  35(8),  the police need not execute the  warrant.   The

amended section 35(8) requires the warrant to be executed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment to section 38. The old section 38 is limited to

Malaysian  driving licences.  The amendment seems to  widen  its

scope of application to any foreign driving licence or permit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 38(1) provides that a foreigner who holds a

valid  foreign licence is permitted to drive in Singapore during

a  period  of  12 months from the date of his last entry.   Sir,

isn't  his  entry  into Singapore for any period  sufficient  to

permit  him  to  drive  in  Singapore?   What  happens  if   the

foreigner's  foreign driving licence has a  validity  period  of

less  than  12  months?  Why must the section specify  that  the

foreigner  be  temporarily  in Singapore?   How  do  you  define

"temporarily"?  What happens if the stay of the foreigner is for

a period, such as 10 years?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 38(2) uses the words "driving permit"

instead  of  "driving licence" as in section 38(1).  It  appears

that  no  valid foreign driving licence is required as  long  as

there is a permit.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1921</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Amendment to section 42</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the conviction under the aforesaid sections in

the  Penal Code is not sufficient.  One needs to prove that  the

commission of these offences has got to do with the use  of  the

road or public place and the behaviour of the offender. I am  of

the  view  that  this is a bit harsh, as this  appears  to  have

punished  the  offender "twice", that is to say, the  punishment

under  the Penal Code as well as disqualification.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  this is against natural justice.  Why should the  offender

be  deprived  of holding a driving licence?  By analogy,  is  it

reasonable  to  prohibit any parent who commits  an  offence  of

persecution of children from having children?

<br><br><i>Insertion of new section 42A</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the existing section 42 empowers the court (and

not  the Public Prosecutor) to give an order of disqualification

upon  conviction of the offender.  The new section 42A  proposes

to give power to the Public Prosecutor to apply to the court for

such  an  order  for disqualification when (a) the  offender  is

accused (not convicted) of an offence and fails to appear before

the  court  to  answer the charge; (b) the court  has  issued  a

warrant  of  arrest; and (c) the offender has been arrested  and

released  on  bail.  A further requirement is that  the  officer

must  inform  the offender that such application would  be  made

against him if he stubbornly fails to appear before the court to

answer the charge on the next date fixed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that this new section 42A is also harsh

especially  in  a  case when the offence committed  is  a  minor

offence.   When an offender is accused of any offence,  it  does

not  follow that he will certainly be convicted.  As long as the

offender is not convicted, he is presumed to be innocent.   Sir,

section  42A  gives  me the impression that the  prosecution  is

attempting  to  make use of such discretionary  power  (if  this

section is passed and becomes law) to apply for disqualification

to  frighten, if not threaten, all offenders for the purpose  of

ensuring  their  appearance  before  the  court.   The   present

practice is such that if the offender fails to appear before the

court, a warrant of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1922</b></font><br><br>

arrest  will be issued.  If he is arrested, he will be  released

on  bail.   If he fails to appear again (ie, if he jumps  bail),

the  bailer will have to show cause.  If he does appear, he will

be  fined  for his early failure to appear.  I must  agree  that

such  practice is not satisfactory to ensure appearance  by  the

offender  but  it is more appropriate and fair to  the  offender

before his conviction.

<br><br><i>Amendment to section 47C</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with this amendment as the offence is of a serious

nature and would endanger other road users.

<br><br><i>New section 65B</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the punishment provided in this new section 65B

is  identical  to  section  65  (driving  without  due  care  or

reasonable  consideration).  It is therefore crystal  clear,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  that this new section 65B is  inserted  for  the

purpose of covering the use of mobile telephone.  I believe  the

Minister  for  Law had previously indicated that  there  was  no

necessity  to have a specific provision to cover use  of  mobile

telephone,  as  section  65  is  sufficient  to  cover  such   a

situation.    The   proposed  insertion  would   now   therefore

contradict what the Minister had argued before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am of the view that section 65B is not necessary and

I  agree  that section 65 does cover wider situations than  just

use  of mobile phone.  My experience as a driver is that  it  is

very  dangerous,  while driving, to look at the  pager  when  it

sounds, to use a walkie-talkie, to meddle with the audio  system

or  to  watch  television  (which some  motor  car  owners  have

installed).   Section  65 covers all such situations.   However,

the  new section 65B is of limited application and the insertion

of which is to lengthen the Act unnecessarily.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this new section 65B is to be inserted, then one must

ask  whether this section covers the use of walkie-talkies.   If

the  answer is in the negative (which seems to be unclear as the

definition of mobile telephone includes any hand held equipment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1923</b></font><br><br>

that  is designed and capable for tele-communication) or  it  is

covered by section 65, then why should one insert section 65B?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the definition of "use" is also ambiguous. When one

uses the mobile phone while driving, whether one is holding  the

phone  with  one hand (sounds like holding with one hand  is  an

offence while holding with two hands is not!) or using a  hands-free car kit, it is equally dangerous as one's mind would be pre-occupied  in conversation.  Furthermore, a driver may  sometimes

hold  and  dial the mobile phone before it is connected  and  in

such a case, would he be caught for using the mobile phone?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, this new section 65B is not necessary and

the definitions are ambiguous and not satisfactorily drafted.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

speak  in support of the Bill and appreciate the opportunity  to

express my comments and thoughts on three issues which I feel we

should take the opportunity which this Bill presents to address.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in considering the proposed amendments to the Road

Traffic  Act, I think we should bear in mind the most  important

objective  of  such regulations, which is the  deterrent  effect

they  have  to prevent the offences they create.  Not only  must

the  laws  be clear as to what is prohibited on our  roads,  the

penalties which they impose must reflect the seriousness of  the

particular  offences in question and be sufficiently  severe  to

deter  people  from committing the offences in the first  place.

After all, what is at stake here are the lives of all the people

who  use  our roads daily, whether as motorists, pedestrians  or

passengers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first point relates to clause 7 of the Bill where it is

proposed that section 47C of the principal Act be amended to add

to  the  circumstances  under which the Deputy  Commissioner  of

Police  may immediately suspend the driving licence of a  person

who has caused death or serious injury to another person while

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1924</b></font><br><br>

driving.   I  would  like  to  ask the  Minister  whether  other

offences   which   provide   mandatory   disqualification   upon

conviction  by the court should also be covered.  Such  offences

include  reckless or dangerous driving and illegal racing  under

sections 64 and 116, respectively of the Road Traffic Act, theft

of  a motor vehicle or component parts under section 379A of the

Penal  Code, and driving and being in charge of a motor  vehicle

whilst  under the influence of drink or drug under  sections  67

and 68 respectively of the Road Traffic Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, please allow me to elaborate on the drink-related

offences I last mentioned.  The problem of drink driving  is  of

concern  in  Singapore  because of the growing  number  of  such

cases,  especially  during the festive periods,  which  led  the

authorities to launch the Anti-Drink Drive campaign in  December

last  year.   The Straits Times on 12th December  1998  reported

that  in  the  first 10 months of last year, 493 motorists  were

convicted  of  drink driving and all of them  were  disqualified

from  driving by the court.  It was also reported that  on  17th

December  1998, 23 persons were charged and convicted  in  court

for  drink  driving offences and all were given sentences  which

included jail terms and driving bans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the years, the law relating to drink driving has been

progressively enhanced and penalties for drink related  offences

made  heavier  and heavier by previous amendments  to  the  Road

Traffic  Act.  I agree with this approach.  The public has  been

continually  warned  of  the effects and consequences  of  drink

driving.  But the increased incidence of drink driving indicates

that  the  problem is rooted more in the irresponsible attitudes

of  people rather than in ignorance.  Since drunkenness is self-induced,  drink  driving is therefore totally preventable.   Our

laws should therefore have a strong deterrent effect on would-be

offenders  who risk their own lives and the lives of  others  by

drinking and driving.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as it now stands, the Road Traffic Act provides that

any person who, when driving or attempting to drive a motor

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1925</b></font><br><br>

vehicle on a road or other public place, has so much alcohol  in

his  body  that the proportion of it exceeds 35 microgrammes  in

100  mls  of  breath or 80 minigrammes in 100 mls  of  blood  is

guilty of an offence regardless of whether he is in fact fit  to

drive  or  capable of having proper control of his vehicle.   On

conviction, unless the court, for special reasons, thinks fit to

order otherwise, the offender shall be disqualified from holding

or  obtaining a driving licence for a period of not less than 12

months.  What this means to the layman is that once he is caught

with  alcohol in his body exceeding the prescribed limit, it  is

almost  without  doubt and without exception  that  he  will  be

disqualified by the court.  However, only when death or  serious

injury  results may his driving licence be immediately suspended

from  the time he is charged with the offence until the  offence

is  tried  and determined in court.  When no death or injury  is

caused,  there is no provision for immediate suspension  of  the

accused's driving licence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask the Minister whether he would

consider imposing immediate suspension in drink driving cases by

including  this  as an additional category of  offences  in  the

proposed  section 47C(1A) of the Road Traffic Act.   To  me,  if

drink  driving is so serious and so undesirable, the ingredients

and  test  for the offence strictly and objectively applied  and

the  sentence of mandatory disqualification is certain, then why

wait until the offender is charged in court and convicted before

taking  him  off the roads?  This would help to drive  home  the

seriousness  of  this offence, making it clear to  every  driver

that  every time he drives while under the influence of alcohol,

he  is  endangering his own life and the lives of others and  it

should  not  make a difference whether any injury or  death  has

been caused by his irresponsible behaviour.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>7.12 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue I would like to raise relates to the

proposed section 65B as set out in clause 12 of the Bill.   This

new

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1926</b></font><br><br>

section  deals  with  the  use of mobile  telephones  and  other

telecommunications equipment by motorists while on the road.  In

recent  years, the mobile telephone has become quite  ubiquitous

in  Singapore.   For many people on the move, it has  become  an

indispensable  tool  in their busy schedules.   As  the  use  of

mobile telephones becomes more and more common and widespread, I

support the urgent need to have express laws on their use  while

driving  on  the road.  It is also important that the  laws  are

clear  and leave no room for doubt or argument as to what manner

of  use  is prohibited as many people will be affected by  these

laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the proposed section 65B, I am afraid it is less

than  clear as to the meaning of the word "use" in its  context.

The  word  "use"  has  been defined to mean  "holding  a  mobile

telephone  in  one hand while using it to communicate  with  any

person".  This definition appears to be too restrictive  as  the

ordinary  meaning  of the word "communicate" in  English  is  to

speak  to another person.  Does this cover situations where  the

motorist  is  in the process of punching in the numbers  on  the

keypad, or when he is holding the phone to his ear while waiting

for  his  call to be answered by the other side, or when  he  is

doing  some  mobile banking, or accessing his SingTel voicemail?

But  clearly, all these situations are just as dangerous as  the

driver  has  to steer with one hand, hold his telephone  in  the

other and take his eyes and concentration away from the road  in

doing so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I would like to make is that offenders may have

all  sorts  of  excuses to show that they were not communicating

with anyone at that point in time when they were stopped by  the

policeman.   Further, it may be difficult for the prosecutor  to

prove  that  the mobile telephone was actually  in  use  at  the

material time.  Can the records of the mobile telephone operator

be  produced  in court as evidence?  But what if the  operator's

records  show that the phone was not in use at the alleged  time

of  the  offence  as recorded by the traffic policeman's  watch?

Perhaps,  this  section should be worded to allow our  policemen

some judgment in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1927</b></font><br><br>

apprehending motorists who appear to be or are in the process of

using the mobile phone while the vehicle is in motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lastly I would like to express my sadness when what

should have been ordinary road courtesy and manners find its way

into  our  legislation.  I refer to road rage or road bully  and

clause  5  of  this Bill which seeks to enhance the penalty  and

empower  the  Court  to  disqualify a  person  if  he  has  been

convicted of any specified offence which arises from or which is

connected with a dispute between him and another person over the

use  of  the road or public place.  So, a dispute over a parking

lot could result in the aggressor being banned from driving.   I

feel one thing that has to be emphasised most strongly, even  as

Singapore  aspires  towards having a world-class  transportation

system, is the importance of inculcating good road habits in all

road  users  here.   Besides  having  the  appropriate  laws  to

regulate  the  use  of  our roads, we  should  also  stress  the

importance of being courteous and considerate to our fellow road

users.   There  is  no  point  having  the  most  efficient  and

impressive  transportation system if it is  not  also  safe  and

pleasant to use.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

too rise to support the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Ong Kian Min said earlier, the primary purpose of any

legislation  is to serve as a deterrent to prevent the  offences

from  being  repeated.  The Minister had said earlier  that  the

passage of this Bill will send a clear and loud message  to  all

those  would be offenders of our roads.  And I believe  in  many

aspects,  he  is right, except in one particular  area  where  I

thought  he  would have taken this opportunity  to  enhance  the

penalty  for such offences, and that is in the area  of  causing

death   through  reckless  and  dangerous  driving.    He   also

highlighted  the case where a motorist ploughed through  a  bus-stop,  killing three persons and seriously injuring  others  and

the   penalty  for  that  particular  offence  was  two   years'

imprisonment and suspension

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1928</b></font><br><br>

of driving licence for life.  I have given it some thought and I

have  also  discussed  it  with my grassroots  leaders  and  the

consensus  is that the penalty in this particular  case  is  not

severe  enough.  This case is over, and I think it is all  right

for me to bring it up in Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, where other minor offences attract heavier

penalty,  I  believe that the current penalty in this particular

category  is  insufficient.  For instance, if  the  penalty  for

outraging of modesty or rape would attract long imprisonment and

severe punishment through caning, I wonder why a case of causing

death   through  dangerous  driving  attracts  only  two  years'

imprisonment  and  suspension of driving licence  for  life.   I

believe  that we should enhance the penalty in these  areas  and

probably  I  would even advocate the introduction of caning  for

such  offences.   This might not be the right occasion  for  the

Minister  to address these problems but I hope he will give  his

due  consideration and bring up such issues in future amendments

to the Act.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I thank the Members for speaking in

support of the Bill.  Let me try to deal with the points  raised

by each of the Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof Chin asked why did we deliberately exclude sections

334 and 335 of the Penal Code from the amendments.  Yes, we have

indeed  deliberately excluded sections 334 and 335 of the  Penal

Code  as these relate to offences committed on provocation.   In

the  situation where a motorist reacts to provocation, depending

on  the circumstances of the case, he may not necessarily  be  a

road  bully.  Nevertheless, he would be punished under the Penal

Code  for  his actions.  As the amendment is meant to deal  with

road  bullies, the Bill therefore has made a distinction between

the cases which involve provocation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of other kinds of help and rehabilitation

of offenders and suggestions of social counselling and so on,  I

think  all  Members agree that motorists who flout  our  traffic

laws should be penalised so that they realise the seriousness of

the offences which they commit.  However, for some of the less

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1929</b></font><br><br>

serious  traffic offences, I agree that there may  be  scope  to

consider  other  forms  of  censure or  punishment  which  could

complement the existing forms of penalties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, we know that offenders who are liable for

suspension  for  their first or second time  are  already  being

given the chance to attend the one-day retraining course.   This

course consists of defensive driving skills, inculcation of good

driving habits and so on.  A remission of the suspension  period

will be granted if the motorist passes the course.  I will study

whether  it is appropriate to adopt other measures suggested  by

Prof   Chin,   for  example,  community  service  or  compulsory

counselling for certain groups of traffic offenders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On dangerous driving and why we arrest people without a

warrant,  dangerous and reckless driving is a  serious  offence.

It  carries  24 demerit points on conviction.  It  is  therefore

imperative that the Police has the powers to immediately  detain

the offender, investigate the case and then produce the offender

in Court as soon as possible.  But if we were to take the normal

course  of  events like now, it will take up to a few  weeks  to

have  the offender produced in Court by way of Notice to  Attend

Court.   So  this  proposed amendment is meant  to  empower  the

Traffic  Police  to  deal with such drivers in  a  decisive  and

expeditious  manner  so that they cannot  further  endanger  the

lives  of  other road users.  The Police will use  these  powers

judiciously.   They have administered section  64  of  the  Road

Traffic  Act  for many years and they know from  experience  the

circumstances under which an offence is classified as  dangerous

driving  or reckless driving, rash driving or negligent driving.

They  will use their years of experience to classify these cases

and deal with the case accordingly before the person is arrested

for dangerous driving.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of car phones and whether car phones which

were already installed in the cars in the past are still in use,

yes,  they  are  still in use.  Drivers who use the  car  phones

without the hands-free kits while driving would be committing an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1930</b></font><br><br>

offence.  The proposed amendment is meant to cover all kinds  of

hand-held communication equipment.  So walkie-talkie would  also

be  counted  as a communication device.  The driver is  said  to

have committed an offence if he holds it in one hand and uses it

to  communicate with another person.  If people would do what Dr

Lily Neo thinks that holding it with two hands, and they are not

committing an offence, I would suggest that they try it and they

will  see  whether they will be committing an  offence  or  not.

They  will  be  committing an offence, maybe not  for  handphone

driving  but for dangerous driving which will carry a much  more

serious punishment.  So do not try it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to the question of whether it is an offence when a

person uses the phone when the vehicle is stationary or when  he

stops  at  a traffic junction, and when he moves off,  he  stops

communicating.   There  is no offence if  the  driver  uses  his

mobile  phone  without the hands-free kit while the  vehicle  is

stationary,  including while waiting at  the  junction  for  the

lights  to  change, as long as the driver stops using the  phone

immediately  when he moves his vehicle.  The proposed  amendment

makes   it  an  offence  to  hold  on  to  a  communication   or

telecommunication  device and communicate  with  another  person

only  when the vehicle is in motion.  So when the motorist calls

on the mobile phone and listens to a voice-mail, he is "talking"

to that person, and he will be committing an offence.  Again, do

not  think  that he can get away by just talking to a voice-mail

and  that  he is not talking to another person.  It  must  be  a

person who left the voice-mail.  The motorist should concentrate

on  driving and controlling his vehicle and looking at the  road

and traffic situation when the vehicle is moving.  Therefore,  I

would advise motorists in general not to use the phone unless it

is  absolutely necessary and if they have to use it,  do  use  a

hands-free kit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof Chin also asked whether persons who are convicted of

using   mobile  phones  under  the  provision  are  subject   to

disqualification  of the licence.  Persons convicted  under  the

new provision would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1931</b></font><br><br>

not be liable to mandatory disqualification.  However, the Court

has  a  discretionary power under section 42 of the Road Traffic

Act  to disqualify any offender of any traffic offence which  it

considers serious enough.  If the Court thinks that it  is  very

serious, the Court may order a disqualification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof Chin also asked whether in densely populated areas and

expressways  and  so on, we should not require  car  sellers  to

ensure  that  their cars which they sell should have  hands-free

mobile  phones.   I think we will leave it to  the  car  sellers

because not all motorists want to have a car phone.  So fixing a

car  phone and charging motorists may not be a fair thing to do.

We  will leave it to the market to decide.  Although the use  of

hands-free  kits  for  driving is not an  offence,  the  Traffic

Police would want to encourage people to refrain from using  the

hands-free kits as far as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to Dr Lily Neo's comments. She said that

the  old section 38 is confined only to Malaysians.  Yes, indeed

it  is.    Singapore  is  a  signatory  to  the  United  Nations

Conference  on  Road  and  Motor Transport  Convention  on  Road

Traffic,  1949, and as an contracting state to this  Convention,

we have to recognise the driving permits or licences.  They mean

the  same thing; some countries call it a permit, some countries

call  it  a  licence, so there is no confusion here.   They  are

issued  by  contracting parties for a period of up to  one  year

without requiring the motorist to sit for any driving test.  The

Road  Traffic  Act  did not formally recognise  the  obligations

under  the  Convention  in  the past.   But  this  amendment  is

necessary now to formally state Singapore's recognition  of  the

foreign  driving  licences  or driving  permits  issued  by  the

signatory states.  As the recognition of driving licence is  for

a  period of only one year, a foreigner staying in Singapore for

more  than  one  year is required to obtain a Singapore  driving

licence.  However, if the driving licence is valid for a  period

of  less  than one year, then the driving licence would only  be

recognised for the period of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1932</b></font><br><br>

validity of the foreign driving licence.  Foreigners who wish to

remain here and drive for more than a year should convert  to  a

Singapore driving licence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of section 42 on road bullies, this section

is  targeted  at  motorists  who  show  violent  behaviour  when

reacting  to  situations connected to driving.  As a  result  of

situations  such  as  flashing of  head  lamps,  overtaking  and

disputes over parking spaces, motorists have been known to cause

serious injury to other persons.  Innocent road users should not

be  subjected  to the potential danger posed by such  motorists.

Hence, those who exhibit such violent behaviour when reacting to

situations arising from the use of the road and choose  to  take

the  law into their own hands should be penalised for the errant

act.   There is no question of double penalty.  It is just  part

of  the  penalty imposed by the Court.  For example, in many  of

our offences, we say that the Court can impose a fine, a jail or

both.  By fining the person and jailing him at the same time, we

are not saying that the Court is punishing him twice.  It is the

same   punishment.    Now  we  just  add  another   one   called

"disqualification".  If one commits certain offences of the Road

Traffic  Act,  one can also be subject to disqualification.   So

there is no double punishment as such.  The analogy of Dr Neo is

that a mother or parent convicted of abusing the - I believe  it

is not persecuting but abusing the child - means that the parent

cannot have children.  I think that is not the correct analogy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On whether it is too harsh under section 42A to disqualify

a  person for failure to turn up in Court, I think we have tried

very hard to get these people with warrants of arrest to turn up

in  Court.  I think the patience of the Warrant Enforcement Unit

and  the  Police as well as the Court is wearing  thin.   People

just  ignore  warrants of arrest.  There are  more  than  55,000

warrants of arrest outstanding and there are hundreds of  people

with  10 or more warrants of arrest in their names.  So, we have

to  take a very serious view of people who totally disregard the

law of Singapore and show contempt of the Court when ordered  by

the Court to turn up and they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1933</b></font><br><br>

did  not  turn  up.  We will have to deal with such  people  who

simply refuse to turn up in Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an offender executes a warrant of arrest, that is,

when  he surrenders to the Traffic Police or goes to the Warrant

Enforcement Unit, the Police would inform him that if  he  fails

to  turn  up  in  Court at the hearing date, then  an  order  of

disqualification may be preferred against him.  In other  words,

a  warning  will be given to that motorist to turn up  in  Court

because  failure to turn up in Court means that  an  application

will  be  made to the Court to disqualify the driver.   I  think

that  is fair.  If not, people would just take for granted  that

any  notice to attend court can simply be ignored.  I think that

is  not a good healthy thing to encourage in Singapore.  This is

not  meant  to  be punitive but to be preventive so  that  these

people  do  not  waste the court's time, the police's  time  and

everybody else's time in trying to chase after them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also asked that since section 65 already can

take  care of handphone driving, why do we need section  65B  to

make  it a specific offence.  We want to have a specific offence

for  handphone driving so as to provide more flexibility to  the

Traffic Police in dealing with handphone driving.  If we do  not

do  that, they will find that of all the offences under  section

65,  only one of them, for example, handphone driving,  is  very

serious,  and  if  they want to enhance the punishment  for  the

offence by increasing the demerit points and imposing the  fine,

they will have to increase it for all the offences under section

65.    We  think  we  do  not have to take  such  a  blunderbuss

approach.   It  is better that we create a distinct  offence  so

that  the  police  will  have greater flexibility  to  vary  the

composition  fine and the demerit points and to take  any  other

action  or  measure against the offender without  affecting  the

other  motorists  who  commit offences under  the  more  general

provision of section 65 of the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have talked earlier about a handphone driver trying to

drive  with  both  hands holding his handphone and  leaving  the

steering wheel free.  If he does so, he

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1934</b></font><br><br>

will  be  committing a more serious offence, and that is  called

dangerous driving.  Dangerous driving is punishable with a  fine

not  exceeding $3,000 or imprisonment up to 12 months, or  both,

for  a first offence.  For a second and subsequent offence,  the

person would be liable to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or  to  an

imprisonment term not exceeding two years, or both.  So this  is

more  serious than just a handphone driving offence.  So do  not

attempt to drive with both hands on the handphone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to Mr Ong Kian Min's questions. His main point

is  really  to impose an immediate suspension on those  who  are

found  or  suspected to have alcohol beyond  the  limit  in  his

blood.   I  would  ask  the police to look  into  this  and,  if

necessary,  we may do as he suggests.   But I think we  have  to

take the measures one step at a time and we will see whether  it

is  necessary to impose such a disqualification or not the  next

time when I look at the Road Traffic Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of definition of mobile phone driving and

whether  it is adequate or not, if there is a need to  re-define

it  after  we have put the new law into force, we will re-define

it.  The way it is defined now, I think, is adequate.  If it  is

not, I will consider amending the definition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen talked about enhancing the punishment for

motorists  who cause death while driving a vehicle.  In  1996  I

amended  the  Act  to provide for enhanced punishment  for  this

offence.   So far, the situation is good.  Of course, from  time

to  time, we have very serious cases and we all get very  worked

up  over  such irresponsible driving behaviour, but we  have  to

take  such incidents, not just a particular one, in perspective.

If  we  were  to  enhance  the punishment  for  accidents  which

resulted in death, we would have to re-look at the rest  of  the

offences and see whether it is in proportion or in keeping  with

the  sentences of the other offences.  But we will bear that  in

mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b>

Mr  Deputy  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be  now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meat and fish are highly perishable products.

Unsatisfactory  handling or processing can cause rapid  spoilage

and serious food poisoning.  Currently, there are two Acts which

regulate  the  meat  and fish industries to  ensure  that  their

products are safe for human consumption.  These Acts, which were

enacted in the 1960s, are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Slaughter-houses and Meat Processing Factories Act; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Fisheries Act.

The provisions of these Acts are no longer adequate and need  to

be updated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than amend the relevant sections of the two Acts, it

is  now  more logical to promulgate a new Act to regulate solely

the  processing  and  sales of meat and  fish  meant  for  human

consumption.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1936</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, a comprehensive new Wholesome Meat

and Fish Bill has therefore been drawn up.  The main features of

the Bill comprise four areas:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Regulating the import, export and transhipment of meat and

fish products;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Licensing of slaughter-houses, processing establishments and

cold stores;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Regulating the sale of meat and fish products; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Improving PPD's operational effectiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now go through and explain the rationale of the main

features of the Bill.

<br><br><i>Regulating the trade in meat and fish products</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Fisheries Act adopts a two-tiered control

system  of  licences and permits for traders wishing to  import,

export or tranship fish products.  However, meat traders are not

licensed.  Provisions have therefore been included in  the  Bill

to harmonise the requirements for the fish and meat trade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clauses 5 and 6 respectively, trading licences and

permits  for individual consignments will now be required.   All

meat and fish traders will have to be licensed.  The requirement

for  permits  for  individual consignments  will  give  PPD  the

flexibility  to impose and enforce sanitary conditions  on  each

consignment so as to prevent the introduction of animal diseases

of public health significance such as anthrax or mad-cow disease

into Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions have also been included to enhance the

transparency   of  licensing  procedures.   This   also   allows

Singapore  to fulfil its WTO obligations.  Clause 8 enables  the

Director of Primary Production to deny anyone an import licence,

or  to  impose  restrictions on the trade  if  he  considers  it

necessary to safeguard public health. It, however, also requires

the Director to provide the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1937</b></font><br><br>

applicant with written reasons if he refuses to issue  or  renew

the  licence  or  permit applied for under the  Act.   Clause  9

allows  any  person aggrieved by the decision  of  the  Director

regarding  the  grant, renewal, suspension or  revocation  of  a

licence or permit, to appeal to the Minister.

<br><br><i>Licensing of slaughter-houses, processing establishments and cold stores</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 11 and 12 require the slaughter-houses, meat and

fish  processing establishments and cold stores to be  licensed.

These  provisions are largely based on the Slaughter-houses  and

Meat  Processing  Factories  Act and  the  regulations  on  fish

processing  establishments  under  the  Fisheries  Act.    These

establishments  will be required to meet standards  set  by  the

Director  to  ensure  that  slaughter,  processing  and  storage

conditions  maintain  the wholesomeness  of  the  meat  or  fish

products.    The   Director  may  also  close   any   of   these

establishments if their condition poses a danger to health.

<br><br><i>Sale of meat and fish products</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 strengthens the regulation of the handling of

meat  and  fish  in wholesale markets.  The wholesale  trade  of

animals  meant for food is also regulated to prevent the  spread

of  diseases  among the animals, and to control the handling  of

the  animals which can have an impact on the safety and  quality

of the meat subsequently derived from these animals.

<br><br><i>Improving PPD's operational effectiveness</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To allow PPD to overcome resource constraints and focus its

limited  manpower on the critical areas, clause 3  provides  PPD

the  flexibility  to outsource less critical operations  to  the

private  sector,  such as the inspection of animals  before  and

after  slaughter  at  licensed  slaughter-houses.   However,  to

ensure  that  a high standard of food safety is maintained,  PPD

will   specify  the  qualifications,  training  and   experience

required for authorised examiners.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1938</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Enhancement of investigation and enforcement powers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 24 to 27 strengthen the powers of investigation and

enforcement.   Clause  25  allows the  Director  to  detain  the

confiscated items in the premises in which they were found.   It

also  requires the owner or occupier of the premises to  provide

reasonable  assistance  to  the Director  or  veterinary  public

health  officer in the investigation.  These powers are required

as the meat or fish products under investigation may be in large

quantities  and  due  to their perishable nature,  can  only  be

practically detained in the place where they were found such  as

refrigerated containers or cold stores.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing legislation, only the court can order

forfeiture  of  items  seized under the  Acts.   As  this  often

results  in  prolonged  detention of  the  items  and  incurring

expensive  storage  charges, clause  32(9)  has  therefore  been

included  to allow the owner of the seized items to  consent  to

their  disposal.  Such items are deemed to be forfeited and  may

be  disposed  of  as the Director thinks fit.   This  provision,

however,   does  not  prevent  legal  proceedings   from   being

instituted against the owner of the items.

<br><br><i>Enhancement of financial and custodial penalties</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penalties of $500 to $2,000 fine and one-year imprisonment

provided  in the Slaughter-houses and Meat Processing  Factories

Act are grossly inadequate in today's context.  Penalties should

be  commensurate  with the value of the goods involved  and  the

seriousness and impact of the offence.  The penalties under this

Bill therefore range from $1,000 to $100,000 for fines and 1  to

3  years for jail terms.  These high penalties have been set  to

reflect the amount and value of the imported products, which may

be  in  the order of hundreds of thousands of dollars.  If  such

quantity   of   goods  were  contaminated  and  distributed   to

consumers,  the  impact on public health would be  far-reaching.

These high penalties are therefore necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also provision for offences to be compounded. The

maximum sum for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1939</b></font><br><br>

the  composition  of  offences  is  $1,000.   This  would  allow

relatively  minor  offences under the  Bill  to  be  dealt  with

expeditiously   without  the  need  for   instituting   criminal

proceedings against the offender.

<br><br><i>"Presumption" clauses</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing legislation, a person found with

illegally  imported or processed meat or fish products  can  get

off  free from prosecution if he denies carrying out the  import

or  processing.  On average, PPD encounters about 2  to  3  such

cases per year.  This is not satisfactory as the consequences of

distribution and consumption of large quantities of  unwholesome

meat  or fish can be devastating to the public.  To protect  the

consumers,  clauses 6(5), 17(3), 20(3) and 23(3) have  therefore

been  included to allow the person charged to show that  he  had

taken  reasonable precautions to prevent the commission  of  the

offence,  and  that the offending act was done by  someone  else

beyond his control.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the enactment of the new Act, the Slaughter-houses and

Meat  Processing  Factories  Act  and  relevant  parts  of   the

Fisheries Act will concurrently be repealed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the Wholesome Meat and Fish Bill will

consolidate, update and strengthen existing regulations  on  the

import,  export  and  transhipment of meat  and  fish  products;

slaughter  of animals; processing of meat and fish products  and

wholesale of fish.  In addition, it will introduce regulation of

wholesale  of  meat and animals intended for  food.   Powers  of

investigation  and  enforcement have also been  strengthened  to

ensure that the provisions of the Bill are complied with,  while

the   high  penalties  would  act  as  a  deterrent  to   anyone

contemplating committing an offence under the Bill.   This  will

ensure  that meat and fish products continue to be safe for  all

Singaporeans to eat.

<div align="center"><b>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION AUTHORITY BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b>

Mr  Deputy  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be  now

read a Second time."

<br><br><i>Objective</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Construction Industry Development Board and the Building

Control  Division of the Public Works Department will be  merged

to  form  a new statutory board on 1st April 1999.  The proposed

Building  and Construction Authority Bill 1999 will provide  the

required  legislative  framework for the formation  of  the  new

statutory board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new statutory board will be called the Building and

Construction Authority, BCA.  Its mission will be to  facilitate

the  development of a professional and technologically  advanced

construction industry that is capable of delivering  world-class

buildings and infrastructure at competitive prices.

<br><br><i>Rationale</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me now share with this House the

rationale   behind  the  Government's  decision  to  merge   the

Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) and the  Building

Control Division (BCD) to form a new statutory board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CIDB was formed in 1984 to promote the development of

technology  and manpower in the construction industry.   It  has

achieved  much  over the last fifteen years in  terms  of  skill

upgrading,  quality,  productivity  and  advanced  technologies.

Skill  levels  have increased from about 2% in 1984  to  27%  in

1998.   A  comprehensive quality assessment system  CONQUAS  has

been introduced and quality scores have increased steadily since

its  introduction  in  1988.  More than  4,000  contractors  and

suppliers are now registered with CIDB with more than  70  local

contractors in the top-most category.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1942</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in recent years, before the economic downturn, the

industry  had expanded too rapidly.  Productivity has  slackened

significantly   as   the   industry   resorted   to   short-term

unproductive  measures.   The  prevailing  economic   situation,

therefore, allows us a very good opportunity to restructure  the

industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from a fundamental review of the various Government

agencies dealing with the construction industry, we came to  two

conclusions.   One, as previously announced, the  non-regulatory

functions of the Public Works Department should be corporatised.

Two,  there would be synergy arising from the merging of BCD  of

the  PWD  with  the present CIDB.  Unlike other industries,  the

construction industry operates within a well-defined  regulatory

framework  -  this  is necessary because of  the  strong  public

interests at stake.  While CIDB's development efforts have borne

fruit  in several areas, its progress has been moderated by  the

fact  that  it  is  not  directly  involved  in  the  regulatory

framework.   Putting  both the regulatory  and  the  development

efforts under one body will allow the new statutory board to co-ordinate  the efforts of these two arms better.  The  new  board

will be able to leverage on the expertise and experience of both

BCD   and   CIDB,  and  take  an  integrated  approach   towards

restructuring the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have taken the opportunity to make an amendment to allow

the   new  BCA  to  make  new  regulations  pertaining  to   the

improvement  of  efficiency  and  standardisation   of   design,

processes,  construction  techniques,  products  and  materials.

This  will pave the way for the BCA to require mandatory minimum

buildable  scores for new buildings in a few years'  time.   The

objective  is  to hasten the adoption of more buildable  designs

which  allow  the  buildings to be built using  more  productive

construction  methods.   Although CIDB  has  promoted  buildable

designs for several years, the adoption of such designs has been

slow.   The  BCA  will  adopt  a  two-pronged  approach  towards

buildable  design  - developmental as well as regulatory.   More

details will be given separately by the BCA when the details are

firmed up.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1943</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Main Features of the Bill</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will now elaborate on the main

features of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part I of the Bill gives the short title and interpretation

of   the   Bill.    Part  II  provides  for  the  establishment,

incorporation and constitution of the Authority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III addresses the functions and powers of the

Authority.   In  particular, clause 9 of the  Bill  defines  the

functions of the Authority.  The functions are drawn from  those

of  the  current  CIDB  Act  and  Building  Control  Act.   Some

amendments are made to make them more up-to-date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers of the BCA are laid down in clause 10 of the

Bill.  Additional powers need to be given to BCA, as compared to

CIDB.  This is to enable BCA to carry out its functions as  both

a  regulator  and a promoter.  For example, under clause  10(a),

BCA   would  be  able  to  prescribe  the  standards   for   the

construction   industry  in  relation  to   design,   processes,

construction techniques, products and materials.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clauses in Parts IV and V of the Bill relate to staff

and  financial matters.  These are based on existing  provisions

that the current CIDB has to comply with.  In particular, clause

13  will  provide for the appointment of the Chief Executive  of

the  Authority.  Clause 24 will require the accounts,  financial

statements  and auditor's report of the statutory  board  to  be

sent to the Auditor-General, Minister and Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 25 to 31 of the Bill provide for the transfer of

property, assets, liabilities and employees from CIDB and BCD to

BCA.   Under clause 26, all persons employed immediately  before

1st April 1999 by CIDB and BCD shall be transferred to BCA.  The

terms  will  be  no less favourable than those  enjoyed  by  the

officers  immediately  prior  to their  transfer.   The  pension

rights  of  Government employees would also be  preserved  under

clause 27 of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 36 provides for the repeal of the Construction

Industry Development Board Act.  This is necessary as CIDB  will

cease to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1944</b></font><br><br>

exist with the formation of BCA.  Clause 36(4)(b) will amend the

name  of  "Building Authority" in the Building  Control  Act  to

"Commissioner of Building Control", unless otherwise provided in

the  Schedule  to the Bill.  This is to avoid confusion  between

the  name  of  "Building Authority" and  the  new  Building  and

Construction  Authority.  The same clause 36  also  repeals  the

moribund  Land Improvement Act, which was enacted in 1901.   PWD

currently administers sections 10 and 12 of the Land Improvement

Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule to the Bill provides for the necessary

consequential  amendments to some of the  existing  legislation.

Amendments  will be made to the Foreshores Act to transfer  some

of the functions presently under PWD to URA.  References made to

the  "Building Authority" and "Deputy Director-General of Public

Works" in the Railways Act will be amended to that of the  "Land

Transport  Authority".  The Sand and Granite Quarries  Act  will

also  be amended to allow statutory board officers to administer

the relevant portions of the Act.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the construction industry will always

remain  an  important  component of the  economy.   The  present

respite  from the heady days of past years allows us to  refocus

our  efforts to upgrade the construction industry.  It  is  thus

timely   that   the  Building  and  Construction  Authority   be

established  to  look  into strengthening Singapore's  long-term

competitiveness in the construction industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  I  support  the Building and Construction  Authority  Bill

which  basically  merges the regulatory functions  of  the  PWD,

which  are currently under the Building Control Division  (BCD),

and the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB), under  a

new  statutory  board.  I fully agree that with this  merger  it

will  yield greater synergy and cost-effectiveness as both  deal

with the design

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1945</b></font><br><br>

and construction stage of property development.  I have been  in

dialogue  with industry practitioners regarding the above  Bill.

Although  they support the establishment of the BCA,  they  have

expressed certain concerns that I would like to bring up to  the

attention of the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the function of the BCD is regulatory in nature.

It  coordinates the technical departments such as the URA,  FSB,

ENV,   LTA,   National   Parks,   and   so   on,   during    the

building/planning process.  The CIDB's functions,  however,  are

more promotional in nature.  After the merger, the industry  has

expressed  concern  that  the  BCA  might  focus  too  much   on

regulation  rather than promotion.  So they hope  that  the  BCA

would continue with this promotional functions as before, as the

name  "Authority" may perhaps change the mindset  of  the  civil

servants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The promotional functions and efforts of the old CIDB have

been  much  appreciated by the building industry in  helping  to

lift  the  standard of construction.  The continuation  of  this

role  under  BCA,  I am sure, will benefit all  players  in  the

industry.  Presently, architects and engineers still have to get

approval for building plans from a number of Government  bodies,

although  the  BCD coordinates many of these functions.   It  is

hoped  that more of these functions can now be centralsied under

the  BCA  to  provide  a one-stop shop for  the  convenience  of

industry practitioners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the functions of the new BCA, which is clearly stated

under  clause  9(1)(d), is "to promote good procurement  methods

and practices in the construction industry and advise and assist

the  Government  in  the procurement of construction  works  and

services".   According to industry feedback,  today,  frequently

different   Government  agencies  adopt  different   procurement

methods and they are considered inequitable with the practice of

the  industry.  With the passage of this new Bill, the  industry

would  like to see the BCA standardise such procurement  methods

and  disseminate  to all Government bodies for  compliance.   In

reviewing such procurement methods,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1946</b></font><br><br>

special consideration should also be given to promote the  local

professionals and the local building industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also given to understand that, currently, PWD has

established  several  panels  of  private  consultants  for  the

purpose  of  undertaking  public  sector  projects.   As   such,

projects  that  PWD  can  farm out are given  to  these  private

consultants on the panels.  With the corporatisation of PWD,  it

is  recommended  that the proposed BCA take over  this  role  of

managing these panels so as to create a more level playing field

for all in the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With greater synergy and cost effectiveness, as pointed out

by  the  Minister in the formation of the new BCA, the  industry

would  also  like  to see lower fees for the processing  of  all

kinds   of  applications  by  the  industry  practitioners.    I

understand   that  the  Board  of  Architects  right   now   has

representation by three to four architects from the  PWD.   With

the  corporatisation of the PWD, the Minister may want  to  look

again  more  closely  into  the  composition  of  the  Board  of

Architects  to give it a better representation from the  private

sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share the concerns of many of these points brought up by

the  industry.   Some of these concerns may be  unfounded.    If

they are, there is obviously a perception and communication  gap

between  the  Ministry  and  the industry.   Perhaps,  a  better

communication programme could be instituted to bridge this gap.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let me say that I believe that the merger of

the  regulatory  functions  under  BCD  and  the  promotion   of

functions  under  CIDB  into the BCA is  a  move  in  the  right

direction.   The public and the building industry  practitioners

welcome the initiative.  However, I hope the Minister will  take

the feedback of industry practitioners into consideration during

this exercise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise

in support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of the Building and Construction

Authority  (BCA)  is  indeed  a  step  towards  integrating  the

functions of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1947</b></font><br><br>

various  authorities presently responsible for the  construction

industry.   As  I  have mentioned before,  we  need  a  one-stop

centre,  be  it  a Construction Ministry or statutory  board  to

spearhead the construction industry into the next millennium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction industry is a complex industry that

involves  many statutory boards and industries.  To upgrade  the

industry,  we need to adopt an integrated approach to facilitate

its development and expansion.  Although the Bill integrates the

functions  of the Building Control Division and the Construction

Industry  Development Board, it lacks the integration needed  to

improve   on   productivity,   quality,   professionalism    and

competitiveness of the construction industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One major setback is the lack of power given to the

Building  and  Construction Authority to  exercise  development,

environment  and  fire safety control over  the  development  of

buildings  and  infrastructure works.  A  one-stop  centre  that

encompasses   all   these   functions   would   provide   better

coordination  and  accountability which should further  increase

the efficiency of development and construction works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me discuss the details of the Bill.

<br><br><i>Functions of Authority</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although clause 9 has laid out many functions of BCA, there

is  no  mention of any effort to promote the use of  information

technology,  innovative and efficient design  and  environmental

protection  to  improve the construction industry.   Information

technology   and  environmental  protection  are  key   concerns

affecting the construction industry of many developed countries,

such  as  Japan, USA and UK.  Thus, it is essential for  BCA  to

address these issues which have direct impact on the development

of the construction industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9(1) also does not include the function to regulate

and enforce building regulations and Acts in the industry.  As a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1948</b></font><br><br>

building  authority, BCA must ensure the compliance of  building

regulations and Acts and take enforcement actions to ensure that

buildings and infrastructure works are properly constructed  for

safe occupancy and usage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9(1)(c) has apparently omitted the need to encourage

standardisation   and   improvement  of   information   in   the

construction  industry.   At  present,  there  is  a   lack   of

standardisation  of  information  in  the  industry.   This  has

resulted in wastages, abortive works and disputes among  parties

involved  in  construction and development  works.   The  recent

court  case on the definition of "built-up" and "built-in" areas

is  an example of the lack of understanding among players in the

industry.    To  improve  productivity,  BCA  should   implement

standardisation of information in the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9(1)(e) allows BCA to provide consultancy and

advisory  services related to the construction industry.   As  a

regulatory  authority,  there  may  be  potential  conflict   of

interest for BCA to provide such services especially for private

sector projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9(1)(j) also specifies that BCA will promote and

carry  out research for the development and improvement  of  the

construction  industry.   While it is  appropriate  for  BCA  to

promote  research, research work should be carried  out  by  our

universities and other research institutions.  Both NUS and  NTU

are  equipped with research facilities and resources, which  can

undertake  multi-disciplinary research.  Thus, BCA should  avoid

duplication of effort and wasting of resources in this area.

<br><br><i>Powers of Authority</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10(a) mentions that BCA may prescribe standards for

the  construction  industry  in  relation  to  design,  process,

construction techniques, products and materials.  Presently, the

Productivity  and Standards Board prescribes all  standards  and

codes  of practice for the construction industry.  May I clarify

with the Minister whether this function will be transferred from

PSB to BCA?  If so, there must be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1949</b></font><br><br>

provisions in the Bill for the transfer of authority,  property,

assets and liabilities from PSB to BCA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10(e) highlights that BCA can conduct tests and

award  diplomas  and  certificates  of  proficiency.   I  wonder

whether  it is appropriate for the Authority to award  diplomas.

This  may  cause  confusion among employers in the  construction

industry  with  regard to the recognition of such  diplomas.   I

would like to suggest that diploma training should be channelled

to  the  respective polytechnics so as to avoid  duplication  of

resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10(i) states that BCA can enter into a partnership

or  an  arrangement for the sharing of profits.  May I  ask  the

Minister  under  what  circumstances can  such  partnerships  or

arrangements take place and who are the likely partners?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to upgrade the construction industry, there is an

urgent  need  to  control  the quality of  participants  in  the

industry.   The  BCA  should be empowered to issue  licences  to

practitioners  and firms in the industry.  It should  provide  a

one-stop  centre  for the issuance of licences so  that  quality

control  can  be  centralised.   Stringent  control  should   be

exercised  to  register  and  license  construction  firms   and

practitioners.   Presently,  we  have  registered  or   licensed

architects,  engineers, plumbers, electricians, safety  officers

and  cable  detectors.   We  should  take  further  measures  to

consider  licensing  the  other professionals  involved  in  the

construction  industry,  namely, builders,  quantity  surveyors,

project managers and property managers so as to raise the  level

of professionalism in the industry as a whole.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Building and Construction Authority can

play  a leading role to improve the quality and productivity  of

the construction industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, I rise to speak in support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of the new Building and Construction

Authority comprising

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1950</b></font><br><br>

the  current CIDB and BCD of PWD should be welcomed as good news

to  the construction industry.  As mentioned by the Minister, up

to  now,  CIDB  and BCD perform their roles quite independently.

CIDB  will  deal  with  all  the promotional  and  developmental

aspects of construction industry at the downstream of the  value

chain.   They  handle the registration of contractors,  training

and   certification  of  workers,  promote  new  materials   and

processes.   BCD, on the other hand, regulates and controls  the

building   works  at  the  upstream  and  they  deal  with   the

developers,  architects and planners.  Today,  the  coordination

between these two entities can be said to be minimal.  Often, if

one  entity wanted to do, it may not achieve the cooperation  of

the  other.   This  has  resulted,  as  the  Minister  mentioned

earlier, in a delay in implementing measures to help promote the

overall well-being of the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with the merger to form one single entity under one

Chairman  and  one Board of Directors, I can envisage  that  the

merged entity would be a more effective one.  On one hand,  CIDB

would  be  able,  with  the regulatory power  of  BCD,  to  move

upstream  to enforce the promotional measures that it previously

found powerless to impose.  On the other hand, BCD now would  be

able  to  better exercise the building control and  approval  of

plans  with a good knowledge of the latest construction methods,

equipment  and availability of skilled workers.  This integrated

approach will help to accelerate the process of skills upgrading

and reduction on its dependence on foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I digress now to speak on the status of the

construction  industry  today.  There are  currently  more  than

200,000  foreign construction workers.  Our indigenous  pool  of

workers  in  the  industry is very small.  It is around  30,000.

The  foreign workers, whether they are skilled or not, have come

and gone.  While they are here, we train them from unskilled  to

semi-skilled,  to  skilled  and to be trade-certified,  and  all

these cost a lot of money.  At the same time, the quality of our

construction also suffers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1951</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at first glance, we seem to have an advantage by having

cheap  labour.   But if we add up all the costs,  like  training

cost,  defect cost, time cost and social cost, I think the total

cost is probably higher.  This helps to explain partially why we

have  a  higher  construction cost and yet our  quality  is  not

commensurate with the cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, at this point, I would like to commend

the  Minister  for boldly introducing the new functions  of  the

authority  that would give the industry a quantum  leap  in  the

overall  efficiency.  The new Bill places a lot of  emphasis  on

the   promotion   and   development  of  advanced   methods   of

construction.   In  particular, as  part  of  the  consequential

amendments to the Building Control Act, the Bill states that  it

will   introduce   measures  to  improve  the   efficiency   and

standardisation in the construction industry relating to  design

processes, construction techniques, products and materials.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members of this House would know, Singapore inherited the

construction  system  from  the British.   All  along,  we  have

practised  what the British did 20 or 30 years ago.   Typically,

for a development project, the property developer's main concern

was  maximisation or short-term gain by asking the architect  to

deliver  the  maximum saleable or lettable area in the  shortest

possible time without regard for ease of construction.  Then the

structural  engineers  are called in after  the  architects  and

developers have more or less finalised the concept plan and they

are  asked  to come out, in the shortest possible time,  with  a

structural design, again, without regard to buildability.  So by

the  time  the project is tendered out, the basic architectural,

structural,  mechanical, electrical designs are all  firmed  up.

The  contractor who wins the bid would have no input  whatsoever

to the entire design process.  But the contractor is usually the

best  guy to know which method of construction is the best.   So

the  process we have would not allow the contractor  to  exploit

his  expertise.   And  if we continue with  this  practice,  our

construction industry will continue to be burdened with labour

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1952</b></font><br><br>

intensive and inefficient construction processes.  We are  lucky

that  the  CIDB  has introduced the buildability concept  a  few

years ago to address this problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate a little bit on buildability. In layman's

terms, it can be said to be the ease with which the construction

product  can  be  made and it is computed with a formula  giving

different  weightages to various construction methods, materials

usage and standardisation of dimensions.  A high buildable score

for  a  project  indicates  that the  project  is  less  labour-intensive and more efficient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-date, some Government departments, such as HDB, Mindef,

PWD,  etc,  have used the score to gauge if their projects  have

been  designed  for  efficient construction.   And  two  foreign

countries,  that  is,  Denmark  and  South  Korea,   have   even

legislated  part  of  the buildability, ie, the  standardisation

part,  to  promote  productivity  and  efficiency.   Within  the

Singapore  Government  departments  and  statutory  boards,  the

implementation has been quite successful.  Many public  projects

have  attained high productivity with competitive  cost.   These

departments  have  found  relative  ease  in  implementing  this

concept  because  they  could  control  the  entire  process  of

construction,  ie,  from conceptualisation to  final  execution.

But  in the private sector, the scenario is quite different.   I

think  this  is why this Bill has to provide for legislation  of

buildability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the private sector, possibly owing to unfamiliarity or

fear of loss of creativity or fear of high cost, this concept of

buildability has not been readily embraced, notwithstanding that

it  has been successful in the public sector.  As a result,  the

labour  productivity of private projects tends to be low and  it

pulls  down  the national average year after year.  I personally

do  not  believe high buildability is associated with monotonous

and  stereotype  designs.   On  the  contrary,  many  buildings,

whether  they are local or overseas, have attained a  very  high

standard of aesthetics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In advanced countries such as USA or Australia, all doors

and windows are mass produced in standard dimensions.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1953</b></font><br><br>

Designers  of buildings simply buy them from the shelf  or  from

mail order, and nowadays from the Internet.  In Singapore, there

is  no  standardisation of windows and doors.  All  have  to  be

tailor-made.   And  similarly, the room sizes in  Singapore  are

dimensioned  in such a way that there is always a  lot  of  tile

cutting  at  the edges.  All these practices cause wastages  and

poor workmanship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other industries, standardisation has proved to be a

good  way to make things buildable and the most notable examples

are   in   the   auto  industry.   Nowadays,   most   cars   use

interchangeable parts.  Car manufacturers also try to build cars

with  as few platforms as possible.  Just recently, Ford  Motors

launched  three distinctly different models, namely, the  sports

car,  Firebird,  the  American  saloon,  the  Lincoln,  and  the

luxurious Jaguar S.  All of them have the same chassis  and  all

these three models are aesthetically appealing, even though they

share  a  lot  of common parts.  This leads us to believe  that,

through  concerted effort, both aesthetics and buildability  can

be  achieved  in  the  construction  industry.   BCA,  with  its

regulatory  power,  should  now  be  able  to  implement   these

measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Bill, I note that the authority would have a new

function,  and  that  is,  to  raise  the  professionalism   and

capability  of  firms  in the construction  industry.   On  this

point,  I have several comments.  First, it is easier said  than

done  to  raise professionalism in our industry.  It is a  known

fact that in the construction industry, some clerks-of-works and

resident  engineers do not quite practise their professionalism.

They  would  deliberately delay the progress of  a  project  for

their  own  benefit.  CIDB has, not too long  ago,  conducted  a

survey and found some shocking results, ie, the delays caused by

clerks-of-works and the resident engineers have resulted in 2-3%

wastage in our annual turnover.  If we take $20 billion  as  our

national annual turnover, that means we have lost one centre for

the performing arts each year.  This lack of professionalism  by

the  site supervisory staff has been highlighted time after time

but  the  problem has never been eradicated and I hope  the  new

authority, with its enhanced power, can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1954</b></font><br><br>

find  a  way to resolve this perennial problem.  One possibility

would be the registration of clerks-of-works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second comment I have is that the construction industry

needs badly a fair and equitable contract.  The current form  of

contract  tends  to be one-sided, biased towards protecting  the

developers  and consultants excessively.  One example  of  their

catch-all  clauses is "unless otherwise expressly provided,  the

contract sum and contractor's rates and processing in the  rates

shall  be  inclusive  of  all  ancillary  and  other  works  and

expenditure,  whether  separately or specifically  mentioned  or

described  in  the  contract  or not,  which  are  indispensably

necessary  to  carry  out  and bring  to  completion  the  works

described  in the contract or may contingently become  necessary

to overcome difficulties before completion."  Another example is

that the information given is only a guide.  The party providing

the  information holds no responsibility for the accuracy of the

information.  These examples illustrate that the contract itself

protects some parties excessively, so much so that they need not

be  professional  in  their conduct.  So, in  the  promotion  of

professionalism,   I  believe  BCA  should   ensure   that   all

contracting  parties have equitably distributed responsibilities

and liabilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third comment I have is related to the promotion of

capability of firms in construction and I am glad that  the  new

authority  recognises the need to do so.  I  believe  that  this

cannot  be  achieved  without looking at the  wider  and  higher

Government  policy  on  whether we would accept  unfair  trading

practices  of  dumping in our country.  I have touched  on  this

topic  in  the  debate  on  the  Report  of  the  Committee   on

Singapore's  Competitiveness last  November.   Our  construction

industry  is a fairly small one.  Some of the largest  firms  in

the  world individually have an annual turnover in dollar  terms

more  than our entire industry.  Therefore, it is very easy  for

them  to  practise marginal pricing or dumping to gain a  market

share  and  to  deprive local firms from getting  the  necessary

track   records   which  are  essential  for  players   in   the

construction industry to continue bidding

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1955</b></font><br><br>

and  expanding.   Some  foreign firms  are  even  registered  as

subsidiaries  with limited liability and they sublet  the  whole

work  so  as to pass down the losses to the local subcontractors

and  suppliers.   On the surface, the developers,  be  they  the

Government  or  private, get a better price for  their  product.

But  the  parties they subsidise are not necessarily the foreign

party  but also the numerous local suppliers and subcontractors.

In view of this, I urge the new authority, while trying to raise

the  capability of firms and to promote good procurement methods

for  the  Government, to explore beyond the current  procurement

policies  to  curb the malpractices.  If not,  things  that  had

happened in the last 15 years would continue to happen, and some

of   these  functions  of  the  new  authority  would   not   be

substantially fulfilled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last area I wish to comment on is to ask the Minister

whether  he  would empower the BCA to be the final authority  on

matters relating to the construction industry.  In the past  one

week, we read a lot in the newspapers about the dispute over the

definition of "built-up" and "built-in" area.  Should  we  leave

it  to the Court or the industry to sort it out?  Or should  BCA

come up with a definition once and for all?  I am sure that  the

developers  and  consumers  alike would  be  keen  to  know  the

outcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also occasions whereby there are discrepancies

between BCD and some other authorities.  For example, the  issue

of  landfill.  BCD has certain restrictions but the Ministry  of

the  Environment would usually like the land to  be  filled  up.

These  are  contradictory rules.  If no  one  can  prevail,  the

process  of  sorting out can take a long time and  can  be  very

costly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, now that BCA is about to be formed,

I  wish the Minister could get BCA to standardise all submission

requirements  and procedures for everybody in the  country.   At

present,  for example, some parties are still allowed  to  carry

out  work  without obtaining a permit to commence work.   For  a

small

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1956</b></font><br><br>

nation  like  ours,  we  should  be  in  a  better  position  to

standardise all procedures to avoid confusion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to suggest to the Minister that for

optimum running of this authority, the appointed Chairman should

not  be  currently involved in a statutory board or organisation

whose  major interest is in the area of property development  or

construction.   Yet,  he  should  have  a  good  knowledge   and

understanding  of  the industry.  The Board of Directors,  which

can  have  up  to  12  members, should not just  comprise  those

practising  professionals and contractors.   It  should  include

other  disciplines such as sociologists, manufacturers, bankers,

representatives  from  consumers, to get a  broad  and  balanced

representation for such a complex industry.  It would definitely

be  in the best interest of all people in this country to see  a

progressive, vibrant and efficient construction industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> First, let me thank Members for their

inputs  and support of the Bill.  We try in this creation  of  a

new  statutory  board  to  undertake  both  the  regulatory  and

promotion  functions in a balanced manner.   I  thank  them  for

their  high aspirations of what the authority would  do,  but  I

must  dampen  all  expectations.   We  are  not  intending  this

statutory   board  to  undertake  the  centralisation   of   all

regulatory functions over the construction industry.  There  are

many other functions undertaken by other Ministries, whether  it

is  the  Fire  Safety Bureau or the Ministry of the Environment.

There  are so many other technical specialities.  It is not  the

intention  of  the  BCA to be responsible for  every  speciality

under  regulation.   What the BCA would continue  to  do  is  to

coordinate  the requirements of the various agencies and,  where

there  are  conflicts,  try to get the  government  agencies  to

resolve  these conflicts expeditiously.  That I pledge  the  BCA

would continue its functions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have gone through this debate on whether we should

centralise  with  a one-stop service or we should  decentralise.

This is a never ending debate.  If I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1957</b></font><br><br>

centralise,  you  will accuse me of being too powerful  and  too

dogmatic,  a dictator over the construction industry,  and  that

was  what happened in 1986 when we decentralised.  Now  that  we

decentralise, you say, "You are not helping us enough.  Can  you

now undertake all the functions together?"  I think we stay with

the  present arrangement.  It has worked quite well.   BCA  will

continue  to help, coordinate the requirements and if  you  find

conflicting requirements, we will lend our strength to  get  the

agencies to sort out the conflicting requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On procurement methods, we have tried to standardise the

contract  at least in the public sector.  It is not possible  to

standardise  the contract in the private sector  because  it  is

among  contracting  parties.  It is between you  and  the  other

party.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On private consultant panels, this will continue to be

administered by BCA once PWD is corporatised.  PWD  would  be  a

private  consultant,  just like any private  consultant  in  the

market.   The  body administering the private consultant  panels

for the Government would be transferred to BCA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take the other issues raised by Dr Teo. I think the

role of the BCA would also be to promote information technology,

environmental  protection, etc.  This comes under the  catch-all

term  of advanced technologies.  Many of the issues that Dr  Teo

has  raised about safety and structural requirements are covered

under the Building Control Act.  So the aim of this Bill is  not

to replace the Building Control Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I endorse the comments of both Mr Chuang and Dr Teo about

standardisation.  One of the key features in this Bill is to put

in place the legislation for buildability in two to three years'

time.  To be fair to the construction industry, we ought to give

all the players advance notice that this is how we would want to

take  the  industry,  and  we want to set  certain  buildability

scores  as the requirement to be legislated.   The industry  has

been  given due notice and we will put the legislation  to  have

buildability scores and the methods in place over the  next  two

to three years.  In this,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1958</b></font><br><br>

we will work with the industry.  This is in line with Mr Lew Syn

Pau's  point  about better communication within the construction

industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no conflict with the research. BCA will promote

research in conjunction with NSTB and PSB.  The research  itself

will be done by the universities or other agencies.  There is no

intention  for  BCA to be directly involved in the  construction

research.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for awarding of diplomas, we have the Construction

Industry  Training Centre (CITC) under the current  CIDB.   They

are  upgrading  their  courses  and  working  with  the  various

polytechnics.   They  will  be in a position  to  award  certain

specialised  diplomas  for  certain  specific  skills   in   the

construction  industry.  So again there is no overlap  with  the

polytechnics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also asked under what circumstances would BCA go

into  partnership for profit, etc.  This is in a  very  confined

area.   For  example, the old CIDB undertakes  the  construction

exhibition  every  year  and  this  is  a  private  construction

exhibition  which involves a private contract and they  do  make

profits.   This is to enable them to continue to do  such  joint

ventures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have listened to Mr Chuang's very passionate comments

about   using   buildability  and  to  raise  the   professional

standards.  I fully agree with his comments.  It is part of  the

mission  of the BCA to raise the professional standards  of  the

industry.   We  have tried to encourage the use  of  design-and-build so that consultants and contractors get together early  to

design  and build something that is buildable and aesthetic  and

competitively  priced.  Over time, the use  of  design-and-build

has  taken  on in the industry but we will continue  to  promote

this method of construction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, I would like to thank the Members for their

inputs.  We thank Members for the confidence that BCA would  try

to  do all things for all people.  We will try our best but,  as

Members  realise, the construction industry is  a  very  complex

industry.  It involves many, many players and I am sure we  will

have to do a better coordination job overall.

<div align="center"><b>TOWN COUNCILS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>8.35 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National

Development (Mr Koo Tsai Kee): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg  to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Town Councils (Amendment) Bill seeks to amend sections 21,

33  and  38 of the Town Council Act.  This Bill seeks to improve

the  financial management of Town Councils by making changes  to

the  use  and regulation of their funds. At the same  time,  the

amendment  widens  the powers and duties  of  Town  Councils  to

enhance their operational efficiency and effectiveness.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1960</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Changes to Town Councils' Funds</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk about the proposed changes to section 33. The

Bill  seeks to make three changes to Town Councils' funds  under

section 33.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, Town Councils are allowed to use their funds

for the maintenance of facilities erected on common property  in

their  towns.   However, some improvement works put  up  by  the

Citizens'  Consultative Committees (CCCs)  under  the  Community

Improvement  Projects  Committee  (CIPC)  scheme,  or  by   Town

Councils  themselves  during their Interim Upgrading  Programmes

(IUPs),  were  erected on non-common property  in  their  towns.

These  facilities  are mainly for the use and enjoyment  of  HDB

residents living in the vicinity. Although funding was available

for  the construction of these facilities, there is no provision

for  their maintenance. Allowing the Town Councils to use  their

funds to maintain these facilities should therefore be viewed as

an  extension  of the Town Councils' services to better  address

the needs of residents.  In practical terms, Town Councils would

also  be in the best position to maintain such facilities  which

are  not on common property.  The Bill therefore seeks to  allow

Town  Councils, with the approval of the Minister  for  National

Development, to use the Town Councils' funds for the maintenance

of facilities erected on non-common property in their towns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Town Councils Act currently does not allow Town

Councils  to  make  inter-activity transfer of  funds  in  their

sinking funds.  Funds set aside for activities under "Market and

Food  Centres"  cannot  be  used  for  activities  under  "Other

Commercial Property". In reality, however, the market  and  food

centres   are   an  integral  part  of  the  shopping/commercial

activities  of the Neighbourhood Centres/Town Centres,  as  both

activities,  the  market  and food  stalls  and  the  commercial

activities, complement each other.  To streamline the  financial

operations of Town Councils, the Bill proposes to merge  "Market

and  Food  Centres"  with "Other Commercial  Property"  under  a

single  combined  category called "Commercial  Property".   With

this, their respective operating funds will be merged, as will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1961</b></font><br><br>

their respective sinking funds. This will allow Town Councils to

use the funds for the management, maintenance and improvement of

the common areas for all types of commercial property within the

Town.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Bill proposes to give the Minister for

National Development the flexibility to prescribe the accounting

method for the minimum amount of service and conservancy charges

(S&CC)  to  be  credited  to the sinking funds  established  for

residential and commercial properties.  Prescribing the  use  of

the  accrual accounting method, which is based on the amount  of

S&CC collectible, will require Town Councils to reflect the S&CC

arrears  of  their sinking funds in their financial  statements.

This  will  highlight the level of funds available for  cyclical

repairs and maintenance when the time comes.

<br><br><i>Discretion to Levy Different Rates of Charges</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on now to section 38. Currently, section 38 of the

Act  only  allows  Town  Councils to  levy  different  rates  of

charges,  ie,  S&CC charges,  for different types  and  uses  of

flats  and stalls by way of by-laws.  The Bill seeks to  provide

Town Councils the flexibility to levy different rates of charges

for  the  same type of flats and stalls in accordance with  such

criteria  as  they  may determine.  For example,  Town  Councils

could  levy higher charges for upgraded flats and stalls  as  it

costs   more  to  maintain  the  upgraded  facilities  and   the

environment   surrounding  it.  While  this  Bill  allows   Town

Councils, if passed by Parliament, to charge different rates for

the  same flat type, I understand from the news report that  the

PAP  Town  Councils  are  unlikely to change  the  present  S&CC

charges.   Similarly,  differential  charges  could  be   levied

according  to  the  level  of service and  types  of  facilities

required  by residents.  For example, some blocks of  flats  may

require more cleaning compared to a different block of flats  of

the  same  type.  So Town Councils will have the flexibility  to

charge  different S&CC charges on the same flat type because  it

costs more to maintain a particular block

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1962</b></font><br><br>

of flats.  The amendment is also necessary to give effect to the

policy decision to levy different rates of charges for the  same

flat  type,  based  on  criteria  such  as  citizenship  of  the

lessee/tenant  and whether or not he has any interest  in  other

immovable property.

<br><br><i>Contribution to the Premium for Fire Insurance</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move to section 21 of the proposed amendment. At

present, HDB has a Board-wide Fire Insurance Policy to safeguard

its  properties, including the common property.  Although it  is

the  responsibility of the Town Councils to maintain and  manage

the  common  property, the Town Councils  are  not  required  to

contribute  to the insurance premium.  Section 21  is  therefore

amended  to  make it the duty of Town Councils,  as  the  estate

managers, to contribute towards the cost of fire insurance taken

up  by  HDB  for common areas of the residential and  commercial

properties in their towns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also includes consequential amendments to effect

all the above changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  the idea of Town Councils was first  started  in

1986  as  a pilot project.  In 1989, the Town Councils  Act  was

passed  and many town councils were established.  They gradually

took  over  the  management, repair and  maintenance  of  common

property  from  HDB.  At the moment, there are 16 town  councils

all over Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many years of hard work, the town councils have

matured.   Now,  apart  from maintenance and  repair  of  common

property,  town  councils also organise various   activities  to

educate the residents to keep their estates clean with the  hope

that  they  will cooperate with the town councils  to  create  a

better and cleaner environment for everyone.  This will also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1963</b></font><br><br>

help  to enhance the social cohesion by inculcating in them  the

"kampong spirit" for harmonious community living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through various community activities, the town councils,

together  with  grassroots  organisations  and  the  CDCs,  have

identified themselves with the people and have also served as  a

bridge  between the people and the Government.  When the country

is in crisis, the Government and the people will be able to work

together  to  tide  over the difficult time.   The  Government's

recent  $10.5  billion  package  of  cost-cutting  measures  has

received  resounding support by the people. We  hope  that  this

tripartite  cooperation  package  will  show  good  results   to

overcome our economic difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must encourage our town councils, grassroots

organisations  and  CDCs to carry on organising  more  community

activities so as to further enhance our social cohesion.  On the

other  hand,  the  grassroots leaders  need  proper  places  and

facilities  to  organise their activities.  There  are  reserved

vacant  lands which are now in the charge of HDB.  The  Minister

has  suggested  that  this  should be transferred  to  the  town

councils  for  maintenance  and  management.   This  is  a  good

decision. These vacant lands scattered all over the various  HDB

estates  can provide more space for grassroots leaders and  town

councils  to  organise  their  community  activities,  such   as

National  Day  dinners, the Senior Citizens' Week  celebrations,

Town  Council  Day  and  Residents'  Day.   This  will  play  an

important role in enhancing our social cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in order to give more effect to the

implementation  of the new amendments, I have three  suggestions

for the Minister to consider.  Town Councils should be given the

authority  to  use  the  Town  Council  Development   Fund   for

maintenance  and  management  of  the  vacant  land.   In   this

connection, the Bill must authorise the town councils to collect

land-use  and  temporary licence fees from  organisations  which

apply to use these lands.  The Ministry may want to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1964</b></font><br><br>

consider having the vacant lands included in the IUP and MUP  to

provide residents with a better living environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I must first of

all  declare my interest in this Bill.  I am the Chairman of the

Potong Pasir Town Council.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendments to the Town Councils Act contain in

this Bill are controversial.  The Government seems to be blowing

hot and cold at the same time.  I would like to cite examples of

what  happened at Potong Pasir.  Whenever the Potong Pasir  Town

Council attempts to install a new facility in a building  or  do

anything on the land, the HDB shall step in and refuse  to  give

its consent on grounds that it is the owner of all HDB buildings

and  lands  on  which  those  buildings  are  sited.   The  true

situation in Potong Pasir Constituency is that the Town  Council

there cannot even knock a single nail in any building in an  HDB

estate  without  first getting permission  from  the  HDB.   The

question  therefore  we  ask is: what  is  the  status  of  Town

Councils?  Do we have the right to do things independently?  The

answer  is yes and no.  As far as the day-to-day running of  the

Town  Council is concerned, we have some measure of independence

of  action, but even that is whittled down by the amendment that

is  before  us.  Basically, as I see it, the Town  Councils  are

nothing  more  than  agents of the HDB.   We  are  cleaning  and

property managing agents.  That is what we are, although we  are

given a glorified name of a Town Council.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Potong Pasir Town Council has taken the HDB to court on

the  interpretation of section 19 of the Town Councils Act,  and

the  court ruled that the HDB is the property owner and we  need

to   seek  its  permission  to  install  new  facilities.   Only

recently,  the  HDB and the Potong Pasir CDC jointly  put  up  a

notice  board  on a land under the jurisdiction  of  the  Potong

Pasir  Town  Council.  For any other body which does that,  that

party  would  have  to  seek our Town Council's  permission  and

obtain  a  TOL  for doing so.  But when the HDB and  the  Potong

Pasir CDC put up

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1965</b></font><br><br>

such  a notice board, they blatantly bypassed us with arrogance,

because  they did not even, as a matter of courtesy, inform  the

Town  Council  of what they were doing.  The Potong  Pasir  Town

Council, of course, took the notice board down.  But soon after,

we  received a threatening letter from the HDB claiming that  it

is  the  owner of the land and has the right to erect  a  notice

board on that land.  The Potong Pasir Town Council did not  want

to  confront the HDB in court again, so we re-erected the notice

board  at  its original place, which is land under our care  and

management.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the amendment under clause 2, the HDB now wants

the  Town Council to pay for premiums for the insurance it takes

up  for fire risk in relation to the common property.  No doubt,

under  the  Town  Councils  Act, all common  properties  at  HDB

estates  are  under  the  control and  management  of  the  Town

Councils,  but  still  the  HDB is the  owner  of  those  common

properties,  as it has claimed whenever its rights of  ownership

are  infringed.  Normally, it is the owner of the building  that

takes up the insurance policy against fire risk.  And even under

the  Land  Titles  (Strata)  Act (Chapter  158),  which  is  the

equivalent  law,  it  is the management corporation,  comprising

subsidiary proprietors, which is the required body to insure the

subdivided  buildings  which in part form the  common  property.

The  main difference between the requirement to insure under the

Land  Titles (Strata) Act and this amendment is that  under  the

former  law,  it is the owner of the property or the  subsidiary

proprietors which are required to insure the property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of HDB flats, when this amendment is passed,

ultimately  it  is the lessees who shall pay for  the  insurance

premium for the common property.  The lessees are not the owners

of  that  property.  The Government now wants HDB residents  who

are not owners of the common property to bear responsibility  of

that  property which is not theirs.  The HDB, as  owner  of  the

common  property,  is  shamelessly shirking its  responsibility.

When  it  comes to claiming its right over the common  property,

the HDB is doubly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1966</b></font><br><br>

fast   in   doing  so.   But  when  it  comes  to  bearing   the

responsibility  as  to  the  liabilities,  such  as  paying  for

insurance  premium,  the  HDB is now passing  the  duty  to  the

residents.  Is this the sort of example the Government wants  to

set  for  the  people  of  Singapore?  To  tell  the  people  of

Singapore  -  you  can  enjoy  the  benefits  but  abandon   the

responsibilities and liabilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards clause 3(b), I would say that the determination

of  the  rates of the conservancy and service charges should  be

left to the Town Council and not to the Minister.  The way I see

it,  the Government wants a hand in it.  Because, as regards the

service and conservancy charges, the Government wants to squeeze

as  much political advantage out of them as possible.  With this

amendment,  the  Government can control how much  the  residents

should  pay for their S&CC.  The Government subsidises the  S&CC

of  the  HDB residents out of the goods and services tax  (GST).

The  Government knows how much GST it has collected and how much

of  it  can be disbursed so as to achieve a position of  revenue

neutral,  as  far as the GST is concerned.  It is all  a  clever

juggling of money.  The Government collects from the people.  It

collects the GST on the one hand and disburses them as subsidies

to the HDB flat dwellers on the other.  The only problem is that

the  majority  of people who pay for the GST are HDB  residents.

They  comprise 85% of Singaporeans.  They pay taxes out of their

pockets on the one hand for goods and services they consume and,

on  the  other  hand, they get back in terms of S&CC  subsidies.

The  only problem is that, on average, an HDB resident shall get

back less than what he pays out in GST.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear to me that the amendment under clause 3(d)

is  a  conflict with section 3 of the Town Councils Act (Chapter

329A).  Under that section, the Town Councils are constituted to

control,  manage,  maintain and improve the common  property  of

residential  property  in HDB housing  estates.   The  amendment

allows the Town Council to pay for improvements which are not in

the  common property.  In principle, this is wrong.  What I  was

going to say is:  why

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1967</b></font><br><br>

should the majority of residents pay to improve the property  of

a  citizen who may or may not be a resident in HDB flats for his

sole  benefit?  But now I am told that what the Government wants

is  for  the Town Council to pay for facilities that are put  up

through  CIPC funds by the CCC.  Again, I think that  is  wrong.

If the CCC can put up any facility or any community works, then,

I  think it is up to the CCC to maintain it.  Of course, if  the

Town  Councils  were  told and if they agree  to  put  up  those

facilities, maybe there is a moral duty to pay.  But if the  CCC

puts  up such facilities, like in our Potong Pasir Town Council,

they put up some signages in Sennett Estate, which we were never

told, I do not think the Town Council at Potong Pasir should  be

made liable to maintain those facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this amendment is allowed, there shall be a loophole for

favouritism and even cronyism.  I do not think that  this  is  a

good  amendment.  If the amendment is to be allowed at  all,  it

should be left to the Town Council to have the last say and  not

the  Minister.  It is cronyism because, under section 3  of  the

Town  Councils  Act, it allows the Town Council  only  to  spend

money  to  maintain,  manage  common  property.   But  now  this

amendment is going to allow the Town Council to manage  and  pay

out  of Town Councils' funds for properties which are not in the

common areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to also comment on clause 4 of the Bill.

Since  the Town Councils Act was formed about 10 years ago,  the

Town Councils have always levied service and conservancy charges

at  one  rate for one type of flats, shops or stalls.   This  is

pursuant  to  the  present section 38 of the Town  Councils  Act

which  clearly  states that the Town Council can levy  different

rates  for  different types of residential, commercial  property

and  stalls  and also in respect of their uses.   Now  all  this

seemingly  is to be changed.  If I read the amendment correctly,

the  Town Councils are allowed, after this amendment, to  charge

different rates for, say, 3-room or 4-room flats.  The amendment

also mentions something new, that is, a class

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1968</b></font><br><br>

of owners.  Nowhere in the main Act does it mention the class of

owners of flats.  This is appearing in the new subsection (10A):

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (10), a Town

Council  may  differentiate the rates of charges  to  take  into

account  any  grants-in-aid  made under  section  41  which  are

expressed  to  be  for the benefit of any  class  of  owners  of

flats."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something new. Because this new class of owners of

flats  is  never mentioned in the Town Councils Act.  So  really

this amendment is not very clear to me.  Maybe the Minister  can

explain further.

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the two

Members,  Mr  Ang Mong Seng and Mr Chiam See Tong,  for  raising

relevant queries.  I want to thank all the Members of Parliament

who  are  still sitting around and listening carefully  at  this

hour of the day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng raised three points. The first is whether we

could  allow  Town Councils not just to repair and maintain  but

also to manage vacant land.  I think there is a misunderstanding

here  but  I  will clarify later on.  The second  point  Mr  Ang

raised was to allow Town Councils to issue TOLs for use of  such

vacant  lands  so that Town Councils can collect  the  fees  for

functions  held  on  non-common property.  The  third  point  he

raised  was  whether  we would allow IUP and  MUP  funds  to  be

extended to works on non-common property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Town Councils Act was enacted on 29th June 1988, the

objective was, and still is today, to control, maintain,  manage

and  improve  the common property.  That has not  changed.   But

over  the years, some things have changed.  For example, we have

IUPs,  we  have extensive use of CIPC funds.  On rare occasions,

will  the  CCCs seek permission to fund a project from a  common

property to a non-common property?  For example, a short linkway

from  a  HDB block to a bus stop.  That linkway crosses  from  a

common property to a non-common property, ie, crosses into State

land.  In these circumstances, funds are available for the  Town

Council, acting on behalf of the CCC, to build the linkway using

IUP or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1969</b></font><br><br>

CIPC  funds.  But the Town Council could not maintain or  manage

the part of the linkway which stands on non-common property.  So

this  Bill serves to allow Town Councils certain flexibility  to

use  the operating funds to maintain and manage the facility  on

non-common property.  It is not, as Mr Ang misunderstood it,  to

manage the non-common property land itself.  The land belongs to

the  State.   HDB is made an agent of the State.  We are  saying

that  we  allow  the Town Councils to use the money  to  repair,

maintain,  improve and even replace those facilities that  stand

on  non-common  property.  So I think that is quite  clear  now.

But  I  will take up Mr Ang's suggestion and ask HDB  to  liaise

with Land Office and see what we can do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I want to clarify is that the non-common

property  land usually belongs to the State, which  is  reserved

land, and the State will have some use for the land in the  long

term.  So it would be difficult for the Government to allow Town

Councils  to manage the land.  I hope those points will  clarify

Mr Ang's queries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I come to Mr Chiam See Tong. Mr Chiam is very suspicious.

He thinks that this Bill is to fix him.  Far from it, it is not.

Because  what  fixes  him,  fixes all  the  other  14  PAP  Town

Councils.   So we are actually suffering more than him.   But  I

will  go  through some of his points.  First, he  said  that  we

treat him differently.  In fact, the treatment is the same.   If

any  PAP  Town  Council wants to do any permanent  work  on  the

common property, it has to seek the land owner's, which is  HDB,

permission  to  do so.  Usually, HDB does not say  no,  provided

certain  conditions are complied and provided the  Town  Council

funds  the  project.  So this applies to him at the  same  time.

The  recent incident which he brought up was when he  put  up  a

signboard without seeking permission from HDB.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> You put up.

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> But you took it down.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Anything that stands on HDB land belongs to

HDB.  You are not supposed to remove, paint or vandalise it.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1970</b></font><br><br>

But  it  is  a  small incident.  We have to enforce it  legally.

Otherwise, it will become a precedent.  If he wants  to  put  up

any  signboard, he can just write to HDB.  And if they  are  not

objectionable, I do not see any reason why he cannot put  it  on

Government land.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I seek a clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The land is under our jurisdiction.

The land is part of the common property in which we have control

and we have management of it.  Therefore, if anyone wants to put

anything  on that land, he should seek our permission.   But  in

the  case of HDB and CDC, they did not bother.  They brushed  us

aside  and went ahead and put it up.  The next morning we saw  a

strange board there.  Naturally, we took it down.  We even  have

a  by-law  to say that if anybody wants to put anything  on  the

land under our control, he should seek our permission.

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> In that particular incident, the CCC did

seek  the  permission  of HDB but they did  not  seek  the  Town

Council's permission because it is the managing agent,  but  not

the  landlord.   So that is the technical legal point  which  he

conceded and he put back the signboard.  Anyway, that is  not  a

very  serious  allegation he has made.   There  are  other  more

serious ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the insurance of common property, he said that it goes

against the spirit of the Town Council.  He said that the common

property  belongs  to  HDB,  so HDB  should  insure  the  common

property  and  not  ask the Town Council to share  this  premium

burden.   Over the last few years, from 1991 to 1997,  the  fire

claims  had  gone  up almost two-fold, from  about  $315,000  to

$776,000.   A  lot of the fires were actually caused  by  debris

collected  in the common areas, like lift lobbies and corridors,

and  the  debris should have been removed by the Town  Councils.

It  is  due  to the negligence of the Town Councils  that  these

fires  were started in the first place.  There is a moral hazard

here.  If we do not ask the Town Councils to bear a part of  the

premium, then the Town Councils will not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1971</b></font><br><br>

remove the debris diligently.  No doubt, the Town Councils  have

no control over who throws the debris, but nonetheless it is the

duty  of  the  Town Council, as the managing agent  of  HDB,  to

remove  the debris whenever they occur.  There is a moral hazard

there.   If we do not ask the Town Councils to pay part  of  the

premium,  they will just sit back, take it easy, and more  fires

will take place and the premiums will snowball.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When HDB insures the Town Councils against fire risks, HDB

insures it board-wide, that means, it will take up insurance for

all  the common property owned by HDB.  It does not discriminate

against  certain  Town Councils.  It does not ask  certain  Town

Councils  to be a bit more diligent or pay more.  We think  that

that  is  wrong.   From now onwards, we look at individual  Town

Council and say, "If you are more responsible, if you clear  the

debris quickly and if there are less fire incidents in your Town

Council, we will ask you to pay less or maybe even nothing."  If

there are a lot of fires in a particular Town Council, the  Town

Council has been negligent in clearing all the debris and  fires

keep  on  occurring  at the same few blocks,  then  we  have  to

penalise that Town Council.  We have not worked out the exact co-payment part.  But we will make sure that it would be equitable,

transparent and affordable, and I can come here and  defend  it.

So  I  hope  he is convinced that we are not going after  Potong

Pasir Town Council.  The culprits could be a PAP Town Council, I

really do not know.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On S&C charges, Mr Chiam See Tong said that S&C charges

should be left to the Town Councils.  That is what it is.  It is

up to him to levy X$ for 3-room type, Y$ for 4-room type, and Z$

for 5-room type.  And we have not changed that principle.  It is

up  to him.  We do not tell him how much to charge.  What we  do

is  to  give  him the flexibility to charge different  types  of

rates on the same type of flats.  Let me give an example.   When

the  Town  Councils Act was enacted, we thought that  the  older

flats  would cost more to maintain.  So we gave more  grants  to

HDB.  HDB gave more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1972</b></font><br><br>

grants to Town Councils for older flats.  But over the years, we

find that when we upgrade an old flat, let us say, an upgraded 3-room flat, the cost of upgrading and maintenance goes up because

we  put  in more lifts, faster lifts, more landscaping and  more

lighting points.  So it would cost more.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I clarify, Mr Deputy Speaker?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Koo, are you giving way?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am saying that the Minister has the

last  say.   The  Minister may, from time to time,  prescribe  a

minimum amount of the service and conservancy charges which  are

paid,  or are due and payable, or both, to a Town Council  under

section  38.   So  the  amount  is actually  determined  by  the

Minister.   The Minister will say, "Look, you cannot  charge  at

this  rate.  You must charge at another rate." because he  feels

that that is the minimum rate he should charge.  So the S&CC  is

finally  the  Minister's decision.  It is not the Town  Council,

unless I am wrong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> I think you are wrong there. I think you

have read the part on the sinking fund.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Okay, you may be right there.

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> So he is convinced that we are giving

Town  Councils the flexibility of charging different  rates  for

the same flat type because we find that upgraded flats cost more

to  maintain  than  older  flats.  We also  recognise  that  for

different  group of flats, for example, we have standard  4-room

flats,  4-room  design-and-build flats  and  4-room  design-plus

flats, the design-plus and design-and-build flats actually  cost

more to maintain than a normal standard 4-room flat because they

are  more  luxurious and have more landscaping and  things  like

that.   Whether  the  Town Council wishes  to  charge  different

rates, we leave it to the Town Council.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1973</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since he mentioned about sinking fund, we find that some

Town Councils are less than diligent in collecting their arrears

from  the  residents.  In other words, if they are  supposed  to

collect  Y$  from  the residents per month in  S&CC,  they  only

collect X$, so they have a shortfall.  What they do is they send

a  portion of the X$ into the sinking fund.  We find the sinking

fund  is growing very slowly.  We fear that when the time  comes

for  cyclical upgrading, like re-roofing or changing  of  lifts,

there  may not be enough money in the sinking fund.  This  comes

about  because the MPs may want to be popular and  may  be  less

than  diligent and he may not want to antagonise the  residents.

So  we want the Town Councils to now reflect the arrears portion

in  the  financial statements.  So the residents and the  public

will  know  that there is a significant amount of arrears  which

were  not  collected and that amount should go into the  sinking

fund.  In other words, we are going for a collectible system and

the  accounting  should be in an accrual system.   The  Minister

will direct on that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have covered most of the points raised by Mr

Chiam.  Unless I have not done so, he can seek clarification.

<div align="center"><b>PENALTIES FOR MOTORISTS WHO FORGET TO INSERT CASH CARDS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for Communications

whether  his  Ministry will exercise leniency  not  to  penalise

those motorists who forget to insert their CashCards but make an

effort to re-enter the Electronic Road Pricing gantry (within 10

minutes) subsequently.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system treats each vehicle

passing under an ERP gantry as distinct and separate. Hence,  on

each  passing, a deduction of an appropriate ERP charge will  be

made.  When  a  motorist passes an ERP gantry with  no  CashCard

inserted  in the In-vehicle Unit (IU), a violation is deemed  to

have been committed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scheme whereby a motorist can make up for any earlier

violation  by re-passing under an ERP gantry within a  specified

time  will generate unnecessary traffic circulation on the roads

in  the  vicinity of the ERP gantries.  This will contribute  to

traffic  congestion, increase average travel times  and  pollute

the environment.  All this is of course uneconomical.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore strongly advise motorists that they should

make  it  a part of their motoring habit to insert the  CashCard

into the IU before the start of a journey.

<div align="center"><b>EXTENSION OF CERTIFICATES OF ENTITLEMENT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  if  the Land Transport Authority  will  consider

extending  the  validity  of  certificates  of  entitlement  for

vehicles tested to be in good condition to 15 years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Vehicle Quota System was first introduced, the validity

period  for a Certificate of Entitlement (COE) was fixed  at  10

years  to  tie  in  with  the time limit  for  the  Preferential

Additional  Registration  Fee  (PARF)  benefits.  The  COE  thus

represents  the right for a vehicle owner to use his vehicle  on

the roads for a period of 10 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an owner feels that his vehicle is in good condition and

wishes to use it beyond 10 years, he can revalidate the COE upon

its expiry for either 5 or 10 years by paying 50% or 100% of the

prevailing quota premium respectively.  It would not be fair for

the Government to extend the COE validity for vehicles tested to

be in good condition to 15 years when the owners only paid for a

10-year COE.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to extend the validity period of all COEs, we can

expect the quota premium to be higher as a higher value will  be

attached to the longer life-span.  In addition, if COEs were  to

have  a  longer validity of say 15 or 20 years, the total number

of COEs that can be released will have to be reduced.  A reduced

COE  quota  is again likely to lead to higher premiums.   Higher

COE  premiums will not only have an adverse impact on those  who

are  revalidating their COEs, but will also put the new  vehicle

buyers at a disadvantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government Parliamentary Committee (Communications) is in

the  midst  of  reviewing the different aspects of  the  Vehicle

Quota  System.   I believe they will examine the  issue  on  the

validity of COEs in their review.

<div align="center"><b>RISING TREND OF TEENAGE PREGNANCIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Education   whether  there  was  a  rising  trend   of   teenage

pregnancies  among students between 1995 and 1998;  whether  the

average  age of pregnant teens is getting younger; and,  if  so,

how  his Ministry will improve sex education teaching in schools

to prevent teenage pregnancies.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Ministry of Health, the number of pregnancies

among  teenagers,  defined as those under 20 years  of  age  and

inclusive  of teens both in school and not in school,  has  been

stable  until 1995.  There was, however, a slight increase  from

1995 to 1997.  The number of teen pregnancies was 2,091 in 1995,

2,185  in  1996 and 2,254 in 1997.  The average age of  pregnant

teens has remained stable at approximately 18 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the increase in the number of teen pregnancies is

small, and not all pregnant teens are students, the Committee on

Discipline of Female Pupils, chaired by Senior Minister of State

Dr  Aline  Wong, has made some recommendations which  have  been

accepted by the ministry.



<br><br><i>Key Stage Programmes</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to existing programmes related to sex education,

schools will target human sexuality education programmes at  the

key stages of Primary Six, Secondary Two and JC One.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These programmes will go beyond facts to address the moral and

emotional  dimensions of human sexuality.  Separate,  compulsory

sessions will be held for boys and girls with the assistance  of

the  Ministries of Community Development, Health as well as  the

Voluntary Welfare Organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preventive action against teenage pregnancy is a shared

responsibility between the teenager, the parents and the school.

While schools will continue to play their part, parents must  be

aware   of  and  shoulder  their  responsibilities.   A   strong

partnership between home, school and community is a  key  factor

in helping to curb teenage pregnancies.

<div align="center"><b>PERCENTAGES OF MALES AND FEMALES IN MEDICAL PROFESSION AND</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>MEDICAL SCHOOL</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Health, from 1989 to 1998, what comparative percentages of  male

and  female doctors left the profession every year; and how  his

Ministry  justifies the one-third quota for women  applying  for

medical  school and reconciles the practice with its obligations

under  the  Convention  on  the  Elimination  of  All  Forms  of

Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A consistently higher proportion of female doctors do not work,

or  work part-time, compared to male doctors.  Over the last  10

years, the percentage of female doctors who were not working  or

working only part-time ranged from about 16% to nearly 19%.  The

comparative figure for male doctors is 5% to 8%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two key reasons for imposing the intake quota on

female  medical  students.   First, the  cost  of  training  one

medical  student  is  much  higher  than  that  for  the   other

disciplines  in the university.  It costs over $350,000  over  5

years to train a medical student, 80% of which is subsidised  by

the Government.  The total subsidy for medical students is about

5  times  that  for  students in other disciplines.   Given  the

limited intake of medical students and the need to optimise  the

outcome,  a  higher  proportion of male  medical  students  will

ensure  that more doctors will remain full time in the workforce

to meet the projected demand for medical services and contribute

to society.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1979</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that a higher proportion of female doctors

prefer  to  work  in  positions which do not  involve  irregular

working  hours.  Such positions are very limited in  our  health

institutions.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equal access to education remains one of our cardinal

principles.   Women make up 52% of the local university  student

population  in the 1998/1999 intake.  Equal access to university

education does not mean that every student has a free choice  as

to  the type of course he or she may pursue, as this depends  on

the  number of places available for each course.  The number  of

available places depends on several considerations, such as  our

national  needs and the economic cost of providing such courses.

With  respect  to  medical education,  our  economic  and  human

resources  do  not  allow us the luxury of providing  a  medical

education  to  all  for its own sake.  For  these  reasons,  the

Government  has  imposed  the one-third  quota  in  the  medical

course.   However,  we  do  not regard  this  policy  to  be  in

violation   of  our  obligations  under  CEDAW.    It   is   not

discrimination against women on grounds of gender per se.  It is

because we have to address a real and practical problem.  Let me

also add the Government does not prevent women from enrolling in

medical courses overseas and qualifying as doctors.  There is no

quota  in  the number of women doctors who practise medicine  in

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>



<br><br><i>Procedures</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone wishing to deliver a public speech is required to apply

for  a public entertainment licence, on a prescribed form,  from

the  Police  Licensing Officer.   The Police  would  inform  the

applicant, in writing or by phone, of its outcome as soon as the

application has been processed.  The successful applicant  would

have  to  pay the required fee and collect the licence from  the

Police Licensing Unit at Pearl's Hill.



<br><br><i>Criteria</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police take into account factors such as the proposed

programme  of  the  event,  the  nature  of  the  speeches,  the

suitability  of  the  site, and the timing of  the  event,  when

considering applications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speeches which are political in nature, or on race, language or

religion  which  can  elicit disaffection  or  highly  emotional

responses  may  only  be  held indoors, or  within  stadiums  or

athletics centres.  This is because such speeches have a  higher

propensity  for  law  and  order  problems,  and  an  indoor  or

controlled setting would allow the licensee better control  over

the access and behaviour of the audience.



<br><br><i>Processing Time</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police normally takes about 3 weeks to process an

application.   The actual time needed to process an  application

would vary, depending on the nature of the proposed event.

<div align="center"><b>RECURRENCE OF SMOKE HAZE POLLUTION</b></div>





<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for the

Environment  whether the recurrence of the smoke haze  pollution

at the end of November and start of December 1998 signifies that

illegal  fires  are still evident in Indonesia and  whether  the

ASEAN Haze Action Plan has, to an extent, been ineffective.





<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mild haze we encountered at the end of November and the

start of December indeed shows that there is a strong likelihood

of  plantation fires in Sumatra starting again as soon as  there

is  a  dry spell and that we will be affected if winds blow  our

way.  The  ASEAN  Haze Action Plan will not be  effective  until

there is effective enforcement against illegal burning. This  is

one of the key elements in the Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to work with our ASEAN colleagues to get

Indonesia to implement the Plan more effectively.

<div align="center"><b>MEASURES TO ELIMINATE PROBLEM OF MALARIA AT MANDAI AREA</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for the Environment

what measures his Ministry has taken to eliminate the problem of

malaria at the Mandai area.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mandai area, in the neighbourhood of the worksites where the

7  foreign  workers lived and worked, was thoroughly combed  for

potential  breeding  grounds of the  Anopheles  mosquito  -  the

vector  that transmits malaria.  Ground puddles were filled  and

seepage drains were cleared of all chokages. The area is largely

forested and undeveloped and seepage water found in such terrain

can be conducive to the breeding of this vector.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1983</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area was also fogged with insecticide on three occasions.

There were no further cases of malaria reported since then.

<div align="center"><b>REPORT ON THE SILK AIR CRASH</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Minister for Communications

if  he will give the House an up to date report on the Silk  Air

crash.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigations on the crash led by the Indonesian Aircraft

Accident  Investigation Commission (AAIC) is still in  progress,

with   the   full   support  of  the  United   States   National

Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the Civil Aviation Authority

of  Singapore  (CAAS) and the Australian Bureau  of  Air  Safety

Investigation (BASI).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigator-in-charge, Professor Oetarjo Diran briefed the

next-of-kins  and issued a press release on 18th  December  last

month  to  provide an update on the status of investigation.  So

far,  no indication was found that air traffic control, weather,

maintenance, terrorist acts, or hazardous material was a  factor

contributing to the accident. As I have explained to  the  House

previously, investigation is progressing very slowly because  of

the  high degree of destruction to the aircraft and the lack  of

useful  information  from  the flight  data  and  cockpit  voice

recorders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AAIC expects that the investigation is likely to continue

well into 1999.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Minister for Education if his

Ministry  will  allow marks for pupils offering Indian  minority

languages  to  be  included  as a subject  for  the  purpose  of

promotion at all levels of examinations.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-Tamil Indian students are allowed to opt to study a non-Tamil Indian language as their Mother Tongue. Instruction in

the  non-Tamil Indian languages is not provided by the  Ministry

and  parents are required to arrange for instruction  for  their

children.  This instruction is provided by a variety  of  tutors

ranging   from  centrally  organised  classes,  to  personalised

tuition.  Grades obtained in the non-Tamil Indian  languages  in

the   national  examinations,  namely  the  PSLE  and  the   GCE

examinations, where there is a common benchmark, are counted for

placement in and admission to the next level of study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there are no standardised curriculums or tests at the various

other  levels  the Ministry does not currently count  the  marks

awarded  by  tutors  in these languages for promotion  at  other

levels.  However,  schools  place students  in  the  appropriate

classes according to the ability demonstrated by the students in

their other subjects. Pupils are therefore not unduly advantaged

nor disadvantaged by this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34. <b>Mr Hawazi Daipi</b> asked the Minister for Education (a) how

many  students in the various levels in the Woodlands  New  Town

have asked for transfer to schools in the estate for the current

academic  year;  and  (b) how his Ministry plans  to  solve  the

problem.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1985</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of applications for transfer to a school in Woodlands

New  Town  for  the current academic year is 2,495  for  primary

level and 463 for secondary level. This figure includes students

who requested for transfers between schools within Woodlands New

Town.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as possible, the Ministry has accommodated requests for

transfers  across  schools. We were able to  make  available  an

additional  l,400 places for pupils studying in schools  outside

Woodlands and Yishun by increasing the enrolment of classes  and

opening   additional  classes  in  the  9  primary  schools   in

Woodlands.   The secondary schools accepted 139 pupils  to  fill

the  vacancies.   Where the demand for places  in  a  particular

school  exceeded the places available, 3 criteria  are  used  to

prioritise  the  transfer requests.  The order of  priority  for

admission of the children is as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) Children who have a medical history

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii) Children who have siblings in the school

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii) Children who are currently studying in schools furthest

from  Woodlands to help minimise their long travelling distances

between their homes and schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be more primary and secondary places available in

Woodlands  New Town to cater for additional demand. Two  primary

schools, Evergreen Primary School and Woodgrove Primary  School,

will  move  to  their new premises in March and  September  1999

respectively.   The  Ministry can provide  at  least  2000  more

places  in these 2 schools. Woodlands Ring Secondary School  can

take  in  more  students when schools currently holding  in  its

premises  move  out  in June 1999.  A new  secondary  school  at

Woodlands  Drive 16/Woodlands Avenue 1 will start  operation  in

January  2000.  The actual number of classes to be  opened  will

depend on demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicants who are not successful in their request for transfer

this  round, could write to their schools of choice  or  to  the

Ministry  if  they  want their children  to  be  considered  for

transfer.

<div align="center"><b>PERFORMANCE BONUS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister (a)

whether he will disclose details of the performance bonus scheme

for  civil servants; (b) whether all civil servants are eligible

for  the  bonus; and (c) how many civil servants  received  such

bonuses  in  1998,  by  categories  of  political  appointments,

personnel groups and grades.



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The performance bonus scheme in the Civil Service was first

introduced  in the civil service in 1990 as part  of  the  civil

service's move to inject more flexibility in its wage system. At

the  same  time,  it allows the civil service to  better  reward

officers who have performed well. The performance bonus is  part

of the total annual salary that an officer receives. The quantum

of  performance  bonuses  paid vary according  to  the  assessed

performance  and substantive grade of the officer.  The  maximum

quantum  of  performance bonus payable for the top grades  is  9

months for the Legal Service and 6 months or less for all  other

civil servants and political appointment holders. However, fewer

than  5%  of  officers are paid the top tier  bonus  rate.   The

majority  receive the base rate, which varies depending  on  the

grade and service of the officer. Under-performing officers  are

not paid any performance bonus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Currently, civil servants in intermediate timescale grades

and  above  (about 5,300 in total) are eligible for  performance

bonuses. The scheme was introduced to these grades, in  lieu  of

built-in  salary increase, when salary comparisons  showed  that

they had fallen behind private sector rates. Performance bonuses

have not yet been extended to lower division officers as it  may

be  difficult  to differentiate the performance of  officers  at

that  level.  However,  as we gather more  experience  with  the

administration   of  the  performance  bonus  scheme   and   the

assessment  of  performance, we will  progressively  extend  the

scheme to lower division officers as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) A total of 4,995 civil servants, 31 political appointees and

19  statutory/judicial appointment holders received  performance

bonuses  in  1998 for work done in 1997, as shown in  the  table

below :

<div align="center"><b>DETENTION WITHOUT TRIAL</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

what  is the number of persons presently detained without  trial

under  (i)  the  Internal Security Act; (ii)  the  Criminal  Law

(Temporary Provisions) Act; (iii) the Misuse of Drugs  Act;  and

(iv) any other laws of preventive detention.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>



<br><br><i>Internal Security Act</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 6 persons are presently subjects of Order of

Detention (DO) under the Internal Security Act (ISA).   Four  of

them  have been released from custody under Suspension Direction

of  the DOs.   These persons were arrested and detained in  1997

and 1998 for involvement in espionage activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1997 case, the 2 persons involved were a female

Singaporean  and a male Singapore Permanent Resident.   The  man

was  a  deep-cover operative of a foreign intelligence  service.

He used the woman as his collaborator.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1998 case, the 4 persons detained were all male Singapore

citizens.     Three of them were agents who worked  for  another

intelligence  service.    One  of  them  recruited  the   fourth

detainee  as  his conscious collaborator to collect intelligence

on and to subvert a certain local community organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four of these detainees (the 2 in the 1997 case and 2 from the

1998  case) have since been released under Suspension Directions

after  serving periods of detention ranging from 4 to 11 months.

This   followed  ISD's  recommendations  that  their  preventive

detentions  were no longer necessary for reasons  of  continuing

investigation  or of their posing an active threat  to  national

security.   The remaining two individuals have been  held  under

Orders  of  Detention  since March and July  1998  respectively.

Investigations on them are still continuing.



<br><br><i>Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 31st December 1998, 450 were detained under the Criminal

Law (Temporary Provisions) Act.



<br><br><i>Misuse of Drugs Act</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) does not provide for preventive

detention.  However, sections 37(1) and 37(2) of the  MDA  allow

Director,  Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) to  commit  a  person,

whom  he  reasonably  suspects to be a drug addict,  to  undergo

treatment or rehabilitation, or both, at an approved institution

for  a period not exceeding 3 years.   As at 31st December 1998,

4,923 persons were committed to treatment and rehabilitation  in

the various drug rehabilitation centres.



<br><br><i>Intoxicating Substances Act</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Intoxicating Substances Act also does not provide for

preventive  detention.  However, sections 13 and 17 of  the  Act

allow  Director,  CNB, to commit a person,  whom  he  reasonably

suspects  to  be  an  inhalant abuser, to undergo  treatment  or

rehabilitation, or both, at an approved institution for a period

not  exceeding 6 months.  As at 31st December 1998,  15  persons

were  committed  for  treatment and rehabilitation  at  inhalant

centres.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system is synchronised with

SingTel time. It was chosen to give motorists the convenience of

synchronising  their  time with SingTel's  free  "1711"  enquiry

service.  This  service is the primary source for obtaining  the

local time in Singapore and is available 24 hrs a day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the local radio stations obtain their time from different

sources, it is not practical to synchronise the ERP system  with

any one radio station. This is because the time as announced  by

each  radio  station  may differ slightly. Further,  unlike  the

"1711"  enquiry  service  which is available  on  demand,  radio

stations  only report the time at set intervals, which  may  not

include  all  the  time  points when ERP  charges  are  changed.

Nevertheless, we are looking into the feasibility of  displaying

<div align="center"><b>IN-VEHICLE UNIT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for Communications

whether  his Ministry can re-design the In-vehicle Unit (IU)  so

that the cash card can be concealed when inserted into the IU so

as to prevent cash card thefts from cars.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most effective way of preventing car break-ins is to remove

all valuables, including cash cards, from the cars when they are

left unattended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will consider the Member's suggestion, along with all the

other feedback received, when we design the next version of  the

IU.

<div align="center"><b>SOUND INSULATION STANDARDS FOR RESIDENTIAL FLATS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for National

Development whether his Ministry will consider developing a  set

of  guidelines  or  standards which  will  ensure  proper  sound

insulation between residential flats.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there are no standards at the moment, HDB has been

adopting  internal  guidelines,  which  are  similar  to   known

standards such as those used in Australia, to ensure that  there

is  proper  noise insulation between flats.  For  each  dwelling

unit, the party wall and floor slabs are designed to comply with

the  structural  and fire code.  These solid masonry  walls  and

slabs also have good sound insulation values.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is sufficient to reduce normal noise levels acceptable

under ENV's standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandatory standards are not without cost implications. I

will nonetheless ask my officials to evaluate carefully with the

Ministry  of  the Environment whether there is a case  for  such

standards.

<div align="center"><b>HEARING-IMPAIRED SINGAPOREANS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Education (a) how many hearing-impaired children passed  Primary

School  Leaving Examination and progressed to secondary  school,

pre-university  and tertiary education from 1989  to  1998;  (b)

what  kind of training and qualifications must teachers have  to

teach the hearing-impaired; and (c) what measures are adopted by

his  Ministry to provide the most conducive environment for  our

intelligent,  deaf  Singaporeans  to  lead  an  independent  and

meaningful life.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children who have mild hearing impairment, and are able to

cope  in mainstream education study in mainstream schools.  They

are  taught  together with their peers. In  addition,  they  are

provided  with  help  from resource teachers.   Those  who  have

severe hearing impairment attend special education schools where

they   receive   an  education  customised  to  their   specific

disabilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to available statistics for 1996-1998, the number

of  hearing impaired pupils who enter junior colleges  and  pre-university  centres as well as other post secondary institutions

has  been  on  the rise.  Between 1996-1998, the  number  of  HI

pupils  attending secondary schools averages 186 per year.   The

number in junior colleges and pre-university centres rose from 7

to   17  pupils,  while  those  in  post-secondary  institutions

increased from 34 to 85 over the same period.

<br><br><i>Training Teachers</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who are teaching hearing-impaired pupils in the

special  schools  and designated school centres  must  have  the

basic Certificate of Education which is awarded by the NIE.   In

addition,  they must undergo in-service training in NIE  or  in-house  training which is conducted by the Singapore  Association

for  the  Deaf.   The NIE also conducts Certificate  in  Special

Education and the Diploma in Special Education for teachers  who

are   teaching  hearing-impaired  pupils.   Currently,  81%   of

teachers  are trained, 6% are undergoing training and  the  rest

are newly recruited teachers who will be sent for training.



<br><br><i>School and Remedial Centres</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing impaired pupils who communicate through sign language

attend 2 designated secondary schools (Boon Lay Secondary School

and  Upper  Serangoon Secondary School).  Resource  teachers  in

these  2 schools use sign language to interpret lessons for  the

special  pupils.  Hearing-impaired pupils who are auditory  oral

attend  mainstream  schools and are given  remedial  help  after

school  hours.   From February 1999, they will  be  provided  an

appropriate remedial programme by resource teachers from MOE  in

3  designated remedial centres - two primary schools (Ang Mo Kio

North  Primary  and  New Town Primary) and  1  secondary  school

(Delta  Secondary).  These teachers also act as  counsellors  to

the  pupils.   These additional teachers help the HI  pupils  in

their  academic  work as well as in their social  and  emotional

adjustment in mainstream schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of our continual effort to help HI pupils, we are

studying  how  IT can facilitate their learning.  In  mainstream

schools,  the  HI  pupils receive the same  resources  as  other

pupils.  We  are looking into additional IT help for HI  schools

run  by Voluntary Welfare Groups.  We are also looking into  the

feasibility  of  providing FM equipment for HI  pupils  who  can

benefit  from  the  system.  We are studying  the  range  of  FM

equipment  that  are  available before we  decide  on  the  most

appropriate system for our school centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is committed to providing the most conducive

environment  for our hearing impaired pupils in our schools  and

is constantly looking into ways to support them with resources.

<div align="center"><b>COMMUNITY SERVICE OF STUDENTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Education if he will give an evaluation of the effectiveness  of

the  mandatory six-hour community service rendered by  secondary

school  students to instil in our young the value  of  community

caring and sharing; and if his Ministry intends to increase  the

number of hours.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Community Involvement Programme (CIP) was introduced to all

schools  in October 1997.  All pupils, from Primary One upwards,

are involved in the CIP. The objective of CIP is for schools  to

be  involved  in  the life of the community to foster  a  strong

sense  of  belonging  and bonding between  the  school  and  the

community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CIP is about preparation for active citizenship. We want

schools  to develop meaningful relationships with the  community

on a sustained basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A survey on the CIP was conducted in October 1998, one year

after implementation.  There was agreement amongst schools  that

the   programme  has  brought  about  a  better   awareness   of

volunteerism, helped in character development of pupils and also

enabled  pupils  to pick up important skills like  communication

and  care-giving skills.  Pupils have developed a stronger sense

of belonging and bonding to the community.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2001</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, our objective in starting CIP is being achieved. The

CIP coupled with other community service activities conducted by

schools  provides  our  young with good  exposure  to  community

service and involvement. As the Programme is relatively new,  it

should  be  allowed  to  run for a few years  before  we  assess

whether  there  is a need to make any changes to the  number  of

hours required.
