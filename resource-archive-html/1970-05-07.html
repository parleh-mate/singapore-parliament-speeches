<div align="center"><b>MINISTERS' SALARIES AND</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>MEMBERS' ALLOWANCES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Prime Minister)</b></div>



<br><br>2.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, although it is 15 years ago, in 1955,

that  Ministerial  salaries  and  allowances   for

Members  were fixed and are unrelated to  present-day economic conditions, I would have preferred to

have left them alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, two reasons compel me to make some

adjustments now, and this in spite of the need for

wage  restraint by the workers and by their  trade

union  leaders. Until we are sure that the effects

of  the rundown of British military spending  have

been  more  than  offset by an  expansion  in  our

industrial  and servicing sectors of the  economy,

we  must be cautious and discourage wage increases

which are not matched by higher productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reason is that I wish to appoint the

new  Member  of  Parliament  for  Havelock  to  an

important Ministry. Sir, it is not fair to ask any

man,  however conscientious and faithful a  public

servant the Member for Havelock has been, to  take

on    a    Ministry    which    carries    heavier

responsibilities  than  the  Development  Bank  of

Singapore for a salary of $2,500 per month. It  is

so   unrealistic  and  so  unrelated  to   present

conditions  in  Singapore,  and  to  what  he   is

getting,  and  to  what  is the  remuneration  for

higher  executives in commerce and  industry,  and

even for senior members in the professions. Senior

lawyers  put in income tax returns of over $20,000

a month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that if I asked him to, the Member for

Havelock would be willing to make a sacrifice  and

serve  at  the present salary. But if  we  are  to

attract  men of ability to serve as Ministers,  in

other words, to run for election and then serve as

Ministers,  Singapore cannot, for  the  indefinite

future,  rely  on people who are willing  to  make

inordinate sacrifices, particularly when it is  at

the expense of their families.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No group of men, either in commerce or industry

or  in  academe,  are  as crucial  to  Singapore's

continued  security and prosperity as  the  eleven

who  form  the  Cabinet.  The  leadership  that  a

government provides determines whether  a  country

is stable and prosperous, or chaotic and bankrupt.

And what has happened to a number of new countries

should warn us of the dangers Singapore faces if a

second generation leadership is not equal to their

task.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had considered the possibility of raising

the salaries for the Member for Havelock and for a

few  other Ministers for whom $2,500 would be  out

of  all  proportion  to  what  they  were  earning

outside the Government and whose family needs  are

also  pressing. I decided against  it.  To  do  so

would be discriminatory and arbitrary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that it would not be

possible  to have men of ability and integrity  to

become  Ministers  at  these  salaries,  once  the

present  Ministers leave office. If  Ministers  in

Singapore  are  not  expected to  be  scrupulously

honest, then that is quite a different matter. For

then  their  Ministerial  salaries  can  be  token

payments  for  purposes  of  income  tax  returns,

whilst fortunes are accumulated in kick-backs  and

rake-offs, for licences, contracts, and a  hundred

and  one  acts  of  the  exercise  of  Ministerial

discretion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, therefore, decided to recommend to

Members  to increase the salaries of Ministers  in

Cabinet from $2,500 to $4,500 per month; Ministers

of   State  from  $2,000  to  $2,500  per   month;

Parliamentary Secretaries from $1,500 to $1,750  a

month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not increasing my own salary of $3,500 a

month. My salary will stay as it is until the  end

of  1972,  by  which  time Singapore  should  have

overcome  the  economic  problems  caused  by  the

rundown  in British military expenditure, provided

we   all   work   hard  for  higher   and   higher

productivity  and more and more industries.  I  am

able  to  do  this  only  because  my  wife  is  a

practising solicitor with an adequate income. But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



it   is  unrealistic  to  expect  the  next  Prime

Minister,  one qualified for the job, to discharge

the  functions  of  this office  for  the  present

salary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile my colleagues and I are hoping to

attract  young  men  and  women  of  ability   and

integrity to take up political work and  stand  as

Members  of  Parliament.  From  several  selection

exercises we have held since 1965 to get new blood

into  this  House, we know that many young  people

are  reluctant  to  undertake political  life  and

stand  for  election, first, because their  public

and  private lives are immediately put under close

and  constant scrutiny, and next, because  of  the

time   and   effort  required  of  a   Member   of

Parliament, all for $500 per month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues and I have, therefore, decided

that  we should raise M.P.s' allowances to  $1,000

per  month.  I  am not suggesting that  this  will

solve  the problem. But it will help. At the  next

sitting   of   Parliament  I  shall  introduce   a

supplementary budget for these changes to be  made

from 1st June, 1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost will be about $300,000 per annum for

the   increase  in  the  M.P.s'  allowances,   and

$300,000  per  annum  for  the  increase  in   the

salaries  of  Ministers, Ministers  of  State  and

Parliamentary   Secretaries.  No   increases   are

proposed  for Political Secretaries, for  normally

they  would  not  be  Members of  Parliament  and,

therefore,  the  rationale for the increases  does

not apply to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the 70's, it is my hope that this

Parliament  can attract enough men of quality  and

integrity   to   maintain  honest  and   efficient

standards   of  administration,  and  to   provide

capable leadership for Singapore. Social, economic

and  political conditions have changed  enormously

since  1955, and motivations for seeking political

office  have  also changed. But I believe  we  can

produce   a   second  generation  leadership,   as

competent  and  honest, and with a  bit  of  luck,

perhaps also as dedicated and determined as  those

colleagues  of mine who have been in office  since

1959.  If we can succeed in this, then Singapore's

future for the 1980's and beyond



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



will be assured. I am prepared, of the statement I

have  put  House,  to  answer  any  questions   of

clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like  to seek clarification and elucidation

from  the  Prime  Minister  arising  out  of   the

Ministerial statement. First of all, Sir, will the

Prime  Minister indicate whether or not  the  four

Members of Parliament who resigned from this House

last  month would come into this category to enjoy

their  pensions?  Secondly, will he  not  consider

that  this increase is out of date? Thirdly,  Sir,

will  he  not  inform this House, apart  from  the

reasons   he  gave  just  now,  why  he  has   not

recommended an increase in his own salary?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply

to  the first question, whether the increases will

apply  to the four Members of Parliament who  have

resigned, the answer, with great regret, is no. We

considered  this matter carefully. If we  were  to

apply it to them and have their pensions based  on

$1,000 per month, then we, as a government,  would

be  going  against a principle for which  we  have

always  stood, namely, that wage increases  should

never   be   back-dated  or  made   retrospective.

Parliamentary  pensions for M.P.s' allowances  and

Ministers'  salaries are calculated  on  the  mean

average of their last three years. So if it is  to

be  altered for the four former M.P.s, the present

allowances  would  have  to  be  back-dated  three

years.  It is irresponsible for any government  to

set  such  a precedent. Apart from grave  problems

that   would  be  posed  not  only  to   employers

generally,  the  Minister  for  Finance  will   be

pressed, because every wage increase made, will be

asked  to  be  retrospective. I know  that  it  is

regrettable that former Members like Mr Lee  Teck

I  Tim, after having served 11 years, will  get  a

pension  of  only $170 a month. I suggest  to  the

Member  for  Punggol that perhaps his feelings  of

comradeship  and loyalty to Mr Lee Teck  Him  are

such  as  to  make  a  call on  his  generous  and

charitable disposition, and that of other Members.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> The second question is about the

increase in the Prime Minister's salary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I have already given the

reason. I do not think it is appropriate. First, I

can  afford  not to take an increase  immediately.

Second,  1  think it will be better understood  by

workers  generally and their trade union  leaders,

of  whom there are several representatives in this

House,  that  the need for wage restraint  and  no

wage  increase  without higher productivity  -that

policy   must  prevail.  My  stagnant  salary   is

symbolic of that policy. I am not suggesting  that

my productivity is not increasing. All I am saying

is  that,  because workers do not visibly  see  my

productivity increasing, I am leaving it at $3,500

until  we have the all-clear signal by the end  of

1972.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> There is still the last part of

my question, Sir: whether the Prime Minister would

not  consider that this increase is a  little  bit

out of date?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is better late than never.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

we all know that the Member for Joo Chiat has been

a  Member  of  Parliament  till  his  election  as

Speaker  of the House. May I know whether the  new

salary  will  be  applied to him  in  his  present

position as Speaker?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Unless the Member for Bras

Basah moves an amendment to exclude the Member for

Joo  Chiat, the increase for all M.P.s  will  also

cover  him.  I am not sure whether the Member  for

Bras  Basah  wants to exclude the Member  for  Joo

Chiat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> In fact, I was a bit anxious

when  the Member for Joo Chiat's position was  not

clarified. I want him to be included.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Thank you, Mr Ho.

steps  the  Singapore Telephone Board proposes  to

take to improve telephone services in the Town.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore Telephone

Board  is aware that during certain peak hours  in

the  morning, there is congestion in the telephone

traffic between the Jurong Exchange and the  City.

This  normally occurs between the hours  of  10.00

and 11.00 in the morning.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This congestion is due to the lack of sufficient

junction cable circuits to the Jurong Exchange. An

additional junction cable is now being laid.  This

project  was scheduled for completion  early  this

year,  but  due  to the delay in the  delivery  of

certain   ancillary  equipment,  such  as  loading

coils, it will now be completed by the end of June

this year. The delay unfortunately has been caused

by  strikes,  not in Singapore but in  the  United

Kingdom firm which supplies the equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, however, certain relief measures

have been taken and it is estimated that about  40

per cent of the congested traffic load during peak

hours has been met.

Defence  how many non-citizens are at  present  in

(i)  the  Singapore  Police Force;  and  (ii)  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on 1st April, 1970, there were 420

non-citizens in the Singapore Police Force and 258

non-citizens in the Singapore Armed Forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizenship is granted only to those whose

loyalty  to  Singapore and what Singaporeans  seek

for  themselves  is beyond doubt. All  these  non-citizens  have  had the opportunity  to  take  out

Singapore citizenship and throw in their lot  with

us   in   the   years  before  August  1965   when

citizenship  was  obtainable by application  after

two years' residence. They decided not to apply to

be  Singapore  citizens. Now for  bread-and-butter

considerations, some have applied. We think it  is

better  to give them the bread-and-butter benefits

without    imposing   the   responsibilities    of

citizenship on them.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for

Defence  whether the existing law is  adequate  to

deal with persons causing noise nuisance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the existing

legislation  is  adequate  to  deal  with  persons

causing  noise  nuisance. The  laws  that  can  be

invoked are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Minor Offences Ordinance (Chapter117).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Public Entertainments Ordinance, 1958 (No. 40 of 1958).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The Road Traffic Ordinance, 1961 (No. 26 of 1961).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will agree that legislation alone will

not  be able to deal with the noise nuisance. Loud

noises   are   usually  created  by  inconsiderate

people.  Good  social habits can  be  achieved  by

education both in the schools and at home. In  the

next  decade  we  should have an educated  society

where    the   majority   should   have   acquired

considerate habits. By then we hope that the above

legislation would be obsolete and could be  safely

revoked.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Dewan Bahasa dan Kebudayaan Kebangsaan

was  wound up in July 1969 after the purposes  for

which  it was set up were achieved. The Dewan  was

set  up  in 1960 mainly, amongst other things,  to

promote the study of the National Language amongst

the  adult  population. In the nine years  of  its

existence it had successfully encouraged the study

of  the  National  Language  through  its  various

those records.



<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin (for the Minister for Culture):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the public records of

the  National Archives and Records Centre  include

archives  dating from 1800, some 20  years  before

the  official founding of Singapore in  1819.  The

archives  include not only Government publications

and correspondence, but also maps, building plans,

photographs  and  other types of  public  records.

Many  items  in  the  archives may  be  considered

unique  and therefore priceless in that  they  are

original  documents  of  irreplaceable  value.  No

estimate can be made of the monetary worth of such

items,  as  in modern times, copies of  these  are

generally  made available through  the  medium  of

microfilm or other photocopying devices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All archives are kept in air-conditioned stacks,

the oldest and most important of these being in 24-hour    air-conditioned   storage.    Such    air-

conditioning   ensures   that    there    is    no

deterioration  in the condition of these  records.

One  of the National Archives staff has also  been

sent  to the National Archives and Records  Centre

of  Malaysia  for  training  in  the  binding  and

restoration  of  fragile  archives.  Training   of

additional   staff  will  also  be   provided   as

necessary.

<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin (for the Minister for Culture):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is

considering   a   proposal  by  the   Broadcasting

Division  to  set  up  an Audience  Research  Unit

within  the Department to service its requirements

for  a regular survey of audience preferences.  In

this   connection,   the   Department   has    had

consultation with the Economic Research Centre  of

the University of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radio and T.V. Singapore has always been keen to

have  an audience survey since, as the Member  for

Katong  has suggested, the selection of programmes

for  broadcast could be broadly based on  audience

preferences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pending approval for the establishment of the

Unit,  the Department is exploring ways and  means

of  getting information, no matter how limited, on

the   reaction   of  its  viewers/listeners.   The

Community Centre Survey presently being undertaken

by  the  State and City Planning Organisation  and

the People's Association, for example, includes  a

few questions on Radio and T.V.

<div align="center"><b>(Steps to improve industrial refuse collection)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for Health

if   he   is  aware  that  due  to  the  irregular

collection of industrial waste in Jurong  Town  by

his  Ministry,  the factories tend to  burn  their

waste which, besides possibly giving rise to  fire

hazards, increases air pollution in the area;  and

if he will take steps to improve the efficiency of

industrial refuse collection in the Town.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Acting Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is correct that the Ministry

of  Health provides only a limited refuse  removal

service  to  factories  in the  Jurong  industrial

estate. The refuse removed is a domestic and trade

type  of  refuse, but not industrial  waste.  This

already amounts to 29 tons per day. The department



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



does  not  have  the  vehicles  or  men   to

undertake the removal of industrial waste which is

estimated at present at another 45 tons  per  day.

To  remove this, six more vehicles and 18 men  are

required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The removal of trade and industrial waste by

persons  carrying  on a trade  or  manufacture  is

provided for under the law. All factories  in  the

area  were  in  October 1968 served  with  notices

under  section  13  of  the  Environmental  Public

Health  Act, 1968, to cart their industrial  waste

for  disposal at the Choa Chu Kang refuse  dumping

ground.  The  charge  made for  the  use  of  this

dumping  ground was waived and the managements  of

factories do make use of this facility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning of industrial refuse, unless carried

out    in    properly   designed   and    approved

incinerators,  is a fire hazard and  causes  smoke

and  air  pollution in the area.  Action  will  be

taken against the management of the factories  for

creating such nuisance.

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7 of the Stamp Ordinance, as it now

reads,  permits the use of impressed  or  adhesive

stamps  for  the  payment  of  duties.  The   term

"adhesive stamps" includes both postal stamps  and

revenue  stamps of higher values. In other  words,

under the law as it now stands, postal stamps  can

be used for the payment of duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of separate revenue stamps will assist

in  differentiating  between  postal  revenue  and

stamp  duty  revenue, and it has been  decided  to

introduce  revenue stamps as distinct from  postal

stamps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment which will come into force on such

date as the Minister may appoint will restrict the

payment  of duties to revenue stamps and impressed

stamps only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sufficient time will be given for the change-over.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before this House was drafted on

the   recommendation  of  the  Chief  Justice   in

consultation with the Attorney-General.  The  Bill

fuses  the  jurisdictions of the lower  courts  in

respect   of   civil  and  criminal  matters.   It

provides, inter alia, for both civil and  criminal

jurisdictions to be exercised not only by District

Courts  but also by Magistrates' Courts. We  shall

thus  no longer have the separation between  Civil

District  Courts and Criminal District  Courts  as

hitherto.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil jurisdiction of the District Court

will also be raised to $5,000 with powers to award

equitable remedies like an injunction or  specific

performance.  This  will  effectively  off-load  a

considerable  amount of work that  has  previously

been   dealt   with   in  the  High   Court.   The

jurisdiction  of the Civil District Court  is  now

$2,000,  and  the  court has  no  power  to  grant

equitable remedies. Any claim for more than $2,000

or  an action praying for equitable remedies  must

be  instituted  in the High Court. Care,  however,

has  been  taken to ensure that this  increase  in

jurisdiction will not deny a litigant the right to

pursue  his own claim without the aid of  counsel.

The  Civil District Court has always been regarded

as  "a  poor man's court" where he can pursue  his

claim with the aid of officials of the Court. With

the  increase  in  jurisdiction,  provisions  have

necessarily been made for the making of new  rules

of  procedure that would assist both  counsel  and

the  Court  in  arriving  at  a  fair  and  proper

decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Magistrates' Courts deal solely with

criminal matters. The Bill provides



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



for  Magistrates  to hear civil  cases  where  the

claim  or  the  value  of the  subject  matter  in

dispute does not exceed $1,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, which has also received the

consideration   of  the  legal  profession,   will

provide for more efficient administration  in  the

lower courts. A central Registry to deal with  all

administrative work will also be set up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new system will further enable our District

Judges  and  Magistrates to acquire a more  varied

experience, affording them opportunities to gain a

rounded  and  more  comprehensive  training.   The

structure  of  our  system  of  administration  of

justice  is  such that officers appointed  to  the

judicial and legal service may be called  upon  to

serve  in  capacities that would require  them  to

assume  the  role of prosecutor, legal adviser  to

Government1  as  well  as that  of  Magistrate  or

District Judge, according to the exigencies of the

service. An officer would, therefore, be given the

same  rounded experience both in the  criminal  as

well as in the civil fields of law, whether he  is

a  District Judge or Magistrate, in the  Attorney-General's   Chambers,   the  Official   Assignee's

Department or the Legal Aid Bureau.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also affords our subordinate courts

greater  powers to commit for contempt  of  court.

Provisions  relating to this are  set  out  in  no

uncertain  terms  so that those administering  the

law  will  have adequate powers and  authority  to

maintain at all times the dignity of the Courts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Departmental Titles (Alteration)

Ordinance,  (Chapter 55 of the Revised  Edition),

provides in section 2 for the substitution of new

departmental  titles  or  names  of  offices  for

and  in  section  3  for  the  amendment  of  the

Schedule  to  that  Ordinance  by  resolution  of

Parliament  for the purpose of giving legislative

effect to changes in such titles or names.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement of this House is therefore sought

by  the  title "Deputy Chief Chemist  and  Deputy

Chief Inspector of Dangerous Materials".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passing of this motion will mean that

wherever in any written law or in any document of

<br><br><i>Research Officer, Publicity Division</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Publicity Division of the Ministry of

Culture has one post of Research Officer,  who  is

in  charge  of the Research Unit of the  Publicity

Division.  The  duties  of  this  officer  are  to

gather,  collate, catalogue and index  information

from    newspapers,    periodicals    and    other

publications,  reference and source  materials  on

political  and public events, economic and  social

history  and  other related subjects  relevant  to

current  affairs, for the publications  issued  by

the Publicity Division and for the general use  of

this Division.



<br><br><i>Research Officer, Broadcasting Division</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The `Research Officer' is in charge of the

Research Unit which works in conjunction with  the

Newsroom and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>



Central  Productions Unit of Radio & TV Singapore.

All  these three units comprise the News  Division

of the Broadcasting Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Research Unit is essentially a news

information  unit and maintains  a  modest  quick-reference library as well as a collection of  news

clippings. It indexes a variety of periodicals  on

current  affairs, and classifies and  files  items

from  local and overseas newspapers, and  the  RTS

news  bulletins. It also keeps the scripts of some

radio  and  television programmes.  The  Unit  has

started  a  collection  of photographs  and  other

illustrations  which  may  be  required   for   TV

programme productions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Research Officer is also responsible for the

transcription  of important speeches,  interviews,

press  conferences,  talks  and  forums  (in  both

English and Chinese) recorded by RTS. In addition,

he  collects and collates information required for

the   production  of  some  radio  and  television

programmes, such as `Breakfast Bulletin' and `It's

Happening  in  Singapore'.  Lastly,  the  Research

Officer  acts as the departmental liaison  officer

in connection with current publicity campaigns.
