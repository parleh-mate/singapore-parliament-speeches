<div align="center"><b>(Deferment and Part-time)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister of

Defence  how many applications were made  (i)  for

deferment;   and   (ii)  for  part-time   National

Service,  during  the year ending  28th  February,

1973; how many applications were approved; and how

many  applications were rejected and  the  reasons

therefor.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phua Bah Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Defence (Mr Phua Bah Lee) (for the Minister of Defence):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, between 1st March,

1972,  and  28th February, 1973, 878  applications

were  received for exemption/deferment from  full-time  National Service. Of this number,  146  were

applications   for   deferment   and   732    were

applications  for part-time National Service.  The

decisions in respect of these applications were as

follows:-



<pre>

     Number granted part-time service    394

     Number granted deferment            117

                                         ---

     Total appeals granted               511

     Number not approved                 326

     Number being investigated            41

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications are considered on the following

grounds:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Whether call-up for full-time National Service will result in financial hardship for the family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Whether it will result in the disintegration

of a business enterprise.



<br><br>These  applications are referred  to  an  Advisory

Board  consisting  of  prominent  members  of  the

public  (including businessmen and  senior  public

servants)  and  senior  military  officers.  Those

applications  in  which  these  grounds  are   not

satisfied are rejected.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

could  the  Parliamentary Secretary please  inform

the  House



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>

whether all applications are, in  fact, referred to the Advisory Board?



<br><br><!-- Mr Phua Bah Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phua Bah Lee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when

applications   for  deferment  or  for   part-time

service are received at the Central Manpower Base,

they  are  examined to see what grounds have  been

given. If they conform to the grounds which I have

stated  earlier,  such  as financial  hardship  or

disintegration of a business, the applications are

referred  to the Advisory Board for consideration.

This  Advisory Board will then review such  cases,

and  their  recommendations are submitted  to  the

Director   of   Manpower.  Each  application   is,

therefore, considered on its own merits.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Communications, since the wearing of crash helmets

by   motor  cyclists  and  scooterists  was   made

compulsory,  how many such persons  have  died  in

road accidents.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr Ang Kok Peng) (for the Minister for Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, compulsory wearing of crash

helmets  was implemented in three stages.  In  the

first   stage,   only  those  applying   for   new

provisional licences for motor-cycles and scooters

were  required to wear crash helmets  with  effect

from  1st  November, 1969. The second  stage  came

into  effect  from 1st February,  1970,  when  all

provisional  licence holders for motor-cycles  and

scooters  were required to wear crash helmets.  It

was  only  in  the third stage, from 1st  January, 1971,  that  all  motor-cyclists, scooterists  and pillion-riders  were  required   to   wear   crash helmets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1970, there were 118 fatal accidents involving

motor-cyclists  and  scooterists.  There  were  77

fatal  cases in 1971, and 73 fatal cases in  1972.

This represents a decrease of 35 per cent in fatal

cases  in 1971, and a decrease of 38 per  cent  in 1972,  when  compared  with the  number  of  fatal accidents involving motor-cyclists



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>

and scooterists in 1970, when "L"  riders were required to wear crash helmets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1501 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently the Government has initiated some

very   welcome  measures  by  revising  the  leave

eligibility  of civil servants and by  introducing

realistic  incentives for top civil servants.  The

much  publicised  reason for the  introduction  of

these measures is to make the terms and conditions

of  service  in the public sector comparable  with

those  prevailing in the private sector.  However,

the Government has made it known that employees in

the  Education service are to be excluded from the

benefits   of   the   various   schemes   recently

introduced  by  the Government to attract  and  to

retain  the  best  in the public  service.  In  so

doing,   the  Government  has,  in  fact,  created

further  anomalies in the terms and conditions  of

service for different groups of employees  in  the

public  sector  and  has,  therefore,  effectively

nullified  all its past attempts to establish  the

principles   of  fair  comparison   and   internal

relativity  within  the  public  service   as   an

objective  basis  in  determining  the  terms  and

conditions of work in the public service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now refer the Education

Minister  to  the recent scheme of the  Government

whereby  a  monthly allowance is  to  be  paid  to

employees  in  the public service as  compensation

for  the  reduction  of  their  annual  leave  and

medical leave eligibility. Such a realistic scheme

is much to be welcomed, except



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>



that   the   Government  has  declared  that   all

employees  in  the  Education service  are  to  be

excluded from the scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the revised scheme, in respect of medical

leave  eligibility, all public  officers  can  opt

either  for  the maximum medical leave eligibility

under   the   old  scheme  without  any   monetary

allowance, or for a reduced leave eligibility plus

a  monetary allowance equivalent to ten days' pay.

The  full  medical leave eligibility is a  nominal

benefit of which a very small proportion of public

employees  have availed themselves  to  the  whole

extent.  As  far as possible, they  prefer  to  be

spared  the  circumstances whereby  they  have  to

utilise any portion of their hospitalisation leave eligibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the revised scheme, therefore, those public

officers  who normally do not fully utilise  their

leave  eligibility will, by opting to  participate

in  the  scheme, gain by converting their  surplus

portion   of   leave  eligibility,  which   is   a

contingent  interest, into  an  entitlement  of  a

monetary  allowance equivalent to ten  days'  pay.

The   exclusion   of   education   officers   from

participation under the scheme in respect  of  the

conversion  of  surplus medical leave  eligibility

into  a  monetary allowance results in a  positive

disadvantage  to education officers in  comparison

with  their  colleagues in the administrative  and executive services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the abovementioned scheme, the

decision of the Government to exclude officers  in

the Education service from the scheme seems to  be

based  on  an  oversight. While  officers  in  the

Education  service  generally  do  not  enjoy  any

annual  leave eligibility, they do have  the  same

medical  leave eligibility as their colleagues  in

the  administrative and executive services of  the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view, therefore, that all officers in

the Education service, whether performing teaching

or  administrative duties, should be  accorded  an

opportunity  to  opt for a payment  of  a  special

monthly  allowance  in lieu of a  greater  medical leave eligibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the revised scheme on annual leave eligibility, the decision of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>



the Government to exclude persons in the Education

service  seems to be based on the assumption  that

all  persons  in  the Education  service  have  no

annual  leave eligibility and that, as such,  they

cannot opt for any reduction in their annual leave

eligibility  to  qualify for the  special  monthly

allowance.  I  agree that such  an  assumption  is

accurate  and  justifiable  in  respect   of   the

majority of the persons in the education service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, a minority of persons in the

Education   service  who  are  attached   to   the

Headquarters  in  the Ministry of Education.  Such

education officers have the same hours of work and

similar   annual   leave  eligibility   as   their

colleagues  who are in the administrative  or  the

executive  service. I am of the  view  that  these

education  officers  who are  accorded  an  annual

leave    eligibility   by    reason    of    their

administrative  or  special  functions  should  be

permitted  to opt for a special monthly  allowance

in   consideration  for  a  reduced  annual  leave

eligibility under the scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While an objection may be raised against the

inclusion  of such officers in the scheme  on  the

ground  that postings to the Headquarters  of  the

Ministry are not of a permanent duration and  that

the  officers  so posted may sooner  or  later  be

transferred back to teaching duties in schools, in

practice the possibility of officers who have been

assigned  administrative or special  duties  being

transferred  back  to  teaching  duties,  is  very

remote. Even if I concede that such transfers  may

and  do  take place, there is no reason  that  the

officers  so affected cannot be accorded  whatever

special monthly allowance may be payable under the

scheme for so long as they are required to perform

administrative or special functions and to observe

the   same   working  hours  and   other   working

conditions  as  their  office  colleagues  in  the

administrative or executive service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now refer the Education Minister to the

Ministerial   Statement  of  his  colleague,   the

Finance  Minister, on 16th February, 1973 in  this

House  in  which he stated that a Merit  Increment

Scheme  for civil servants will be introduced  and

that the upper timescale will be revised



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>



from $l,700x50-1,850 to $l,700x100-2,000.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Education service structure, there are

nine  salary scales, the highest of which  is  the

scale of $1,700x50-1,850. A teacher who starts  at

the  bottom of the Education service will have  to

secure eight promotions before he can expect to be

placed on this scale. This scale is identical  and

corresponds  to the upper timescale.  It  is  only

logical that revision of the upper timescale  must

result in the revision of this scale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of a Merit Increment Scheme by

Government is to retain and to attract the best in

the civil service. I am sure Members in this House

will agree with me that the need to retain and  to

attract the best in the Education service is  just

as  crucial and vital as the need to retain and to

attract  the  best  in the other  sectors  of  the

public service. Unless the Education Ministry  has

strong   objections  to  granting  increments   to

teachers, I urge the Government to reconsider  its

decision and not to create a "Cinderella"  out  of

the Education service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  recently  a  case  of  errors   in

translation was found among textbooks approved  by

the Ministry of Education. Moreover, some of these

books  were  edited in a haphazard  manner.  As  a

school  teacher,  I would like to  speak  on  this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to deal with the textbooks.

We  all  know  that irrespective of  the  teaching

method  adopted, the textbook remains one  of  the

main  tools  for teaching and imparting knowledge.

The   textbook  is  a  medium  for  teaching   and

learning.  If  a textbook is full of  errors,  the

teacher  will  have to spend a  lot  of  his  time

reading  other  books to supplement  the  material

contained  in the main textbook. And if  it  is  a

textbook edited in a haphazard manner, the teacher

will also have to spend a lot of his time teaching

without the use of the textbook.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent case, we found many translation

errors in a textbook. The teacher had to waste his

time correcting these errors. At the same time, it

demoralises  the  teacher  and  the  pupils.  Some

confusion  and misunderstanding must  result  from

these  translation errors. Sir, these errors  have

caused untold damage and irreparable harm. To  the

younger  generation,  the  textbook  is   a   very

important  medium of knowledge and we  should  pay

serious attention to this matter. On discovery  of

these   translation  errors,   the   Ministry   of

Education immediately announced that it would take

immediate measures to prevent a recurrence of such errors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last few years we have spent large

sums  of  money  on education. The expenditure  on

Education  is  second only to Defence.  Therefore,

why is it that the Ministry of Education has still

not  established  a committee for the  translation

and  editing  of textbooks? As an educationist,  I

hope that the Ministry of Education will look into

this  matter. Of course, what's done is done.  But

it is better late than never. I think the Ministry

should   consider   setting  up   an   independent

committee on textbooks, so that it will absorb the

present  employees and staff of the  Ministry  who

are  responsible for the publication of textbooks.

At the same time, people with specialist knowledge

and  wide teaching experience can come forward  to

assist  this  committee. This  committee  can,  in

addition to editing the textbooks for the  primary

and   secondary  schools,  also  review  all   the

textbooks  currently in use in  the  schools.  The

purpose of the review is to ensure that there  are

no  further  cases of errors and also to  make  an

improvement to the textbook, if necessary. We know

that  the  contents if textbooks will  affect  the

spirit  and attitude of both the teacher  and  the

pupils,  and  the wrong textbooks  will  therefore

lead to confusion and misunderstanding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this juncture, I would also like to raise

a  few other points, one of which is in regard  to

the  administration of the Ministry of  Education.

Although



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>



the Ministry is in charge of education in the four

language   streams,   95   per   cent    of    the

correspondence  from the Ministry  is  written  in

English.   I  am  not  raising  the  question   of

language. The Government has laid down the  policy

of  multi-lingualism. Why is it that the  Ministry

of Education, which has so many talented officers,

cannot translate official correspondence into  the

other  official  languages?  Of  course,  if   the

correspondence is addressed to English schools  it

is  quite  logical  and  understandable.  But  the

question  is this. When correspondence in  English

is  addressed to schools which do not use  English

as  the medium of instruction, then time is wasted

by  the  school  staff  in  understanding  it  and

getting it translated. I trust, Sir, that from now

on  the Ministry will be able to use all the  four

official languages in its correspondence  and  its

circulars  to  all  schools in the  four  language

streams.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the debate on the President's

Address, I had spoken about the retirement age  of

teachers  in  Government-aided  schools.  At  that

time,  perhaps the Minister for Education was  not

present.  But up to now, I have still not received

any reply. Now that the Minister is present, I  do

not  know  whether he has looked up  the  relevant

copy of the Hansard on this matter so that he  can

give me a reply. If he has not, may I be permitted

to  repeat what I said on that occasion, i.e, that

all  Government-aided school  teachers  should  be

given  the opportunity to retire at the age of  60

years.  I  hope the Minister will now  give  me  a

reply one way or the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another point is in respect of

schools  in the rural areas. Some of them  are  so

small  that they do not even have a school  clerk.

Sometimes  the principal himself has to teach  and

to  do the administrative and clerical work. I  do

not  understand why the Ministry cannot provide  a

clerk for a small rural school, which has the same

amount   of  administrative  work  as  the  larger

schools. Up to now I have not received any  reply.

I hope the Minister will be able to give me a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>



reply.  I also hope that by tomorrow these schools will be provided with clerks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to touch on the question of

medical  benefits for teachers in Government-aided

schools.  By doing so, I am not saying  that  they

are not contented. We are most grateful indeed  to

the  Ministry  for  giving  us  the  same  medical

benefits as the Government teachers. But there  is

still some difference to a certain extent. In  the

case   of   Government   teachers,   after   their

retirement,  they will continue to  enjoy  medical

benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the teachers in Government-aided schools do

not   qualify  for  free  medical  benefits  after

retirement.   What   is  the   reason   for   this

difference?  Both  are doing  the  same  work  and

living  in  the same country. This is not  to  say

that  the  teachers  in  aided  schools  are   not

contented  with what have been accorded  to  them.

While a young man, he is strong and healthy and is

not  likely to suffer from any illness. It is only

on  occasions  that he might have  minor  ailments

like  a  cold or flu. But when he is old,  he  may

have health problems. Many Government-aided school

teachers  suffer from ill-health after retirement.

The  older they are, the more troubles they  have.

These  old people, who have devoted 20 to 30 years

of  their  lives in the Education service  of  the

country  suffer  a poor fate after  retirement.  I

hope    that    the   Minister   concerned    will

sympathetically consider the plight of the  aided-school teachers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tay, I have allowed you more

than 10 minutes. When are you going to finish your

speech?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too:</b> Sir, I have

already finished. (in Mandarin) The main point  is

that after he passes away, the medical benefit  is

withdrawn!



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, over the past few years the Ministry

of Education seems to be very busy taking note



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>



of  the  ages of old teachers in Singapore.  Those

teachers who have reached the age of 40 years  and

50  years or more have to report their ages to the

Ministry of Education. It is as if the Ministry of

Education  is  afraid that they will  stay  on  to

teach for one day more than is necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many applications from the

retired  teachers for extension of  service.  Some

applications have been granted on a three-month or

six-month basis, and only a very fortunate few are

granted  an  extension of one year. Unfortunately,

some  teachers are only allowed to get 80 per cent

of  their  last drawn pay when they are  so-called

"re-employed".  I think this is a bit  ridiculous.

Since  we  allow  these teachers to  extend  their

services,  that  means we consider their  services

useful, valid and effective. Since they are useful

and effective teachers, why should their salary be

reduced by 20 per cent? To an old teacher who  has

dedicated his whole life to education, this  is  a

great  blow to him morally. Unlike people in other

professions,  teachers  start  their  professional

work  at  a late age because of their professional

training. These teachers are brain workers. But if

they  are forced to retire at the age of 50 which,

according  to  experts, is the maturity  age,  and

this  also is the important stage of the teachers'

career, then this will not only be a great loss to

the  teachers themselves but also a  loss  to  the

country.  It  is  my hope that the  Minister  will

sympathetically  consider  the  applications  from

teachers for extension of service, and that on re-employment their salaries should not be reduced by 20 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar has brought up the

question of textbooks, and I would like to add  my

views to what he has said. There has been quite  a

lot  of  criticisms  against  textbooks  published

locally.  While  we here are not concerned  as  to

whether this is the result of some overt or covert

rivalry  between publishers in the private sector,

such criticisms have brought into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>



the  open the defect in the present review  system

of   textbooks.  Sir,  textbooks  are  not  to  be

regarded  as  bibles. However, there is  no  doubt

that they form the basis of teaching and learning.

Therefore, if there are any defects in them,  they

will be very unreliable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully endorse that there should be freedom of

publication,  because  if  there  is  freedom   of

publication  there  will be  competition,  and  if

there  is  competition there will be  improvement.

But  this should not be taken haphazardly or  done

in  a  very irresponsible manner, particularly  in

regard  to textbooks for schools. I would like  to

take  this  opportunity therefore to propose  that

henceforth book publishers or book-shops should be

asked  to  set  up a textbook editorial  committee

with  such members to be approved by the  Ministry

of   Education.  In  this  way,  we  can   prevent

publishers  or bookshops from getting anyone  they

choose within a short time. Next, the Ministry  of

Education   should  also  set   up   a   committee

consisting of experts in their own field, such  as

specialist inspectors and representatives from the

various teachers' associations. We cannot continue

with  the  present system of giving  $50  to  each

textbook  reviewer  and  expect  good  result.  In

fairness, we should also ensure that adequate time

is given to the compilers or editors of textbooks.

We  cannot  expect these people  to  produce  good

textbooks within six months of the publication  of

the   syllabuses,  because  the   publication   of

textbooks involves not only editing, printing, but

also  research.  So  we cannot  rush  out  a  good

textbook in any case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally I would like to suggest to the Minister

that prices of textbooks should be rationalised so

that  there  would  be  no undue  profiteering  by

publishers and bookshops.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

abolition  of  history and geography from  Primary

VII  exanimations has been a very wise move on the

part  of this Ministry. The increase in the number

of  passes in Primary VI is a clear indication  of

the wisdom of this move. As a result of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>



the  large  number  of passes, we  have  a  unique

system  introduced in secondary schools.  We  have

such a thing as "floating" classes. Literally they

are  floating,  for  the  students  have  no  firm

classroom which they can claim as their  own,  and

as  a  result  we have a class of pupils  who  are

without a permanent place in the school. I  wonder

how long these "floating" classes will go on. What

we  need  urgently are extensions  to  accommodate

more classes, and this is not an impossible task.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I brought the attention of the

Minister  to the sad state of affairs of Secondary

I and II students. Not only have they got to learn

11  compulsory examination subjects, but they also

have  to  go for workshop practices twice  weekly,

and  for extra-curricular activities two or  three

times  a week. How on earth can these young  minds

cope with this enormous work-load?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the removal of history and geography from

Primary  VI  examinations  has  concretely  proved

better  results,  would it not  also  be  wise  to

remove history and geography from examinations  in

Secondary I and II? This will lighten their load a

great deal, and probably we may eventually be able

to  produce better results in Secondary IV and HSC

levels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Education Ministry's policy regarding

transfers?  I  thought the  policy  is  to  reduce

transfers  to  the  minimum.  Yet  we  still  find

teachers  being transferred within 24  hours.  How

can teachers in Government schools be expected  to

be fully loyal to the school, if they realise that

they  can  be  transferred within 24 hours  merely

upon  a  telephone  call?  Is  this  the  way  the

Ministry  runs  its  establishment?  Has   it   no

consideration  for  the  teachers?  Or  have   the

officers working in air-conditioned comfort become

so  inhumane,  as  to think of  teachers  as  mere

digits in their files? I urge the Minister to give

more  valued  consideration  to  the  transfer  of

teachers against their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>



wishes,  and to consider the human aspect  of  the

action  more  than just filling in the  gap  in  a

staffing list.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are teachers made to do two compulsory extra-curricular activities, one of which must be a

sports  activity? Why not confine it to  one,  but

let  the  number  of  hours  remain  unchanged?  A

teacher  who  specialises  in  a  particular  game

cannot  give his full attention if half his extra-curricular  activities' time is taken  by  another

activity  in which he has no interest.  We  should

encourage  specialisation  in  activities,  rather

than  discourage it, especially in  the  secondary

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently there was a promotion exercise for the

teachers  and others connected with the  Education

service.  Though this exercise was held  after  an

unusual  delay, the promoting body has not decided

on  the  persons to be promoted. There has been  a

lot  of  talk about the exercise in the newspapers

as well as in public. Can the Minister explain why

such  a situation had arisen? It appears that most

of  the  principals, being human  and  some  being

inhuman,  may  have  made gross  mistakes  in  the

assessment of their teachers. It is my  view  that

some  solution  must be found, otherwise  we  will

have a very unhappy lot of teachers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, with your permission can I speak  on

amendment (2)* now?

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendment, standing in the name of Mr Teong  Eng Siong, reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 1501 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1002.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right, Mr Teong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I have heard

several  comments  from  my  colleagues.   So   in

fairness  to  the Ministry of Education,  I  would

like  to  say something. It cannot be denied  that

over  the  past few years there has been  a  great

achievement  in  education in Singapore.  The  sum

allotted to the Ministry of Education for  1973-74

comes to about $300 million, both for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>



the Main and the Development Estimates. This is to

ensure  that there is an all-round development  in

the  four  language streams and that  all  school-going  children will have good teaching and proper education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilingual education is a very realistic and

practical  approach to a multi-lingual society  in

Singapore.  This  is a system  which  gives  equal

treatment to the various language streams. What is

more  important  is  that under  this  system  our

students  will  become good and  rugged  citizens.

These  are the main objectives of education  which

cannot   be  denied,  but  the  problem   is   the

administrative   officers  in  the   Ministry   of

Education  headquarters and the administration  in

the  schools.  Are  they capable  of  implementing

these objectives effectively? I have received some

complaints from both teachers and parents on  this

matter.  These  complaints and criticisms  can  be

classified into four categories:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Bilingualism, in principle, is not wrong but

in  practice, more often than not we  come  across

difficulties in its implementation. This is due to

the lack of teachers. As a result of this shortage

of  qualified teachers, it is difficult  to  raise

the  standard  of  bilingualism, particularly  the

second  language. Students in the  Chinese  stream

find  it  difficult  to  follow  the  teaching  of

science   and   mathematics,  for  which   English

textbooks are used. That is one of the reasons why

bilingualism cannot be effectively implemented. So

I  would  like the Minister for Education to  look

into   this  problem  of  sufficiency  of   second

language teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The shortage of physical education teachers.

We  are concentrating our efforts and attention on

extramural activities in the schools, but in  many

cases  there  is  a  shortage of  PE  teachers  in

schools.  This  shortage  affects  the  extramural

activities,  and it also means that  teachers  who

are  not  interested  or not trained  in  physical

education are dragged in to be involved  in  extra

physical  education activities. As a  result,  the

standard of physical education does not reach  the

level expected. So I would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>



like  the Minister to consider the possibility  of

opening  holiday-classes for teachers in  physical

education,  both  in terms of technique,  practice

and  theory.  This  may  go  a  long  way  towards

alleviating the shortage of PE teachers.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The shortage of full-time teachers. I said

just  now  that  there  is a  shortage  of  second

language teachers and PE teachers. There is also a

shortage  of full-time teachers. What has happened

here?  According to people involved in  education,

there is still a good number of relief teachers in

our  schools.  Some of these relief teachers  have

been  teaching  for more than 10 years,  but  they

still   remain  relief  teachers.  They  are   not

promoted to the status of full-time teachers. As a

result  of this, the relief teachers are not  able

to  concentrate and dedicate themselves  to  their

work.  They just adopt the attitude of `work today

for life today', because they are relief teachers.

I  think  the  senior assistants  in  the  various

schools understand this problem best because  they

have to deal with these relief teachers. There  is

the Teachers' Training College. Why cannot we make

use  of  the Teachers' Training College to produce

more  qualified  teachers? The  next  question  is

this.  Since a relief teacher is allowed to  teach

for  10  years  or  more, cannot consideration  be

given  to  convert  them into  ordinary  full-time

teachers,  so that they will be able  to  dedicate

themselves  to  teaching  without  worrying  about

their tenure of office?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Sir, we come to the question of teacher-pupil

relationship. There seems to be a barrier  between

teachers  and  students  in  Singapore.  That   is

probably because students and teachers spend  only

half  a  day  together in schools. There  is  very

little  time for them to mix around in a  half-day

session.  Steps should be taken to promote  better

relationship  among teachers, pupils and  parents,

particularly at the present juncture when  we  are

faced  with  the  problem of some students  taking

drugs. We cannot blame the schools alone for this,

because there is just not enough



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>



time for students and teachers to get together. So

the  society and the Ministry of Education  should

partly shoulder the blame. I believe that if there

is closer and better relationship between teachers

and students, a lot of problems can be solved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Sir, we come to the number of pupils for each

class.  In my view, for a teacher to be in  charge

of  40 pupils per class is too great a task. Since

there  is  an improvement in our economy,  perhaps

the  Ministry of Education can consider recruiting

more  teachers  in order to reduce the  number  of

students  per  class.  I  am  sure  many   of   my

colleagues here in this House will support  me  on

this.  With a reduced number of pupils per  class,

the  teacher will be able to teach better and give

more  individual attention to the students. I hope

the  Minister will consider this, and ask for more

funds to be allocated for the next financial  year

to recruit more teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) We come to the promotion of teachers. This

has  been widely publicised recently, and it gives

encouragement  to  the  teachers.  The   promotion

prospects  for  teachers will be an incentive  for

them  to work harder and with stronger dedication.

But there has been also dissatisfaction.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong, your 10 minutes are up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I only need 10 seconds more.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Lastly, Sir, I

would like the Minister to consider setting up  an

HSC  class  for  Sembawang High School  or  in  my

constituency. There are three secondary schools in

my  constituency, but there is not a single school

running HSC classes. So my constituents will  have

to  go  out  of  my  constituency  to  attend  HSC

classes.  I think the setting up of at  least  one

HSC  class  is  justified  because  there  are  at

present    three   secondary   schools    in    my constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> rose -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, the Minister has not replied to whatever points you have raised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Sir, since the Members for Anson

and  Sembawang  have touched on  the  question  of

promotion, may I be permitted to express my  views

on this point?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, carry on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  implementation of education policies and  the

achievement  of its objectives depend  to  a  very

great extent on the efforts of teachers. To ensure

that  there  is no brain drain from the  Education

service  to  the  private sector,  the  Government

decided   to  hold  negotiations  with   teachers'

organisations  two years ago on the  restructuring

of  salary scales and improvement of conditions of

service.  As  a  result of such  negotiations,  an

agreement  was  reached. This agreement,  however,

does  not  give, and will not give,  teachers  any

immediate benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the terms of the agreement was the

promotion prospects for teachers. This, of course,

is  a  source of encouragement for teachers.  But,

Sir,  the  recent  promotion  exercise,  in  which

interviews have been held, has caused a lot of new

problems. This has also exposed the defects of the

present  promotion system. The basis for promotion

is  that  a teacher, in addition to being good  in

teaching, should also be good in other activities,

such  as extracurricular activities in school  and

community  service outside the school.  He  should

set  a  good example in extracurricular activities

and  community service. In other words, a  teacher

does not belong to the school alone. He belongs to

the society and the country. He should not only be

a  teacher  of  pupils but, in time  of  need,  he

should  be  able to make his contribution  to  the

country  and  the society. So a good  teacher,  by

this  definition,  would be  an  activist,  and  a

creative  educator  of  man.  But  what  are   the

prospects of promotion? Under the present  system,

all  teachers with five years' teaching experience

are allowed to put in their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>



applications. Of course, this is quite democratic.

But anomalies have arisen out of this system. As a

result   of   such  anomalies,  there   has   been

widespread dissatisfaction, which is caused by the

fact  that  applications must  be  accompanied  by

confidential  reports put up  by  the  principals.

These  reports  become  the  prerequisite  for  an

interview for promotions, and undue importance has

been given to such confidential reports. And those

teachers,  who  were  not  even  shortlisted   for

interviews,  have  blamed the principals  for  not

putting up proper reports. As a result, there  has

been some misunderstanding and dissatisfaction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that some senior assistants

have   not   been  selected  or  shortlisted   for

interviews. On the contrary, some junior  teachers

have  been  shortlisted.  This  is  a  source   of

embarrassment  to  the senior assistants.  In  the

earlier  days,  senior assistants  were  appointed

because of their outstanding performance. But  now

they  are  not even given a chance to  go  for  an

interview in the promotion exercise. Sir, although

it is a good policy to promote teachers or to give

them  opportunities for promotion,  teachers  have

been demoralised because of the present system  of

promotion. I hope the Minister concerned will look

into the matter, and remedy the situation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Lee, I will extend the

guillotine time for you because there are so  many

questions to be answered.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Thank you, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I take the question of the

promotion exercise first? This was already  raised

by  the  Member  for Jurong in the debate  on  the

financial  policy of this Government,  and  he  is

bringing  it  up  again  today.  This  topic   has

attracted  a lot of interest. There is  a  lot  of

publicity given by the press and a large number of

anonymous letters have been received. I am  afraid

the most important consideration of a good teacher

is  his ability to teach, and short-listing has to

depend on that. His ECA



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>



and community service activities, however, will be

taken  into consideration in the actual  promotion

exercise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one common misconception about the mechanics

of  the  present promotion exercise  is  that  the

shortlisting of candidates was done by a computer,

the  implication being that the assessment of  the

candidate  was  left  to a  machine.  This,  I  am

afraid, is being alleged by the Member for  Jurong

during the debate on the financial policy. This is

not  so.  Assessment in every case was made  by  a

reporting officer and checked by a counter-signing

officer  who could, if he thought fit, change  the

grading given by the reporting officer. Apart from

the confidential report prepared for the promotion

exercise,  the confidential reports  for  the  two

previous  years are also taken into consideration,

making  three  confidential reports  in  all.  The

computer part of the exercise was merely  to  work

out  the  final grading awarded, and to  list  the

candidates  in order of merit for the  purpose  of

short-listing.  In other words, the  computer  did

not pass judgment on anyone. It merely performed a

mechanical  task  which would have  taken  a  much

longer time if it was carried out manually.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, admittedly human judgment is not infallible.

However,  every  effort has been  made  to  ensure

uniformity and objectivity in assessing the  merit

of  candidates by comparing them with their peers.

For  this purpose, a new confidential report  form

was  devised  with  the expert assistance  of  the

Public Service Commission, the Management Services

Unit  of the Ministry of Finance, and the Research

Unit   of  this  Ministry.  Detailed  notes   were

prepared  and  issued  to all reporting  officers,

explaining  the various qualities  expected  of  a

candidate  and the system of grading to  be  used.

Both the confidential report form and the notes to

the  reporting officers were subjected to  various

tests  and amended several times before they  were

finalised. The Member for Jurong may be pleased to

know that the whole process of developing this new

confidential report took us more than six months.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another common complaint is that some

teachers  who were reported on by their principals

were  shortlisted  for the interview  whereas  the

principals  themselves were not  shortlisted.  The

argument  behind this criticism seems to  be  that

those  who  are good enough to report  on  someone

else,  must themselves be better than the officers

they  are  reporting on, and therefore  should  be

shortlisted.  If we pursue this, argument  to  its

logical  conclusion,  then every  teacher,  except

those  at  the  lowest grade, that  is,  Education

Officers   in  Group  III,  would   have   to   be

shortlisted.  I  am  afraid  this   is   not   the

intention.  The restructured scheme  is  aimed  to

provide  greater promotion prospects for  everyone

in  the  teaching service. The criticisms  clearly

indicate  that  the  complainants  do  not   fully

understand  the  basic philosophy  underlying  the

restructured Education service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One fundamental feature of this new restructured

scheme is that promotion is no longer awarded to a

post  but  to  a grade, so that a teacher  can  be

promoted  and  still  remain a  teacher.  It  also

follows  that a teacher may be promoted whereas  a

principal may not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of rewarding an officer according

to   his  own  merit  and  not  according  to  the

functions  he performs is a rather new concept  in

the   public  service.  This  feature  was   fully

publicised  in  October 1971  when  agreement  was

finally  reached  after  a  year  of  negotiations

between   the  Ministry  of  Education   and   the

Singapore  Teachers'  Unions.  At  that  time   no

criticism   was  levelled  against   either   this

principle  or the new Education service structure.

For one and a half years not a single criticism or

comment   has  been  received  by  the   Education

Ministry, or by the Singapore Teachers' Unions for

that matter, on the principle underlying this  new

structure.  It is only now when the  teachers  are

being called up for interview that criticisms have

emerged, including the anonymous letters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in any promotion exercise, it is inevitable

that those who are unsuccessful



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>



will  be  disappointed.  In  this  particular

promotion exercise, being the first one under  the

new structure based on the new principle, it is to

be  expected that even more than the usual  number

of   disgruntled  candidates  will   voice   their

misgivings.  I  am not saying that the  system  is

perfect. My Ministry will continue to improve  the

procedure,  and  any constructive suggestions  for

future  promotion exercise will be most  welcomed.

But  to  those who are disappointed in the current

exercise,   let  me  assure  them  that  promotion

exercises will be carried out regularly in  future

as  spelt  out in the agreement with the Singapore

Teachers'  Unions. Let me also point out  that  in

the  past  an average of 30 officers were promoted

every  year.  It is to be expected  that  in  this

current promotion exercise, the opportunities  for

promotion will increase more than ten-fold.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to correct the statement

made  by  the Member for Jurong during the  debate

last  week,  and  that  is, there  was  a  massive

resignation  of  teachers  as  a  result  of  this

promotion  exercise. I am afraid that he  has  got

his   facts  wrong.  Only  32  resignations   were

received after the teachers had been called up for

interview.  Although this figure is slightly  more

than that for the corresponding period in 1971 and

1972,  which  is  28  and 21 respectively,  it  is

relevant  to note that more than half of them  are

still  under  probation. Therefore, the  promotion

exercise has nothing to do with their resignation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another popular issue under

discussion  currently is the review of  textbooks.

Arising   from  the  recent  incident   concerning

certain  history  textbooks, which  has  generated

considerable interest, perhaps it is relevant  for

me  to  explain  how the machinery works.  When  a

publisher wishes to have his textbook accepted  by

the  Ministry of Education for use in the schools,

he  has  to  submit  a draft to the  Ministry  for

review. The Ministry will then appoint a panel  of

three  reviewers.  The reviewers  are  experienced

members  of  the teaching service, either  in  the

schools or in the institutions of higher learning.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>



We  will  have to keep their identity  secret  for

fear  that  they  may be unduly  influenced.  This

system  of  review was introduced in  August  1970

after  a series of negotiations with the Singapore

Educational  Publication Council. In the  past  we

had our Specialist Inspectors to do the reviewing.

But  unfortunately, this system did not work  very

well   because  there  were  lots  of  allegations

against  certain  Specialist Inspectors  who  were

book-writers themselves. We are now working out  a

more   stringent  system  for  the  reviewing   of

textbooks.  The Member can rest assured  that  the

incident  which  came to light recently  will  not

occur  again. The Ministry will welcome any  views

and suggestions from the teachers on the textbooks

which they use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar raised a number of

questions  on  the  retirement  of  teachers,   in

particular, the difference in retirement  ages  of

55  and  60 years. The retirement age for teachers

and  all other civil servants is governed  by  the

Pensions   Ordinance,  1956,  under  which   those

officers  who were employed before 1st July,  1956

would  retire  at  55  years  of  age,  and  those

employed after that date would retire at 60  years

of  age.  This scheme is applicable to the  entire

public  service, and not to the Education  service

alone. I am afraid we cannot make an exception  to

the teaching service. However, it is the policy of

the  Ministry  to  encourage  good  and  dedicated

teachers  to  remain in the teaching service,  and

therefore  as  is  the practice in  the  past,  an

extension  of service is generally given  to  such

teachers.  Other  teachers whose  performance  has

been   found   to  be  satisfactory  are   usually

reemployed. The Member for Jurong will be  pleased

to  note  that, with immediate effect, in all  new

cases  of  re-employment they will be given  their

full  salary. Those who have been paid four-fifths

of  their last drawn salary will have their  cases

reviewed at the end of their re-employment  period

and, if they are found suitable, they will be paid

their full salary.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar also raised the

question  of  medical  benefits  for  aided-school

teachers  on  retirement. Again, I am  afraid  the

Member  for  Paya  Lebar thinks that  aided-school

teachers  are the only category of public officers

who  are  not  on Government pensionable  service.

This  is  not  so.  There are  thousands  of  such

officers employed by the various statutory bodies,

such  as  the Public Utilities Board, the Port  of

Singapore   Authority   and   the   Housing    and

Development  Board. These officers  and  those  in

Government  service who contribute to the  Central

Provident Fund are not entitled to medical benefit

after their retirement. This ruling is applied  to

all  officers in this category, and  not  just  to

school  teachers alone. The Member for Paya  Lebar

can  rest  assured  that retired school  teachers,

like all the others, are entitled to the excellent

medical service available to our citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also raised the question of correspondence

between the Education Ministry and the school.  He

alleged  that  95  per cent of the  circulars  and

correspondence between the Education Ministry  and

the  schools are written in English. Again,  I  am

afraid   that   he  has  got  his   facts   wrong.

Practically  all  circulars from the  Ministry  of

Education   are  written  in  the  four   official

languages. Most of the correspondence are  in  the

appropriate language of the school concerned.  The

Member for Paya Lebar will agree with me that  the

school  is perhaps the most appropriate  place  to

practise  and  implement our bilingual  policy.  I

think both principals and teachers must be able to

command  a  second language. Word  must  now  have

filtered  through  that in  the  recent  promotion

exercise considerable weight was given even  to  a

teacher's command of a second language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another question raised on school

clerks  for  the small rural school with  a  small

enrolment. Let me assure the Member for Paya Lebar

that  we are, in fact, actively looking into  this

matter. He is aware that a number of large  aided-schools  have more than their quota of clerks.  We

are looking into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>



the  feasibility of transferring the excess clerks

from  these  schools to the smaller rural  schools

which do not have a clerk at the moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson raised a number of

interesting  points, especially on  curriculum.  I

agree with him that at the moment the students are

overloaded.  In fact, it is the Ministry's  policy

to avoid overworking the students. But in order to

provide  an all-round education within the present

constraint of curriculum time, there is  only  one

way  out,  and  that  is, the integrated  teaching

approach. We are currently working on this system.

For  example,  a  few  similar  subjects  will  be

integrated into one, such as physics and chemistry

will be integrated into physical science; history,

geography  and  civics  will  be  integrated  into

social  study. At the present moment there  is  an

experiment  to integrate English, mathematics  and

science  into  a  single subject  in  the  primary

schools.  This may partly answer the query  raised

by  the Member for Sembawang. If he has the  time,

he  is  most welcomed to visit this school to  see

how the system works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also raised a number of

questions  on  extra-curricular  activities.   The

Ministry of Education attaches great importance to

ECA.  Pupils generally turn up once a week outside

school hours for ECA, and three hours for workshop

practice.  Only those who have been nominated  for

participation in special events, such as the Youth

Festival, the National Day Parade, etc., are asked

to  go  for practice occasionally. The Member  for

Anson  is  wrong  when  he  said  that  it  is   a

compulsory requirement for teachers to do two ECA,

although  I am aware that some of them  are  doing

so.  But  it is not compulsory. The allocation  of

ECA  responsibilities to teachers is made  by  the

principals   in  consultation  with   the   senior

assistant  and  the teachers concerned,  based  on

their  attitude and interest, so that  they  could

specialise in a particular activity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also passed some very interesting remarks on

"floating"  classes.  Sir,  the  introduction   of

"floating" classes in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>



January   this  year  was  necessitated   by   the

unexpectedly large number of students  who  passed

the  Primary School Leaving Examination last year.

I  have to disappoint him by saying that this  has

no  direct relevance to the withdrawal of  history

and  geography from the examination. There are  92

such  "floating" classes in about 58  schools,  an

average of two "floating" classes per school. This

system has been introduced in schools where  there

is   not  enough  ground  for  building  temporary

structures or where other means to accommodate the

students  have failed. As a temporary measure,  we

have  built  some  50  additional  classrooms  and

converted   another   50   special   rooms    into

classrooms,   in  addition  to  these   "floating"

classes.  As soon as we have built enough schools,

there will no longer be any "floating" classes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year I announced the change of exposure

time  for second language. As a result there is  a

massive transfer of teachers. This has to be  done

to meet this change of policy. In fact, the Member

for  Anson can expect another massive transfer  at

the  end of this year and next year so as to reach

the  target in 1975 whereby more than 40 per  cent

of  the curriculum time in primary schools will be

in  the  second language. Sir, in such a  transfer

exercise, school principals are generally asked to

submit the names of teachers who will be redundant

and,  therefore,  available for re-posting.  Under

this  arrangement,  certain  appeals  against  the

transfer  are sympathetically considered  and,  in

fact,  entertained. But it is not always  possible

to  accommodate  the wishes of  every  teacher  in

respect of the school of his choice. To do so will

result in chaos.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am afraid I am not aware of any case where

teachers  have  been transferred  by  a  telephone

call. If the Member for Anson is aware of any such

case,  please  let me know, and I will  definitely

look into the matter.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has raised a number of

questions. On the question of shortage of teachers

for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>



second  language in respect of the  implementation

of  our bilingual policy, as I mentioned just now,

the  way  to overcome this problem is to introduce

an  integrated teaching approach as has been  done

in  many  schools. And we will see the results  of

our work very soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also suggested that in view of the

shortage of physical education teachers, we should

run  more  in-service courses  during  the  school

vacation.  I  think this is a good idea.  We  will

look  into  his  suggestion, and implement  it  if

possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has quoted examples of relief teachers

who  have been doing relief teaching for 10  years

or  so.  I am afraid I am not aware of such cases,

and  I  would be most grateful if he could let  me

have more particulars. If the Member for Sembawang

knows of such cases, it is not only his duty as  a

Member  of Parliament but as a citizen to  let  mc

know instead of keeping us in the dark. Sir, I  am

afraid   that  the  use  of  relief  teachers   is

unavoidable. Relief teachers are used, as  I  have

said,  almost  every year to relieve  teachers  on

maternity leave and so on. Unless we can  do  away

with  maternity  leave and prevent  teachers  from

going  on  maternity leave, we still have  to  use

relief teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I could not disagree with the Member that

there must be greater rapport between teachers and

students. We are encouraging this by all means and

the ECA is one of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one point which I am afraid the

Member  seems to contradict himself. At  first  he

pointed  out that we have a shortage of  teachers,

and therefore we have to use relief teachers. Five

minutes  later he said that we should  reduce  the

number of students per class, which means that  we

require  more teachers. Sir, we would not be  able

to get the teachers, and we would not also he able

to  satisfy  the  Member for Anson  because  there

would   not  be  enough  classrooms.  Until   such

facilities are available, we will not be  able  to

do so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, notwithstanding the many good words the

Member  for Sembawang has said about the Ministry,

I  am  afraid  there  is  no  demand  for  a  pre-University class in Sembawang. We will  look  into

this when the need arises.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

has not answered my points.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, my apologies. The Member

for Moulmein has raised two points relating to the

eligibility of the teaching service in respect  of

the  conversion of leave eligibility into monetary

terms,  and the other the extension of  the  Merit

Increment  Scheme to the upper timescale  officers

in  the  teaching service. Sir, we are  taking  up

these  matters with the appropriate Ministry,  and

we hope to get a favourable reply soon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have two questions to ask the Minister. First, the

Minister has said that the implementation  of  our

bilingualism  policy  now  will  not   cause   any

difficulty. Therefore, when he says that there  is

no problem for the Chinese schools to use English,

I  hope he could also say the same for the use  of

Chinese in English schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that he has asked us to

promote  bilingualism.  But  I  recall  that   the

Chinese  teachers'  union asked  the  Ministry  of

Education  to  make  available more  teachers  and

facilities  to help its members learn  the  second

language,  and  so  far it has  not  received  any

reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am quite

satisfied  with the reply given by  the  Minister,

except  for  the problem relating to shortlisting,

which  I  would like him to clarify. Just  now  he

said that the Ministry has been very cautious with

the  shortlisting of applicants. I would  like  to

ask  him  why  is it that in the recent  promotion

exercise,  out  of  28  applicants  in  a  certain

school,  26  were  called for  interview.  And  in

certain other schools, none of the applicants  was

called   for  interview.  Is  it  because  certain

schools are good and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>



certain  schools are bad? And is it  necessary  to

transfer good teachers from one school to another?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the point

raised   by  the  Member  for  Paya  Lebar   about

organising  courses for members  of  the  teaching

service to learn a second language, I thought  the

Member has benefited from one of these courses. In

fact,  I  thought  he  has got  a  bonus  already.

Anyway,  the Ministry of Education, together  with

the  Institute of Education and the Chinese Middle

School Teachers' Union, is currently looking  into

the possibility of running courses during the long

vacation, in July and at the end of the year,  for

this particular purpose. When it is organised,  it

will be open to everyone in the teaching service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point raised by the Member for Jurong

regarding  the promotion exercise,  where  in  one

school  practically  all those  who  applied  were

shortlisted whereas in another school none of  the

applicants  was  shortlisted,  is  a  very   valid

example.  In  fact,  I  am  fully  aware  of  this

phenomenon.  As  a  result  we  are  contemplating

introducing  a  ranking  system  for  confidential

reports in schools whereby a principal has to rank

his  staff, say, 10 per cent of the best,  15  per

cent  of the second best, and so on, so that there

will  be  an  even spread of those called  up  for

interview.  In  this  way,  they  will  really  be

compared against their peers when they appear  for

interview.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Minister for Education said that the  Chinese

teachers' union wanted those classes organised  in

order  that  its members could get a bonus,  as  I

did.  It  seems that he is challenging me.  But  I

would like to suggest that if he can send teaching

staff to a place where there are proper facilities

for  a  second language laboratory, then  we  will

agree  to  ask  our members to take part  in  such

courses.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have raised some questions but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>



the Minister has replied to the Member for Jurong.

There   has  been  much  discrimination   in   the

promotion exercise. How can the Minister find  out

whether the teachers are good or bad? Is it by the

confidential reports put up by the principals? The

Minister  should look into the matter to see  that

there   is  no  discrimination  in  the  promotion

exercise. Sir, this complaint is not only confined

to  the  Ministry of Education, but  also  to  the

other Ministries where the same complaint has been

made on promotion exercises.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I am not working in the educational

field, but I often hear that people working in the

Education  service complain that Taiwan graduates,

who  were  recruited and trained at the  Teachers'

Training College in Singapore, were not given  the

opportunity  to teach in a secondary  school.  The

salaries of these Taiwan graduates are also lower.

I  wonder  why a University graduate is  asked  to

teach  in a primary school. Is this not an  under-use of his talent?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid

the  Member  for Paya Lebar has misunderstood  me,

and this shows the failure of the bilingual policy

in the past. What I meant is that the Ministry has

conducted such courses before, and we are going to

conduct more courses with the union for the coming

vacation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson raised the point about

promotion. I am afraid the Minister does not  know

whether one teacher is good and the other is  not.

As  I have said just now, we go according to three

confidential reports on the teachers - reported by

the reporting officers and counter-reported by the

counter-signing officers. So we do not  depend  on

one person or one report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah asked the question

about the engagement of certain graduates to teach

in   primary  schools.  Sir,  these  teachers  are

engaged for that specific purpose, and nothing can

be done about it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  there is a question which was insufficiently

replied  by the Minister. I asked him to  consider

setting   up  pre-University  classes  either   in

Sembawang  or in Nee Soon. We have three secondary

schools  in Sembawang with a few hundred Secondary

IV graduates every year, but they do not have pre-University  classes.  I am sure  Sembawang  has  a

sufficient  number of students for  pre-University

classes  to  be set up in Sembawang. I  think  the

Minister said just now that we could not have them

or  we could do without them. This is not the way.

Some of the students have to travel a few miles to

go  to the pre-University classes. For the average

family,   it   means  an  increase  in   transport

expenses.  This is a question which  deserves  our

serious  attention  and should  not  be  dismissed

lightheartedly. I hope the Minister will carry out

a  detailed investigation to assess the  need  for

pre-University classes in Sembawang.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as the

Ministry is concerned, records show that there has

been  no demand for pre-University classes in that

area.  The  nearest pre-University  centre  is  at

Thomson  Secondary  School.  It  does  not  matter

whether a student is staying at 12 m.s, or 15 m.s.

Thomson Road, he still pays 10 cents bus fare, and

it is on one direct bus route.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of

the Minister's reply, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* That the sum to be allocated for Head 1501 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1005.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the two universities in our country are

doing the same job of cultivating and training our

young  people. But where administration and salary

conditions are concerned, the two universities are

afforded   different   treatment.   The    Nanyang

University teaching and administrative  staff  are

at  a  disadvantage. Recently, the salary  of  the

Vice-Chancellor  of  the  Nanyang  University  was

raised  to the same level as that of the Singapore

University.  This symbolises that the Ministry  of

Education  is  trying to standardise the  salaries

and   working  conditions  of  the  teaching   and

administrative staff of the two universities.  The

graduates  of the two universities are  given  the

same  treatment  when  they  work  in  the  public

sector.  The two Vice-Chancellors are getting  the

same  salary.  So  there  is  no  reason  why  the

administrative  and  teaching  staff  of  the  two

universities should not be standardised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the designations and titles of the teaching

staff  of  the  two universities are different.  A

University  of  Singapore lecturer has  a  maximum

salary  of  $1,700 and an Assistant  Professor  in

Nanyang University has a maximum salary of $1,600.

A  senior  lecturer in the University of Singapore

has  a  salary of $1,200 rising to $2,050. But  an

Associate  Professor in Nanyang University  has  a

salary  of only $1,650 rising to $1,850. It  seems

that  in the same country the Professor is not  as

good  as the Lecturer. This sort of phenomenon  is

likely to lead to confusion and misunderstanding.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the salaries of the two Vice-Chancellors are

the  same.  The  teaching and  the  administrative

staff  of the two universities are doing the  same

job.  Why  cannot we standardise the designations,

salary  scales and working conditions?  Under  the

present  system, if a lecturer from the University

of Singapore is transferred to Nanyang University,

he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>



can  become an Assistant Professor or an Associate

Professor,  but his salary may be  lower.  On  the

other hand, if an Assistant or Associate Professor

in  Nanyang  University,  is  transferred  to  the

University  of  Singapore, he can  only  become  a

lecturer  and  his salary can be even  higher.  So

some  people  may think that the standard  of  one

university  is  higher  than  that  of  the  other

university. I do not know what plans the  Minister

has in this respect.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, from the

speech  of  the  Member for Delta,  we  know  that

certain   anomalies  still  exist   in   the   two

universities.  I think it is time  to  review  and

standardise the administrative system, and to  put

right   the   various   anomalies.   The   Nanyang

University  is  a  University  initiated  by   the

people.   After   the   reorganisation   of    the

university, it is under Government's finance.  The

Nanyang  University is doing the job  of  training

the   elite   of  our  society.  We   should   not

discriminate between the two universities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to raise is in regard

to  the housing loan for Nanyang University staff.

I  know  that  the  staff  in  the  University  of

Singapore are entitled to housing loans.  But  the

staff,  both teaching and administrative,  in  the

Nanyang  University are riot entitled  to  housing

loans.  I  would like the Minister to  review  the

policy in this respect.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> The principle of parity of

treatment to both universities is being applied  a

few  years  since. The trouble, as far  as  salary

scale  is  concerned, lies in  Nanyang  University

having  a great proliferation of titles and  names

and  scales.  For  example, in the  University  of

Singapore  there are ranks of Professor, Associate

Professor, Senior Lecturer, Lecturer and Assistant

Lecturer.   Whereas  in  the   case   of   Nanyang

University,  there are such titles  as  Foundation

Professor,  Professor, Associate Professor,  Grade

I;   Associate  Professor,  Grade  II;   Assistant

Professor-I  am  not quite sure whether  there  is

Grade I or Grade II - then Lecturer,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>



Assistant Lecturer, and Teacher. I am afraid  that

with  about  nine  grades as compared  with  five,

there    is   bound   to   be   overlapping    and

misunderstanding. I can assure  both  the  Members

for  Delta and Jurong that the principle of parity

is definitely being applied. In fact, the Ministry

hopes  to  take  up this matter with  the  Nanyang

University  to  consolidate the  great  number  of

grades  of  academic staff so as to  conform  with

internationally acceptable ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid the Member for Jurong does not quite

get   his  facts  right.  Academic  staff  of  the

University of Singapore obtain their housing loans

from the University of Singapore, and the loan  is

a  private fund of the University. It has  nothing

to  do  with  Government. It is an endowment  from

donations  in  the  past, and  they  have  a  huge

endowment fund from which, I think, the  loan  was

obtained.  I am afraid the Nanyang University  has

no  such funds. Perhaps what it can do is to raise

a  large  endowment fund, and the interest accrued

therefrom can be used for housing loans.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view of

the grand reply given by the Minister, I hope that

in the not too distant future the staff of the two

universities  will  be  given  exactly  the   same

conditions of service. I beg leave to withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That the sum to be allocated for Head 1501 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1351.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Govindaswamy is not here. Amendment (5).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1501 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2037.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Education has restricted the

use   of  school  playgrounds  and  do  not  allow

children  who live in the vicinity of  schools  to

make use of them. This is an unhealthy policy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>



Children  need  playgrounds in  the  afternoon  or

during  school holidays to exercise. In fact,  the

Government is encouraging students not only to  be

good  in their studies but also to build a  rugged

body. To achieve this, sufficient facilities  must

be  provided. But in the case of children who live

in the vicinity of schools in the slums of Kampung

Kembangan,  they are not allowed to  make  use  of

school playgrounds. Where then can they go to?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education has called for the

formation of School Advisory Committees comprising

parents  and  people living near the schools.  The

purpose  of  these  Committees is  to  enable  the

people to share the responsibility and progress of

the  school,  and  to help expand its  activities.

Such committees have done a lot to raise funds  to

achieve  these  objectives. Some of them  organise

funfairs, jumble sales and also cinema shows, etc.

Funds collected from these efforts are contributed

by  people who live close to the schools. However,

when their children want to make use of the school

playgrounds, they are not allowed to. An  incident

took  place  in one of the primary schools  in  my

constituency.  The  school  principal   saw   some

children playing in the school playground and sent

for the police to arrest them. Some of the parents

of  these  children  are  members  of  the  School

Advisory  Committee and had worked  very  hard  to

raise  funds  for  the school by  selling  funfair

tickets and cinema tickets. So they approached me,

as  MP  for  Kampung Kembangan, to  help  them  to

obtain the release of their children. This is  not

the  way to further establish rapport between  the

school  and  parents. On the other hand,  it  will

create  enmity which will lead to their reluctance

to  give support to the School Advisory Committee.

Therefore, I wish to know whether the Minister for

Education  can  allow children who live  close  to

schools  to  make  use of the  school  playgrounds

either during or after school hours.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

reply  to  the question raised by the  Member  for

Kampung  Kembangan, I am happy  to  say  that  the

Ministry  of  Education does consider applications

from  outside  organisations to make  use  of  the

school  playing fields after school hours, subject

to  the  payment of a small fee.  As  far  as  the

general  public  is  concerned,  the  Ministry  of

Education,  in  collaboration  with  the  People's

Association,  is currently working  out  a  scheme

whereby  school playing fields as well  as  school

halls  will be made open for public use.  If  this

scheme  is  implemented, the unhappy  incident  as

quoted   by  the  Member  for  Kampung  Kembangan,

whereby  children  of Advisory  Committee  members

were harassed by the police, will not happen.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Can the

Parliamentary   Secretary  say  when   will   this

proposed scheme be implemented?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Sir, this scheme is still being

worked  upon by the Ministry of Education and  the

People's  Association, and the Member for  Kampung

Kembangan  will  be informed  as  soon  as  it  is

possible.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, on the

assurance given by the Parliamentary Secretary,  I

beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1501 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2081.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Educational Television has been established

for a few years now. The main purpose of ETV is to

raise  the efficiency of teaching in the  schools.

ETV  is  indeed a good method of teaching and  its

programmes   are   a   very   useful   medium   of

instruction.  In  this  respect,   I   have   some

questions to ask the Minister concerned. First the

telecast  time  seems  to  be  rather  short   and

limited, and it cannot therefore achieve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>



as  much  as  it should. For example, the  various

classes  in  the primary schools have  only  seven

programmes for the whole term, and each  programme

is  only  for 15 minutes. This is too  short.  The

various classes include Primaries I, II, III,  and

V.  Primaries IV and VI, however, do not have  any

ETV  programmes,  and  this  seems  to  give  good

treatment on the one hand and yet not well  enough

on   the  other.  What  is  the  reason  for  this

discrepancy?  Why  are there  no  good  television

programmes for Primaries IV and VI? Is it  because

there  is  a  shortage of teaching  materials  for

Primaries  IV  and VI? If there is a shortage,  by

all  means  proceed to acquire  the  relevant  and

necessary  materials  for  the  benefit   of   the

Primaries  IV  and  VI students.  In  addition  to

increasing the telecast time for ETV programmes, I

wonder  whether  the Minister  for  Education  can

consult  the Minister for Culture, who is  present

here  now  -  after all, television is  under  the

Ministry  of Culture-as to whether it is  possible

to  telecast  part  of the ETV programmes  in  the

evening. But if the Minister says that this is not

really necessary because we have to let the pupils

have some rest or recreation in the evenings, then

I say that if this is what he thinks, it is wrong.

If  we want a student to have a firm impression of

what  he  has  studied  in the  day,  then  it  is

necessary to give him the opportunity to revise in

the evening. So if we can telecast it again in the

evening,  the  parents will be able  to  supervise

them.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impression will be better if the students are

given  the opportunity to see the programmes again

in  the  evening.  We know that  very  often  they

forget  what they have learned. The Ministers  are

all bright and learned people. So I would like  to

know  whether  it  is possible to  telecast  these

programmes in the evenings. I think this is a very

good programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to raise is since we

are  spending a few hundred thousand dollars every

year, therefore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>



we  must  get  some returns from this expenditure.

Has  the  Ministry of Education made any study  to

assess  the  returns we get from the provision  of

this service?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Mr Chai Chong Yii):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the Member for

Sembawang asked his questions in Mandarin,  may  I

be permitted to answer in Mandarin?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, we are thankful

to  the Member for Sembawang for his concern about

educational television service. There is no  doubt

that telecasting time for this programme is rather

short. But we must understand that although it  is

a  short  programme, it requires a great  deal  of

effort and preparation to put up the programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Sembawang said

that  Primary  IV and Primary VI students  do  not

have  ETV  programmes. Perhaps he is referring  to

the  Chinese  stream. As for  the  other  language

streams,  Primary IV and Primary VI do have  these

programmes.  It  is therefore not correct  to  say

that  there  are no ETV programmes for Primary  IV

and  Primary VI students. Besides it is  difficult

to  say whether the ETV programmes are confined to

students of certain standards only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of expenditure for these

programmes,  I  would  like  to  say   that   this

expenditure is worthwhile. Since we started  these

programmes  in 1966, the returns we have  achieved

can  be seen in many respects. I cannot elaborate,

measure  or  itemise all the good  results  but  I

would  like to pick out the main benefits that  we

have  achieved. The first point is  that  we  have

provided a more systematic teaching programme  for

the  various classes in the primary schools,  with

particular   emphasis  on  science,   mathematics,

language and social science. We have prepared more

systematic teaching methods on these subjects. The

second  point is that through the ETV  programmes,

we   have  provided  new  teaching  material   and

techniques for teachers. We have achieved  a  fair

amount in this particular respect.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>



Thirdly, through the ETV service, teaching methods

may   be  revised  and  brought  up-to-date.   For

example,  new techniques and methods  of  teaching

have  been  introduced. Fourthly, ETV service  has

done   a  lot  to  promote  the  use  of  teaching

materials    and    teaching   aids,    such    as

transparencies and colour slides, video-tapes, and

so  on.  We  have made use of these materials  and

have  promoted  the application of  such  teaching

aids.  We  have  also conducted  seminars  on  the

application of teaching aids to assist teachers in

general, and I think we have achieved something in

this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the question that some of the programmes

should  be  telecast  in  the  evenings,  we  have

already  done  this.  It is only  because  of  the

limitation  of time that we cannot do  this  on  a

wider scale. We have co-operated with the Ministry

of  Culture and the Adult Education Board  to  put

certain  programmes  over  television,  like   the

teaching  of  English and how to play the  guitar.

All  these  are relevant to educational television

service.  But, as I have said, because of  certain

limitations, we cannot do it on a bigger scale.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view of

the  Minister of State's fairly good reply, I  beg

leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1501 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know what are the breakdown

figures of the grants to the four institutions  of

higher  learning.  And is Government  prepared  to

increase its grant to Nanyang University, in  view

of   the  fact  that  public  donations  to   this

University have been noticeably declining over the

years? Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>



the  Minister has done a very good job in  getting

extra income for the Ngee Ann Technical College. I

wonder  if  he  could do the same  for  this  fast

growing University.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the breakdown

figures   of  Government  grants  to  the  various

institutions of higher learning are as follows:

<pre>

University of Singapore       $ 20.5 million

Nanyang University            $  5.5 million

Singapore Polytechnic         $ 6.25 million

Ngee Ann Technical College    $975,000.

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the quantum of the grant to each of these

institutions  is  computed on  the  basis  of  the

estimated   expenditure  for   the   coming   year

submitted  by the institution concerned,  and  not

unilaterally by the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of his question is very well

taken.  But  I  would like to correct  one  point,

i.e., that the donation of 75 per cent of the  net

income to Ngee Ann College was a voluntary gesture

by  the  Ngee Ann Kongsi. If what the  Member  for

Delta  meant  is to ask the Hokkien Huay  Kuan  to

give   75  per  cent  of  its  income  to  Nanyang

University, I will convey his view to the  Hokkien

Huay Kuan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1501 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2120.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this provision under the Ministry of

Education  is  in  respect  of  the  Annual  Youth

Festival. Sir, over the past few years the  Annual

Youth  Festival has been organised by the Ministry

of  Education so that our youths would be given an

opportunity to show their potential in art, music,

sports  and other activities. This is commendable.

However,  much  organisational  work  is  involved

during   the   period  before  the  Annual   Youth

Festival.  It  takes months to  prepare  for  this

festival, and only those students involved  in  it

will  take part in such activities. Other students

are not even aware of the Annual Youth Festival. I

wonder whether the Minister for Education will set

aside one day as a Youth Day so that all the young

people   in  Singapore  can  take  part   in   the

celebration  of  the  Annual Youth  Festival.  For

example, the children have Children's Day on which

the   primary   schools   are   closed   for   the

celebrations  to  be  carried out.  Therefore,  we

should  have a Youth Day to enable the  youths  in

Singapore  to take part in various activities  and

give more meaning to the Annual Youth Festival.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposal by

the  Member for Jurong to set aside one day in the

school  calendar  to be called Youth  Day  and  to

coincide  with  the opening of  the  Annual  Youth

Festival is indeed a laudable one. The Ministry of

Education  is  actively considering this  proposal

and, if feasible, will certainly implement it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1501 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2126.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is an allocation of funds for school

crossing  patrols,  and  I  would  like  to   seek

clarification   from   the   Minister    or    his

Parliamentary Secretary. On the question of school

crossing patrol in the Jurong Town Primary  School

in Jurong Town, they have a problem which has been

in  existence  for some time. It is  a  source  of

worry  to the parents and students because of  the

difficulty  in employing people to do  the  school

crossing patrol. As a result of the difficulty  in

recruitment,  some teachers have  been  given  the

duty  of  guiding the school children  across  the

road.  They  do this by rotation. I do  not  think

this  is  proper because the teachers  have  other

duties   to  perform.  Moreover,  they   have   no

experience   in  school  crossing   patrol   work.

Requests have been made to the Police to help  the

students to cross the road. But a policeman  would

only  turn  up  at certain times, while  at  other

times  he  would fail to turn up. You can imagine,

Sir,  how  heavy the traffic is along  Corporation

Drive because of the industrial development there.

It  is  difficult to cross the road.  Without  any

help from the school crossing patrol, the students

will be exposed to a lot of danger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that there has been a high rate of

resignations of school crossing patrolmen  because

of  the low pay which, I understand, is only $4.65

per  day. This wage is only paid for working days.

In other words, they do not get paid on Sundays or

public holidays. They can only earn about $100 per

month for doing this kind of work. They can easily

get  more  than  this amount  in  any  factory  in

Jurong.  Unless  their wages are increased,  I  am

afraid that this school in Jurong will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>



never   be   able  to  employ  a  school  crossing

patrolman. I hope consideration will be  given  to

this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Member for Jurong is to be commended for  his

interest in the safety of school children  in  his

constituency.   School  crossing   patrolmen   are

normally employed on a part-time basis because  of

the  short hours of work. On the average, a school

crossing patrolman works only five hours per  day.

Therefore,  the daily wage is quite comparable  to

the  other  daily-rated  employees,  although   it

cannot he said to be very attractive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the school mentioned by the Member

for  Jurong,  we  are aware that  this  particular

school   has   been  without  a  school   crossing

patrolman  for quite some time. But  he  has  also

mentioned that teachers have been asked to perform

the  duty  of a patrolman. I think it  is  a  good

idea.  In  fact, it is good for teachers  or  even

older  students to take an interest in the welfare

of  the younger school children. I agree with  him

that  teachers have their own work to do, and that

the  duty  of  guiding children  across  the  road

should  not  be  their main concern.  However,  if

teachers  could guide school children  across  the

road,  it will promote better relationship between

students and teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though we have been trying very hard, it is still

difficult  to  get  an adequate number  of  school

crossing  patrolmen. The difficulty of  recruiting

the  required  number of men within a  short  time

could probably be due to the availability of  jobs

in  Jurong.  If we can get hawkers in  the  school

canteen or tuck-shop to take up this employment on

a  part-time basis, perhaps the problem of low pay

and the difficulty of recruitment can be solved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, Sir, the Ministry of

Education has also given consideration to the need

of   getting  assistance  from  the  Public  Works

Department to build either a pedestrian overhead



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>



bridge or a traffic control point at the school to

solve  this problem. But personally it is my  hope

that  the teachers will continue to give a  little

of  their  time  for this kind of service  to  the

pupils.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

do  not  know  whether the Minister of  State  for

Education   is   aware  that  a  school   crossing

patrolman  must  first be trained by  the  Police.

Without  the proper supervision of the Police,  no

Tom,  Dick  or Harry can do traffic control  duty.

Therefore, it is impossible to get hawkers in  the

school  tuck-shop  to  take up  this  job  without

proper training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that school crossing patrolmen should be

employed   on   a   part-time   basis   is    also

unacceptable. No doubt the actual working time  is

five  hours, but the five working hours are spread

over  the  whole  day.  He  cannot  therefore   be

expected  to be gainfully employed in between  his

duty  hours, which are spread over three sessions,

morning, afternoon and evening. He cannot take  up

any other employment in between his duty hours.  I

hope   the   Minister  of  State   will   consider

increasing the salary because this is one  way  of

getting  the necessary manpower for this  job.  If

you  ask a teacher to take up this job, of course,

he  will have to do it. But I do not think this is

an   appropriate  duty  for  a  teacher.   Another

suggestion  from  the Minister of  State  is  that

senior  students should be asked to do  this  job.

But I think it is quite risky for them to do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

it  is,  of course, true that training is required

for  the school crossing patrolman. It is  a  very

simple  form  of training. If the hawkers  in  the

school tuck-shop are prepared to take up this job,

there will be no difficulty in getting the traffic

police  to give them the training. I am  sure  the

traffic  police  will be quite  willing  to  train

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the comment that it s not quite

suitable  for  teachers to take  up  this  job,  I

personally feel that,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>



although  my  view  may not be acceptable  to  the

Member for Jurong, it is a very simple task  which

the  teachers  can undertake after the  school  is

dismissed.  It  will only take ten  minutes  after

each  session  at the most to guide  the  students

across the road. But if this is not feasible, then

the  only  way  left is to set up a traffic  light

control  at  the school. However, this  will  give

rise to some traffic problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to raising the

salary of the school crossing patrolman, if we can

get someone living near the school to take up this

job,  it  will not be difficult for him to  accept

the  rate  of pay. Of course, it may be  difficult

for  anyone  to take up this job if he  lives  far

away  from the school. But we will look  into  the

matter.



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Member for Jurong has mentioned about getting

any  Tom,  Dick  and Harry to do  school  crossing

patrol  duty.  I have come across a case  where  a

housewife  was given the job of a school  crossing

patrolwoman  by  the Employment Exchange.  In  her

daily  life  this woman seldom goes out,  and  she

might even find this job of school crossing patrol

difficult to manage. Therefore, this matter of any

Tom,  Dick and Harry, or even Mary taking up  this

job  is  open to question. For the safety  of  the

children, we should not employ any person  who  is

not  able to look after his or her own safety when

crossing the road. If he cannot look after his own

safety,  how then can we expect him to look  after

the  safety of the children crossing the road?  Mr

Speaker, Sir, there are some former civil servants

who  have  retired at the age of 55  but  who  are

still  physically fit. Perhaps this is a  possible

source   of   recruitment   of   school   crossing

patrolmen.  If  these pensioners, in  addition  to

their  pensions, are given this job on a part-time

basis,  it  would be good both for the  Government

and the pensioners themselves.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would also like to take part in this discussion on

the  school  crossing patrolman. I wonder  whether

the  Ministry of Education could convert the daily

wage of a school crossing patrolman into a monthly

salary,  because these people are not paid  during

the  long  school  holidays, public  holidays  and

Sundays. If they can be paid on a monthly basis, I

wonder  whether  the  Ministry  of  Education  can

provide an extra school servant for each school on

the basis that the school servant also works as  a

school crossing patrolman.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, no

matter  how we put it, it boils down to a question

if money. Since it is a question of money, I think

the  matter can be solved easily. Sir,  I  endorse

the  view of the Minister of State that it is good

for  teachers to help students to cross the  road.

It  can  be  their duty too. That  being  so,  why

cannot  we  pay  some  kind of  allowance  to  the

teachers, so that this problem can be solved?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Member for Bras Basah's proposal  is  a  very

good one, and we will consider the suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a

statement was made to the effect that a hawker can

be a part-time school crossing patrolman. Sir, was

that  statement made earlier by a Member  here?  I

just   want  a  confirmation  of  that  statement,

because I am in charge of this.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, if it came to my knowledge

that   a  hawker  serves  as  a  part-time  school

crossing patrolman, I shall see to it that he does

not  get  the  job. I am in charge of recruitment.

Sir,  the  situation is this. The job of a  school

crossing  patrolman, which is rather a light  one,

is  normally offered to older people, who are  not

able   to  get  employment  elsewhere.  But  these

people, in view of their advanced age,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>



must   be  physically  fit  and,  most  important,

without any impaired vision. So having got  a  job

as  a school crossing patrolman or patrolwoman, he

or  she  might  during the spare time  in  between

school sessions become a hawker; but certainly not

a full-time hawker and a part-time school crossing

patrolman.  I would rather that he be a  part-time

hawker and a full-time school crossing patrolman.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

my  proposal  is for the conversion of  the  daily

wage of a school crossing patrolman into a monthly

salary and for the absorption of the duties  of  a

school crossing patrolman by a school servant of a

particular school. The Minister of State  has  not

answered my question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment (Mr Chor Yeok Eng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to clarify the question of

hawkers   and   school  crossing   patrolmen.   My

colleague,  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the

Minister for Labour, has already pointed out  that

the  job  of a school crossing patrolman is  meant

for  old people. According to the hawker licensing

requirements  of the Ministry of the  Environment,

part-time hawkers do not qualify for licences.  In

fact,  licences  for  hawkers  are  already  quite

popular  and in demand. Sir, if we issue  licences

to  part-time  hawkers,  this  will  increase  the

number  of  hawkers in Singapore. If a  hawker  is

given  this  part-time job of  a  school  crossing

patrolman, we will withdraw his hawker's  licence.

A  person can choose either to retain his hawker's

licence or to take up a part-time job.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the   Member  for  Paya  Lebar  has  proposed  the

conversion of the daily wage of a school  crossing

patrolman  into a monthly salary. Basically,  this

proposal  has  its  merits. But,  at  the  present

moment,  there  is also the problem of  recruiting

school



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>



servants which will take quite some time to solve.

In any case, if it is possible, the problem can be

considered and it involves a review of  the  whole

system. If I remember correctly, Sir, there is  no

necessity  for  hawkers in  school  tuck-shops  to

apply for licences.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Minister of State just now said  that  it  is

difficult  to get school servants. In my meet-the-people  sessions,  I have come across  people  who

want to apply for the job of school servants. Sir,

if  the Minister wishes, I can recommend a lot  of

people to him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, wherever

vacancies  exist  for  school  servants,  male  or

female,   or   school   crossing   patrolmen    or

patrolwomen, they will have to be channelled to me

in  the  Ministry  of Labour. The  recruitment  is

conducted through the Ministry of Labour. In  this

respect, I might be in a better position to inform

the  Member  for Paya Lebar as to  the  number  of

vacancies  available for school servants.  If  the

Member knows of people who are interested in  this

job,  would he please direct them to me.  I  shall

see  to  it  that  if they possess  the  necessary

qualifications  they will get a  job  without  any

difficulty, provided they do not do it part-time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

think  the  Government Benches are in a  state  of

confusion.  We  have been talking back  and  forth

without  getting  an answer from the  Minister  of

State  as  to which is the best method  to  get  a

school  crossing  patrolman  for  the  school   in

question within the shortest possible time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

this is a question of manpower, supply and demand,

wages,  and so on. Of course, we hope that we  are

able  to  raise the wages. But, under the existing

system,  we have to find out from the Ministry  of

Labour as to how soon we can get a school crossing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>



patrolman  for the particular school in  question.

In this respect we are looking into the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I can

help the House. I realise the difficulties of  the

problem  raised by the Member for Jurong. The  job

of  a  school crossing patrolman does not  require

much  physical exertion, and the person doing this

job  is  paid on a daily-rated basis. So  we  have

decided  to  reserve  these  jobs  for  the  older

people,  hoping  that the younger  people  can  be

diverted into the various industries. There should

not  be  any  difficulty at all in getting  school

servants or school crossing patrolmen. But, as you

know,  Sir,  nowadays our job  seekers  are  quite

different  from those of 10 years ago. More  often

than not, the problem is to satisfy the job seeker

and to post him to a particular school or location

which he asks for. I do not see any difficulty  at

all  if  the  Member for Jurong were to  send  his

request to me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might help the House if I were to elaborate a

little on the set-up in the Ministry of Labour. We

do  our  best and as quickly as we can  to  select

candidates  to fill the vacancies in  the  various

Government Ministries, because we do not  wish  to

hold   up  recruitment  and  thereby  reduce   the

efficiency   of   the   particular   Ministry   or

department. As far as the Ministry of Education is

concerned, we encountered some difficulty  in  the

past.  It took us an average of two or three weeks

-  it  could be even less - to select a candidate,

and  then  pass  his  name  to  the  Ministry   of

Education.  But it took the Ministry of  Education

as  long as four months to call this person up. By

the time this person is called--



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Two months.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir. My

Minister  of  State has corrected me.  It  is  two

months,  and I apologise for innocently misleading

the House. By the time this person is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>



called   for  an  appointment,  he  is  no  longer

interested because in the meanwhile he  had  found

an alternative job.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, just a point of

clarification.  When  the Parliamentary  Secretary

mentioned  "older  people", what  is  the  general

guideline? How old should he be? The second  point

is:  why  should  the  buck  be  passed  from  one

Ministry to another?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope you

will  not  hold  me responsible for confusing  the

debate.  The Ministry of Education has  placed  an

age  ceiling  of  55  years. This  requirement  is

stipulated  by  the  Ministry  of  Education.  The

Ministry  of Labour, as an agency for recruitment,

will  have  to select candidates that fall  within

the  requirements  of  the  Ministry  wanting  the

services of these persons. So the age limit is  55

and not more. Sir, I feel strongly that even if  a

person is 60 years old, but is fit and has a  good

vision, he should he given a job.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

having heard the views of the various Members  and

Parliamentary  Secretaries,  I  have  become  more

confused.  The  Parliamentary  Secretary  to   the

Minister for Labour says that there is no  problem

in  recruiting school crossing patrolmen. But,  on

the other hand, there is this real difficulty of a

school  in  getting a patrolman. Six  months  have

elapsed, and the school is still without a  school

crossing  patrolman. I do not know what  has  gone

wrong. If the Minister of State for Education  can

give  me the assurance that proper steps are being

taken to fill the vacancy, I beg leave to withdraw

my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1501 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2141.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we all know, the Teachers Training

College   will  be  known  as  the  Institute   of

Education from 1st April, 1973. In this respect, I

would like to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>



ask  the  Minister whether the Institute  will  be

awarding degrees, and whether all the teachers  in

the  TTC  will  be  absorbed by the  Institute  of

Education.   They   are  at   present   Government

servants. What will their position be if they  are

absorbed by the Institute of Education?



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the function

of the Institute of Education will be planned with

three main objectives in mind. Firstly, this is to

provide pedagogical training before they join  the

teaching service. Secondly, the in-service  course

is  to  enhance and enrich their knowledge and  to

provide   promotion  opportunities  for   existing

teachers.  Thirdly, to do pedagogical research  as

well as educational research.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Institute will not award degrees. At the last

Budget  sitting, I have given detailed reasons  as

to  why  we will not award degrees. I think  those

countries  awarding Bachelor of Education  degrees

are now having second thoughts about the viability

of such degrees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question of the existing staff, in the

first  instance, all of them will be  seconded  to

the  Institute  of Education. The  Institute  will

advertise the vacancies and the suitable ones will

be appointed, while the others will be reverted to

the Education service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank the

Minister  for  his  answer, and  I  beg  leave  to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1501 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 11.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, the sum allocated is $1,500,000 for the

development of the ETV-CEPTA Complex. I would like

to  ask  the  Minister  for  Education  when  will

construction of this complex begin and when is  it

expected  to be completed. What kind of facilities

will be provided



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>



in  this complex, and what improvements will there

be in respect of ETV?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, the project and design

are being finalised. Construction of the CEPTA ETV

Centre will begin soon, and it is expected  to  be

ready  sometime  towards the  end  of  1974.  With

respect   to   his   query  about   its   physical

facilities,  the Centre will be built  on  a  site

adjoining  the  present Ministry of Education.  It

will  consist of a complex with five studios,  two

of which will be used for colour TV, a theatre and

a  four-storey general block, which will house the

main   production,  photographic  and   processing

divisions  as  well as the instructional  material

library.  This project is, in fact, to enrich  the

activities of the ETV with a view to developing it

fully  into  an  educational  mass  media  in  the

future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank

the  Minister for his detailed reply. I beg  leave

to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1501 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 22.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this subhead, I would like to raise

something  about  staff quarters  in  the  Nanyang

University.  If I can recall rightly,  I  remember

that  every year we had occasion to come  to  this

House  to revote about half a million dollars  for

the   building  of  staff  quarters   of   Nanyang

University.  Last year there was  such  a  revote.

This  year  there  is again a  revote  of  half  a

million  dollars for such a building.  Maybe  next

year we will have to revote again. I would like to

ask the Minister why has the building of the staff

quarters   been   delayed.   According    to    my

understanding, the staff are waiting to move  into

the  quarters because many of them have come  from

abroad. If there is no such facility, it is rather

inconvenient  to them because at the  moment  they

are  living  very  far away from  the  University.

Although they are used to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>



the  travelling distance at the moment, but if  we

can  provide them with these quarters, it will  be

helpful  to  them. I would like  the  Minister  to

clarify the position to this House.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, the provision of staff

quarters  for  Nanyang  University  for  the  last

financial year was based on an overall master plan

for  the  physical development of  the  University

prepared by a Colombo Plan expert. Since then,  we

have a more detailed study of the master plan  and

are  having  second  thoughts about  it.  We  have

decided  instead  to  appoint  a  local  team   of

architects  to  prepare another master  plan,  and

this  will  be ready soon. As far as the provision

of  staff  quarters  is  concerned,  it  is  being

finalised.  We hope work can commence within  this

financial year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1501 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 31.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this subhead, I would like to ask the

Minister whether he is prepared to build a primary

school  in Jurong Town. As we all know, there  are

about  40,000  people in this town, and  there  is

only  one primary school now. This year there  are

about  500  Primary I pupils, and  next  year  the

number is expected to be around 1,000. So there is

an urgent need for another primary school. I would

like  to  ask the Minister whether he is going  to

build a primary school there and, if so, when will

it be completed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, I think the Member for

Jurong  is aware that a secondary school is  under

construction  in Jurong, and a new primary  school

will be built sometime this year. In addition, new

schools,  both  primary and secondary,  are  being

planned for the future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, talking about

a  secondary  school, I would like to  remind  the

Minister that the foundation work has already been

done,  but  work has since then stopped  for  four

months  now.  There has been no  further  progress

beyond  that. I do not know what has  happened.  I

hope  the  Minister  can  go  back  and  give  his

attention  to  this. As regards his  intention  to

build  more primary schools in future, I beg leave

to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1501 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 81.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This allocation is for various projects of the

Industrial  Training Board, to train  and  produce

more  technical and industrial personnel  to  meet

the needs of our industries. The setting up of the

Industrial Training Board is a very good move.  In

this  respect,  perhaps we may be faced  with  the

difficulty   of   obtaining   suitable   technical

teachers.  At  the  moment the  factories  are  in

urgent  need  of trained and skilled  technicians,

and have offered attractive pay for such people. I

raise  this  question  now so  that  the  Minister

concerned  will be able to give his  attention  to

the  problem  in  advance, that is,  the  pay  and

treatment  accorded to the technical teachers.  It

seems that their salary is lower than that of  the

technicians  in  the factories. I  am  afraid  the

experienced   and   trained   teachers   in   this

Industrial  Training School may be  absorbed  into

the  factories. So I hope the Minister will  raise

their salary at least equal to that of the skilled

technicians employed in the factories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is about the long hair problem.

This  has  been mentioned when we debated  on  the

Ministry  of  Home Affairs, but I  would  like  to

raise  it again. We have a certain training course

under   the  joint  industry-Government   training

scheme, and many of the trainees are sporting long

hair. The Ministry concerned with this scheme does

not  seem to have given any instructions to  these

trainees to cut their hair



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>



short.   I  do  not  know  whether  this  is   the

responsibility of the school principal  concerned,

or  whether  it is the responsibility  of  someone else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is, after the setting up of

the  Industrial  Training  Board,  what  kind   of

industrial and technical training courses will  be

available, and how many students will be recruited

into these various courses?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, the attraction by the

industry  to experienced qualified staff from  the

teaching institute is a phenomenon throughout  the

world. It is not peculiar to Singapore, but we are

trying  our best to retain them. May I just  quote

an   example?  Recently  the  Ngee  Ann  Technical

College   offered  an  appointment  to  a   former

graduate.  Immediately after the offer  was  made,

the  firm  in  which  he  is employed  immediately

doubled  his salary, thereby pie-venting him  from

coming  back to the College. It is precisely  with

this  problem  in  mind that we  have  established

joint  training schools with major  industries  so

that  we can have their manpower to help us  train

our own people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of long hair, the trainees in

this  joint  training school have to  observe  the

rules  and regulations of the vocational institute

in which they are housed. They are not supposed to

keep  long hair, and we will enforce the rule very

strictly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Industrial Training Board will take over the

functions of industrial training formerly  handled

by  the Technical Education Department. At present

the  Board  runs  some  40  different  courses  at

various levels and of various durations, from  six

months to two years. The output for 1972 was 4,000
