US$10  billion  in  assistance  to  Indonesia  will  affect  our

case  of  a  default,  taking into consideration  the  projected

<div align="center"><b>RESCUE AND ASSISTANCE PACKAGE FOR INDONESIA</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Finance why is

there  a necessity for Singapore, being such a small country  as

compared  to  Japan, to contribute a large and equal  amount  of

US$5 billion to help Indonesia in the present currency turmoil.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  with  your permission,  I  would  like  to  take

Question Nos. 1 to 3 together as they are related?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, you may.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1806</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Because of our close links with our

neighbours in the South East Asia region, Singapore is  affected

by the economic well-being of their economies.   It is therefore

in  our  interests  to do what we can to maintain  economic  and

financial stability in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will first take up Mr Inderjit Singh's question and

explain the nature and form of the rescue package to Indonesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's contribution to the Indonesian reform package

is  in  two  parts.   The first is a loan  of  US$5  billion  to

supplement  the aid package offered jointly by the International

Monetary  Fund  (IMF), the World Bank and the Asian  Development

Bank (ADB).  The second is the purchase of Rupiah to support the

Indonesian currency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate on the first part of our assistance

package.   Indonesia  has  adopted  a  strong  economic   reform

programme  which  should  help  to  restore  confidence  in  the

economy.    This  programme,  which  was  formulated  with   the

assistance  of  the IMF, World Bank and ADB, will  be  supported

with  US$23  billion  of financing from the  three  multilateral

agencies  as  well  as from Indonesia's own substantial  foreign

reserves.    However,  if  for  some  unforeseen  reasons,   the

multilateral  financing proves to be inadequate, then  Singapore

and  several other countries with regional interests,  including

Japan,  the United States, Malaysia, Australia and Brunei,  have

agreed  to  provide  supplementary  financing  to  support   the

programme.   In particular, Singapore has pledged to  contribute

up  to US$5 billion to this "second line of defence".  There  is

every  likelihood  that there may be no need  to  draw  on  this

supplementary line of credit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of our assistance package involves the

purchase   of   Rupiah  to  support  the  Indonesian   currency.

Singapore  and Japan share the view that loss of confidence  was

the primary cause of the recent depreciation of the Rupiah.  The

fall  in  the value of the Rupiah has been excessive  and  could

jeopardize the successful implementation of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1807</b></font><br><br>

economic  reform  programme.   Therefore,  both  countries  have

agreed  to  collaborate  with  Bank  Indonesia,  through   joint

intervention  in  the foreign exchange market,  to  promote  the

strengthening  of  the  Rupiah to levels  more  consistent  with

Indonesia's   economic  fundamentals.    The   amount   of   our

intervention   is   not  predetermined  and   will   depend   on

developments in the foreign exchange market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong has asked whether the US$1 billion loan

to Thailand and US$5 billion assistance to Indonesia will affect

our  reserves  and  Singaporeans' Central Provident  Fund  (CPF)

savings,  in  case of default.  I would like to assure  Mr  Seng

that  our  CPF  savings are not at risk at all.  CPF  funds  are

invested  in  Singapore Government bonds  and  the  Government's

external reserves are well in excess of its CPF obligations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the facilities offered to Thailand and

Indonesia  are  sovereign loans and remain part of  our  foreign

assets.   The  loans  are to help maintain foreign  reserves  of

those two countries at a "comfortable" level to instill investor

confidence.  Neither Thailand nor Indonesia have ever  defaulted

on their sovereign debts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong has asked why Singapore, being such a

small country, needs to contribute an amount equal to Japan's to

assist  Indonesia.  I would like to point out  that  Singapore's

loan  was  made  as  a result of a request from  the  Indonesian

Government  for assistance, and Japan subsequently  matched  our

offer.  Our willingness to extend a substantial loan despite our

small size is reflective of the importance Singapore places upon

its  relationship with Indonesia and the close ties between  the

leaders of Indonesia and Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh has also asked how Singapore and other ASEAN

countries will benefit from Singapore's financial assistance  to

Indonesia.  The recent currency turmoil has revealed  the  close

interdependence of the economies in this region.  As the largest

economy in ASEAN and a close

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1808</b></font><br><br>

neighbour, the health of the Indonesian economy is critical  not

only  to  Singapore  but also to the overall prosperity  of  the

region.   The  restoration of investor confidence  in  Indonesia

will  help  to stabilise regional financial markets.   Singapore

will  also benefit in the long term when the Indonesian  economy

recovers and resumes strong growth.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I would like to ask

the  Minister who will administer the US$5 billion  loan.   Will

IMF  do  it  or  will  Singapore do it directly?   Is  the  loan

targeted  for  any specific spending in Indonesia  or  is  it  a

general fund?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if the loan is administered, will it affect any

Singapore Government's spending plan for the next few years, eg,

in  upgrading  programmes or any other programmes like  the  MRT

lines and so on?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The loan will be administered

between  the  Monetary  Authority of  Singapore  (MAS)  and  the

Indonesian Ministry of Finance.  It will be a direct  loan  from

MAS  to  the  Indonesian government and  will,  as  I  mentioned

earlier, if  drawn down, be used basically to act as part of the

Indonesian government's foreign reserve.  It will have no impact

whatsoever  on  the  Singapore  Government's  current  operating

expenditures and therefore its surpluses, if there are  any,  so

that  there  should  be  no direct impact  on  the  Government's

programmes,  including  the upgrading programmes,  provided  the

Government continues to run current surpluses in its  budget  in

the next few years.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I have about three questions.  May I ask them altogether?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I had intended to ask the Prime Minister

these  questions but I see he is not in the House.   So  I  will

address them to the Finance Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should first of all like to know where and when was this

decision  taken to grant the assistance to Indonesia.  Secondly,

who took the decision?  Was it taken by the Cabinet or by any of

the Ministers?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1809</b></font><br><br>

Thirdly,  why  was the approval of Parliament not sought  before

the  decision was taken and the announcement made?  Finally, was

the  approval  of the President sought before the  decision  was

taken and the announcement made?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know

exactly  where and when the decision was made but it was several

weeks  ago, and the decision was taken by the Prime Minister  in

consultation with his senior advisers, which include the  Senior

Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and myself, and subsequently

the decision was approved by Cabinet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who took the decision? The Prime Minister ultimately,

including  his senior Ministers.  Why was Parliament's  approval

not  sought?   A  decision of this sort is entirely  within  the

prerogative  of the Executive.  It is no more than a  conversion

of  one loan to another form.  For example,  we buy from time to

time  large  quantities of, let us say, 5-year US  bonds.   This

loan  to Indonesia merely converts the US$ loan extended to  the

US  government  to a loan extended to Indonesia.   There  is  no

change  in the asset position.  Therefore, there is no  need  to

refer to Parliament.  Equally, for the same reason, there is  no

need  to  refer  the  matter to Parliament because  Parliament's

responsibility is to approve legislative matters and not to  get

involved in Executive decisions on a day-to-day basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's approval was not necessary because in 1980

President   Sheares  had  already  approved  the   purchase   of

Indonesian  assets  and  in  1986 President  Wee  Kim  Wee  also

approved   the  purchase  of  Indonesian  equities   and   these

Presidential  approvals  are  still  valid  notwithstanding  the

election  of  the  Elected President. If the  Elected  President

feels that there is something untoward which he dislikes he  can

still  veto  these actions but it does not require his  specific

approval.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  also like to ask a few questions for elaboration.  First,

I  would like to ask the Minister whether he could elaborate  on

the economic ties between Singapore and Indonesia.  As he

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1810</b></font><br><br>

mentioned, there are very close economic links between  the  two

countries,  eg, the trade ties between Indonesia  and  Singapore

and  what are the figures.  Secondly, could he elaborate on  the

reserve  that will be drawn upon and where will the  money  come

from?  Does it need us to sell off some of our foreign assets or

draw down on some of our own particular reserves held in various

currencies  and what sort of impact will it have  on  the  funds

that we have?  Thirdly, could the Minister elaborate on some  of

the  details of the loan, eg, the interest rate if  there  is  a

drawdown,  the repayment schedule and the terms of repayment?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> On the question of trade ties, I

will  refer his question to the Minister for Trade and Industry.

I  think  he will have occasion to speak later on some question.

He has the exact figures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where does the money come from? It comes from MAS' own

assets.   MAS manages a portfolio of substantial size and  holds

its  financial assets in various forms, largely financial assets

in  US  dollars, Deutsche Mark or Yen.  As I mentioned  earlier,

the  Indonesian loan is therefore a conversion of one asset form

to another, so it has no impact on MAS' reserve position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loan is a five-year facility drawn down on five

tranches  of  $1  billion each at the request of the  Indonesian

government.  It will be at commercial interest rate,  ie,  SIBOR

plus  a  premium,  SIBOR being six months US  dollar  inter-bank

interest  rate.  The loan will have to be repaid either  earlier

or the maximum of five years.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, as regards the 16

Indonesian  banks  that  were  asked  to  be  closed  by   their

government,  do  the  Singapore  Government  and  any  Singapore

Government related companies have an interest in them?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> As far as I am aware, none. These

are  relatively  small  banks  in  Indonesia.   Do  not  forget,

Indonesia  has  currently, I think, 256 banks and  this  is  the

first   phase   of  the  banking  reform  which   Indonesia   is

implementing.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1811</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister or perhaps the Prime

Minister, now that he is here, whether the decision was taken in

Jakarta,  or  was  it taken here?  And secondly,  how  does  the

Minister   or   the  Cabinet  reconcile  this  -   not   seeking

Parliament's  approval - with Article 144 of  the  Constitution,

and likewise not getting the President's approval?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The decision was taken in Singapore

and  conveyed  to  Indonesia.  It has to be, because  the  Prime

Minister and his advisors are in Singapore and he alone went  to

Indonesia  together with some aides.  I have  mentioned  earlier

that  there is no need for such a decision to be subject to  the

approval  of  the  President.  I do not know what  part  of  the

Constitution is he talking about.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It is Article 144 of the Constitution.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Perhaps to refresh my memory,

Article 144 refers to what?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, I am sorry. I have got the Article

now, and Article 144 says quite specifically:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No guarantee or loan shall be given or raised by the

Government -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;except under the authority of any resolution of Parliament

with which the President concurs;"

And  this  was an amendment which was made in 1991.   So,  going

back to 1986 and before that will not help us.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> No. I do not agree with his

interpretation.   As  far as I am aware, we have  the  Attorney-General's advice that such granting of loans and the purchase of

securities of this type had prior approval of two Presidents.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> What does the Minister think that Article

144 then tries to say?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I am not a lawyer. I shall not

argue  this with him.  I do not believe that it applies in  this

case.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I do not know whether the Minister has

answered my

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1812</b></font><br><br>

question.  Singapore being such a small country, why is there  a

necessity for Singapore to give such a big loan to Indonesia?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Chiam was not here when I

answered  the  question.  Because of our special  relation  with

Indonesia and the fact that Indonesia is our close neighbour and

the  largest  economy in ASEAN and its welfare is  critical  not

only to us but to all the countries in ASEAN, and because of the

special relationship between our leaders and President Suharto - I think these are very important reasons.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, is this $5 billion loan, $1

billion  per  year to be specific, significant to  prop  up  the

Indonesian economy?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> By itself, no. As I have mentioned

earlier,  it  is  a  back-up facility  which  we  are  providing

together with a number of other countries which needs only to be

drawn down if Indonesia's frontline defence of US$23 billion  is

fully used and they require supplement to hold up their external

reserves.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> If the answer is no, why do we need to

give such a large amount?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> It is a commitment; it is not

giving.  It is not a gift.  This is a commercial loan attracting

commercial interest rates.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Is there no risk that this loan will be

defaulted?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I have mentioned earlier that

neither  Thailand nor Indonesia has ever defaulted on  sovereign

loan   and  I  think  the  risk  is,  of  course,  always  there

potentially.   But neither is the purchase of a  $5  billion  US

bond totally risk-free.  One cannot say for certain that the  US

government will never default on its loans either.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The Minister will surely know that

buying  US bonds is completely different from making a  loan  to

Indonesia which is in financial trouble now.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1813</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> What is the difference, in

principle?  Are you saying that they are going to default?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Are you going to say that they are not

going to default?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Are you saying the US government is

not defaulting ever?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> No. I say that there is a difference.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> There is no difference.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> There is a difference between buying US

bonds  and  giving a loan to a country which is now in financial

trouble.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> They are temporarily in financial

trouble.  The purpose of the loan is to get them out of  it  and

they will pay back.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can we not give a smaller loan?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Perhaps he suggests $100 will do?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I know there are more urgent needs in

Singapore for money, especially at Potong Pasir.  The Government

is  refusing  even to spend money on building two MRT  stations.

And  here you are making large loans to other countries.  Surely

I am concerned.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Expenditures in Potong Pasir are

not restricted by reasons of generosity but whether they are  in

fact  useful,  and  there will be adequate funds  if  Government

considers they are necessary.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Is the Minister saying that because of

generosity we are giving such a big loan to Indonesia?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> It is not generosity. It is a

commercial loan earning interest.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> It is generosity.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I would like to move on a bit from

here.   I would like to clarify the answer given by the Minister

that  this  package  is  specially just for  Indonesia.   So  my

question to the Minister is: is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1814</b></font><br><br>

there  any  current  plan  to rescue  any  of  the  other  ASEAN

economies?  Or will the Government consider doing so if there is

a call for help?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> In addition to the Indonesian loan,

we have also extended US$1 billion facility to Thailand.  Beyond

that,  we do not see any other potential request from the  ASEAN

region.  But if there are, we have to think very hard because of

our extensive commitments already.

jams in Marsiling Estate and some parts of Woodlands New Town.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry whether the Government has taken the necessary  actions

to alleviate the frequent massive traffic jams at the Singapore-Johor   Causeway  and  whether  the  Singapore   and   Malaysian

governments will hold a meeting to resolve the problem and  find

a  long-term solution to ensure the free flow of goods, services

and people between Singapore and Malaysia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin</b> asked the Minister for Trade

and  Industry what is the impact the Causeway jam has caused  to

companies  in  Singapore and whether he will ask  the  Malaysian

government to take steps to ensure the smooth flow of traffic on

the Causeway.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, as Questions 4, 5 and 6 are related, may I  answer

them together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, you may.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1815</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Thank you. Mr Speaker, Sir, this

problem   began  in  late  September  when  the  Johor   Customs

implemented  stringent  checks on  both  outgoing  and  incoming

vehicles.   The  result was massive congestion at  the  Causeway

with  long  lorry  tailbacks from Johor Customs  Tanjong  Puteri

Complex.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, checks are conducted on a selective basis in line

with  the  Best Customs Practices' code advocated by  the  World

Customs  Organisation, of which both Singapore and Malaysia  are

members.  The sudden change in procedure resulted in long delays

of up to seven hours to clear the Johor Customs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jams at the Causeway have affected bilateral trade and

especially manufacturers with plants situated in both  Singapore

and  Johor.   Parts  and components are sent from  Singapore  to

Johor on a daily basis to be assembled, and then transported  to

their  Singapore plants on a Just-in-Time basis (JIT) for  final

assembly and distribution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any impediment to the free flow of cargo along the Causeway

disrupts production schedules, and directly impacts the Just-in-Time  concept  of modern factory operation.  To  overcome  this,

companies  on  both sides of the Causeway had to increase  their

inventories  and  rent  more  lorries  to  transport  parts  and

components, resulting in higher operating costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raised this issue with my Malaysian counterpart Rafidah

Aziz  at  the ASEAN Economic Ministers' Meeting in Kuala  Lumpur

last month.  Prime Minister Goh subsequently discussed the issue

with the Malaysian Prime Minister during bilateral talks at  the

recent  Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting  in  Edinburgh.

The  two  Prime  Ministers agreed that the  relevant  Ministries

would  look  into  the matter to see how it could  be  resolved.

Foreign Minister Jayakumar also followed up on the subject  with

his Malaysian counterpart Abdullah Badawi who said that he would

instruct the relevant Malaysian ministries to get in touch  with

their Singapore counterparts to deal with the problem.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1816</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, our Government agencies at the Woodlands

Checkpoint did all they could to alleviate the traffic jam.  The

Traffic  Police  increased  their  manpower  deployment  at  the

Checkpoint  and  Causeway  to manage  traffic,  as  well  as  to

facilitate the movement of Johor-bound lorries by allowing  them

to  occupy up to two lanes on the Causeway, instead of the usual

one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in the past two weeks appears to have

improved.   Nevertheless,  we  will  continue  to  monitor   the

situation  and,  if necessary, work with the relevant  Malaysian

authorities to ensure that the problem does not crop up again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opening of the second crossing next year will help to

reduce  traffic at the Causeway and minimise the traffic  queues

on  both Woodlands Road and the Bukit Timah Expressway.  LTA  is

also  building  a  new road system to serve  the  new  Woodlands

Checkpoint.  Part of the work includes improving the road scheme

around Woodlands Centre, so that traffic bound for the Woodlands

Checkpoint  will be separated from traffic bound  for  Marsiling

Estate  and  Woodlands New Town.  The new road  system  will  be

completed in 1999.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> May I ask the

Minister  whether  he anticipates that the recent  Causeway  jam

will  have a negative effect on companies' decisions to relocate

their investments to Johor?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Yes, I am sure it will have some impact

because  this casts a doubt on the feasibility of having  plants

distributed  in  various  parts  of  ASEAN,  especially  between

Singapore  and Johor.  The assumption of manufacturers  is  that

they   can  source  parts  and  components  easily  from  either

Singapore  or Malaysia for their factory in the other  location.

So  it is important to facilitate the free movement of parts and

components.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I read in the papers that the Singapore

Customs stepped up their checks for GST purposes.  Did that  not

increase the problem of the jam?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> This is done on the other side of the

Causeway for the cars

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1817</b></font><br><br>

coming back.  It is perfectly in order for us to check the  cars

because, with the GST and with the decline in the value  of  the

Malaysian  dollars, it is important to make  sure  that  we  are

collecting the GST which is due from the Singapore shoppers  who

have gone across the Causeway.  And there is a limit of $200 per

adult  for  those who go for less than 24 hours  and  half  that

amount  for children.  So the Customs were just doing their  job

when they did the checks.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, can I ask the Minister

whether  any  Singapore companies now operating  in  Johor  have

asked for EDB's assistance to relocate elsewhere?

Development, in view of the irregularity of supply of perishable

goods  caused by problems at the Johor customs checkpoint,  what

steps  is  the  Government taking to diversify  our  sources  of

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is conscious of the fact that

Singapore  will always be dependent on imports for most  of  our

food  requirements.  To be overly dependent on  any  one  source

will  subject Singaporeans to uncertainties in supply and higher

prices.  Primary Production Department (PPD) already has an  on-going programme to diversify our sources of fresh food.  Imports

are  encouraged from as many countries as possible  as  long  as

they fulfill our safety requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PPD works actively with our local importers to look out for

new sources which can provide a regular supply of fresh food  at

an  affordable  price.   PPD's  food  sourcing  programme  which

actively accredits new sources of safe fresh food

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1818</b></font><br><br>

offers  the  flexibility and opportunities to our  importers  to

diversify their sources and suppliers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure the House that PPD will continue with its

diversification  programme, and ensure  that  any  shortfall  in

fresh  food  supply from any source can be quickly  replaced  by

other sources.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPOREANS SHOPPING IN JOHOR BARU</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Loss in GST revenue)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  whether  he  is aware that as a  result  of  the  sharp

depreciation  of  the  Malaysian  ringgit,  large   numbers   of

Singaporeans  have been crossing the Causeway to shop  in  Johor

Baru, causing a severe drop in business for Singapore retailers,

especially  those  in Woodlands and, if so, whether  he  has  an

estimate  of  the  loss in GST revenue arising  from  this;  and

whether,  in  view  of this, he will review  the  GST  exemption

limits  on goods brought into Singapore, to reduce this  revenue

loss and to encourage Singaporeans to shop in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in recent weeks,

there has been an increase in the number of Singaporean shoppers

to  Johor  Baru  to  take advantage of the depreciation  of  the

Malaysian  ringgit  as  well as shopping sales  in  Johor  Baru.

Customs and Excise Department has stepped up GST checks  at  the

checkpoints  to  ensure that all Singaporean shoppers  returning

from Johor comply with the GST requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reasonable GST exemption is given for goods imported by

bona fide travellers.  The intention is to relieve a person from

paying GST on a reasonable amount of purchases he may bring into

Singapore.  Currently, an adult traveller, which is a person  18

years old and above, who had been away for more than 48 hours is

allowed  an  exemption from GST up to $400 of the value  of  the

goods  brought in.  If a traveller is below the age of 18 years,

the  GST  exemption is on the value of goods up  to  $200.   The

above limits are halved if he has been away less than 48 hours.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1819</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October this year, an average of about 7,000 Singapore

registered   cars   return  from  Malaysia   every   day.    If,

theoretically,  each  car contains purchases  up  to  $800  (the

maximum  GST  exemption on the assumption that each car  carries

four  adults, including the driver), the potential  GST  revenue

loss  per  year can be up to $60 million.  Even if  each  person

buys  only  up to half his GST exemption limit, the  loss  would

still  be  some $30 million.  In practice, of course, not  every

Singaporean is likely to use up his exemption limit and many  of

the day purchases are in the form of groceries and poultries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are constantly reviewing the GST system, including the

GST  exemption limits, to ensure that the GST system  introduced

only  three  years ago in 1994 is working well.   We  will  take

measures  to  safeguard  revenue  loss  arising  from  the   GST

exemption limits if the situation necessitates such a move.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, would it also

be  necessary  to  look at the fiscal measures relating  to  the

retail  trade in Singapore to see whether Singaporeans can  also

be positively encouraged to shop more in Singapore than in Johor

Baru?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I take it that the Member is

suggesting  tax  incentive  for domestic  consumption.   We  can

consider it, but I doubt it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, in view of the large

amount  of  potential revenue loss, would the  Minister  perhaps

consider  lifting  the GST exemption for travellers  across  the

Causeway?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> When he says "lifting", does he

mean  increasing it or reducing it?  Or does he mean  taking  it

out altogether?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> No exemption limit.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> That is a possibility. But of

course  a  reasonable  amount should be allowed  for  legitimate

travellers particularly tourists.  I think taking it out

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1820</b></font><br><br>

altogether would not be consistent with international  practice.

So  it  is  really a question of size and we will have to  judge

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The monthly Goods and Services Tax

<pre>

                         GST Monthly Collection

     FY 97                   at the Woodlands Checkpoint / S$

     May                      30,000

     June                     31,000

     July                     35,000

     September                34,000

     October                  49,000

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should point out that these collections are not from day

trippers buying groceries and so forth in Johor.  These are  GST

collections  from  traders who bring  in  goods  for  resale  in

Singapore and therefore they are subject to 3%.  Practically, no

Singaporean day tripper in fact exceeds this quota.  He is  very

careful.  So by and large, he does not pay any GST.

concerning the suitability of Mr

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1821</b></font><br><br>

Tang  Liang  Hong  for  selection  as  a  Nominated  Member   of

Parliament came to be released to the press.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was a member of the Select

Committee  that  deliberated  in  1992  on  the  appointment  of

Nominated Members of Parliament.  Several MPs had written to the

Committee  strenuously opposing Mr Tang Liang Hong's appointment

as  an  NMP.  The MPs had also spoken to BG Lee at the  time  to

express the same views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BG Lee told me about the MPs' views, and gave me copies of

the  letters during the last General Election.  He had asked the

Speaker for the letters as he did not have them with him on  the

day  he  spoke  to me about the MPs' views.  The letters  showed

clearly  that  Tang  was  a Chinese chauvinist.   I  decided  to

release  them  to  the media.  Tang was standing  for  election.

Singaporeans had a right to know before the election  that  long

before  Tang  contemplated  entering opposition  politics,  four

Chinese  educated MPs, plus Dr Tay Eng Soon,  all  of  whom  had

known Tang for many years, had concluded that he was a dangerous

extremist.   There  was nothing personal.  But  they  considered

Tang unfit to be a Nominated Member of Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By December 1996, Dr Tay Eng Soon had passed away. The

other MPs consented to their letters being made public.  The MPs

also   publicly  repeated,  confirmed  and  elaborated  on   the

statements  in  their letters.  There was  no  question  of  any

breach of confidentiality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand Tang being embarrassed by these letters,

which  were  written four years before he became a candidate  in

the  1996 elections, and therefore carried that much more weight

with  the  people  and the court.  But I am surprised  that  the

Workers'  Party, which has repeatedly pressed the Government  to

provide Singaporeans with more information to make up their  own

minds, should make an issue of the publication of the letters.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I assure the Prime

Minister that my purpose

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1822</b></font><br><br>

in  asking  this question was not for him to air  his  views  on

whether  Mr  Tang  Liang Hong is a Chinese chauvinist  or  anti-Christian.   My  question  was  directed  to  the  propriety  of

releasing  them to the press.  Is the Prime Minister aware  that

under  section  8 of the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities  and

Powers) Act, no publication of the papers may be allowed  except

on  the certificate of the Speaker?  Otherwise, the papers  lose

any   protection  in  any  proceedings  brought  against   them.

Secondly, is the Prime Minister aware that, under Standing Order

No.  30 of the Standing Orders of Parliament, the papers are  in

the  custody  of  the Clerk and they may not be released  except

upon the authority of the Speaker?  May I know whether all these

were complied with before they were released to the press by the

Prime Minister?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not look at the

Standing Orders.  The issue is a simple one.  The authors of the

letters  are the ones who decide whether the opinions  expressed

therein  are  to be kept confidential or not.   So  we  had  the

permission  of the authors of the letters and they could  easily

repeat in public those same opinions which were contained in the

letters,  which they did, not just once but several times,  with

telling blows during the General Election.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Prime

Minister  whether he thinks that it is enough to say that  those

who  wrote the letters consented?  May I ask him whether  it  is

not  a question of the privileges of Parliament that is in issue

here?   They  were letters written to the Speaker in  confidence

and  they become Parliament papers.  Were they released  to  the

press  in accordance with the Standing Orders and section  8  of

the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act?  That is

my question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have explained the

circumstances in which I released the letters and I  still  hold

the  view that it is entirely appropriate for me to do so.  When

a  person  stands for election, he must be prepared for whatever

character flaws, if he had, to be exposed by the PAP.   This  is

what we stand

for.   If  there  is anything which we know about  a  particular

candidate, which is of public interest, we are going  to  reveal

and  what are the strategic policies and measures the Government

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Question No. 11, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I answer Question

Nos. 11 and 12 together as they are related?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> As the Singapore economy is closely

linked  to  the  region, it will inevitably be affected  if  the

regional  currency  crisis continues  for  a  prolonged  period.

However,  the  impact on the real economy has been  marginal  so

far.   There  was  some impact on the volume of  re-exports  and

visitor  arrivals.  Nevertheless, economic growth picked  up  in

the  third  quarter to 10.1% compared with 8.2%  in  the  second

quarter.   For the whole of 1997, we are on track to  achieve  a

GDP growth rate of about 7%.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1824</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two main factors have provided underlying support for our

healthy growth this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Firstly, we are benefiting from the recovery in global

electronics  demand, with favourable spin-off effects  on  trade

and hub services;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Secondly, a large part of Singapore's regional trade

consists  of intra-firm movement of parts, components and  final

products  by  multi-national  companies.   As  demand  from  the

eventual  markets of the US and EC remained strong,  Singapore's

trade  was  not  seriously  affected by  the  regional  currency

crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead into 1998, we can expect some moderation in

growth.   The sustained global electronics recovery and expected

healthy growth in the US and EU will continue to provide  strong

underlying  support for Singapore's economic  growth.   However,

the  regional  financial  turmoil  is  expected  to  affect  our

services sector somewhat.  Activity in the commerce sector  will

be  dampened  by  fewer visitor arrivals from  ASEAN  and  lower

spending   from   those  who  come,  reflecting  their   reduced

purchasing  power.   Re-export trade may  also  be  affected  by

cutbacks  on  imports  to  the region, although  this  would  be

somewhat  offset by the electronics recovery.  Any  slowdown  in

trade  would  also  have  a  negative  knock-on  impact  on  the

transportation sector.  The financial services sector is  likely

to  see  slower growth in the Asian Dollar Market next  year  as

major  infrastructure  projects in  the  region  are  postponed.

General uncertainty about the region could also keep funds  away

and  dampen  the fund management industry, although fundamentals

in  the  region  remain sound and when the currency  and  equity

markets   stabilise,  foreign  funds  could  return   within   a

relatively  short period, to seek good investment  opportunities

at  attractive  lower  levels.  Taking all  these  factors  into

consideration, MTI's preliminary GDP forecast for 1998 is 5%-7%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This currency crisis has highlighted the importance of

fiscal prudence and sound financial management.  Singapore has a

strong current account surplus which

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1825</b></font><br><br>

stands  at  15% of our GDP.  The Government budget has  been  in

surplus  for  many years and there has been no  need  to  borrow

money  for  public  expenditure.   The  MAS  has  imposed   high

prudential standards on our financial institutions.  Our foreign

reserves are strong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors have remained confident of Singapore's economic

prospects,  despite  the regional financial turmoil.   Recently,

MNCs  like  3M  and Molex announced their plans to expand  their

plants  in  Singapore.   In  the  third  quarter  of  1997,  the

manufacturing sector registered investment commitments of  S$2.2

billion in fixed assets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry does not expect the depreciation of the

regional  currencies  against the Singapore  dollar  to  have  a

serious  impact  on our export competitiveness, although  it  is

monitoring   the   situation  and  will  recommend   appropriate

measures,  if  necessary.   Although the  Singapore  dollar  has

appreciated  against the regional currencies, it is  competitive

on  a  trade-weighted  basis as it has depreciated  against  the

currencies of most developed countries.  With about half of  our

exports  going  to the OECD countries, the depreciation  against

these currencies will help our exports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The composition of Singapore's exports of goods and

services  is also different from those of other ASEAN countries.

Over  the years, we have upgraded our manufacturing and  service

sectors  to stay ahead of our regional competitors in  terms  of

technology, skill content and value added.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To remain competitive, we have to continually improve our

productivity  by  upgrading  our capabilities  and  moving  into

higher value added activities.  The Government will continue  to

invest  heavily in education and training, improve our  business

infrastructure, optimise the use of our limited land and  labour

resources, and keep a close track of our cost situation so  that

we remain internationally competitive.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, with the currency and stock market

turmoil,  our economy has performed rather well during the  last

quarter.  My question is: in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1826</b></font><br><br>

the  absence of a turmoil, would our performance be better  than

the  given  percentage?  Also, if there  were  to  be  a  speedy

recovery  in  terms  of  currencies and stock  markets  in  this

region, would the prospect for 1998 be better than 5-7%?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> On the first question, the answer must be

yes.   There  has  been  some impact, eg, in  terms  of  tourist

arrivals and this has also affected the retail trade.   I  think

the  impact would probably be greater in the fourth quarter than

in  the  third  quarter,  and this is  compounded  by  the  haze

problem.   We have to tell our foreign visitors from Europe  and

elsewhere that the haze has, in fact, cleared.  But the  message

is still there, ie, there is a haze problem here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The currency turmoil has affected us in different ways. In

the  real economy, in manufacturing, in fact, we have done  very

well  and  we  are geared for further growth.  We have  recently

completed  a petrochemical project.  Our electronic  plants  are

doing  well and the world economic recovery has set  in  in  the

field   of   electronics.   For  next  year,  if  the  situation

stabilises and the funds start to come back and the stock market

picks  up, obviously the situation would be better.  But  it  is

hard to say how much without proper estimation.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, to the extent that the other ASEAN

countries  as  well  as  Korea  are  able  to  effect   a   real

depreciation  of  their  currencies,  would  not  the   Minister

anticipate that there will be greater cost competitive pressures

on  Singapore, and also that there will actually  be  a  greater

outflow  of  investments from Singapore as  a  result  of  this,

bearing in mind that it is not just the ASEAN countries but also

our  competitors, eg, Korea, that have depreciated in  terms  of

their currencies?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> As I have mentioned, relative to the

ASEAN  countries, our export composition is somewhat  different.

For example, Indonesia is still very dependent on exports of oil

and  natural produce and their manufactured goods are lower  end

products.   Our  closest competitor is probably  Malaysia.   But

there again, we are ahead of them in terms of the skill content.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1827</b></font><br><br>

We  are higher up the value added ladder.  We will have to  keep

ahead of them.  Where we are exporting the same kind of products

to  the  same  markets, then they may have a cost  advantage  in

terms  of  their lower local cost.  But if they are importing  a

lot of components, for example, and the value added component is

really not very big, the question is whether they can keep their

cost  down.  There will be higher inflation, there will be  wage

pressures and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relative to the NIEs - Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea - in

fact, they are worried that ASEAN currencies having depreciated,

apart  from  the Singapore dollar which has also depreciated  by

about  10%, the others have gone down by about 30-40%.   Taiwan,

in  fact,  has  allowed its currency to come down  in  order  to

compete  and  its situation is somewhat similar to  ours.   Hong

Kong  is  still maintaining its peg and this has been translated

into impact on the interest rate as well as the real economy and

the stock market.  Korea is in a rather difficult situation.  We

have to watch and see.  But there again, they have tried to keep

their currency at a certain level, which is rather high relative

to the US dollar.  Of late, it has come down.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, I am aware that the Chinese

Renminbi  has been rather stable and unhurt thus far.  I  wonder

whether it is going to have an impact on our economy next year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> The Chinese Renminbi is controlled

because it is a closed situation.  The Chinese government  will,

of  course, monitor and they may have to adjust.  I do not know.

It  is  up to them.  But so far, the country is performing  very

well and the growth rate is very high.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said in my answer, we will have to assess and monitor

and  see how it goes.  So far, it looks all right.  In fact,  in

terms  of  the investment flow to Singapore, we are still  doing

very  well.   EDB  is still very confident and, if anything,  we

are  in  a  somewhat  stronger position  now  in  terms  of  our

stability  and ability to sustain real activity.  And confidence

of investors in Singapore is very high.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1828</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, the reason for Singapore companies

regionalising is because of more attractive markets  abroad  and

because  of  supply constraints internally, but also because  of

cost  pressures in Singapore.  Does the Minister not expect that

to  the  extent  that  there  is a  real  devaluation  by  these

countries,  actually  there  would  be  a  greater  outflow   of

investments from Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> In Singapore's case, we cannot avoid

having this effect.  If we try and keep everything in Singapore,

we  will  end up strangling ourselves.  So the lower  value  end

will,  in fact, have to go offshore and we have to look  to  the

region and further afield as possible areas where we can enlarge

our  economic scope.  Our aim should be to go higher.  In  fact,

we are working closely with the Indonesians in Batam, Bintan and

so  on, to the extent that it is more attractive now for them to

go overseas.  In fact, we can encourage and help some of them to

go overseas so long as what is remaining here is upgraded and we

have full employment.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> To the extent that there is indeed an

acceleration    of   offshore   investments   from    Singapore,

particularly  of the lower end, would the Minister  expect  then

that  there would actually be some more medium term effect, say,

for example, on unskilled workers in Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> For the moment, I remain optimistic. As

I have said, we will monitor the situation.  In fact, we have so

many  foreign workers here.  For the longer term, we have to  be

careful  and  make  sure that our older  workers  who  are  less

educated are retrained for the higher value jobs.  As of now,  I

am completely optimistic of the situation.

<div align="center"><b>FINANCIAL SECTOR IN SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Supervision with a lighter touch)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Zainul

Abidin Rasheed -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. To ask the Minister for Finance, despite the recent

regional  currency  and  stock market  turmoil  and  calls  from

certain sectors for greater regulation on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1829</b></font><br><br>

speculative activities, if he will elaborate on the reasons  for

the  need  for  Singapore  to call for the  supervision  of  the

financial sector with a lighter touch.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Question No. 13, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the calls from

certain  quarters for more regulation of speculative  activities

relate to the recent volatile movements in foreign exchange  and

stock  markets which have depressed the value of currencies  and

share  prices in the region.  The belief is that some  mechanism

should  be  introduced to control speculative  foreign  exchange

activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These calls are unrelated to the concept of regulating

Singapore's financial sector with a "lighter touch", as outlined

by  DPM  BG  Lee  in his speech to SESDAQ on 4th November  1997.

Regulating with a "lighter touch" does not mean the lowering  of

supervisory  standards.   The maintenance  of  high  supervisory

standards  will remain a cornerstone of Singapore's  development

as a financial centre.  It means modifying the style and balance

of  regulation and supervision.  The proposal is to set  clearer

rules to encourage the private sector to play a greater role and

to  allow  more  innovation, but to  accompany  this  with  more

comprehensive supervision to ensure compliance.  The reason  for

this  change  in  approach is the need  to  respond  to  rapidly

changing banking technology and international competition.  This

is a strategic shift in approach which we must do independent of

the short-term economic ups and downs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1829</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>EN-BLOC SALES IN PRIVATE CONDOMINIUMS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Lew Syn Pau</b> asked the Minister for Law whether he

will  consider  making it easier for en-bloc  sales  in  private

condominiums to be effected.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Law):</b> Sir, the current requirement is for

all  the owners to agree before an en-bloc sale can take  place.

We have received appeals from frustrated owners whose efforts at

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1830</b></font><br><br>

selling  their flats or condominiums en-bloc have been  thwarted

by a very small minority.  In these cases, the vast majority are

unable  to proceed to sell their residential developments  at  a

premium,  in  order  to  maximise their  development  potential.

There is also a public interest because rejuvenation of estates,

through en-bloc sales of older developments, cannot be realised.

Government recognises that there is a problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a basic principle, the Government has never allowed

development in the overwhelming interests of the majority to  be

held   up  by  a  minority.   Compulsory  land  acquisition   to

facilitate comprehensive development is an example.  It  defeats

national objectives if changes in Development Guide Plans cannot

be  translated into better utilisation of scarce land  resources

in  those  cases because disagreements have held up or prevented

en-bloc sales.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will therefore amend the law to make it easier for en-bloc sales to be effected by removing the requirement to obtain

the  agreement of 100% of owners.  However, we will ensure  that

there  are  appropriate safeguards to protect  minority  owners,

such as ensuring that the purchase price is fair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a practice will not be peculiar to Singapore. In some

Canadian states and Hawaii, owners' unanimous agreement  is  not

required  to  terminate a strata-titled development.   In  those

states,  land  is  abundant.  In land-scarce Singapore,  such  a

change  is  even more imperative, as it will release more  prime

land  for higher-intensity developments to provide more  quality

housing for Singaporeans.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, if the Government is going to amend

the  law  to  allow the majority to have their  way  in  en-bloc

development,  how  many  per cent of  the  residents  must  give

consent before this en-bloc development is allowed?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, we are still looking at the

figures.   Currently, it is 100%.  We have examples  from  other

countries. In  the  examples that I  stated,  in  Ontario  and

British  Columbia in Canada and Hawaii, it ranges  from  75-80%,

but

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1831</b></font><br><br>

that  is  only a guide.  We are still looking at the figures  to

see  what percentage will be appropriate to balance the interest

of both the majority owners and the minority owners.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta-Ayer Tanglin):</b> Sir, when will the new

laws come into effect?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, we will need to amend the

Land Titles Strata Act.  We hope to finalise our position by the

end of this year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I know of certain cases of

residents  who  oppose en-bloc development.  It is  not  because

they  do not want the place to be improved, but there are  cases

of  persons  who  are widows and who are living  alone  with  no

relatives.  In such cases, it is difficult for them to move out.

The Minister spoke about safeguards.  Will such persons be taken

care of?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Where the minority owners are

concerned, we are providing for appeals to, possibly,  a  board.

But because there are so many other factors that may be involved

if  we  go away from what is a "fair price", I think it will  be

difficult for the board to decide other than that the price is a

fair  price.  I think if Mr Chiam knows the situation, when this

arises, it is very often a matter of the majority talking to the

minority, and sometimes even talking to the developers, so  that

the  person who does not want to move out, he or she  strikes  a

deal  with the developer who is developing the land so that that

person will have a first right of refusal for a new unit in  the

block.

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1833</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government Procurement Bill seeks to legislate the

basic  framework  for  Singapore's implementation  of  the  1994

Agreement  on Government Procurement ("GPA" in short) negotiated

under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation or WTO.   The

Bill  sets  out the scope of Singapore's Government  procurement

covered  by  the GPA and the regulations governing the  receipt,

process  and  disposal of any complaint or  "bid  challenge"  by

suppliers   of   any  alleged  non-compliance   with   the   GPA

requirements  by Government Ministries, Departments,  Organs  of

State and Statutory Boards.

<br><br><i>Background to the GPA</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GPA took effect on 1st January 1996. It is an

international framework designed to make government  procurement

more  transparent, and to ensure that Government do not  protect

domestic  products  and  suppliers,  nor  discriminate   against

foreign products and suppliers.  The GPA requires that signatory

members  shall  not discriminate against the products,  services

and suppliers of another member.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently 25 GPA members, including the United

States of America, Canada, United Kingdom, Israel, Japan, Korea,

Hong  Kong  and most of the European Union countries.     It  is

thus  beneficial for Singapore to accede to the GPA.  It is also

a  re-affirmation of Singapore's open and transparent Government

and  our  commitment to the open multi-lateral  trading  system.

Singapore's application to join the GPA was approved by the  WTO

on 20th September 1996.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The predecessor of GPA is the Tokyo Round Government

Procurement  Code, which came into effect on 1st  January  1981.

It  covered  the procurement of goods at the central  government

level.   Singapore is a signatory to the Tokyo Round  Government

Procurement  Code.    The  GPA  goes  beyond  the  Tokyo   Round

Government  Procurement  Code  by offering  services,  including

construction; procurement by sub-central government, ie, states,

provinces and prefectures;  as well as procurement by government-related or linked entities.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1834</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GPA will cover procurement of goods and services by our

Ministries and Organs of State and 25 statutory boards.

<br><br><i>Singapore's Government procurement system</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has always practised an open and competitive

system   of  Government  procurement.     The  three  principles

underpinning Singapore's public procurement policies are :

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Open, fair, competitive and transparent rules and

procedures.   The processes and procedures of submitting tenders

for  Government  projects  are well publicised  and  adhered  to

strictly;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Honesty and integrity in the evaluation of tenders and

quotations; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Value for money based on overall cost-effectiveness and

efficiency.    This ensures that we stretch the  tax-dollar  and

keep the cost of Government low.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These principles have stood us in good stead over the years

and  have  earned us a high reputation amongst  both  local  and

international  suppliers and contractors.   The  private  sector

knows that it cannot win Government projects through connections

or  under-the-table methods.  As they know that  the  Government

will  be  rational in its evaluation of tenders, many have  also

proposed  better  and  more cost-effective  alternatives,  hence

helping us to operate more efficiently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, we have improved the system to make it more

efficient  and effective.  For example, we now post tenders  and

award  information on the Internet under the Government Internet

Tendering  Information System (GITIS).  Any  supplier  from  any

part  of  the  globe  can  access easily  and  cheaply  collated

information  on  tenders  called by the  Government  Ministries,

Departments and Statutory Boards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GPA requirements are congruous with our procurement

principles.    We have no fundamental problems adhering  to  the

GPA  requirements.    Some administrative  changes  are  however

necessary.    For example, GPA imposes a minimum

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1835</b></font><br><br>

tendering period of 40 days, longer than our present minimum  of

21 days;  and a bid-challenge system has to be instituted.

<br><br><i>Provisions of the Bill</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now bring Members through the salient provisions of

the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) First, the Bill provides for the identification of the

procurement entities and types of procurement to be subjected to

the GPA, the method of valuing each procurement to determine  if

it  is within the GPA threshold value, and types of  procurement

that  could  be excluded, as provided for by the  GPA,  such  as

those  on grounds of national security, defence, public  morals,

order  or  safety,  human, animal or plant  life  or  health  or

intellectual  property, or products or services  of  handicapped

persons and of philanthropic institutions;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Secondly, the Bill specifies the procurement procedures

in respect of:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the technical specifications to be included in tender

documents;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the procedures for the qualification of suppliers;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the procedures for the award of a procurement contract;

and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) the collation and provision of information on

procurement activities of entities covered under the GPA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill sets out the provisions for the bid

challenge  system. This is required under the GPA to provide  an

avenue  through  which aggrieved suppliers can lodge  complaints

over  alleged non-compliance with the GPA requirements, and seek

compensation.    This   is   to  be  implemented   through   the

establishment of a Government Procurement Adjudication Tribunal.

Its  members will comprise a Commissioner and a number of Deputy

Commissioners.  The hearing of the challenge will be done either

by  the  Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner.  Procedures  and

rules  governing  the  lodging and hearing  of  the  challenges,

consistent with the GPA

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1836</b></font><br><br>

requirements, have been included.    Powers of the Tribunal such

as  those relating to the proceedings, costs and damages  to  be

awarded and suspension of procurement are spelt out in the Bill.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector in Singapore has, over the years, built

up high standards of integrity, honesty and efficiency in public

procurement.   The Government Procurement Bill will  bring  some

aspects  of  our public procurement policies and  procedures  in

line  with  other  GPA  signatories.  This will  help  Singapore

companies  in  supplying goods and services  to  the  government

agencies  of  GPA members.  At the same time, it re-affirms  our

commitment  to our own high standards of public procurement  and

our commitment to the open global multi-lateral trading system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you for letting me speak on the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the Bill shows the Singapore

Government's  support  for international relations  as  well  as

multi-lateral  trade.   It  is gratifying  that  this  Bill  has

provision  for  mediation, which is a feature  of  our  judicial

system.  This will help in resolving disputes.  However, Sir,  I

am a little disturbed as clause 7(3) takes away the power of the

Court, but it is reassuring that clause 8 has provision for  the

setting up of a Tribunal.  Sir, may I first read clause 7(3)?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A breach of a duty referred to in subsection (1) shall not

be  the  subject of any proceedings in any court but may be  the

subject of a challenge brought before the Tribunal by a supplier

to  whom  the  duty is owed and who has suffered, or  reasonably

risks suffering, loss or damage as a result of the breach."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while it is reassuring that the Tribunal would look

after  the  interest of the aggrieved supplier, it is  a  little

disturbing that in the UK a High Court Judge hears the  dispute,

but  in Singapore the Tribunal is to be headed by a layman.   To

give  assurance to the public at large, may I urge the  Minister

to consider a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1837</b></font><br><br>

provision which we have in other statutes as well, such  as  the

Maintenance of Parents Tribunal or Strata Titles Board.  It  has

been  the  practice  in this country to have a legally-qualified

man,  and  if  he  is  not happy that he should  have  the  same

qualification as a High Court Judge, may I urge him to  consider

a  person  who  is legally qualified.  There is no  shortage  of

talents  in Singapore and there are many lawyers who  have  more

than 10 years of standing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Tribunal would have to deal with disputes and

lawyers  would  have  the right of audience,  and  questions  of

evidence and procedures have to be looked at.  I would urge  the

House  to  consider  the position of having a  legally-qualified

person to head the Tribunal.  I am happy with the provision that

there  is  a  Commissioner and a number of Deputy Commissioners.

There  are two ways of going about it. Either we have a legally-qualified person  or we could have a panel of three, of whom one

must  be  the chair person, ie, the Commissioner or  the  Deputy

Commissioner, who must be legally-qualified.  I leave it to  the

Minister's  discretion.   But  as  the  Tribunal  has  the  same

immunity  as  that of the High Court, perhaps the  Minister  may

consider having a person who is qualified under the Constitution

to  be  a  High  Court  Judge  to be a  Commissioner  or  Deputy

Commissioner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am mindful of the fact that we should not clog up

our  court  but  in  order to give confidence  to  the  business

community  and  the public, it would be in the interest  of  the

trade  to have a person who is legally-qualified.  I would  urge

the  Minister to reconsider this because all we have  got  under

clause 8(4) is:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No person shall be appointed or shall continue to hold

office as Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner if he -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) is of unsound mind;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) is an undischarged bankrupt or has made any arrangement

or composition with his creditors; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) is convicted of an offence involving dishonesty, fraud or

moral turpitude or has not received a free pardon."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are rather prohibitive qualifications. What we

require are some positive

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1838</b></font><br><br>

qualifications  to  show that the person who  is  heading  is  a

person who is capable of discharging his duties.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I just want to seek a

clarification from the Minister.  If this Bill comes  about,  if

we  accede  to the Agreement on Government Procurement  made  at

Marrakesh  on  15th April 1994, what advantage  do  we  have  by

implementing  this Bill to keep in line with the  provisions  of

this Agreement on Government Procurement that is internationally

recognised?   What  are the advantages to us?   Is  it  not  our

Government  itself,  without  joining  this  international  body

agreement, able to maintain a high standard of procurement?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> To answer the NMP's question first,

I take the point about the Member's concern over the possibility

that  non-legally  qualified people may be appointed  to  become

Commissioner and Deputy Commissioners.  But our proposal  really

is  to  provide flexibility so that persons who do not meet  the

qualifications of High Court Judges can also be appointed to  be

Commissioner, in order to widen the scope of people who  can  be

appointed.   There are many cases where very experienced  people

who know the Government procurement procedures will probably act

and  serve  better  than  a legally qualified  person.   We  are

talking  here  about a very specific and narrow field  of  legal

interpretation.   Therefore, we will certainly  take  his  point

into  account  in the appointment of suitably qualified  people,

preferably with the legal qualifications which he has mentioned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, many people who would eminently fulfil the

role of Commissioner may not start off their careers as lawyers.

And  we  do not want to miss out the possibility of using  these

people  to act as Commissioner or Deputy Commissioners.   It  is

quite  clear  that the pool of candidates in Singapore  for  the

Bench  is very limited and to impose further demands on them,  I

think,  would  be probably not wise, and it may be difficult  to

fill  these several positions if we had to confine ourselves  to

those with the legal qualifications alone.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1839</b></font><br><br>

Unlike  High Court Judges whose cases span a very wide spectrum,

the  Tribunal  Commissioner and Deputy  Commissioner  relate  to

Government procurement only.  Therefore, I think the flexibility

we  are asking for under this Bill is really our objective.  But

the  points  he  has raised are well taken and we will  consider

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question by Mr Chiam, I agree that our present

procurement  procedures are more than  adequate.   In  fact,  in

many cases, it probably exceeds the GPA requirements.  But it is

good  for us to join an international arrangement of this  sort,

not  only  because it suggests that we have nothing to hide  but

the  other advantage, of course, is when our suppliers of  goods

and  services  go  to other countries to tender  for  Government

projects, they would be more acceptable to the host countries if

they  know  we in Singapore also accede to the GPA requirements.

So  there is an advantage clearly in joining, even though it may

be marginal in our case.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> If we are a member of this

international convention, would that not open the floodgates  to

other  contractors  coming into Singapore in fierce  competition

with our own contractors, especially supplying services?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> This situation already exists

because we are not restricting anybody from coming in.  So I  do

not think that really changes the situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.

<div align="center"><b>HAZARDOUS WASTE (CONTROL OF EXPORT, IMPORT AND TRANSIT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to provide for the regulation of the

export,  import and transit of hazardous and other  wastes,  and

for related purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 2nd January 1996, Singapore acceded to the Basel

Convention   on  the  Control  of  Transboundary  Movements   of

Hazardous  Wastes and their Disposal.  The Convention came  into

force  in Singapore on 1st April 1996.  Currently, 113 countries

and  the  European  Union are Parties to the  Basel  Convention.

Besides   Singapore,   four  other  ASEAN   countries,   namely,

Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Vietnam have also  ratified

the Convention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will enable us to fulfil our obligations

under  the Basel Convention.  Before I proceed to highlight  the

major  provisions of the Bill, I would like to inform the  House

of our obligations under the Convention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as a Party to the Convention, we will not permit the

export  of  hazardous  and other wastes to  Parties  which  have

prohibited the import of such wastes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that

the generation of hazardous and other wastes within Singapore is

reduced to a minimum.  We must have adequate facilities to treat

and  dispose  of the wastes in an environmentally sound  manner.

We will ensure that transboundary movements of hazardous

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1841</b></font><br><br>

and  other  wastes  are  reduced to  a  minimum.   Transboundary

movements will be conducted in a manner that will protect  human

health and the environment against any adverse effects which may

arise from such movements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we will prevent the import of hazardous and other

wastes if we have reasons to believe that the wastes in question

will not be managed in an environmentally sound manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, we will consider that illegal traffic in hazardous

or other wastes is criminal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, we will not permit hazardous and other wastes to be

exported  to  a  non-Party or to be imported from  a  non-Party.

However,  Article  11  of  the Convention  allows  us  to  trade

hazardous and other wastes with a non-Party if we enter  into  a

bilateral agreement with the non-Party.  The provisions of  such

agreement  must  not be less environmentally  sound  than  those

provided for by the Convention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although Singapore only acceded to the Convention in

January 1996, the Government has all along been deeply concerned

with  the  potential  threat  posed  by  hazardous  wastes.   My

Ministry   has  been  regulating  the  generation,   collection,

transportation   and  disposal  of  such  wastes   through   the

Environmental    Public   Health   (Toxic   Industrial    Waste)

Regulations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996, about 64,000 tonnes of hazardous wastes were

generated  by  a  wide range of industries, ranging  from  motor

vehicle   workshops  to  the  large  petroleum  refineries   and

petrochemical  complexes  in Singapore.   The  hazardous  wastes

included  spent  acids,  solvents  and  etchants,  waste   oils,

pathogenic  wastes  and  so on.  These hazardous  wastes  are  a

potential  public  health problem.  We need  to  comprehensively

manage them to avoid contaminating our precious water resources,

waterways and scarce land resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, most of the hazardous wastes generated in

Singapore  are collected for specialised treatment and  disposal

locally.  However, small quantities of wastes, such

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1842</b></font><br><br>

as   PCB   (polychlorinated  biphenyl),   spent   Nickel-Cadmium

batteries, spent catalysts, chlorobenzene wastes, and so on, are

exported  to  countries such as the United Kingdom,  France  and

Japan  for  treatment and recycling.  We lack the facilities  to

treat  and recycle these wastes here.  Such wastes are  exported

with the prior approval of the environmental authorities of  the

importing countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Environmental Public Health (Toxic Industrial Waste)

Regulations were promulgated for the control of hazardous wastes

within  Singapore.  They are consequently limited in  scope  and

intent.   This  Bill enables us to fulfil our obligations  under

the  Convention.   In  preparing the  Bill,  officials  from  my

Ministry   and  the  Attorney-General's  Chambers  studied   the

legislation of developed countries, like Australia, and  adopted

or adapted provisions which were relevant and appropriate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will provide a legal framework for the control of

hazardous  wastes  and regulate the transboundary  movements  of

such  wastes  through Singapore.  The Bill  also  sets  out  the

requirements  and  procedures  for  the  export  and  import  of

hazardous  wastes with non-Parties of the Convention.   It  will

act  as  a  deterrent against illegal trafficking  of  hazardous

wastes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now highlight the major provisions that are

being introduced in this Bill.

<br><br><i>Definition of Hazardous Wastes and Other Wastes</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill covers all the hazardous wastes that

are listed in the Basel Convention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Convention, if a Party to the Convention

classifies  as  hazardous, a waste which is not  listed  in  the

Basel  Convention, the waste shall be deemed to be  a  hazardous

waste.  This requirement is provided for in clause 5.

Control of Export and Import of Hazardous and Other Wastes

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 25 and 26 of the Bill allow ENV to impose full and

complete control on the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1843</b></font><br><br>

export  and  import of hazardous and other wastes.  Under  these

clauses, any person who intends to export any hazardous waste or

other  wastes  from Singapore will need to apply for  an  Export

Permit  from  my  Ministry.  Environment will  issue  an  Export

Permit to the applicant provided that -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the State of Import is a Party to the Convention or has a

bilateral  agreement to trade hazardous and  other  wastes  with

Singapore  if  the  State  of Import  is  not  a  Party  to  the

Convention, as allowed for in the Convention;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) there are no suitable treatment and disposal facilities

for such wastes in Singapore;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) a Prior Informed Consent from the Competent Authority of

the  State  of Import as well as the States of Transit,  if  the

wastes are transited through other states, must be obtained; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the wastes can be treated and disposed of in an

environmentally sound manner in the State of Import.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, any person who intends to import any hazardous

or  other wastes into Singapore will need to apply for an Import

Permit from my Ministry.  ENV will issue an Import Permit to the

applicant  provided he is able to comply with all the  specified

conditions.

<br><br><i>Control of Transit of Hazardous and Other Wastes</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under clause 6 of the Bill, transit means to bring

hazardous  or  other wastes into Singapore for  the  purpose  of

being carried to a foreign country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 27, any person who intends to bring such

wastes  into Singapore for transit to another country will  need

to apply for a Transit Permit from my Ministry.  The requirement

will cover the following situations:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, vessels bringing in hazardous and other wastes into

and leaving Singapore waters without unloading the wastes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1844</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, vessels unloading hazardous and other wastes in the

port  and  the  wastes are subsequently re-loaded  onto  another

vessel for another country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENV will issue a Transit Permit to the applicant provided

that -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the applicant has the proper documents pertaining to

the  export and import of the wastes from the States  of  Export

and Import; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the wastes can be transported safely through Singapore.

<br><br><i>Trading of Hazardous and Other Wastes with Non-Party States</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 11 of the Convention allows for a Party to trade

hazardous  and other wastes with a non-Party provided that  both

Parties  enter  into a bilateral agreement or arrangement  whose

provisions  are  not  less  environmentally  sound  than   those

provided for by the Convention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 provides for Singapore to enter into an agreement

or  arrangement with a non-Party to trade in hazardous and other

wastes.   Such  agreements or arrangements, if  made,  shall  be

published in the Government Gazette.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 of the Bill allows the Minister to make

regulations to give effect to such Article 11 arrangements.

<br><br><i>Environmentally Sound Management of Hazardous or Other Wastes</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Convention requires that Parties treat and dispose of

hazardous  and other wastes in an environmentally sound  manner.

This  means taking all practical steps to ensure that the  waste

is  managed in a manner that will protect human health  and  the

environment  against the adverse effects that  may  result  from

such  wastes.  This requirement is provided for in clause  8  of

the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 provides for the Minister to make regulations for

guidelines and standards for any person who intends to carry out

treatment  and  disposal of hazardous  or  other  wastes  in  an

environmentally sound manner in Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1845</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Exemption of Naval Vessel, Military Aircraft, etc.</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Convention does not apply to any vessel or aircraft

belonging  to the naval, military or air forces of Singapore  or

any  other country.  This is because the Basel Convention is not

meant  for the control of movements of naval vessels or military

aircraft.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the Basel Convention, clause 12 exempts any

vessel  or  aircraft  belonging to the naval,  military  or  air

forces of Singapore or any other country from the provisions  of

this Act.

<br><br><i>Act Binds the Government</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 13 of the Bill binds the Government. In other

words,  Government  departments and  statutory  boards  are  not

exempted from compliance with the provisions of the Bill.

<br><br><i>Prohibition of Import, Export and Transit</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 25 to 27 of the Bill prohibit the unauthorised

import,  export and transit of hazardous or other  wastes.   Any

person who imports, exports or transits hazardous or other waste

without a Permit shall be guilty of an offence.  In the case  of

an   individual,   the  maximum  penalty  is  $100,000   or   an

imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or both.  In the

case  of  a  company,  the  maximum fine  is  $300,000  and  the

directors, managers or other similar officers of the company may

also be charged in court for the offence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the stringent penalties are necessary to deter illegal

trafficking and dumping of hazardous and other wastes.

<br><br><i>Liability and Compensation</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a Legal Working Group has been set up under the

Basel  Convention  to  develop  a  protocol  on  liability   and

compensation to deal with damages arising from the transboundary

movements of hazardous or other wastes.  The protocol has yet to

be completed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 enables ENV to make regulations to give effect to

the protocol when it is completed and accepted by Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1846</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding this, clause 48(d) allows the Minister to

make  regulations to deal with such incidents and recover  costs

from the offenders.

<br><br><i>Enforcement</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 28 to 34 empower the Director and other authorised

officers to take enforcement actions against persons engaging in

activities  that  could  be  or  are  in  contravention  of  the

provisions of this Act.

<br><br><i>Regulations</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 48 empowers the Minister to make regulations on

matters  under the Act.  The maximum penalty prescribed for  the

regulations   shall  not  exceed  a  fine  of  $10,000   or   to

imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or both.  In  the

case of a continuing offence, the penalty is a further fine  not

exceeding  $1,000 for every day or part of the day during  which

the offence continues after conviction.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry has always been conscientious in

regulating  the generation, movement and disposal  of  hazardous

and  other  wastes.   We have ensured that no  hazardous  wastes

generated  in  Singapore have been exported to  other  countries

without  the  consent  of the receiving country.   We  have  not

allowed  our industries to dump their toxic wastes overseas,  as

we  follow very closely such wastes from generation to treatment

to disposal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enactment of this Bill is timely as Singapore enters

the   next   lap   of   industrialisation.    Other   countries,

particularly  those  in this region, are also  undergoing  rapid

industrialisation.   More  and  varied  hazardous  wastes   will

inevitably be generated from the new industries in Singapore and

other  countries.  This Bill will tighten the control of import,

export  and  transit  of  hazardous and  other  wastes.   Proper

control  will minimise, if not prevent, illegal trafficking  and

indiscriminate dumping of such wastes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is of particular importance also as Singapore is

a major transhipment centre.  It will enhance our enforcement

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1847</b></font><br><br>

powers  against unauthorised transhipment of such wastes through

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Bill, we will be able to fulfil Singapore's

obligations fully under the Basel Convention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has actively sought the views and inputs of

MTI,  MinCom, the Maritime Port Authority, PSA, EDB and  TDB  as

well  as the private sector during the preparation of the  Bill.

All  parties have given their general agreement and  support  to

the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, thank you very much

for giving me this opportunity to speak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill not only because it is a necessary

consequence  or consequential legislation so as  to  give  legal

effect  to  the  fact that Singapore is now a signatory  to  the

Basel Convention but, more importantly, as a small country  with

no hinterland and with major international sea and air ports, it

is in our own interest that we support the international control

of the transport of hazardous waste.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister in his address has stated that, under the

obligations  of  the  Convention, we would  take  the  necessary

measures to ensure that the generation of hazardous waste,  both

in terms of quantity and hazard potential, would be reduced to a

minimum.   Sir, that is good.  But there are those  who  do  not

generate  hazardous waste as part of their normal  business  but

use  equipment  containing hazardous substances.   For  example,

although radioactive substances are not covered under this  Bill

but  under  other legislation, in nature, they are certainly  no

less  hazardous  than substances and wastes covered  under  this

Bill.   I would therefore like to ask the Minister how we should

control  the  disposal  of  equipment,  especially  medical  and

laboratory   equipment,  containing  such  hazardous  substance.

Without  strict control, Sir, such substance may become part  of

the normal

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1848</b></font><br><br>

mainstream  garbage  which,  in our case,  may  be  incinerated,

thereby  poisoning our environment.  Sometimes, it  is  used  as

landfill, thereby affecting our land and water supplies, or even

recycled,  thereby affecting all those coming into contact  with

the recycled material.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said earlier, radioactive substances are not

covered under this Bill.  Because of the ease of such substance,

through  the  example  I gave earlier, it could  leak  into  the

collection  of  mainstream garbage.  It is  important  that  the

Minister assures this House and the people of Singapore that all

equipment   containing  radioactive  substances   are   properly

controlled in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as an added control, I would like to ask whether we

have radiation detecting equipment at our central rubbish dumps.

If  not,  could the Ministry look into the procurement  of  such

equipment to make sure that the rubbish that we collect  do  not

contain any radioactive material?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to this Bill, I would like to seek the

following  clarification from the Minister.  (1) Do  we  require

registration  of  all those who generate hazardous  wastes?   If

not, how do we prevent hazardous waste from becoming part of the

mainstream  garbage?   (2)  Do we  require  that  some  type  of

hazardous  wastes must be exported?  Sir, we must remember  that

Singapore  is  a  small  country  and  perhaps  there  are  some

hazardous  wastes that should not be disposed of  in  Singapore.

(3) The Minister has already mentioned that Singapore is a major

transit  point.   Therefore it is important for  us  to  control

transit of hazardous wastes.  He has given some comments on  how

such  transit  items could be controlled.  While  I  can  safely

presume that there will be adequate control of legal transit  of

such  wastes  through Singapore, what about illegal  traffic  of

hazardous  wastes?  How do we control this and how  do  we  deal

with illegal traffickers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears to me that while we punish drug traffickers with

the  death sentence, the punishment for illegal hazardous wastes

trafficking  is comparatively light.  Despite what the  Minister

has said that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1849</b></font><br><br>

companies  will  be  fined  a maximum  of  up  to  $300,000  and

individuals  will  be fined up to $100,000  or  a  maximum  jail

sentence  of  two years, I think for these people who  illegally

traffic  in  hazardous  waste, thereby affecting  not  only  the

environment, but also generations of Singaporeans to come,   the

punishment is not stringent enough as compared to those who deal

in  illegal  drug  trafficking.  So  I  would  advocate  heavier

punishment  on  the individuals concerned.  After  all,  in  the

final  analysis,  Sir, it is the individual who is  responsible,

not a faceless corporate body.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  from  the term "hazardous waste", it is implied  that  the

substance concerned has no commercial value and, if accidentally

released  or improperly disposed of, it would endanger life  and

cost  long-term contamination to our environment.  In  hazardous

waste  management, proper and professional effort is  needed  in

waste  handling, tracking, storage, treatment and disposal.   It

helps to ensure that there is no accidental release of the waste

and  the  waste does not fall into the wrong hands, which  would

lead  to  illegal  disposal  for  financial  gain.   The  actual

treatment  of hazardous waste and its subsequent disposal  could

be  quite  costly, and it will also add cost to the  production.

Unscrupulous  businessmen  and waste treatment  companies  might

take  advantage of the lack of control in places where the anti-pollution  laws are not effectively put in place  and  dump  the

waste  over  there.  I did come across a newspaper  report  that

drums  of industrial waste were just dumped next to a children's

playground in a foreign country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of the Bill, Singapore, once again,

plays  a  responsible  role  as  a  world  citizen  to  help  in

preventing  environmental pollution.  This  Bill  plays  a  very

important  role  in  controlling the movement  of  transboundary

hazardous  waste to assist the world community in  tracking  and

prevention  of illegal movement of hazardous waste  which  would

eventually lead to illegal dumping.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1850</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill also helps us by ensuring that no hazardous waste

would  be  illegally imported into Singapore, and no  one  could

possibly  carry  out illegal waste treatment activities  without

the  knowledge of the Government, because from now onwards,  all

imported wastes will be tracked.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handling and management of hazardous wastes, while the

wastes  undergo transboundary shipment, is one of the  important

issues.   We should not only be concerned about the tracking  of

the movement of the waste, but also how the waste is handled and

stored  during shipment.  Mishandling could result in damage  of

the  container and cause leakage of the waste.  In case of fire,

the  waste could be released into the atmosphere and the  impact

on  the  environment could be worse than illegal ground dumping.

We  should  therefore need other laws to deal with the  handling

and  storage of the waste in the process of shipment.  A  severe

penalty  should be considered if the waste is mishandled  during

its shipment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Bill, it is stated that both the individual and the

corporation  could possibly be penalised.  I would like  to  ask

the  Minister  whether both parties will be  charged  if  anyone

should have flouted the regulations.  I believe that to sentence

an  individual  with  a  mandatory jail term  would  be  a  more

effective deterrent than just asking the corporation to pay  the

fine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Bill, it is stated that the maximum penalty is

$300,000.  In the case of accidental release of the waste due to

mishandling, the cost of the clean-up to contain the  pollution,

the  loss  of  lives and the long-term impact on the environment

could  be much more than the penalty of $300,000.  I would  like

to  ask the Minister whether the offenders could be asked to pay

for the cost resulting from the pollution created by them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill does exclude marine and radioactive wastes.

Could  the  Minister enlighten the House on  whether  there  are

other  Acts that effectively control the transboundary shipments

of  these types of wastes?  The latter, I believe, could be much

more hazardous compared with those mentioned in the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1851</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C.Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  is  an  important Bill.  The Bill deals with  wastes  that

present  serious environmental and health hazards,  unless  they

are  dealt with in an environmentally sound manner.  The illegal

trade  in  such wastes, both world-wide and Asia,  is  real  and

serious.   There  has  been  a lack of internationally  accepted

definition  of what exactly constitutes "hazardous  wastes"  and

what  should  be done about them.  Such a lack of  international

understanding can lead to misunderstandings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not too long ago, a Singapore company was alleged to have

dumped  detergent waste called "soap noodle" on  a  neighbouring

island.   This was resolved when Singapore agreed  to  ship  the

substances  back,  although  under  our  laws,  they   are   not

considered toxic.  By following the Basel Convention, this  Bill

incorporates  international  standards  and  approaches  to   an

international  problem into our national laws.   It  is  further

evidence  that  Singapore is a good citizen of the international

community.   Hopefully,  there will be  fewer  misunderstandings

with neighbouring states over what can or cannot be exported.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill reassures ASEAN and other neighbours that

Singapore will follow international practice as regards movement

of  hazardous  wastes.   We are one of the  most  industrialised

nations  in  the  region.   We are one  of  the  leading  ports.

Without  these  safeguards,  our  companies  may  otherwise   be

suspected   of   foisting   hazardous   wastes   on   neighbours

unknowingly, while our port may become a transhipment centre for

such wastes.  By enacting this legislation, we acknowledge state

responsibility  for  transboundary  environmental  damage   from

hazardous wastes.  With this Bill, it is now Singapore's duty to

help ensure that our neighbours do not suffer environmental  and

health damage.  A UN report has recognised that Singapore is one

of   the   few  countries  in  the  region  that  has  a  legal,

institutional  and  manpower capabilities  to  manage  hazardous

wastes properly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I want to emphasise that these duties are not

taken on without

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1852</b></font><br><br>

some cost.  The generation of hazardous waste is inevitable from

certain   industrial  processes.   If  they  are  generated   in

Singapore, such wastes must either be treated and disposed of in

Singapore or they must be exported for the same.  When we change

the  laws on export, therefore, this can have an impact  on  our

local  environment.  When we mandate new rules for  industry  in

dealing  with  such wastes, it can also have an  effect  on  our

economic   competitiveness.   The  Bill   will   require   close

coordination  between  the  Environment  Ministry  and  economic

agencies and I am glad to hear from the Minister today that this

has been done in the drawing up of this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having emphasised the importance of the Bill, I wish to

seek  the  assurance  of the Minister on five  matters.   First,

compliance  of  the Basel Convention.  I ask for the  Minister's

reassurance  that Singapore will comply with the  Convention  in

both  letter  and spirit.  In particular, there  are  three  key

essentials  of  the Basel Convention that are missing  from  the

Bill as presently drafted.  These are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Prior Informed Consent (Article 6 of the Convention)

that Singapore must inform the receiving state of the nature  of

the waste and has received its prior consent to the shipment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The prohibition of export to a country that is not

party to the Convention; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The duty to reimport wastes which have not been

properly  exported  and the duty not to  export  wastes  if  the

Government has reason to believe they will not be managed in  an

environmentally sound manner by the receiving country.

None  of these key essentials are specifically embodied  in  the

Bill  in its present form.  Additionally, while the Bill  should

cover exports from Singapore to a territory of another state, it

is  not  clear if it also covers the exclusive economic zone  of

that state.  This should be clarified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By clause 17 of the Bill, however, the Minister is given

the power to enact regulations to give effect to the Convention.

I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1853</b></font><br><br>

ask for the Minister's assurance that these vital principles  of

the  Basel Convention would be observed, either by amendment  to

the  Bill  before  it is passed by this House or  in  subsequent

regulations he will make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to make and seek the Minister's

assurance   on  is   something  he  has  already   given;   that

consultation with the industry has been fully considered.  There

is  one  remaining issue on this point.  This is with regard  to

new  and potential investors.  I ask the Minister to clarify  if

the  criteria  set out in this Bill will be screened  in  future

investments.   I ask this particularly as there  is  no  law  at

present  in  Singapore  that  mandates  the  assessment  of  the

environmental impact of such potential investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I wish to make and ask the Minister's

reassurance  is  for clarity for applicants for  permits.   Sir,

this  Bill mandates businesses to apply for permits for  export,

import  and transit.  I seek the Minister's assurance that  this

procedure  will  be simple, transparent and as  even  handed  as

possible,  with  the minimum of administrative  discretion.   In

this regard, I would draw the Minister's attention to section 17

of  the Australian equivalent to this Act - the Hazardous Wastes

(Regulations of Exports and Imports) Act, 1989 of Australia.  In

that  section, the Australian Act stipulates that  the  Minister

must grant the permit upon being satisfied of certain conditions

stated  therein.  There is no equivalent in our Bill.   While  I

understand  the Minister may be reluctant to bind himself,  this

would   surely  provide  a  greater  degree  of  certainty   for

businesses in obtaining the necessary permits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth point is with regard to Article 11 arrangements.

Under   the  Basel  Convention,  as  the  Minister  has  stated,

Singapore cannot trade in hazardous wastes with parties that are

not  also  parties to the Basel Convention.  Article  11  is  an

exception  that  allows  bilateral,  multilateral  or   regional

agreements.    The   Bill,  as  is  presently  drafted,   places

considerable emphasis on such Article 11 arrangements.   I  wish

to  ask  the  Minister  whether  Singapore  has  entered  or  is

negotiating such agreements.  If so, I seek his

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1854</b></font><br><br>

assurance that such Article 11 agreements will abide by the same

high standards found in the Basel Convention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fifth and final point, Mr Speaker, is that there should

be  a  review  of  laws  regarding  the  domestic  treatment  of

hazardous  wastes.  Singapore has enjoyed a very good reputation

regarding the domestic treatment of hazardous wastes.  The Bill,

however, puts additional procedures for those seeking to  export

hazardous  wastes.   In these circumstances,  there  will  be  a

greater  tendency to treat wastes in Singapore or  to  dump  it.

The   Environmental   Public  Health  Toxic   Industrial   Waste

Regulations of 1988, as amended most recently in 1996,  must  be

looked  at to harmonise these regulations on national  law  with

the present Bill regarding import and export.  Otherwise, we run

the  temptation  to improperly dispose of wastes  in  Singapore,

rather   than  adhering  to  procedures  for  export  or  proper

treatment.   In this regard, I wish particularly  to  point  out

that  it seems the penalty under the Environmental Public Health

Regulations  of 1988 is a maximum of $10,000 or imprisonment  of

12  months,  or  both.  This is in section 24  of  the  Act,  as

amended in 1996.  In comparison, the present Bill sees a maximum

fine  of $100,000 for individuals and $300,000 for corporations.

I  therefore  urge  that the penalties under  the  Environmental

Public  Health  Regulations be reviewed to  harmonise  with  the

present Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be grateful for the Minister's response, Mr

Speaker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> First, let me thank the three Members of

the  House  who have spoken in support of the Bill.   They  have

recognised  that  the Bill is a very important  one  because  it

safeguards not just Singapore from hazardous wastes but

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1855</b></font><br><br>

also  safeguards  the region from wastes which  are  transhipped

either through Singapore or which originated from Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Heng Chiang Meng has raised quite a few points.

Let  me answer them one by one.  As he has rightly pointed  out,

the  Bill  does not cover hazardous wastes which are related  to

either ship-borne wastes or radioactive wastes as well as wastes

which  are  contained in instruments which  may  not  have  been

generated  by  the user but which are inherent as  part  of  the

features  of  the  equipment.  Sir, these items  are  controlled

under  other  legislation. For example,  ship-borne  wastes  are

controlled by the International Convention for the Prevention of

Pollution  from  Ships or MARPOL and this  comes  under  MINCOM.

Radioactive  wastes  are  governed by the  International  Atomic

Energy   Agency   and  its  regulations  and  conventions.    In

Singapore, radiation and radioactive products are covered  under

the  Radiation Protection Act, which is under the privy  of  the

Radiation Protection Inspectorate of the Ministry of Health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain how these items are controlled. In terms of

radioactive  equipment,  all imports  of  radioactive  equipment

require  permits  to  be  granted or  issued  by  the  Radiation

Protection Inspectorate.  As part of the granting of the permit,

for those radioactive substances which have long half-lives, and

therefore cannot be dumped, we will require that the country  of

export  is  obliged  to  take back the radioactive  wastes  that

result  from  the  use of this instrument.  So we  are  covered.

There  are  other items, of course, which have very short  half-lives.   We will allow those to be dumped because the half-lives

could be in terms of a matter of days and therefore they do  not

pose any health hazard to Singaporeans if they are dumped.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of equipment with hazardous chemicals, similarly,

we  will  require the user, when he imports such  equipment,  to

undertake  to have those chemicals disposed of either internally

within the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1856</b></font><br><br>

company  or  disposed  of  through the  registered  toxic  waste

collectors.   So in this way we ensure that all those  equipment

that  either  result in the generation of toxic waste  or  which

require chemicals which are toxic are properly controlled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked how we register those companies that are

generating hazardous wastes.  Sir, as part of the duties of  the

Ministry  of  the  Environment, we require all  new  industries,

before  they  set  up their operations in Singapore,  to  obtain

clearance  from  the Ministry.  And as part of  the  process  of

obtaining the clearance, we will require them to furnish  to  us

full  details  of  the chemicals they use in  the  process,  the

process  itself and the chemicals that are released as a  result

of  their manufacturing processes.  In this way, we are able  to

track  both toxic chemicals that have to be used or imported  as

well  as the toxic and hazardous substances that are the  result

of  the processes.  We will also require them to let us know how

they  intend to treat the hazardous materials that are  released

as  a result of their processes.  They can either do it in-house

or  they  will have to get the services of one of their licensed

toxic  collectors  who will then dispose of  the  chemicals  for

them.  So in this way we ensure that whilst, as I mentioned just

now,  about  64,000 tonnes of hazardous wastes were  created  in

Singapore, we have full control over all these wastes and we are

able  to ensure that they are disposed of in a manner which does

not  pose any health hazards to human beings as well as  to  the

environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Heng has also talked about the punishments which

are  not adequate.  The penalties, as contained in the Bill, are

quite   hefty   compared  to  what  we  have  in  our   existing

Environmental  Public Health Regulations and  Act.   And  I  can

assure  Mr Heng that we will monitor very closely whether  these

penalties  are  deterrent enough and, if not, I can  assure  him

that we will be prepared to further enhance these penalties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay has asked that since the penalties

apply to both the company as well as to individuals

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1857</b></font><br><br>

involved in the company, whether we will charge both the company

and the individuals involved.  Sir, this will vary from case  to

case.   If  we are able to prove that both the company  and  the

individuals involved are guilty, of course we will bring charges

against both the company and the individuals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked whether the polluter will be required to

pay  for  the  cost  of clearing the wastes  and  damage  caused

because  the  penalties themselves may not be  very  significant

compared  to  the  damage.   Under the  Bill,  we  do  have  the

authority  to  require the polluter to pay for cleaning  up  the

damage caused by pollution and if the company is not able to  do

it, we will do it on the company's behalf and we will charge the

full cost of the work to the polluter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked for information about the regulations for

controlling  ship-borne and radioactive  wastes.   I  have  just

given that in my answer to Mr Heng.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay has also supported the Bill and he has asked

quite a few questions.  Let me deal with them one by one. He has

asked questions on five broad areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is his observation that many of the key

requirements  in  the Basel Convention are not actually  covered

specifically in the Bill.  Sir, the Bill is a broad format which

gives  us  the framework to promulgate the specific  regulations

which will allow us to comply with each of those regulations  in

the Convention.  So let me take him through.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prior Informed Consent, that will also be included in

the  Regulations.  In fact, as I mentioned in my Second  Reading

speech, we already have this practice today.  We already require

companies  which  have to bring in hazardous  wastes  or  export

hazardous wastes to either furnish the Prior Informed Consent of

the  receiving  country  or where they  are  bringing  in  those

hazardous  wastes  into Singapore, we will then  give  them  the

Prior  Informed Consent, provided we know that those wastes  can

be  treated  and disposed of safely in Singapore.   So  that  is

already  in practice, and this will be continued resulting  from

this Bill in the Regulations.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1858</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked about the prohibition of export to non-Parties, that this is not specifically covered in the Bill. To

export  to a non-Party, the intending exporter must get a permit

from us and this will again be covered in the Regulations.   The

application  for the permit would of course include things  like

the receiving country, whether it is Basel Convention Party, and

whether  they  have  the approval of the  receiving  country  to

import  those wastes from us.  So this would also be covered  by

Regulations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is the re-import of wastes that have not

been  properly  exported.  Sir, that again is already  available

today under the existing Regulations and we will promulgate such

regulations under this new Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has commended the Ministry for having consulted with the

industry.   I  thank  him for that.  He has also  asked  whether

existing  companies would be required to alter their  operations

or processes arising from the passing of this Bill and how would

this  impact  on new investors.  Sir, the passing of  this  Bill

will  have no impact because under the existing Regulations,  we

only  regulate  investors and operations that are already  here,

ie,  the  existing operations all comply with  our  very  strict

environmental  requirements and therefore they comply  with  the

Bill.   Similarly,  for  new investors, we  will  process  their

applications in the same way that we are processing them now and

we will apply our existing very tight requirements on them too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His third area was that he hopes that there will be clarity

for  applicants and that the application process will be simple,

transparent  and even-handed.  Sir, that indeed  is  already  so

currently, and it will continue to be so in the future.  He  has

also asked about the Australian regulation, section 17, which he

has read out, that the Australian Minister must grant permit  if

all  the conditions are complied with.  In Singapore, the permit

will  be granted and issued by the Director of Hazardous  Waste,

and  the  Director will definitely grant the permit if  all  the

conditions,  as  stipulated  under  the  Basel  Convention,  are

complied with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fourth point was on Article 11 which relates to

bilateral, multilateral or regional

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1859</b></font><br><br>

agreements  with non-Parties to the Convention.  Sir,  Singapore

does  not  at  the  moment have any bilateral,  multilateral  or

regional agreements with non-Parties.  And I can assure  Mr  Tay

that  if  we  do  in  the  future, we  will  ensure  that  these

agreements  comply totally with the requirements  of  the  Basel

Convention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His last point is that with the passing of this Bill, it is

likely  that  there will be a greater tendency to  treat  wastes

locally,  since  now  a company that intends  to  export  it  to

another country may face problems with the requirements  of  the

Bill.   Sir, as I have explained earlier, we already  have  very

tight  controls  on  import and export of hazardous  wastes  and

therefore  having this Bill will in no way change the situation.

In  any case, our requirements are that any wastes which are  to

be  treated  locally have to be treated in such a way  that  the

outcome of the treatment poses no threat to human health and the

environment  and we will continue to monitor the technology  for

treatment  and ensure that the most appropriate technology  will

be applied in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked that we harmonise penalties under the

existing  Environmental Health Protection  Act  and  this  Bill.

Sir,  they  are focusing on two different areas but I  take  the

point  that  the existing penalties in many ways are  inadequate

and we will definitely be reviewing them and harmonising them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill. - [Mr Yeo Cheow Tong].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;

read a Third time and passed.

as   shown  coloured  pink  on  the  plan  marked  `LAND  OFFICE

RECLAMATION PLAN NO 2/97' which is deposited in the Land Office,

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Parliament at its sitting on 28th May 1993 approved

Phase  1A of the reclamation of approximately 166.6 hectares  of

foreshore/seabed between Pulau Seraya and Pulau Merlimau,  Pulau

Ayer  Chawan,  Pulau Ayer Merbau and Pulau  Sakra  to  form  the

proposed  Jurong  Island.  The amalgamated  Jurong  Island  will

yield  more industrial land for Singapore and be turned  into  a

world  class  petroleum and petrochemical complex, with  related

supporting industries.  Phase 1A of the reclamation is  expected

to  be completed in March 1998.  Phases 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B and 2C of

the   reclamation   of   an   additional   440.4   hectares   of

foreshore/seabed between Pulau Seraya, Pulau Ayer Merbau,  Pulau

Ayer Chawan, Pulau Sakra, Pulau Pesek and Pulau Pesek Kecil were

approved  by Parliament on 27th February 1996, and are  expected

to be completed in December 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is now proposed to proceed with Phase 3A of the

reclamation  to  reclaim  the foreshore/seabed  north  of  Pulau

Merlimau as shown coloured pink on the plan marked "LAND  OFFICE

RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 2/97", a copy of which is displayed in  the

Library of this House for the information of hon. Members.   The

proposed  reclamation will yield an additional 34.2 hectares  of

land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Jurong Town Corporation will be appointed as agent of

the   Government   to  oversee  the  reclamation   works.    The

reclamation  and  infrastructural  works,  estimated   to   cost

approximately  $142  million, will commence immediately  and  be

completed in December 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<div align="center"><b>BEYOND ECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS</b></div>

<br>3.19 pm

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  thank  you for giving me this opportunity to speak  before

this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have watched how the recent currency turmoil has raised

unexpected  speed  to  turn  Asia's  economic  miracle  into   a

meltdown.  One consistent message has emerged from this  mess  - the need for good governance and good leaders acting in the best

interest of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful that Singapore has again demonstrated through

this crisis that it has a government who knows how to manage its

economic   fundamentals.   Yet  it  is  not  smugly  complacent.

Despite  the turmoil in the region, it has set up five Singapore

<br><br>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committees  to identify more and new ways  to  strengthen  a

"heartware" society, as defined by the Prime Minister.  That  is

a good word, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this commitment by the Government to listen to the

people  of  Singapore  which prompts me  to  rise  to  raise  my

concerns.   I  will  raise  five matters  today:   the  need  to

prioritise social services, recognise the role of social service

professionals, expand tertiary curriculum, encourage  a  culture

of initiative and setting up Social Services 21.

<br><br><i>Social Services as Priority Concern</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we build on our economic fundamentals, how are we

strengthening our social fundamentals?  My concern here is:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1862</b></font><br><br>

how  are we nurturing an effective human resource structure  for

our  social  service  agencies which are  vital  agents  in  the

exercise to forge unity of cohesion?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of fleshing out the vision of a `care and

share'  society certainly requires more than committee meetings,

reports  and national campaigns.  Sir, in the realm of community

services,  we  require  a professional  corps  of  "sharers  and

carers"  -  I mean the social service professionals - who  would

translate this vision by serving as a catalyst, the bridges and,

by  their  own personal examples, as a role model of service  to

the needy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides people, the way social services are organised to

translate  heartware into realisable components may require  the

same  kind of detailed, cohesive and committed action plan which

would  be implemented if we were to achieve economic goals.   At

this  point,  allow  me,  Sir, to raise  some  priority  issues.

First,  the  need  for relevant social service institutions  and

effective  programmes which cut across Ministries.  Second,  the

need  for additional resources to expand and upgrade the  skills

of the social service professionals.  Third, the need to develop

a  substantive understanding among social service  providers  on

social  issues and programme management.  Fourth, the  need  for

clearer  role  differentiation between Government and  volunteer

agencies.  And, fifth, the need for service standards and  audit

procedures to guarantee best practices in our frontline  service

agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the Ministry of Community Development must have

deliberated these issues.  Some Members have been invited to sit

in committees to give feedback.  As a result, working committees

were  formed,  new  agencies  were  set  up,  new  courses  were

developed  in  NIE, NUS, NCSS, the Family Research and  Training

Centre (FRTC) and by select VWOs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There remains a concern, however, about whether these

assets  were  coordinated and integrated  enough  to  provide  a

relevant  continuum  of services for our community,  or  whether

they were ad hoc,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1863</b></font><br><br>

sometimes  fragmented, and stand-alone training  modules,  which

lacked consistent therapy methodology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we need generic services? Or do we need more

specialised ones?  Is 2% training budget sufficient for our VWOs

to  upgrade  themselves annually?  How are  our  services  being

prepared  for many of the recovery programmes in abuse cases  to

support mandatory counselling court orders?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While recognising the complexity of these issues as there

are  no  easy  answers  readily available,  the  social  service

community  is anxious to hear from the Minister if  there  is  a

comprehensive policy for the delivery of social services and how

the   priority   concerns  mentioned  will  be  translated   and

implemented in the next millennium.

<br><br><i>Mindset Change</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned that unless there is a mindset change about

the  proper role of social service professionals, even the  best

action  plans  will not be fully realised.  These  professionals

are  almost  an  invisible category in our community.   Seen  as

quasi-volunteers,  do-gooders, people with a kind  and  stalwart

heart,  and  many volunteers have done outstanding charity  work

without regard, we overlook the need to promote a highly trained

and well-paid corps of professionals to offer best practices  in

counselling, therapeutic and rehabilitation services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteers in community services are acknowledged through

various  public  service  medals.  But full-time  direct  social

service  professionals  who live with  their  clients'  multiple

family problems are not always recognised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other social service professionals who do not care about

either  money  or  recognition identify  inadequate  skills  and

resources  as well as poor career development in the  sector  as

major problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet others feel strongly about their sense of helplessness

vis-a-vis Ministry administrators and frontline enforcement

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1864</b></font><br><br>

officers  who  are too over-worked and equally  ill-equipped  to

facilitate the helping process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It comes to no surprise then that against this backdrop of

low  morale,  we  face higher attrition rate among  social  work

graduates.   Minister Tarmugi reported in 1994 that since  1974,

the university had trained an estimated 830 social workers.   We

are looking at 40 a year.  In 1992, the Singapore Association of

Social Workers conducted a study on the number of social workers

in  social  work related jobs.  The study found  that  over  the

years,  half the university social work graduates of each cohort

took up social work related jobs.  Subsequently, only a third of

the cohort remained in social work related jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an overall 30% success rate is not a cost effective

educational  investment.  Nor could it meet  increasing  service

needs.   The  Government  is now talking about  developing  more

family  service centres by the year 2000.  Where do we get  this

manpower to run these centres?  What kind of service do we offer

to  Singaporeans  seeking therapeutic  help?   Do  we  risk  the

possibility  of re-traumatising our clients due to poor  service

delivery?   How  many  programmes were  not  implemented  simply

because we did not have the expertise to teach our young  social

workers?   We  are  at a stage, Sir, when we  need  specialists,

therapists and consultants for the sector.

<br><br><i>Start with the University</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to emphasise that in the

arena of human resource development, we need a long lead time to

change mindset and upgrade existing skills.  Even if we were  to

start  in  1998  to increase our undergraduate  and  polytechnic

student  intakes into the Social Work Department  and  start  to

change  our curriculum from a general one to a specialised  one,

we  will  only see the outcome in 2001.  There is an urgency  to

attend to this matter now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One idea related to manpower shortage was raised by the

community,  whether  we  could create opportunities  for  mature

adults  like home-makers or early retirees to train for a social

work degree in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1865</b></font><br><br>

university.  They could fill the manpower shortage in the sector

and  at  the  same  time  add value to the  quality  of  service

delivery  by  sharing their life experiences  when  they  handle

families with multiple problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young social workers, graduated at 21 or 22, find

family  therapy  work  overwhelming  due  to  their  youth   and

inexperiences.  Importing foreign talent is obviously  a  short-term  solution.   But in the long run, Sir,  we  cannot  have  a

society  where  the  poor,  the aged,  the  sick  and  the  less

fortunate  are  all  cared for by foreigners while  Singaporeans

write the cheques for the carers and givers.  If we are to build

on  the  ethos of volunteerism and service excellence,  then  we

must  have  a  strong  corps of grown decently  paid  and  well-respected social service professionals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To borrow an analogy. Even if a volunteer citizen army is

to  work,  it must have a corps of highly motivated and  trained

professional officers.  It is no different for social work.

<br><br><i>Job Demoralisation:  A national liability</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not just about the economics of manpower

planning.   When people are demoralised due to a perceived  loss

of  personal  relevance, it is the end  of  all  motivation  for

change  and  improvement.  This is a national liability  because

individuals  in  such mental state have lost  the  capacity  and

competence to be contributing citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation may not only be applicable to the social

service  sector.  Let me quote the survey on the General  Health

of   the  Singapore  Population  conducted  in  1989.   A  minor

psychiatric   morbidity  (MPM),  which  is  an   indicator   for

establishing  the  extent of our population at  risk  of  mental

health  problems, was a high 18% compared to other countries  in

the  region which ranged from 8% to 20%.  MPM does not  mean  we

are  all  mad.  But it does mean that we are not all  too  well.

And  a  subsequent report published by the IPS in 1991 indicated

that, among other factors, low self-esteem, performance anxiety,

stress,  inadequate coping skills were some of  the  causes  for

MPM.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1866</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is while our GDP may not be dramatically

affected by a high MPM rate, it undermines our national sense of

self  and weakens our collective psyche.  It may not prepare  us

to cope with the extraordinary stresses.

<br><br><i>Culture of Anxiety</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also concerned, Sir, that all our efforts to upgrade

our  heartware resources will come to nought if we  do  not  rid

ourselves of the culture of anxiety which infuses our system.  I

am  not referring to the external stresses which are part of the

human condition, ie, poverty, making ends meet, relating to life

partner, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to an anxiety syndrome within the Government

service.   The anxiety started at an early age where within  the

school system, young people are socialised into worrying how  to

get through the system without tripping up.  They are driven  by

the  fear  of  being wrong rather than the desire to  be  right.

These are two different motivations.  The first is inhibited and

paralysing; the second, proactive and choice-focused.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have worked with many police case officers, social

service   providers  and  other  Ministry  administrators,   and

invariably, a culture of anxiety is omni-present.  Most of  them

are  competent, dedicated, but they are afraid to make decisions

for   fear  that  they  would  be  judged  as  wrong  decisions.

Therefore, it is better to dawdle, rather than make a  decision,

especially  one  which may break new ground.   At  other  times,

their  hesitations were compounded by inadequate training,  poor

understanding of the standard operation procedures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PM has spoken of the need to decentralise decision making

so  that  we do not just have a top-down society, but a  lateral

society  of interaction and dialogue.  Sir, I think that  if  we

are  to achieve PM's vision, we must seriously tackle this  fear

of failure, culture of anxiety, whatever you call it, because it

prevents the empowerment of Singaporeans at all levels.  And  in

the  arena  of  crisis intervention, when on-the-spot  decisions

have to be made to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1867</b></font><br><br>

save  lives, the failure by frontline officers to act could lead

to disastrous outcomes.  We do not need more weeny hose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one doubts that Singapore is where it is today because

of  our  commitment to competition and meritocracy in all fields

of our endeavours.  But if we are, as PM has encouraged, to look

at  improving our society with no preconceptions, I urge that we

look at how we can replace the culture of anxiety with a culture

of  initiative.  By that, I mean, Sir, give people  the  freedom

and  the responsibility to choose the course of action and  face

the  consequences, make the mistakes and learn from them without

being  judged  too  harshly.   This  open  spirit  and  acquired

confidence in making a right and good judgment can only  enhance

our commitment to competition and meritocracy.

<br><br><i>Social Services 21</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we believe that a balanced development

requires  both  economic and social help.   In  our  efforts  to

create  this  care-and-share society, who  do  we  see  are  the

heartware  specialists?  Government sets the tone  and  provides

the vision but the help will actually be delivered by grassroots

advocates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creation of CDCs and their sincere attempts to partner

with  neighbourhood  agencies are a welcome strategy  to  foster

community building.  Such cooperative involvement is what  gives

Singaporeans a sense of relevance and how we keep the  daughters

and  sons  of Singapore on this soil.  The long-term  return  on

investments for dollars spent on heartware resources is  when  a

Singaporean will say, "I may not be rich but I am cared for,  my

work is relevant and being recognised, and I feel I belong."   I

hope the Government will see the social service community as one

key  partner in its vision of building a heartware society.   We

need  a paradigm shift to see social welfare beyond handing  out

benefits  here and there.  Instead, welfare involves a focus  on

social  services  as a heartware fundamental,  integral  to  any

effort  in  governance  to ensure social equity  and  the  total

wellness of Singaporeans.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1868</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response, the social service community would like to

help  translate  these tenets of a care and share  Singapore  21

with a wish list.  Our wish list comprises:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Career recognition;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared passion for social courses to be encouraged at all

community and administrative levels;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service with a clear mind and a trained skill;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A closer and trusted communication at all levels between

institutions in the helping process;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Access to information and open exchanges of experiences;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearer protocols and procedures in case management to

achieve an integrated approach; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sharing of responsibility by enforcement personnel across

all Ministries.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I hope the Ministers for Finance, Education

and  Community  Development will give meaningful focus  to  this

wish list for the social services in the Singapore 21 plan.  The

community would like to see a Social Services 21 Committee being

set  up  whereby  grassroots social service professionals  could

make  recommendations and propose integrated programmes for  the

sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to clarify that by proposing SS 21, I am not

asking  for  more and more subsidies.  I believe  in  the  `many

helping hands' principle, but I stress we also need many helping

skills.   Sir, we need a fresh mindset willing to recognise  new

priorities and change old cultures of organisations and work, if

we  are to reach beyond the already successful Singaporeans  who

touch  the lives of the marginalised and the disadvantaged  -  I

mean  the underachievers, delinquents, children and families  at

risk,  the  aged, the disabled and the poor.  We  can  certainly

start by recognising that in today's affluent Singapore,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1869</b></font><br><br>

we must move beyond economic fundamentals to address the equally

important social fundamentals.  [Applause].

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community Development (Mr Chan Soo Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of my

Minister,  I would like to thank the NMP Mdm Claire  Chiang  for

her  very comprehensive and eloquent speech.  But before  we  go

too  much  beyond economic fundamentals, let us  get  one  thing

straight.    It   is  important  first  to  get   the   economic

fundamentals  correct.  Without a strong economy, we  would  not

have  the resources to deal with the social problems and to fund

the meaningful social service programmes.  We may also face more

severe  social problems when our economy weakens.  Nevertheless,

I   acknowledge  that she has put forward many  good  ideas  and

raised many pertinent and constructive points.  The Ministry  of

Community  Development together with other  organisations  which

are  in the social service sector will study her ideas.   I  may

also  seek  further clarifications from her and to  further  the

exchange  of  ideas.   After  all, social  service  is  not  the

responsibility  of  Government  alone.   We  look   forward   to

participation of sincere and like-minded people.  We  also  look

forward to benefiting from their ideas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to outline MCD's basic approach to the provision

of social service  - "Many Helping Hands".  She has pointed this

out  in  her  speech  and also mentioned  that  the  hands  need

training of many useful skills too.  Yes, this is what  we  have

been  doing and we want to do better.  With many helping  hands,

the  Government, the voluntary organisations, the community and,

in particular, the more successful citizens can come together to

help  the less fortunate in the community.  This enhances social

cohesion.   This  approach has served Singapore  well  and  this

basic approach will continue.  Whether we call it Social Service

21  or  some other name, I believe we can decide later.   It  is

important to know what is it that we want to do first.  In fact,

as  we approach the 21st century, we will see more helping hands

coming our way and, in a sense, also more useful skills.   These

come through from three

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1870</b></font><br><br>

directions.    First,   the  increased  involvement   of   local

communities;   second, the increase in volunteer  participation;

and, third, the development of human resources.  I think the NMP

has addressed all three.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps allow me to address them using my own frequency.

First, involving the local communities.  The involvement of  the

CDCs  was  indeed mentioned by the NMP.  In fact, the  voluntary

organisations  and  the  CDCs  can synergise  with  each  other.

Voluntary  welfare organisations have the professional knowledge

and enthusiasm, while the CDCs have the local grassroots network

and know the needs of the local community.  By working together,

they  can  reach  out to more people, recruit  more  volunteers,

raise more funds, and serve more residents and do it better.  As

a  result, more residents will  benefit from more resources  and

better  services.  We also bring the coordinator,  namely,  CDC,

closer  to the community, instead of being located far  away  in

the  Ministry of Community Development.  That way,  the  helping

hands are nearer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, increase volunteer participation. We believe that

through the involvement of local communities via the CDCs,  more

local  residents will be willing to participate  as  volunteers.

As  they will see that they are helping a neighbour in need  who

is  just perhaps not too far away, they will be more willing  to

come  forward.  Also, our students will be performing a  minimum

of  six  hours a year of compulsory community service.  This  is

the  initiative of the Ministry of Education, and this  will  be

part  of  the school programme.  Our young people will  discover

the joy of helping people who are in need.  As they discover the

pleasure,  they  grow  up and become more  conscious  about  the

importance of social service.  Many of them would join the  rank

of   volunteers  or  social  service  professionals.   As   this

programme is introduced to the young people, it can become a way

of life and part of Singapore 21.  With more volunteers, we have

more  helping  hands.   We can  raise the level  of  volunteers'

participation to a level nearer that of the developed countries.

At the moment, I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1871</b></font><br><br>

think  we  are about half.  Some people have said, one-third  of

the  volunteers' participation of developed countries.  I  think

we should be able to catch up in the next few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area is developing human resources. I think the

NMP  has articulated many ideas in this direction, both for  the

social  service professionals as well as for the social  service

volunteers.  Like her, we attach much importance to the  quality

and commitment of the social service professionals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the House and the NMP that much has

been  done  to try to improve and assure the quality  of  social

service professionals as well as the standard of the social work

graduates.    We  do  admit  that  sometimes  we   find   rather

inexperienced  young  graduates  handling  relatively  difficult

cases  in  some  of the centres.  But please  see  this  in  the

context of the rapid growth of our social service sector in  the

last  few  years.  The social service centres will  ensure  that

these younger graduates are guided, supervised and they learn on

the way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NMP mentioned the need to train a core of trained

professional officers drawing on the analogy with the  military.

Let me assure her that the Ministry of Community Development and

the NUS collectively plan for our officer cadet schools to train

our  officer  cadets.  We work closely with  the  Department  of

Social  Work and Psychology of the NUS to plan student  intakes,

identify training needs and review the curriculum of NUS  social

work  courses.   I  shall visit my distinguished  colleague,  Dr

Vasoo, to find out what more we could do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who want higher professional qualifications, the NUS

also  has a plan for a Masters degree and a Graduate Diploma  in

Social   Work  for  graduates  in  social  work.   The   Temasek

Polytechnic has also launched its Graduate Specialist Diploma in

Counselling and Guidance this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So those are the training courses for professional social

workers.  And to  allow

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1872</b></font><br><br>

existing frontline workers including volunteers to upgrade their

skills,  MCD encouraged and facilitated the setting  up  of  the

Family  Resource  and Training Centre (FRTC)  by  the  Singapore

Association  of  Social Workers.  The FRTC leads in  specialised

skills  training  in  new areas of social service  such  as  the

management of juveniles as well as family violence cases.

The  NMP  seems to have the impression that MCD has always  been

very stingy but we did provide $1.6 million since 1992 to set up

and  run  the  FRTC.   We also set up a half  a  million  dollar

endowment fund for them to help them generate interest  to  fund

some  of the training programmes.  I want to assure the NMP that

more funds would be provided if more courses are identified  and

a  need  should arise.   In addition, we also give  business  to

FRTC.   We  commission  FRTC as well  as  other  agencies,  like

Counselling and Care Centre, to conduct specialised  and  skills

enhancement  workshops  and courses.   A  total  of  788  social

workers  from the various VWOs, police, medical and social  work

departments and MCD have attended these courses in the last  two

years.   More  such  courses  would  be  funded  by  MCD.   Nine

specialised  courses  a year in the areas  of  family  violence,

child  abuse and juvenile delinquency will be conducted starting

next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD is satisfied with the professional standard of our

social  work graduates as well as most of our social work  para-professionals.   MCD  is  also  committed  to  their   continued

improvement.  In fact, their quality of training and versatility

may  have contributed to the relatively high turnover.   Let  us

face  it.   If  I am no good, and nobody wants to  employ  me  I

cannot  turn over.  Perhaps our graduates are too  good.   As  a

result,  they turn over rather faster than we wanted them.   But

this is no reason for us not to ensure that they are even better

trained than now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically, our human resources in the social service

sector  are also particularly suitable for the HR sector in  the

private sector.  Social workers, in fact, can make very good  HR

managers.  Sometimes they get paid more.  Social work  also  can

be  very  stressful  and  can be very emotionally  draining.   A

social work graduate who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1873</b></font><br><br>

does  not  really have a heart for such work may  find  it  more

worthwhile to join the private sector.  This is inevitable,  but

this  may  not be all bad.  The private sector, with more  staff

with social work experience, can turn out to be some of our many

helping hands, our hands and contacts in the business world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also say that despite the high turnover we do have

excellent professional social workers who have remained  in  the

profession.   They  stay  because they find satisfaction.   They

find  that social work is work for the conscience and  work  for

the heart.  Of course, we must not take them for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1874</b></font><br><br>

granted.    MCD  is  working with NUS, NCSS  and  the  Singapore

Association  of Social Workers to address the issue  of  greater

recognition of professional social work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question having been proposed at Nineteen minutes past

Three  o'clock pm and the Debate having continued  for  half  an

hour,  Mr  Speaker  adjourned the House  without  Question  put,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesian State Ministry for the Environment has, in

fact,  been  providing weekly situation updates  on  efforts  to

control  land  and forest fires since the beginning  of  October

1997.   The  problem  has  not been providing  information,  but

implementing  effective measures against the fires.   As  stated

several   times  by  the  Indonesian  State  Minister  for   the

Environment, the Indonesian authorities face problems  enforcing

the  laws  against the use of fire by big plantation  owners  to

clear  plantation land.  And once the fires take hold  and  rage

over  a  large  area, they are very difficult to put  out.   The

problem has also been exacerbated by the drought brought  on  by

the El Nino phenomenon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1875</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>STEPS TO ASSIST/PREVENT FOREIGN WORKERS STRANDED IN SINGAPORE</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Minister for Labour what steps

the  Government is taking to assist and prevent foreign  workers

from being stranded in Singapore by the premature termination of

their services.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigations by my Ministry show that the majority of

stranded  foreign workers were construction workers  whose  work

permits  were cancelled because their employers default on  levy

payments.  A small number were waiting for their salary disputes

with employers to be settled.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will help foreign workers who were left

stranded  when  their employers fail to pay the  foreign  worker

levy.    We   will  try  to  find  alternative  employment   and

accommodation  for them.  In the recent Chander  Road  case,  we

were   able  to  assist  more  than  200  foreign  workers  with

alternative  employment and accommodation.   This  was  achieved

with  the  cooperation  of the Singapore Police,  the  Singapore

Contractors' Association Limited (SCAL) and main contractors who

agreed to employ the foreign workers or re-assign them to  their

other sub-contractors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unscrupulous employers who abandon their workers run the

risk  of having the $5,000 security bond forfeited.  This is  on

the ground that they have infringed one of the conditions of the

bond  which is to provide proper accommodation for their foreign

workers  while they are in Singapore.  Such employers will  also

not  be  allowed to employ foreign workers.  Their  applications

for  work  permits  will  be rejected to prevent  recurrence  of

abuse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of stranded foreign workers is often caused by

unscrupulous employers who recruit foreign construction  workers

mainly  to  profit from the monetary kickback from  foreign  and

local  employment  agents.   These employers  are  usually  sub-contractors or labour suppliers masquerading as sub-contractors.

Often  they  obtain  the  work permits by  overstating  or  even

falsifying their workload claims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has studied these malpractices and we have

already announced measures to prevent such abuses.  Last  month,

I  announced  that next year, we will implement a  revised  work

permit   allocation  system  which  allocates   foreign   worker

entitlements  directly  to  main  contractors  only.   The  main

contractor can then use their entitlement

to  employ foreign workers directly or allocate all or  part  of

the  entitlement to their sub-contractors.  In  this  way,  main

contractors  will  have direct control of  the  foreign  workers

engaged for their projects.  They will also have to take care to

ensure  that  the  sub-contractors to whom  they  allocate  work

permit entitlements are actually working on their project.   The

new  work permit allocation system will minimise opportunity for

abuses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pending the implementation of the new work permit

allocation  system,  my Ministry will also tighten  the  current

endorsement procedures for work permit applications.  Presently,

both  main  and  sub-contractors can apply for  foreign  workers

directly  from CIDB.  Although main contractors are required  to

endorse  the  work permit applications of their sub-contractors,

many  do  so without proper scrutiny. Henceforth, we will  refer

applications  by  sub-contractors to their main contractors  for

verification  and  support.   Main  contractors  will  also   be

required  to  undertake to employ and provide  accommodation  to

foreign  workers  of  their sub-contractors  should  the  latter

subsequently  abandon their workers.  This measure  will  compel

main  contractors to scrutinise the work permit applications  of

their sub-contractors carefully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides tightening the application system, MOL will

consider  introducing an additional security  deposit  for  levy

payment to deal with sub-contractors who are habitually late  in

their levy payments or who had defaulted on payments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above measures will minimise abuses of foreign workers

and  ensure that employers do not abandon their foreign workers.

However,  should this happen, my Ministry will ensure  that  the

foreign workers' welfare is safeguarded.  We will help those who

wish  to  continue working in Singapore to find  new  employers.

Apart  from  placing them with their main contractors  and  sub-contractors, the Ministry will require applicants for  new  work

permit  to consider these displaced workers before bringing  new

foreign workers to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the House that my Ministry will not

tolerate the actions of unscrupulous employers who abandon their

foreign  workers.   My  Ministry takes a very  serious  view  of

unsavoury  labour practices and will not hesitate to  deal  with

such employers firmly.

consider a waiver or concession on the foreign maid levy where a

elderly family member requiring nursing aid.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. <b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin</b> asked the Minister for Labour

whether there are long-term plans on the imposition of the  levy

on  foreign  maids and how these are consistent with efforts  to

encourage more women to work.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reply to the questions raised by Mr Zainul

Abidin  Rasheed,  Mr  Gerard Ee and Mr  Zulkifli  bin  Baharudin

together as they are on the same subject.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry recently announced the increase in the levy for

foreign  domestic  workers from $330 to  $345  per  month.   The

increase  will  take  effect  from  1st  April  1998.   We  also

announced  the intention to review the levy annually  to  ensure

that  it  remains effective in dampening the demand for  foreign

domestic  workers. Future levy increases will take into  account

the  increase in the number of foreign domestic workers as  well

as the income levels of Singaporeans.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1879</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The levy on foreign domestic worker is meant to dampen

demand  so  that Singaporeans will not become over-dependent  on

them.  We understand that some families require the service of a

foreign   domestic  worker  and  our  policy  is  not  to   deny

Singaporeans of such service.  However, there is still a need to

ensure  that  the  number  of foreign domestic  workers  remains

manageable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Households employ foreign domestic workers for a variety of

reasons.  Some  employ a foreign domestic worker to  look  after

young children, others to look after the aged and handicapped or

the sick, and yet others to attend to household chores or to  do

all  these tasks.  We should not favour any particular household

or  type of work by exempting the levy or granting a concession.

The   levy   should  remain  a  transparent  pricing   mechanism

applicable  to all employers.  Granting exemption or  concession

on  the  levy will undermine Government's efforts to manage  the

demand for foreign domestic workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imposition of the foreign domestic worker levy is not

inconsistent  with  efforts  to  get  more  women  to  join  the

workforce.  By adopting levy as a regulating instrument, we  are

leaving  it  to  women to decide on working or staying  at  home

after balancing their income with the total cost of employing  a

foreign  domestic worker. The trend of increasing female  labour

force participation rates over the years show that the levy  has

not  deterred  women from working.  In any case,  working  women

should  not consider foreign domestic workers as the only option

in  managing their households.  I would like to point  out  that

countries  such  as  Japan  has a  higher  female  labour  force

participation rate compared to Singapore, and yet does not  have

a large pool of domestic workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, working women who employ foreign domestic

workers, be it to

take  care  of children or the elderly, can claim tax relief  of

twice the levy paid for the year.  This tax relief helps them to

meet  part  of the cost of employing domestic workers  and  thus

providing  incentive for more women to work.  Hence,  I  do  not

think  that  the  levy  revision  will  deter  housewives   from

returning to work especially if they are able to earn an  income

that  more than offsets the cost of employing a foreign domestic

worker.

<div align="center"><b>REGISTRATION OF PRIMARY ONE PUPILS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for Education whether his

before  they  start school so as to facilitate the provision  of

pupil placements, including the construction of new schools, and

at   the   same  time  enable  parents  to  make  the  necessary

arrangements for their children.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an interesting idea which my ministry will look

into.  Registering two years ahead will not give enough time for

construction of new schools, but will certainly give  more  time

for  parents  to  make  the  necessary  preparations  for  their

children.  It will also allow the Ministry of Education time  to

make  adjustments  to classroom and teacher  deployment  to  the

maximum  extent  practical, in response to  actual  rather  than

anticipated demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are important pros and cons to making such a

change.  The matter has therefore to be carefully and thoroughly

studied  before  a decision is taken.  We will  not  change  the

current system until we are convinced that it will result in  an

improvement.

<div align="center"><b>PROTECTION OF PATIENTS RECEIVING BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24. <b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad</b> asked the Minister for Health what

further  procedures can be instituted to increase the protection

of patients receiving blood through transfusions.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1881</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25. <b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed</b> asked the Minister for Health

whether  the  incident  when  two blood  transfusion  recipients

contacted  the  HIV  virus had resulted  in  the  people  losing

confidence in the blood donation/transfusion system and what  is

being done to address the problem.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incident of the two blood transfusion recipients

contracting the HIV virus has indeed raised public concern  over

the safety of our blood transfusion service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address these concerns and to assure the public of the

safety  of our blood service, my Ministry has explained  several

times  through the mass media our comprehensive blood collection

procedures and the safeguards that have been put in  place.   We

have  presented the relevant facts to the general  public  in  a

concise  and easy-to-understand manner to avoid undue alarm  and

to maintain confidence in our blood transfusion service.  At the

hospital  level,  our  doctors  are  also  re-assuring  patients

needing  surgical operations that the blood transfusion,  should

they need one, is safe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Blood Transfusion Service (SBTS) has

continually introduced new measures to improve the safety of our

national  blood  supply  as and when  these  are  available  and

approved  for  use  in  the  developed  countries.  The   safety

standards of our blood collection system are comparable to those

used  in  developed countries including USA, UK  and  Australia.

Besides  adopting stringent procedures to screen  blood  donors,

state-of-the-art methods of laboratory testing are being used to

test  donated  blood at the SBTS.  In addition,  an  independent

external  agency  from Australia carries out  annual  audits  of

SBTS' blood collection and processing procedures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, due to the limitations in currently available

technology,  there  is an inherent risk, one that  is  extremely

low,  of  contracting HIV through blood transfusion.  All  blood

transfusion services in the world face these limitations.  Until

technological advancements can detect HIV infected blood  during

the  "window period" of two to three weeks, we need to  rely  on

other  means to ensure that our national blood supply  is  safe.

The most important are continually educating the public on blood

donation,  and encouraging those who do not engage in high  risk

behaviour  to come forward to donate blood and help save  lives,

and  ensuring  that we have effective screening  procedures  for

blood donors at the blood donation centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has reviewed the process for screening blood

donors  and will be taking measures to further strengthen public

and  donor  education.  The aim of such education  is  to  raise

public awareness on AIDS and other infectious diseases which are

transmissible by blood transfusion.  Persons with high  risk  of

exposure to infectious diseases, including AIDS, must not donate

blood, and we must strongly discourage them from doing so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will also embark on a programme to train our

counsellors  at the Blood Transfusion Service to  improve  their

effectiveness in interviewing potential donors.  They need to be

discreet,  yet effective, in conveying the message to  intending

donors  that  they  have  to withdraw from  the  blood  donation

session  if  they are in the high risk group. My  ministry  will

also  be improving the blood donor questionaire to enable donors

to withdraw discreetly, and without embarrassment, at the end of

the interview.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is very appreciative of the selflessness and

civic-mindedness of the very large number of regular donors  who

take  time  to  donate their blood at the  BTS.   As  our  blood

transfusion  service rely on voluntary blood donation  from  the

public,  we  have  to maintain a fine balance  between  imposing

criteria  on  blood  donors that are overly  inquisitorial,  and

having an adequate supply of blood in our national blood bank to

save lives.

he  will  give an assessment on the amount of ecological  damage

caused  by  the  collision  of the  tankers  off  the  coast  of

Singapore;  (b) what is the long-term ecological impact  on  the

wildlife concerned; and (c) how much it cost in cleaning up  the

oil spill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of the oil spill on the ecology of the affected

areas can only be assessed after a comprehensive study has  been

carried  out.   The  Tropical Marine Science Initiative  of  the

National   University  of  Singapore  has  proposed  a  one-year

research  project  to study the ecological  impact  of  the  oil

spill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tropical Marine Science Initiative (TMSI) of the NUS

has proposed a one-year study on the effects of the oil spill on

the  sea  and aquatic life.  The TMSI has submitted the  project

proposal to the MPA to seek partial funding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENV is currently exploring the scope for the Ministry to

participate in the study proposed by the TMSI.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is still too early to ascertain the total cost of the

clean-up operations.  The bills and claims are still coming  in.

However,  because  the  situation  was  brought  under   control

relatively quickly, it is expected that clean-up cost and claims

for  economic  and  environmental  losses  will  be  lower  than

expected  for  an  oil spill of this magnitude.  Throughout  the

incident,  the  operations of the port and the oil/petrochemical

complexes  were unaffected; international shipping in  the  busy

Singapore  Strait went on as usual; and apart from  a  few  off-shore islands, Sentosa and mainland beaches remained clean.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BACKtoWork (BTW) Programme was launched on 13th

September  1996 to encourage economically inactive persons  such

as  housewives and older persons to rejoin the workforce.  It is

a tripartite effort by MOL, PSB, SNEF and the NTUC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BTW programme was piloted over a six-month period from

September   1996   to  March  1997.   The  response   has   been

encouraging.  Some 1,900 housewives and retirees have registered

to  re-enter the workforce.  Of these, 63% were housewives,  21%

older persons and 15% were displaced workers.  Of the 1,900, 700

have  been  successfully  placed in companies.   The  number  of

participating companies has also increased from the  initial  18

to 80.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most companies provide orientation training to the re-entrants to help them build confidence, acquire communication

skills  and develop positive attitudes towards work and quality.

To supplement this, PSB offers a Core Skills Training Programme.

The  SDF  provides 100% grant for the programme.  To date,  more

than 60 housewives and retirees have completed the course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further develop the BTW Programme for the next phase, an

Advisory Committee was set up in September 1997.  This Committee

aims  to  identify the needs and constraints of  housewives  and

older  persons returning to work, encourage employers  to  offer

innovative part-time and flexible employment schemes,  including

redesigning of jobs; and identify the incentives to attract  the

target group.

<div align="center"><b>PROGRESS OF NATIONAL MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMME</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for Health

what  has been the progress of the 3-year National Mental Health

Programme  launched  in  February 1993  which  identified  seven

strategies  to  promote good mental health  and  prevent  mental

disabilities among Singaporeans.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mental Health Education Programme has made good

progress in the seven areas identified at the launch in February

1993.  The achievements since then are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) Convenient community mental health clinics

Apart  from the main outpatient clinics at Woodbridge  Hospital,

the  Ministry  of  Health has established  5  adult  psychiatric

outpatient  clinics and 4 child guidance clinics in HDB  estates

to  provide  mental health services closer to where Singaporeans

live.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii) Modern hospital inpatient service

The new Woodbridge Hospital, opened in October 1993, provides up-to-date facilities for patient treatment and rehabilitation.  It

also  has  clinical  sub-specialities in  Geriatric  Psychiatry,

Forensic Psychiatry and Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii) Rehabilitative and Home follow-up programme

Woodbridge  Hospital  has stepped up its patient  rehabilitation

programme.   More patients are being discharged  to  the  4  Day

Centres  for follow-up rehabilitation and to prepare  for  their

gradual  assimilation into the community.   To  complement  this

effort, the hospital has also expanded its community psychiatric

nursing  service, which provides trained nurses for home  visits

to  review  the  progress of patients and  to  give  advice  and

support to those caring for them.  Support groups for the family

members on patient care activities have also been formed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv) Expanded training programme for psychiatrists,

psychiatric   nurses,   clinical   psychologists,   occupational

therapists and Continuing Education for doctors and nurses

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More psychiatrists and clinical psychologists are being

trained.  The number of psychiatrists has increased from  65  in

1992 to 88 in 1997, and clinical psychologists from 8 in 1992 to

13  today.  Woodbridge Hospital has also intensified its ongoing

medical  education  programme  for  doctors,  nurses  and  other

support workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v) Public Mental Health Education Programme

Ministry  of  Health  has  launched  an  annual  Mental   Health

Education Programme to:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;encourage adoption of lifestyles that will promote good mental health;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;encourage the public to seek treatment early; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;educate the public about the common mental illnesses and the services available for treatment.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to on-going programmes throughout the year, the

Ministry organises an annual Mental Health Week to promote  good

mental   health  through  activities  such  as  public   forums,

exhibitions   and   seminars  for  special   groups,   including

principals,  teachers  and  personnel  managers,  symposia   for

doctors  and  nurses,  feature  articles  for  radio,   TV   and

newspapers. Pamphlets are produced and distributed to  reinforce

the mental health messages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vi) Epidemiological and Clinical Research

A  Clinical  Research  Division is being set  up  at  Woodbridge

Hospital.  $2.8 million has been allocated for clinical research

in mental health over the next 3 years.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1887</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vii) Closer Working Relationship with Voluntary Welfare

Organisations

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodbridge Hospital continues to work closely with

Voluntary  Welfare Organisations (VWOs) such  as  the  Singapore

Association  of Mental Health, the Anglican Welfare Council  and

the  New Horizon Centre.  Psychiatrists from the hospital  train

and act as part-time consultants to these VWOs. Some even sit on

the   boards  of  the  VWOs  which  provide  residential   care,

outpatient   counselling  and  day  centre   rehabilitation   to

complement the public mental health services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is now a greater awareness of mental health amongst

Singaporeans. One indicator is the increasing number of  parents

who  bring  their children for psychiatric consultation  as  new

consultations have increased significantly from 1,500 in 1993 to

2,358 in 1996.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Members that my Ministry will

continue  to  promote  lifestyles for  good  mental  health  and

provide  quality  mental health care for our  people  under  the

National Mental Health Programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to carry out major upgrading works to the

common  areas in private condominiums can be effected by passing

a  special resolution at general meetings. Under the Land Titles

(Strata) Act (LTSA), a special resolution will be passed if  the

total  number of votes cast against the resolution is  not  more

than 25% of the total value of the votes cast. As such works are

costly and require a large capital outlay from the sinking  fund

or   even   additional  contributions  from  the   owners,   the

requirement is not unreasonable. My Ministry therefore does  not

see the need to amend the current position.

Development if he will review the latest Housing and Development

Board's policy so that the period a HDB apartment is rented  out

considered   in   the   5-year  occupation   period,   otherwise

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB flats are sold under the home ownership scheme for

owner  occupation. HDB had previously exercised flexibility  and

allowed  lessees who sublet their whole flats under the Approved

Subletting  Policy to include the subletting period as  part  of

the  minimum occupation period.  Unfortunately, this had led  to

abuse.   Some  lessees bought flats from HDB or  from  the  open

market,  rented  them  out,  and subsequently  sold  the  flats,

without ever physically occupying them.  The HDB flats were used

for capital gains and rental income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the recent revised policy, HDB has imposed the

requirement that all lessees must fulfill the minimum period  of

physical occupation before they are allowed to sell their  flats

or  apply  for the second new HDB flat.  Those who  have  sublet

their flats are required to make up for the period of subletting

by  physically occupying the flats. The revised policy will  not

affect  genuine  home buyers who purchase flats  for  their  own

occupation.  It will, however, deter those who intend to use the

HDB  flat as a form of investment for rental income and  capital

gain.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1889</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, HDB will exercise flexibility for flat

lessees who are posted overseas on official duties.  Flexibility

will  be  granted  to employers and employees  of  locally-owned

firms  and  MNCs,  who are required to go overseas  on  official

duties.   It  will  also  be  extended  to  employees  of  GLCs,

Statutory Boards and civil servants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These flat lessees will be allowed to include the period of

subletting  of  whole  flat in the computation  of  the  minimum

occupation  period, subject to a maximum of 3 years for  direct-purchase flats and 1.5 years for resale flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore economy is among the most open in the world

and  the Government is committed to a free market economy.   The

Government does not condone price-fixing behaviour among cartels

or  suppliers.  The best way to prevent this is to promote  open

competition in the market place, so that customers benefit  from

paying  the most competitive prices for any product or  service.

My  Ministry administers a Price Control Act, which provides for

the  control of prices, including the setting of maximum prices.

It  gives  the  controller  wide powers  to  curb  profiteering.

Currently,  it  has 2 items as controlled articles  -  rice  and

pigs.   However, MTI has not found it necessary to use the  Act,

as  keen  competition in the retail sector has made  any  direct

government intervention unnecessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NSmen who attend NS training are eligible for the SAF

service  pay.  To make up for the loss in their civilian salary,

they are paid an additional make-up pay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF recognises that with the increasing use of flexible

wage  systems  in  Singapore,  more companies  are  linking  the

compensation  of  their workers to their output.    Bonuses  and

other  forms  of payments are therefore very often  an  integral

part of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1891</b></font><br><br>

regular income of our NSmen.   It would not be fair for NSmen to

suffer  a loss in income when they are recalled for NS training.

MINDEF  will  be amending the Enlistment Act to include  bonuses

and  other  regular payments in the computation of  the  make-up

pay.

affordable  housing  in our current effort  to  attract  foreign

talent  to  Singapore.  Under this scheme, JTC  purchases  flats

from  the resale market and HDB at market prices and rents  them

out to foreigners on a commercial basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC is processing about 1000 applications and has allocated

about  60  flats so far. The process will be speeded up  as  JTC

<div align="center"><b>WOODLANDS TOWN CENTRE</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40. <b>Mr Hawazi Daipi</b> asked the Minister for National Development

whether  the  Government will consider (i) giving retailers  and

hawkers at Woodlands Town Centre discounts on rentals in view of

the  substantial drop in business as a result of  the  prolonged

Causeway  jam  and  the  stronger  Singapore  dollar;  and  (ii)

allowing passenger vehicles to go into the Woodlands Town Centre

car  park from the exit way at Centre Road so that residents and

shoppers can have better access to the shops and hawker centre.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 183 shops, 5 eating houses and 77 occupied cooked

food  stalls in the old Woodlands Town Centre.  The Town  Centre

serves the residents, workers in the neighbouring factories  and

other visitors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pricing and rental of HDB shops and stalls has to be

determined  by  the  general  market  conditions.   It  is   not

practical  to consider each individual factor like  the  traffic

congestion at the Causeway and give discounts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the rent of shops, HDB has, on 14th November

1997, announced a package of measures to assist HDB shop tenants

in  managing their business costs.  For tenants currently paying

above  today's market rents, HDB will adjust the rents downwards

to  the prevailing market rents as at 1st December 1997, subject

to  a  maximum reduction of 10% of their existing rents.   Also,

for  fixed-term tenancies that are at or going for  their  third

renewal, HDB will moderate the rent further such that the annual

increase,  as well as the maximum rent at the third renewal,  is

reduced further. Eligible shop tenants in Woodlands Town  Centre

will therefore benefit from this package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the proposal to allow vehicles to enter the Woodlands

Town  Centre  car park via the current exit at Woodlands  Centre

Road, HDB will work with LTA on its feasibility.

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;43. <b>Dr Toh See Kiat</b> asked the Prime Minister whether he will

consider  having a Ministry of Information Technology to  better

plan,  co-ordinate  and  implement the development  and  use  of

information technology.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has recognised the importance and far reaching

consequences of the IT revolution as early as twenty years  ago.

In  1981, we allocated $100 million for computerisation projects

in the civil service to improve the efficiency of the government

machinery  as  well as seed the development of an IT  sector  in

Singapore.  At  around  the same time, we  formed  the  National

Computer  Board  to  promote  and  catalyse  IT  development  in

Singapore.   We  also have the National IT Committee  (NITC)  to

formulate  IT  policies  and  strategies,  and  coordinate   and

integrate IT applications nationally and in the various  sectors

of society.  NITC is a high level inter-agency committee.  It is

currently chaired by Teo Chee Hean, with DPM Lee Hsien Loong  as

advisor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has achieved considerable success in propagating

the widespread use of IT in homes, schools and industries and in

building  up  a  significant IT economic sector.  Our  household

computer  penetration rate of 36% is one of the highest  in  the

world.   We  are spending $2 billion over the next  5  years  to

provide  computers for every pupil  in schools.   The  local  IT

industry registered revenues of almost $9 billion in 1996 and is

growing at a phenomenal rate in excess of 30% a year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A milestone in our IT development is the unveiling of the

national  IT plan in 1992.  Codenamed IT2000, the plan envisions

Singapore as an "Intelligent Island" where IT is used in  almost

every facet of life - at home, at work and at play.  IT will  be

exploited    aggressively   to   boost   Singapore's    economic

competitiveness and enhance the quality of life of our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of IT2000 is on track. A major component is

the  creation of Singapore ONE - an islandwide broadband network

that  will  run multimedia interactive services, including  fast

Internet   access,  video-conferencing,  online   shopping   and

distance  learning.  Singapore ONE is expected to be  accessible

to all Singaporeans by end 1998, thus bringing Singapore another

step nearer to the "Intelligent Island" vision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have done all these without a Ministry of Information

Technology.  The inter-agency arrangement under NITC has  worked

well.  NITC has provided strong and effective leadership to  the

push  for IT development and use in Singapore.  Rather than  set

up  a  new  Ministry,  it  is better to focus  on  refining  the

existing  arrangement, at least for the time being.  The  strong

NITC  leadership and added Government emphasis on IT  should  be

adequate in addressing the challenges of IT for Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of its continuous efforts to make travelling by

public  transport  more  convenient and  comfortable,  the  Land

Transport Authority (LTA) has embarked on an extensive programme

to  upgrade  bus  shelters and construct  linkways.  Under  this

programme, about 4,000 bus shelters will be upgraded in  phases.

The  programme  commenced this year, after  a  successful  pilot

project  to  test various new bus shelter designs.  LTA  is  now

proceeding with the first phase to upgrade some 800 bus shelters

and construct about 200 linkways in older HDB estates.  Work  on

these  facilities will be starting soon and residents  can  look

forward to using these upgraded bus shelters by mid-1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new design bus shelters will be sized according to the

estimated  number of passengers using them. They will  be  wider

than  the present ones so that passengers will have more shelter

from  wet  weather. Linkways to bus shelters will also be  wider

and,  wherever possible, will have planting screens  to  provide

better weather protection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on commuters' feedback, LTA has also worked out a

list  of facilities to be provided within the new shelters.  For

example,  besides lighting, seats and notice boards,  large  bus

shelters  will  be  provided with public telephones  and  ticket

vending machines.

whether his Ministry is aware of the feedback from mobile  phone

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TAS requires the operators to regularly monitor the Quality

of  Service  (QoS) of our telephone networks, fixed as  well  as

mobile.  It  is  aware  of incidents where  mobile  phone  users

experience  service disruptions at certain places in  Singapore.

This   is   caused  by  environmental  factors  such  as   local

obstructions, eg, high rise buildings between mobile phones  and

base stations, and radio interferences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TAS has a set of QoS standards that spells out the minimum

service  levels  which  both SingTel Mobile  and  MobileOne  are

required  to  comply.   These standards are benchmarked  against

international  service levels achieved by service  operators  in

places  such  as  UK,  Hong Kong and Australia.   Overall,  both

service providers have been able to meet the standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service providers are also required to monitor users'

feedback  received  and  submit  the  statistics  to   TAS   for

monitoring.  Both operators have been taking measures to rectify

or make good any problems fed back by consumers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Health whether there are

plans  to  have  more  "after office  hours"  clinics  for  non-emergency  cases  in  the  other Government  Hospitals  and  the

Restructured Hospitals apart from those in the Singapore General

Hospital and the Tan Tock Seng Hospital.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1994, SGH and TTSH have been operating walk-in

clinics  that are open from 8 am until 11 pm.   This means  that

these  walk-in clinics operate only 2 hours longer than most  GP

clinics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1994 and the end of 1996, the total number of

emergency  cases  in  SGH increased from  138,100  in  1994,  to

161,900  in 1996.  This is an increase of 17% over the 2  years.

However, the number of non-emergency cases jumped from 27,600 in

1994,  to  63,500 in 1996, an increase of 130%.   For TTSH,  the

emergency  cases increased by 12% between 1994 and  1996,  while

the number of non-emergency cases jumped by 76%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear that the walk-in clinics may be giving the

public   the  wrong  impression  about  the  role  of  the   A&E

departments in SGH and TTSH.   Some people may be using the  A&E

as  a  convenient screening service, knowing that if  considered

non-emergencies,  they can still seek treatment  at  the  nearby

walk-in  clinics.   However, by using the  A&E  as  a  screening

service, they unnecessarily increase the workload of the already

hard-pressed  A&E  staff,  and worse, delay  treatment  for  the

emergency and more deserving cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the experience with the existing walk-in

clinics,  the  other acute hospitals have no  plans  to  set  up

similar clinics.

so far and what other new facilities will be added on.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>

<br><br><i>Improvements in facilities and services in AH</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexandra Hospital is an acute hospital where the range of

specialties such as general medicine, surgery, orthopaedics,  is

comparable to some of the restructured hospitals.  Over

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1899</b></font><br><br>

the  past  few years, new medical equipment and facilities  have

been  provided  in  the  hospital.  For  example,  a  new  X-ray

department  has replaced the old, and last year, a new  hi-speed

CT scan was introduced .

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a government hospital, more than 80% of the beds in AH

are  subsidised beds and these have been completely  refurbished

since  1995.   With  AH currently under the management  of  NUS,

patients  have access not only to the expertise of AH's in-house

doctors  and  nurses,  but also to NUS  doctors.   AH  has  also

developed  expertise  in  the area of  geriatric  medicine.  The

Alexandra  Geriatric Centre was set up in 1994 and comprises  an

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;54. <b>Mr Inderjit Singh</b> asked the Minister for Finance if he will

elaborate  (i) how CAM International got through the  supposedly

stringent  SES listing criteria; (ii) what were the issues  that

led to the suspension of trading of CAM International shares  in

the  stock market; and (iii) what will his Ministry do to  avoid

similar  companies from getting listed so that  small  investors

will be better protected.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>

<br><br><i>How  CAM International got through the supposedly stringent  SES listing criteria</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAM International ("CAM" or the "Company") applied for

listing  on  the Main Board of the Stock Exchange  of  Singapore

("SES")  in  March 1994.  The listing application was  sponsored

and  managed by United Overseas Bank ("UOB").  UOB had  reviewed

the  business  and  financial position of the Company,  and  was

satisfied that the Company was suitable for listing on the  SES.

UOB  had also carried out due diligence on the disclosures  made

in   the  listing  application  and  in  the  prospectus  issued

subsequently in connection with the share issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 1993, CAM's accounts were audited by Cheong Khee

San  & Co.  Before the listing, Ernst & Young was appointed  the

joint  auditor  starting  from the  financial  year  ended  30th

September  1993.  The joint auditors did not make  any  material

qualifications  to  the  5-year audited  consolidated  financial

results  of  the  group  which were  submitted  in  the  listing

application.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the information (including the 5-year audited

accounts)  contained  in  the  listing  application,   the   SES

considered CAM to have met the minimum listing requirements, and

accordingly, approved the Company for listing on the SES.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reviewing listing applications, the SES, like other

stock  exchanges  elsewhere,  has to  rely  on  information  and

documents   prepared,  provided  and/or   vouched   by   various

independent  professionals.   These  professionals  include  the

auditors  of  the  listing  applicant,  the  investment  bankers

sponsoring  and  managing the listing and share issue,  and  the

lawyers advising on the legal issues.  It is both impossible and

impractical  for  the SES to verify every piece  of  information

contained  in a listing application.  In CAM's case,  there  was

nothing  to  cause  the  SES  to suspect  that  any  information

contained   in   the  listing  application  was  inaccurate   or

misleading.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1901</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem in CAM's case would appear to be an audit

failure  resulting from alleged collusion between a  partner  in

Cheong  Khee San & Co and the top management of CAM  to  falsify

the   group's  financial  accounts.   Consequently,  the  5-year

audited  consolidated  accounts of the group  submitted  in  the

listing  application were likely to have vastly  overstated  the

group's  profits or concealed its losses.  Had the group's  past

accounts  been properly prepared and audited, the Company  might

not have met the SES' listing requirements and the listing might

not have taken place.

<br><br><i>Issues   that   led  to  the  suspension  of  trading   of   CAM International shares in the stock market</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAM shares were suspended from trading on the SES on 29th

April  1997.  The SES took that action after it was notified  by

the  Monetary Authority of Singapore that Ernst & Young had made

a  report  to the Minister for Finance under section 207(9A)  of

the Companies Act.  In that report, Ernst & Young concluded that

it  believed  that a serious offence had been or was  likely  to

have been committed against the Company by its officer(s).   The

SES  decided  that it would be in the interest of the  investing

public  to suspend trading in CAM shares until adequate  details

about  the  alleged  irregularities  and  their  effect  on  the

Company's   financial  conditions  have  been  established   and

disclosed to the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, the Company had appointed Price Waterhouse to

investigate the matter, and Price Waterhouse's findings had been

released  to the market.  However, the Company had not  released

its  audited accounts for the year ended September 1996 and  its

interim results ended March 1997 within the 6 / 3 months (as the

case  may  be)  required by the SES rules.   As  a  result,  the

investing  public  does  not have recent  information  on  CAM's

financial  position, including its solvency.  In view  of  these

circumstances, it would not be appropriate to resume trading  in

CAM shares now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SES will let the shares resume trading after the

Company  has  finalised and reported its September 1996  audited

accounts  and  March 1997 interim results, and the  Company  can

show  that  it has sufficient working capital to continue  as  a

going concern.

<br><br><i>What  will MOF do to avoid similar companies from getting listed so that small investors will be better protected?</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review of listing applications falls within the purview

of  the  SES.   No amount of rules can ever prevent  frauds  and

dishonest  conduct.   To  try to do so by  introducing  more  or

stricter  rules  will  increase the cost of  operations  for  an

overwhelming  number of good corporate citizens.  What  can  and

should  be done is to impose severe punishment on those  persons

found to have perpetrated serious frauds that caused huge losses

to  the public.  In addition, professional bodies, in this  case

the  Public  Accountants  Board and the Institute  of  Certified

Public  Accountants of Singapore, must deal with  unprofessional

behaviour of their members quickly and firmly.

Ltd  (HPL), a company listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore,

to  Senior  Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien  Loong.

exchange  rules.  The discounts offered to, and the prices  paid

by,  the  Senior  Minister and Deputy Prime Minister  Lee  Hsien

Loong were according to market practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the answer to the Member's question is that MAS'

with  about  48 lorry lots and 289 car lots at the vacant  site

next to Blk 151 Serangoon North Ave 2.  The MSCP is expected to

be completed in the second quarter of 1999.

<div align="center"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>MINORITY REPRESENTATION IN PUBLIC LISTED COMPANIES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Minister for Finance if he

will   consider   amending  the  law  to  allow   for   minority

representation in public listed company.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safeguarding the interests of minority shareholders is

important.   For  this  reason, there are  currently  already  a

number  of provisions in the Companies Act and SES rules  to  do

so.  The safeguards are as follows :

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) the Companies Act confers certain fundamental rights

on  each  and  every shareholder, regardless of  the  number  of

shares  he  or  she  owns.  These include the  right  to  attend

general  meetings, to speak thereat and to vote  on  resolutions

put  forth  at  such  meetings.  Minority  shareholders  are  at

liberty  to  ask  questions and voice  their  opinions  at  such

general meetings;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) under the law, each director has a duty to act

honestly and in the interest of the company as a whole,  ie,  in

the interest of all shareholders;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) both the Companies Act and SES rules require all

listed  companies  to establish an Audit Committee,  which  must

have  a  majority of independent directors.  The Audit Committee

helps  to  review  internal controls, financial  statements  and

procedures for related-party dealings;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) in cases of oppression or injustice done to any

minority shareholder, sections 216 and 216A of the Companies Act

provide avenues for redress; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) where the interest of substantial shareholders might

be  at variance with those of minority shareholders, such as  in

material  related-party transactions, the SES rules require  the

appointment  of  independent financial advisers  to  advise  the

minority  shareholders.   Furthermore, substantial  shareholders

who  have vested interests in such transactions have to  abstain

from voting on the relevant resolutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current regulations are adequate to safeguard the

interests  of  minority  shareholders.   Therefore,  it  is  not

necessary  to amend the law to allow for minority representation

in listed companies.

<div align="center"><b>REHABILITATED DRUG ADDICTS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  whether  his  Ministry will commit  more  resources  to

strengthen supports services for rehabilitated drug addicts  and

help them to find jobs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rehabilitating drug addicts is a key priority for Prisons

Department  and  the  Singapore  Corporation  of  Rehabilitative

Enterprises (SCORE).  However, in providing support services for

rehabilitated  drug addicts, we must strike  a  balance  between

providing rehabilitative opportunities for addicts and  imposing

sufficient deterrence against drug abuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current rehabilitative programmes focus on providing

employment opportunities and aftercare support for drug addicts.

<br><br><i>Providing employment opportunities</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inculcation of strong work ethic and discipline is a

major focus of our rehabilitative efforts.  Addicts who can hold

down  a  stable job tend to be able to reintegrate into  society

more  easily and lead a useful life upon their release from  the

Drug Rehabilitation

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1907</b></font><br><br>

Centres (DRCs).  Companies have set up workshops in the DRCs  to

provide  work  opportunities.  These workshops  provide  inmates

with  a  realistic work environment, and help them to  work  and

learn  on-the-job  skills.  SCORE also  provides  a  variety  of

vocational and generic training courses for drug inmates.  Since

1983,  more than 5000 inmates have benefited from these training

courses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an extension of its vocational training programme for

DRC  inmates, SCORE recently initiated the Corporate  Assistance

for Rehabilitation (CARE) Scheme.  CARE encourages companies and

organisations  in the private sector to play an active  role  in

community  service  by  contributing  towards  the  training  of

inmates.    Under  this  scheme,  companies  solely  or  jointly

sponsor  relevant training courses inside the DRCs.  In  return,

the trained inmates are attached to the companies for at least 6

months after their release, where they put their acquired skills

and knowledge to good use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rehabilitated addicts can also enrol under SCORE's

Corporate  Adoption Scheme (CAS) after their  release  from  the

DRC.   Under this Scheme, companies provide ex-addicts with jobs

and  appoint  a  mentor in the company to guide and  assist  the

individual  in  adapting  to the new work  environment,  and  in

regaining their self-confidence and esteem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCORE has also been running a Job Placement Unit (JPU)

since 1988 to assist released prisoners and drug addicts to find

suitable  jobs.   The  Unit helps to match  the  skills  of  the

inmates  to the requirement of suitable companies.  So far,  the

Unit has helped more than 9,200 inmates to find jobs.

<br><br><i>Providing aftercare support</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than employment, strong aftercare support is also

critical for the successful rehabilitation of drug addicts.  For

drug  addicts  who are sufficiently motivated to kick  the  drug

habit,   the   Prisons  Department  runs   a   Community   Based

Rehabilitation Programme (CBR) which allows them to be  released

earlier into the community to continue their rehabilitation in a

supportive  environment.  The emphasis of the CBR scheme  is  on

stable  work,  regular counselling and continuous  support  from

either  the  family  members or the  community  in  the  halfway

houses.   The  results of the programme have  been  encouraging,

with a completion rate of about 80%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCORE also runs a well-structured and comprehensive

counselling   programme,   called  the   Aftercare   Counselling

Programme  (ACP),  for  drug addicts.  The  ACP  is  a  one-year

programme  providing individual counselling,  group  counselling

and   family  counselling  under  qualified  SCORE  counsellors.

Clients are encouraged to participate in social and recreational

activities organized by SCORE.  As of 30th August 1997, a  total

of 940 recovering addicts and their families have benefited from

the SCORE Counselling Centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than SCORE, various religious and voluntary welfare

organisations  such  as the Singapore Anti-Narcotic  Association

(SANA)  also  provide  various  in-care  and  aftercare  support

services for drug addicts.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, adequate resources have been committed to put

in   place  a  comprehensive  range  of  support  services   for

rehabilitated drug addicts.  We will continue to review the need

for additional programmes from time to time.

<div align="center"><b>MADAM CHENG YOOK CHAN</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Health why was

there  such a long delay in treating Madam Cheng Yook Chan,  who

was  admitted to the A & E department and ward 46  of  Tan  Tock

Seng  Hospital on 20th October 1997 and who passed away the next

morning.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1909</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Cheng Yook Chan was triaged by the A&E specialist

nurse at 4.49 pm soon after her arrival at the A&E Department of

Tan Tock Seng Hospital on 20th October 1997.  She had complaints

of  giddiness, sweating and vomiting.  The A&E doctor  completed

his  examination  by 5.20 pm and the provisional  diagnosis  was

stroke.  She was kept under close observation by doctors in  the

A&E  Department, and admitted into the ward for stroke  patients

at about 7.00 pm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ward doctor reviewed her at 7.50 pm and she was given

medication for her high blood pressure.  The doctor also ensured

that  she  had a clear airway for breathing and that  her  blood

circulation  was adequate.  This is the standard  treatment  for

the acute phase of stroke.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A CT head scan was carried out around 10.30 pm after 8

other  emergency  cases  that came  in  before  Mdm  Cheng  were

cleared.    The   scan  showed  that  Mdm  Cheng   had   massive

intracranial  bleeding and accumulation of fluid with  increased

pressure  on the brain.  The CT scan findings were explained  by

the  neurosurgeon to the family members at around  12.30  am  on

21st  October 1997.  They were also informed of the need for  an

operation to relieve the pressure on the brain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Cheng underwent the operation a few hours later.

Unfortunately, she suffered a heart attack during the  operation

and passed away at 5.45 am that morning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no undue delay in the various stages of the

management  and  treatment of Mdm Cheng.   She  had  suffered  a

massive  stroke and had a very poor prognosis.  The doctors  had

done their best given the circumstances of the case.

<div align="center"><b>SOCIAL AMENITIES FOR FOREIGN WORKERS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Labour whether the

Government  has  utilised part of the foreign workers'  levy  to

provide  social  amenities to each of  the  national  groups  of

foreign  workers during their off days, and if there  are,  what

are those social amenities.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all other sources of revenue, the amount collected

from  the Foreign Workers' Levy goes into the Consolidated  Fund

which  is  used  to  finance Government  expenditure  on  public

infrastructure and amenities which benefit both Singaporeans and

foreigners  working  in  Singapore.   All  social  amenities  in

Singapore are open and available to foreign workers.  We do  not

prevent foreign workers from using any public amenities.   I  am

sure  the  Member  is aware that every weekend, foreign  workers

gather  at  places such as the Botanical Gardens, Orchard  Mall,

Crawford  Park and Rochore Centre to meet and socialise.   There

is  thus  no  need  to  provide special  amenities  for  foreign

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these public amenities, some employers also

provide  recreational and welfare facilities for their  workers.

These are open to both local and foreign workers in the company.

Some  even  build special facilities for their foreign  workers.

An  example  of  this  is  the  Acacia  Lodge  built  by  Keppel

Corporation    to   house   its   foreign   workers.     Besides

accommodation, the Lodge has facilities such as a canteen, mini-mart, launderette and a multi-purpose recreational hall.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB and JTC are prepared to lease out more sites to be

developed  as dormitories for foreign workers.  When  developed,

these  dormitory projects will also be provided  with  amenities

and recreational facilities for the residents.

<div align="center"><b>IMPROVEMENT OF WALKWAY ALONG KALLANG RIVER</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  whe  ther the Government can  improve  the  walkway

along  the Kallang River by constructing tunnels underneath  the

roads  so  that  pedestrians and cyclists could have  continuous

access along the walkway.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walkway referred to is the Kallang Park Connector. It

is  a  long  term plan by the National Parks Board to  build  an

islandwide network of park connectors linking the various parks.

Since  the  inception of the plan, the National Parks Board  has

completed 2 stretches of park connector along the Kallang River,

namely:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a 6.8 km stretch linking the Central Catchment at

Upper  Thomson  Road  and Bishan Park to  the  Jalan  Toa  Payoh

section of the PIE;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a 2.0 km stretch from Serangoon Road to Kallang MRT

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;station.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Parks Board is giving priority to build

segments  of  park  connectors to meet the  needs  of  residents

living  nearby.  Crossings  to  improve  the  continuous  access

require greater detailed planning, design and co-ordination  and

these are being phased in gradually when feasible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Parks Board will consider tunnels as well as

other appropriate crossings for park connectors. The choice will

depend on the traffic conditions of the surrounding roads,  land

availability  at  site and cost. The construction  of  the  park

connectors and crossings in built-up areas like those along  the

Kallang   River   is  further  complicated   by   the   existing

infrastructure  and developments there. So far 2 crossings  have

been  completed  along  the Kallang Park Connector,  namely  the

overhead bridge at Braddell Road and the at-grade crossing along

Bishan Road. More will be done in due course.

<div align="center"><b>CHILD ABUSE</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for Community

Development, in view of the fact that in half of all child abuse

cases  where the perpetrators are mothers, if he will look  into

the causes and what can be done to protect potential victims.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many causes of child abuse and the father is as

likely as the mother to commit child abuse.  One cause of  child

abuse  is the lack of parenting skills and the understanding  of

the  child's  needs.   Another is conflict between  the  parents

resulting in innocent children being used as punching bags.  Yet

another factor is the lack of bonding between the abusive parent

and the child.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parent education and family life education programmes are

therefore  essential.  MCD has since 1985 embarked on programmes

to  promote  family well-being and to enhance parenting  skills.

The  parent  and  family life programmes provide information  on

support services which individuals and families can turn to when

in need of help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD is also promoting public awareness of family violence

and   child  abuse  and  the  services  and  support  programmes

available.   Public education materials on family  violence  are

distributed  widely to professionals as well as  individuals  in

the community.  Talks and workshops on child abuse are conducted

by  the  MCD as well as voluntary organisations with the support

of  the Ministry.  Workshops on child abuse and family will also

be  conducted for staff of child care centres, kindergartens and

schools.   Family service centres also provide support  services

to  families  who  require  help.  All these  concerted  efforts

provide  a  wider coverage for detection of child abuse  in  the

community and provide support to families.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1913</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD is also amending the Children and Young Persons Act to

strengthen  provisions  to get the cooperation  of  parents  and

guardians in seeking treatment and help for themselves  and  the

victims.

<div align="center"><b>RAISING PROFESSIONALISM OF SOCIAL WORKERS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for Community

Development   if   he   will   review   service   standards   by

professionalising  social  workers  through   a   programme   of

accreditation which will require mandatory training and  regular

upgrading of required counselling and therapy skills.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of accreditation and registration of social

workers   has   been  studied  by  the  Ministry  of   Community

Development  (MCD) together with the Department of  Social  Work

and  Psychology of the National University of Singapore and  the

Singapore Association of Social Workers (SASW).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, we support the proposal to accredit and

register  not only social workers but also other human  services

and  helping  professions  (such as family  counsellors,  family

therapists and others) and to raise their professionalism.   The

issue  is how and when such a move should be implemented  as  it

has wide implications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good number of people currently in social work do not

have social work qualifications.  However, they have accumulated

good  experience  and  knowledge through attendance  at  various

courses  and  years of work experience.  How this pool  of  good

workers  will  be  treated and other issues  would  need  to  be

resolved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry together with the Department of Social Work and

Psychology  of  NUS  and  the Singapore  Association  of  Social

Workers   (SASW)   will  continue  to  study  the   matter   and

accreditation is one of the issues being considered.
