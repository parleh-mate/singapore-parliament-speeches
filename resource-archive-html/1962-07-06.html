<hr size="2" noshade>

* The motion, standing in the name of the Prime Minister, reads as follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the motion in regard to a referendum being held

for the people to decide between two alternatives of reunification standing in

my name, and the motion in the names of the Members for Anson and

Queenstown that the people  of  Singapore shall be asked only one question on  Polling  Day  and

that Government shall name Polling Day as a day four weeks from the date  of

the  Order  therefor, and another motion in the names  of  the  Members  for

Queenstown  and  Upper Serangoon that the House condemns the Government  for

its  dishonest  and malicious distortion of the Opposition's  stand  on  the

11th July, 1962.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Now, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That business motion, of course, also takes in items 11 and 12 on

the  Order  Paper. Perhaps it would be convenient if there is  also  a  business

motion moved under Standing Order 10, paragraph 2 - "That items 11 and 12 on  the

Order Paper be taken immediately after item 3."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is not the intention. The intention is that, since it

is  not anticipated that there will be any debate of any length on items 4 to 10

(since  they are all going to Select Committee, except items 4 and 5  which  are non-controversial), items 11 and 12 be taken after item 10.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> After item 10?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In that case the business motion can be "That item 3 be taken

after item 10." Is that it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is so.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Prime Minster please move?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I move under Standing Order 10 (2),



That item 3 on the Order Paper be taken after item 10.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That item 3 on the Order Paper be taken after item 10.

<div align="center"><b>(Business Motion)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I beg to

move,





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the motion in regard to a referendum being held for

the  people to decide between two alternatives of reunification standing  in  my

name,  and the motion in the names of the Members for Anson and Queenstown  that

the people of Singapore shall be asked only one question on Polling Day and that

Government shall name Polling Day as a day four weeks from the date of the Order

therefor,  and  another motion in the names of the Members  for  Queenstown  and

Upper  Serangoon  that the House condemns the Government for its  dishonest  and

malicious distortion of the Opposition's stand on the merger issue, shall all be

brought to a conclusion at 12 midnight on the 11th July, 1962.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, we have estimated a debating time of 2 to 3 days  for  these

three  items.  They are issues which have already been discussed over  and  over

again at considerable length, and no doubt Members of the Opposition would want

some considerable time to restate all their propositions in as interesting a way

as  I hope they can. Mr Speaker, Sir, it gives us roughly 24 hours of debating

time,  the  House sitting from 2.30 p.m. to 12 midnight on Monday,  Tuesday  and

Wednesday. However, if the Third Reading of the Referendum Bill finishes earlier

today - as I think it would be earlier than 12 midnight - then no doubt the debating

time  will  be suitably extended by the rapidity with which conclusions  on  the

Third Reading are brought to a close.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, you will remember that when

the  Deputy Prime Minister moved his closure motion with reference to the stages

of the Referendum Bill, I urge that it was unnecessary.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It was not really a closure motion; it was a guillotine

motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Thank you for your terminological correction, Mr Speaker. Sir, I

think  I will be proved right - I was certainly proved right as regards the  first

part as we ended before midnight yesterday - and I am sincerely hoping that I will

be  proved right as regards the second part, and it would have been much happier

if things could have taken their normal course. I do urge with respect, Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>



Speaker, and this might assist the Government - they are conscious that by  virtue

of  their prerogative, and I am not complaining of their prerogative, the  Prime

Minister  has introduced a motion which completely blankets out mine, which  is

item 11 - the one that I put in with the Member for Queenstown - except for the part

thereof  which speaks of naming the polling day as four weeks from the  date  of

the  Order. Now, Mr Speaker, the issue of four weeks from the date of the Order

has been fully discussed in this Assembly - it is true on the basis that, the Bill

was  a general referendum Bill at the time - but we all recognise that there would

be  no useful purpose served by rediscussing that issue and, I repeat, I for one

am  not  here to filibuster, Mr Speaker, and since the other part of the motion

is  covered  by  the Prime Minister, it is my intention not to move  the  motion

appearing  as  item  No.  11  of  the  Order Paper,  since  the  Government  has

anticipated it in the Prime Minister's motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in the light of that statement, perhaps the Government will agree with me

that  it  is highly improbable that we would exceed the time limit indicated  of

the  11th  July  and they may well wish to consider postponing consideration  of

this  motion,  let  us say, till Tuesday the 10th and if they  are  prepared  to

accept  it, I will be happy, Sir, to move under Standing Order, that this motion

do  stand  adjourned to the 10th of July. I am sure that they are no more  happy

than  I  am, Sir, to apply guillotine motions which are unnecessary,  and  I  do

suggest that this one is unnecessary, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, the Government have always said that they want to allow  full

discussion,  and here again they want to limit our discussions  to  only  a  few

days.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Point of order, Sir. The point of order being that perhaps

the Member for Queenstown may not be aware that he is not necessarily obliged to

make a speech just because the Member for Anson has done so, although the Member

for  Anson has touched upon his motion on the Order Paper, item No, 11, I think.

So Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps you can give the Member for Queenstown



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>



and  the House a ruling that no Member is thereby obliged to speak; there is  no

compulsive speaking in this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order. There is, of course, freedom of

speech and the Member for Queenstown can, of course, attack this motion.  He  is

probably  going  on  a different tack. The Member for Anson wishes  for  a  postponement, but the Member for Queenstown considers this is not sufficient  time,

I suppose.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see, Sir, even here he tries to muzzle me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> To try to help you.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Of course, he realises that ultimately it may be that it does

not  help  because he has already sold out Singapore and he has already promised

to sell out Singapore on time. That is why we have this guillotine. I am sure if

the  Prime Minister were honest to the people of Singapore; he would inform  the

people what he has actually promised. Is it because he has already promised  the

Federation that he would hand over Singapore by a certain date?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Let us come back to the guillotine motion, and the only

debate  can be as to whether or not there should be sufficient time.  Dr  Lee,

nothing further?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> All I need say to the Member for Anson is that I am obliged to him for reminding the House that we gave more than ample time in our

guillotine  motion  on the recommittal of the Bill, and  I am  obliged  to  him

further  in his agreeing with our estimation that there is more than ample  time

for the guillotine on this motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir I will be happy to postpone the moving of this motion till Tuesday provided he promises me his wholehearted support and asures me that we finish even

before Tuesday.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I thought the Member

said the 10th, i.e. Monday.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I beg your Pardon - Tuesday.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes. The 10th is

Tuesday.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The suggestion, Sir, was that the motion should be moved on

Tuesday for effect on Wednesday as suggested.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I suggest that since there might be great disagreement, we take

a  resolution  today? It makes no difference. If it is going to be  finished  on

Tuesday, well it is finished on Tuesday.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am much obliged to you for drawing the logical conclusion

- of our respective positions, Mr Speaker, and I bow to your ruling.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Prime Minister must not mistake the Chair. There is

no  ruling at all. It is just a suggestion that we might save some time on  Tuesday anyway. Perhaps there might be a debate on that motion an Tuesday.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Then, Sir, may I move,

That this motion do stand adjourned to Tuesday, the 10th July, 1962.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I, Sir, in view of the fact that you gave no such

ruling,  gratefully accept your suggestion, and suggest to the Member for  Anson

that  perhaps some valuable time on Tuesday which might otherwise  be  used  for

elaborating some of the finer points of argument of the Member, for  Queenstown

would  otherwise be lost, in his once again trying to feel obliged to  have  to

say  something  on that motion. I have already saved, himself  a  few  minutes

this  afternoon  and  I think we should save himself a  few  other  minutes  on

Tuesday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Does the Member for Anson insist? I might say that these

guillotine motions are not unusual in any Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Marshall indicated he did not

insist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the motion in regard to a referendum being held for

the people, to decide between two alternatives of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>



reunification  standing in my name, and the motion in the names of  the  Members

for

Anson  and  Queenstown  that the people of Singapore shall  be  asked  only  one

question on Polling Day and that Government shall name Polling Day as a day four

weeks  from the date of the Order therefor, and another motion in the  names  of

the  Members  for  Queenstown and Upper Serangoon that the  House  condemns  the

Government for its dishonest and malicious distortion of the Opposition's  stand

on  the merger issue, shall all be brought to a conclusion at 12 midnight on the

11th July, 1962.

di-Pertuan Negara's recommendation that this Bill be proceeded with.  I  beg  to

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE NATIONAL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>REFERENDUM BILL</b></div>



Order for resumed Third Reading



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question was, "That the Bill be now read a Third

time."  Since which an amendment has been proposed to leave out from  "That"  to

the  end  of the Question and to add instead thereof-

<br><br>"this Assembly, conscious that this Bill was introduced for the purpose of holding a

Referendum to ascertain the wishes of the people in relation to the issue of

reunification of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya, declines to give it a third

reading on the ground that the provisions therein are inappropriate and inadequate for

that purpose".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the words proposed to be left out, be left out."

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Lee Siew Choh had the Floor.



<br><br>2.50 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

as  I  was saying last night, this Referendum Bill has been the object of severe

attack  from  all  sections of the, people and from all  strata  of  society  in

Singapore.   Office   workers,   factory   workers   farmers,   students,    the

intelligentsia,  both  English-educated,  and  Chinese  educated,  businessmen,

professional men, all have joined in condemnation of this undemocratic,  unjust,

unfair  and dishonest Referendum Bill. The odium and the Fascist nature  of  the

Bill  are  clearly evident. There is hardly anyone in Singapore today  who  can

stand up and honestly say that this is a democratic, fair and honest Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson called it an abortion fathered by dishonesty out of

ineptitude I wish it was true Sir but I say it is not an

abortion. An abortion, Sir is something born dead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You are an expert.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is something not even properly formed when born, Therefore,

the  more appropriate word for this Bill is not abortion but a monster. Sir,  in

medical parlance, a monster



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>



is something that comes out from the womb and can still be alive. An abortion is

dead. You do not see it any more. Therefore, this Bill is a monster born out  of

dishonesty  and Fascist dictatorship. It is a monster which will be  born  alive

because  of the somersault of the S.P.A., but a monster which even the dishonest

and  dictatorial  P.A.P. themselves, the parents of this  monster,  cannot  keep

alive  for  very  long.  This monster of a Bill will only  become  law  for  the

execution and sell-out of the people of Singapore, and the dishonest

P.A.P. parents are themselves so ashamed of this monster that they will  have

to  kill it immediately after their dirty work has been done. It is too indecent

for parade and has to be kept away from public view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, amongst the political Parties represented in this House, the Workers'

Party,  the  United People's Party and the Barisan Sosialis have  all  condemned

this Bill. And until the critical hour not so very long ago, even the S.P.A. had

been loud in condemnation of the dishonesty in clause 29 of the Bill. The

S.P.A. unfortunately -

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> On a

point of order, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order, yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Is all this relevant to the motion before the House?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I suppose that every Member is entitled to an exordium. But I think

the Member for Queenstown is now going back to the debate on clause 29 which has

already been concluded. He must now concentrate his efforts on indicating to the

House how he thinks clause 29 or any other clause is inappropriate or inadequate

for  the purpose of holding a referendum. We do not want to near any debate  for

or against any particular clause in this motion in principle.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It hurts the Member for Farrer Park -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Queenstown has been ruled out of order. That part of

his speech is out of order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I merely wanted to point out, Sir, that had the S.P.A. not

joined in the dishonesty of the P.A.P., possibly through pressure from-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That all is too late. That speech should have been made

when  we were discussing clause 29. I think I have said this before and  I  will

say  it again, Members must accept the fact that these clauses have been written

into the Bill. Whether they like those clauses or not makes no difference. These

clauses  have been written into the Bill. Members must now show how  they  think

those clauses are inappropriate or inadequate.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Let me preface this, Sir, by saying that even outside this

House  all  the  other political Parties, whatever their political  beliefs  and

policies,  have come out openly against this Bill, because everyone in Singapore

now recognises that this Fascist Bill of the P.A.P. has infringed the very basic

aid  inherent right of individual free choice and of the individual right to say

"no".  For  example,  the  Liberal-Socialists,  the  Parts  Rakyat,  the  United

Democratic  Party,  the Workers' Party and the Barisan Sosialis,  although  they

have  different political ideologies and different platforms, have nevertheless,

in the face of this common danger, joined together and formed a Council of Joint

Action. We had hoped, Sir, that this Council of Joint Action might influence the

Government  to give up their Fascist ways and possibly put the interest  of  the

people above the interests of the few Ministers. Even professional bodies,  from

doctors, dental surgeons, pharmacists and journalists, have come out with strong

statements  condemning  the dishonesty and the undemocratic  provisions  in  the

Bill. Everywhere we go, Sir, in buses-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I really hate having to interrupt the hon. Member because I

know how strongly he feels in these matters, but he must realise that we are  on

the Third Reading. He is now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>



advancing an argument against the clauses in the Bill when they were drafted. He

must now accept the position that this Assembly has accepted those clauses.  The

position  now  is that there is a motion to decline to give this  Bill  a  Third

Reading.  And  the  reason for that is that in the view of  some  Members  those

clauses are inappropriate or inadequate for the specific purpose which has  been

declared,  and  that  is for the purpose of holding a referendum.  That  is  the

position. We have finished with the Second Reading debate. We have finished with

the  Committee  stage; we are now on the Third Reading, and the, debate  on  the

Third  Reading  must be confined to the contents of the Bill as they  are  there

now.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I realise, Sir, that it is not permissible, if we go

according  to the usual rules of debate, to harp back on things we  have  spoken

before. But, Sir, the P.A.P. Ministers must know what is happening outside  this

House  as well. This has a direct bearing on out discussions here in this House,

and  if  we  do  not  take  the  feelings  and  views  outside  the  House  into

consideration, then we may be ignoring a large section of opinion and be  merely

discussing the subject with a limited view.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The opinions outside this House were relevant when we were

discussing  the Bill in principle. When we were debating on the Second  Reading,

those  opinions  were  very  relevant; when  we  were  discussing  The  Bill  in

Committee,  those  opinions were very relevant. Now, as I say,  we  are  in  the

position where the Bill has gone through Committee and has come up for  a  Third

Reading. All that Members can do now is to refer to the contents of the Bill and

say this clause, that clause, is inappropriate or inadequate, and cannot be used

properly  for the purpose which has been declared, that is, for the  purpose  of

holding  a  referendum. If there are opinions which the  Member  would  like  to

express as to why they are inappropriate or inadequate, then, of course,  he  is

entitled to give those opinions.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will come to that by and by, Sir. But allow me to remind

the Ministers opposite of what the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>



people outside are saying. The Ministers have been hiding behind air-conditioned

rooms and Radio P.A.P. and they have not -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder if the

Member  could  point  to  a  certain clause in this Bill  which  indicates  that

Ministers are in air-conditioned rooms, working under easy conditions and so on.

What has that to do with the Third Reading?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Air-conditioned Chamber!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> My point is this, Sir, that if they had gone to meet the

people  outside  and had heard what they said, they would not have  pursued  the

course they are taking today.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Yes, all that would have been relevant, as I say, before the

Third  Reading.  But now we are on the Third Reading of this Bill.  Let us  be

relevant.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will come to it straightaway, Sir. But just one sentence

to let the P.A.P. know-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If that sentence is a continuation of previous sentences,

that sentence must be disallowed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, this sentence can be related to so many things at the

same time, but definitely it will be related to clause 29, because the people are saying there is nothing dirtier  than

the P.A.P. today. In Hokkien, the words they use are Chin Chia Chow.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chew Chua):</b> Shut up!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I heard a Member on the Government side taking objection

to  that  expression.  Well, I do not know what that expression  means.  If  the

Member  on the Government side would like to tell the Chair what that expression

means and how that expression is offensive, then I will have to make a ruling on

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Sir, the leader of the Barisan says Chin Chia Chow which

means very bad. What makes him say it is very bad?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. First let the Chair know the meaning of that expression.

That  is  not Mandarin. I do rot know whether there is a Mandarin equivalent.  I

think he says it is Hokkien. Now, let us have the meaning of it, unless it is so

bad that the Parliamentary Secretary does not wish to give me the meaning.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Sir, in Hokkien it is very bad. He says that the people are

saying the Party is very, very bad. Does he mean to say he comes here-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. So the meaning of that expression is "very, very bad"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think that is disorderly. It is not unparliamentary.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Let us carry on.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - for his kind explanation, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill, as we have said before, has no parallel in history. It is, to

use  the  words of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister,  so

dirty and unprecedented that the Bill, after it has become law and has done  its

dirty  deed, will have to be repealed immediately. From this alone, Sir, we  can

see  the  dishonesty  and Fascist nature of the Bill. It is  like  a  traitorous

murderer,  after  the  shameful  and traitorous  deed  has  been  done,  wanting

hurriedly to get rid of all evidence, of that instrument, that has been used for

the  treacherous and shameful deed. It is like the P.A.P., after they have  plunged  a  knife into the hearts of the people of Singapore, wanting to get rid  of

this  knife  as soon as possible. But let us ask them, where can this  evidence,

this  Bill  or this law, or this knife, where can this evidence be  hidden?  The

knife, Sir, can be buried in the bowels of the earth or thrown into the deep sea

and  may not be found again. But this Bill, Sir, this referendum law as it  will

be,  will  forever be recorded in the annals of history as the foulest  and  the

most shameful act of treachery of the P.A.P. leadership and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>



all  those  who condone and connive at such treachery. Sir, we have  spent  many

days of debate on this Bill. There were five days of it in Select Committee and

another  seven  days in the Legislative Assembly on the Second  Reading  and  on

recommittal.  No  Bill in the history of Singapore has been so controversial  or

has  been  the object of so much adverse criticism. Why? Because it  is  a  most

undemocratic, unfair, unjust and most dishonest Bill. The Member for  Anson  has

given  many  examples  of  the  dishonesty of the P.A.P.  The  P.A.P.  Ministers

themselves  know  this,  and  they know they cannot justify  their  undemocratic

principles  embodied in the various undemocratic clauses of the Bill.  So,  time

and time again in Select Committee, the

P.A.P. Ministers had to defend themselves with evasive and irrelevant arguments.

Whenever  the Ministers were cornered, whenever they could find no more excuses,

they sought refuge in their stock-in-trade answer, "This is a general Referendum

Bill."  They  talk of toddy shops, they talk of tobacco smoking,  pipe  smoking,

cigarette  smoking,  and they keep on repeating, "This is a  general  Referendum

Bill.  This  is a general Referendum Bill." Altogether I have counted  about  30

times  their saying this in Select Committee. Even in this Assembly, the  Deputy

Prime  Minister tried to pull the same stunt again. He said, "This is a  general

Referendum Bill." The only unfortunate part was that he did not know that we had

referred to all this before. He was out of the Assembly Chamber and he  came  in

stuttering  those  same  silly excuses. Yet all along in  their  arguments,  and

especially  when  we were discussing clause 5 of the Bill, they  indicated  that

this  Bill  was  meant  for merger. They said we had had enough  discussion  and

canvassing on the merger issue as we had house-to-house canvassing, rallies  and

discussion groups long, long before. Therefore, they considered there was enough

time  for  canvassing. But when the arguments suited them, they came out  openly

admitting  that  this  Bill is specifically a Referendum Bill  for  merger.  The

Minister  for Finance especially came out blatantly and said, "Let us come  down

to brass tacks. This Bill will be for merger." Similarly. I had occasion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>



to  quote, during the Second Reading, the Minister for Home Affairs and  the  Deputy Prime Minister all saying that the present Referendum Bill is for merger. I

think  the  Member for Anson referred to the Government amending his  motion  in

April and the wording of the amendment specifically said that this Bill is meant

for merger. Altogether, Sir, both in Select Committee and in the examples I have

quoted, they have said 20 times that this is a Bill for merger. So if you cancel

the  two  figures out, 30 against 20, it sounds as if it ultimately should  turn

out  to be a general Referendum Bill - 30 times general Referendum Bill, 20  times

specific  Bill. But now we have the final admission from the Minister  for  Home

Affairs  that this Bill is going to be for merger. They are going to  scrap  the

Bill,  scrap the law immediately after the dirty work has been done.  They  are

too  ashamed  to keep it after merger any more. This shows the utter dishonesty

of the P.A.P. and the twists and turns of the P.A.P. Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson gave a series of detailed quotations. I do not think it

is  necessary  for me to bore you with those very same quotations again.  But  I

would  like  to  bring the House back to the time when the Select  Committee  requested  views  from  the public. If you remember, Sir, advertisements  were  in

serted  in  the  newspapers  and all views and memoranda  were  supposed  to  be

submitted  by the 6th April. There were altogether 12 meetings, daily from  2.30

to  7.30  p.m., sometimes 8 o'clock, and much time and energy was spent  in  the

taking of oral evidence. Much play was made of the credentials of those who made

representations.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is completely irrelevant. The Member for Queenstown

must  know that that is irrelevant to the Third Reading. I take it he is  coming

to  the  point where these people were met with the suggestion that this  was  a

general Referendum Bill. If that is so, all he need say is that that was so, and

pass on to the next topic.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see, Sir, what I would like to point out is that the

Ministers had all the time been saying that it was a general Referendum Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>



They  had no intention of listening to all the evidence that was brought  before

the Select Committee, because in many of the observations and evidence given  to

the  Select  Committee, merger was the subject topmost in their  minds.  And

inspite  of  all the evidence and points of argument put forward in the  memoranda

from  the  various  organisations  and unions,  it  really  did  not  make  much

difference with the P.A.P. Because, Sir, at that time they already had  in  mind

their plot to pose two unacceptable questions.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know what point the hon. Member is making. If the

point  is that these representors were met with the suggestion that this  was  a

general Referendum Bill, then the point is in order. But if he goes beyond that,

he will be out of order. We are on the Third Reading.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, I was just trying to point out that while we were

deliberating  and while the Ministers were trying to prove to us how  impossible

it was to pose one question in clause 5, we thought that by getting the evidence

and the arguments from the various bodies, possibly we might be able to convince

the  Government to posing only one question. However the Prime Minister at  that

time had already told the world that it was going to be a referendum on two questions - on the mode and manner of merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in trying to criticise why this Bill should not have its Third Reading,

we must try and look into the motivation behind the Bill. Only then, Sir, can we

understand why certain clauses are not put in, why certain amendments  have  not

been accepted.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That, of course, is completely out of order. The amendments

which  were  not  accepted cannot now be debated. We are now debating  only  the

contents  of  the  Bill,  and the Member must show how those  contents  are  not

suitable for a referendum.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> My point is this, Sir: the Prime Minister had all the time

been  saying  that  the purpose of the Bill is to ascertain  the  views  of  the

majority of the people of Singapore. If this was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>



truly  and honestly carried out, no one would be able to quarrel with the P.A.P.

on  that.  But  that  is  not their true intention. The Bill  is  not  meant  to

ascertain  the views of the people truly, honestly and correctly.  The  Bill  is

meant to distort and manufacture views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye): For a factory.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, the most revealing words of the Prime Minister about

this Bill are that this Bill must be made to serve what it is intended to serve.

Those  were  his  words, Sir - "it must be made to serve what it  is  intended  to

serve." You link these few words of his with his words of "no risk" and "happier

position" in the Second Reading and on many other occasions afterwards, we  will

understand  what  this Bill is intended to serve. This Bill is not  intended  to

ascertain honestly the views of the majority of the people of Singapore.  It  is

intended to confuse the people, to deceive them, and to ensure that although the

people  do not support the P.A.P., nevertheless they have to support the  P.A.P.

That  is  the  purpose that this Bill is intended to serve.  I  wish  the  Prime

Minister would give his own explanation on this, because all this fits  in  very

well with why certain clauses are phrased and worded the way they are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had all the time known of this plot, Sir, and it was not difficult for us

to  pinpoint  the  various  clauses that fit into this  plot.  There  is  enough

objective  evidence in the Bill itself and in the various clauses,  and  I  have

already  indicated  where those clauses fit in. But if you  remember.  Sir,  our

difficulty was to get the P.A.P. themselves to admit this plot. You may remember

my  difficulty  in Select Committee when I tried to indicate to  the  House  the

thinking  and the machinations of the Government. And every time I was  thwarted

because  you  said it was a general Referendum Bill. Of course, you  were  quite

correct,  Sir;  you had indications from the Government Ministers  that  it  was

going to be a general Referendum Bill, and so it was supposed to be.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Chair should be dragged into this

controversial subject. All I need say is that anybody who reads that Bill would,

on first impression, agree that it is a general Referendum Bill and drafted as a

general Referendum Bill. That is all there is to it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I would not presume to drag the Chair into this at any

time,  Sir, but only to draw your attention to this fact in order to clinch  the

argument  which I want to put forward. If you remember, Sir, it was  very  difficult  for  me at that particular stage to present you with the full  picture  of

this  Machiavellian  plot. The Ministers maintained it was a general  Referendum

Bill  and  we  had to accept the words of the Minister at that particular  time.

But, as I said, our difficulty was to let the Ministers themselves admit that it

was  their  plot. And that is why, Sir, when they said I had a  thick  skull,  I

said, "Yes, let us assume that I have a thick skull."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Has the thickness of the skull of the

Member for Queenstown anything to do with the debate?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have already indicated to the Member for Queenstown how the

debate should go. And if he persists in irrelevancies, I must intervene a little

more than that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is now advancing an argument against clauses in the Bill which he was

entitled  to  argue at the proper time. As I have indicated, those clauses  have

now  been written into this Bill, and he must now indicate how those clauses are

in, appropriate or inadequate for the purposes of holding a referendum. That  is

all. He cannot now argue against the clauses as such.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will come to all this by and by, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> By and by!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> He wants to tell us bedtime stories!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No, I do not really intend to tell any bedtime stories,

Sir,  but  just to tell you the story of my difficulty in drawing  an  admission

from the Ministers themselves of what they were plotting in this referendum.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think hon. Members in the Assembly now know the hon.

Member  had a difficulty. Let us come back to the Third Reading. Let us come  to

"by and by". [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Since the Prime Minister is laughing, he probably understands our difficulty. He is a lawyer. He knows what it is all about. It is

difficult for us to get a person in the dock to admit all that they had in mind.

Our only course is to give them enough rope and let them hang themselves.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It looks as if you are the chaps who are so used to it!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, to come to the clauses. We must always remember this

P.A.P. plot  to pose two unacceptable questions to the people in a  referendum,

because  a one-question referendum would spell certain defeat and finis for  the

P.A.P. The voter is compelled to make a choice and he will not be allowed to say

"no".  If  the  voter should decide not to vote any of the two alternatives  and

throw  in  an  uncertain or blank vote, the P.A.P. want to grab  this  blank  or

uncertain vote and convert it into a P.A.P. vote. This is the main plot. I  dare

say  it must have come from the fertile, imaginative evil genius of the Minister

for Finance-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I indicate that how this clause came into the Bill is

now  past history? The clause is in the Bill. Therefore, the Member is in  order

up  to  the stage when he says that this Bill is not appropriate because a "yes"

means a yes in favour of the Legislative Assembly decision.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see the Prime Minister laughs very loudly. I am sure he

has  a  hand in this. The only thing is that I could not say what per cent share

he has in this plot.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Member for Queenstown try and appreciate what the

Chair  is  trying to do, to keep this debate on an even keel and as relevant  as

possible to what, in fact, we are debating?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Very well, Sir.

Let  us  come to some of the undemocratic and unconstitutional clauses  in  this

Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 5, the Government brought in precedents from various countries like

New  Zealand and Australia to prove their point that multiple questions had been

posed  in a referendum. But the earlier examples they gave were all on the  sale

of  liquor  and  on the hour at which bars are supposed to be closed.  The  only

decent precedent the Ministers brought forward was Newfoundland. But

in  every case, in all those examples, which the Ministers quoted, the voter  is

allowed  to say no. He is never forced to choose alternatives which are unacceptable to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has gone to great details on this to prove the contortionist tricks of the P.A.P. in hiding behind the excuse of "This is a general

Referendum Bill." The Member for Anson even mentioned the fact that  he  sought

to  introduce a specific referendum Bill to counter the arguments put forward by

the  Ministers that this is a Referendum Bill. I explained in great  detail,  as

did  some of the memoranda that were submitted to the Select Committee, that the

correct  translation of this Referendum Bill is not in Mandarin, "Chuen min  tow

piou" but "Chuen min fu chyueh."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is your translation. No dictionary.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see, Sir, the Prime Minister asked me to quote the

other  night  and I brought the quotation the next day. It was very unfortunate

that  the  Prime Minister never heard me and I presume that since the Prime  Minister had wanted me to produce authority and quotations, he would agree, if  I

could  bring the authoritative quotations. Otherwise there is no point  in  asking, if you wanted me to quote, it means that once I quote, you could agree  to

what I quote -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Let the Member

for Queenstown speak to the Chair. He has made his point. He did, in fact, bring

some authority.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Of course, the whole trouble with the Government is that they

have  already made up their minds. It does not matter what authority you  quote.

Their whole plot is to pose two questions, and when the expected



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>



reaction  is to throw in blank votes or uncertain votes in disgust, the

Government  want to make sure that that blank vote and uncertain vote belongs  to  the

P.A.P. It sounds a very simple plot. But it is so dishonest and so unfair to the

voter that this shame of the P.A.P. will be with the Ministers for a long,  long

time. All their lives they will not be able to live it down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I asked that a form of the ballot paper be put in the Schedule. This is

done,  Sir, in every country - in fact, in the whole world. And yet what happened?

Silly  excuses were given and again they used the same old phrase,  "This  is  a

general Referendum Bill."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember, Sir, when we were discussing this ballot paper clause - clause 18

- you  suggested that it would be best that I discuss it at this juncture. I will

now  put  the  case  before the Prime Minister that in every country,  in  every

honest democratic Government, they always have a form of the ballot paper to  be

used in a general election or in a referendum.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can I be of some guidance to the hon. Member? That is an

argument  for or against the ballot paper. His line now would be that  the  Bill

itself has not got the form of the ballot paper, and therefore, for that reason,

it is inappropriate or inadequate for a referendum in connection with merger. He

is  now  advancing an argument which was advanced in Committee. The position  we

are  faced  with now is that there is no form of a ballot paper and  the  Member

then  argues  that because there is no form of a ballot paper the  Bill  is  not

quite complete for this specific purpose.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> May I briefly mention, Sir, that in the Australian referendum, in New Zealand, the Compulsory Military Training Poll Referendum, in

the  Jamaica  Referendum, and in fact, in any instance that we can quote,  there

are  always  specific Forms of the ballot papers for the voters. If  the  P.A.P.

were  really honest, they would also provide for the form to be included  in  a

Schedule in the Bill. But, of course, when talking of this, one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>



must  remember  that it was the original intention of the P.A.P.  Government  to

spring  a  snap  referendum on the people so that no  one  would  know  how  the

questions would be posed, whether it would be one question or two questions, and

the voter would be confused as to how voting would take place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one more reason, as far as the P.A.P. are concerned, is that they wanted to

prevent the Opposition political Parties from even knowing what to expect and so

from telling the people how to vote. Now that the Government have indicated what

questions  they  want to pose, I suppose it should be a simple  matter  for  the

Government to have, the Form of the ballot paper in a Schedule in the Bill.  But

I  suppose their decision to let people know the questions came a bit  too  late

and  they have stuck to their original intention of not letting the people  know

what the ballot paper should look like. In any honest government the first thing

that will have to be done is to show a sample of the ballot paper to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember, Sir, that this referendum will be the first referendum we

have  in Singapore, and probably the last, and the people have the right to know

what  to expect. Without this ballot paper, the people may not know in what form

the  questions will be posed, and not know how to indicate their vote,  even  if

they  should  decide  to  vote  for those unacceptable  alternatives  which  the

Government  will pose to the people. For this reason, I would say this  Bill  is

not appropriate and should not have a Third Reading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my more important reasons are in clauses 27, 29 and 30. These are the

notorious  clauses of the P.A.P. and they stand as concrete evidence  of  P.A.P.

dictatorship and P.A.P. dishonesty. They also stand as concrete evidence of  the

depths  to  which  human  nature can sink in futile attempts  to  salvage  their

sinking  personal  fortunes.  Clause 29, Sir,  according  to  the  Minister  for

Finance,  is not based on any constitutional or legal principle, but the  P.A.P.

Government  think  they  should  introduce  such  illegal  and  unconstitutional

principles. They want to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>



legalise such unconstitutional principles to help them in their devilish plot to

sell out the rights of the people of Singapore. This clause has caused a raising

of  eyebrows in polite and diplomatic circles. But it has caused absolute horror

to  the  vast  majority of the people of Singapore, so much so  that  the  Prime

Minister  cannot even explain how they really want to use those  blank  clauses.

This clause, Sir, of course, ties up with clause 5, in that clause 5 allows  the

Government  to  pose  two unacceptable questions to the  people;  and  when  two

unacceptable questions are posed to the people and when they do not know how  to

answer those questions, the P.A.P. hope, under those circumstances, to reap  the

harvest of their plot. This is the most undemocratic clause that has come to the

notice  not only of Singapore but of the whole world. The Member for  Anson  has

said  even Dictator Hitler allowed the people a chance to say 'no', and did  not

force  them  to  put  in  blank  votes which ultimately  meant  votes  for  the

Government. This is a clause that has caused a further reduction in the ranks of

the P.A.P. and I only hope that more will be able to stand up for the rights and

interests of the people of Singapore. The P.A.P. say that this Bill is based  on

the  traditions of the best parliamentary system. I want to know  where  in  the

world  they can produce an example or a precedent of such a parliamentary system

-

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If any Minister

tries  to  do that at this stage, he will be out of order. We are on  the  Third

Reading.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> This clause, Sir, must also be linked with clause 32, sub-clause (2). Imagine, Sir, a voter faced with two unacceptable questions.

What is he to do? If he does not go

to  vote, if he boycotts the referendum, clause 21, sub-clause (5) says that his

name  will be expunged from the electoral register. Sub-clause (7) says that  he

can have his name restored after payment of $5, but his name may not be restored

to  the  electoral  register until the next ensuing revision of  such  electoral

register. In fact, there may be no revision at all and, in the meantime,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>



after this referendum, a general election may be held. So the voter will be

deprived  of a voice in the formation and in the choosing of a new government.  We

do  not  think this is justice. I suppose these are the finer points which  the

Prime  Minister with his legal training has added, in order that the voter  may

be forced into that so-called zugzwang position -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You are in a zugzwang!

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Suppose the voter

goes to the booth to cast his vote and is

again faced with the impossible situation

of not being able to choose one or the other of the alternatives -

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Why not?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He does not like

the  Minister for Finance, he does not like the Prime Minister and so he  throws

in a blank vote.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Who gets it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yet these uncertain and blank votes will be pinched if not by

the  Prime  Minister, then by the Minister for Finance. So, although the  voter

does  not  support either of them, yet the law makes it that  he  must  support

what the P.A.P. decides on -

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You get a chance to have a seat.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If the voter had really decided to support the White Paper,

he  would have voted for the White Paper, because the White Paper is one of  the

alternatives  offered in the ballot paper. It is because he  rejects  the  White

Paper and cannot accept the other alternative offered that he puts in a blank or

an  uncertain  vote.  Yet, the Prime Minister says the  voter  is  offered  free

choice. They refuse to admit, Sir, under the circumstances, that this clause  is

doing an injustice to the voter. For this alone the House should not approve the

Third  Reading  of  the Bill. Let us suppose the voter  does  not  want  to  be

swindled by the P.A.P. Let us suppose he is so disgusted and annoyed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>



with  the questions that have been posed to him that he destroys his own  ballot

paper or defaces his own ballot paper. See what punishment is meted out to  him.

In clause 32, sub-clause (2), he may be imprisoned for one year; he may not have

his  name on the electoral register for three years; and he will not be able  to

stand  for election as a Member of the Legislative Assembly. Sir, all these  are

new things which-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order. The Member has alleged that these

provisions  are  new,  which  is not only incorrect  but  known  to  him  to  be

incorrect.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not strictly a point of order. But the Prime Minister is correct. The Member must not in turn make statements which are not, in fact,

correct. I think the hon. Member for Queenstown does know that there is a 75 per

cent similar section in the old Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is my point, Sir, It is not the same. For example, in

the  Elections Ordinance, there is no such thing as a blank ballot paper clause.

Why does he not follow the Elections Ordinance? In the Preamble-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Prime Minister is referring to clause 32 (2). Perhaps

the  Member  can  make the point straightaway. Really he should point  out  that

there is no such thing as

"intentional" defacing under the Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance.

The word used is "fraudulently" defacing. Let us hurry up about it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, I pointed this out when we spoke on it on the Second

Reading. The words "intentionally destroys and intentionally defaces" have  been

put  in  because only in this way will the P.A.P. be able to force the voter  to

go  to  the  voting  booth and cast his vote. That is the whole  idea  of  this

punishment which they have put



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>



into  the Bill. The Prime Minister has suggested a way out. He says, why do they

not  indicate  their vote and write their names and addresses?  But  surely  the

Prime Minister himself knows. He himself has repeatedly said that quite a lot of

people  in  Singapore do not know how to read and write. That is the reason  why

symbols have to be used.

Yet he is suggesting this to the voter.

The  Member  for Anson has already pointed out that this solution of  the  Prime

Minister  will only cause the voter to contravene the basic principle of  voting

and destroy the secrecy of the vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to say, Sir, that this suggestion of the Prime Minister has

something  more sinister. The powers of the Government are very great.  Although

they have only 25, they are still the Government, and it would be very difficult

for  a lot of people to come out openly to oppose them. People like us will tell

them so, straight in the face, that we oppose them all the time. But there are a

lot  of  people who are not in the happy position that we are in, and they  dare

not openly tell the Government that they oppose them although in their heart  of

hearts they wish that the

P.A.P. Government were dead and gone, and gone forever, never to return.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this suggestion of the Prime Minister has something more sinister and

cannot  so  easily be accepted by the people. So you see, Sir, what  sort  of  a

zugzwang the voter finds himself in. If he boycotts the voting, he will get some

punishment. If he comes along and tears his own ballot paper one way or another,

he  will  be  punished in one form or another. If he puts in  his  vote,  it  is

against his conscience. If he puts in a blank vote, he gets swindled by  a  very

dishonest Government. Is this the meaning of free choice? Is this the meaning of

democracy that the P.A.P. always talk so much about?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as has already been repeatedly pointed out to you, this blank vote clause

is merely to allow the Government a chance to convert their minority of, say, 10

per cent votes into a 100 per cent victory. But what makes this plot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>



more  sinful and devilish is that in stealing those votes the P.A.P.  Government

dare not reveal how many votes they have stolen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in clause 27, sub-clause (7), I asked for a declaration of the result of

the voting.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Point of order, Sir. As I understand it, Mr Speaker, Sir,

speaking on the Third Reading does not mean going seriatim clause by clause. It

means  one  discusses the whole Bill as it has already been  passed.  Or  is  he

talking on the amendment moved by the Member for Anson? But whatever it  is,  it

does not mean he has to go through seriatim clause by clause.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The debate on the Third Reading must be confined to the contents

of  the  Bill. Therefore, references to clauses are permitted. But I  think  the

Member for Queenstown is in danger of re-opening a debate on an amendment  which

has been rejected in Committee. That he cannot do. What he can do is to say that

the  clause is defective because it does not tell the Superintendent to declare

the result of the voting detail by detail. That is all he can say, and he cannot

now debate on the merits of the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No, Sir, I was not going to bring out the merits or demerits of the amendment. But I have to explain and tell the people and Members

of  this  House  that such non-declaration of the result of the  voting  or  of

polling  is  never known in the history of the world, except in  dictatorships.

But  our P.A.P. Government still claim that they are democratic, and, according

to  the Minister for Health and Law, our Bill is based on the traditions of the

best  of British parliamentary systems. Where can they quote any incident,  any

example, any precedent where -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There again the

Member for Queenstown is going quite far away from what can be permitted

on  the  Third Reading. We are not interested in other countries at the  moment.

That  interest  is  past. That interest was present when we  were  in  Committee

discussing the amendments. Now,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>



as  I  have indicated, the Bill is as appears before us and, therefore, all that

the  Member must do now, if he wishes to be relevant, is to indicate  how  these

clauses  or  any  particular  clause is, taking  the  amendment,  inadequate  or

inappropriate for the purposes of a referendum.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, in any election or in any referendum, the result of the

voting  must be declared and the full details must be made known to the  people.

It  is  the right of the people to know and it is the duty of the Government  to

lay  all  the  facts before the people. Yet in our Referendum Bill there  is  no

proper  form  in which the results of the voting can be stated clearly  for  the

information of the people. Then what sort of voting is this? They might as  well

grab  all  the votes and say, "We have won." Why have the voting?  How  are  the

people  to  know how they have voted? Surely even if the P.A.P. want  to  steal

those  votes, let them be brave enough and courageous enough to tell the  people

the number of votes they have stolen. This declaration here, Sir, to be included

by  the  Superintendent in his declaration of the result of the referendum,  has

been specially put in and is meant to be vague and to mislead the people so that

they  might not know about the evil intentions of the Government concerning  the

blank  votes. And what is more revealing is that the Minister for Finance - I  see

that he has come in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have already indicated that Members must be permitted to

leave  the Chamber and to come in with decorum. They must not be referred to  as

they are doing that. Otherwise we will have a very disorderly House.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am glad, Sir, that the Minister is here to listen to it

because I want to refer to him particularly. If you will remember in the  Select

Committee, when the Minister for Finance was asked about the declaration of  the

result of the voting, he said that the Government reserved the right to disclose

or not to disclose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Surely.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - the result of the voting to the people. I have already

mentioned  that  this  Bill is supposed to be based on the  best  traditions  of

British parliamentary practice. Can the Minister quote any precedent which  says

that the Government reserves the right to disclose or not to disclose the result

of the voting?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There again the Member is going off the track. That is an

argument which has been advanced in Committee and cannot now be advanced on  the

Third Reading. He must now accept the fact that that is so. The clause is in the

Bill.  Now he should attack the clause as it is written. He must not now  debate

to say that the clause should not be there. It is there.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, I do not intend to pursue that subject any further.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Thank God!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Prime Minister says. "Thank God!" because he is afraid

that more exposure will follow.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You are boring yourself!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Then in the matter of canvassing. Although it is the

intention  of  the Government to allow canvassing, it still limits the facilities  of

the  Opposition  to  use  posters, placards and banners.  Since  it  is  a  very

important national matter, we consider that it is not a good thing not to  allow

posters

and banners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need only refer now to the presumptive clause - clause 52 - of the Bill. All

this has been adequately pointed out by the Member for Anson, and I do not think

I need go  further into the points raised by him. But we must try and stress one

thing.  The provisions which stop people from paying visits to houses will  make

polling  day a day of curfew. Such provisions are inappropriate in  a  Bill  of

this Sort. This Bill really deserves to be an abortion., I hope it will be. The

only  thing  is  that  now that it is being  supported  by  the  S.P.A.,  the

Government will be sure to push through, this merger Referendum



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>



Bill. We are against it because of the pretence and the dishonesty seen in every

page  of  this  Bill;  because there is no ballot  form,  because  there  is  no

statement  of  the result of the voting in a specially prescribed form,  and

because  we  say  definitely it is not in the best of traditions of  parliamentary

democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has on many occasions said that this Bill is based on a

Fascist  dictatorship with our Prime Minister trying to out-Hitler  Hitler.  I

do  not think we should have a Third Reading and allow this Bill to become  law

so  as to besmirch the good record that we have in this Assembly. We should not

allow the annals -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He does not know what he is talking about.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - of history in Singapore to record such deceit and

shameful  dishonesty of the P.A.P. The Prime Minister says that  there  is  too

much  at stake. I agree with him, Sir. The only difference between us being that

when  the  Prime Minister says that there is too much at stake,  he  means  that

there is too much at stake for the

P.A.P. and for himself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You must be a simple man. That is the point.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> For us we feel that there is too much at stake for the

people  of  Singapore for generations to come. I would urge the Prime  Minister,

before  he takes the, final plunge to think again - think of the consequence  that

may follow. Governments have

resigned  and gone back to the people for a new mandate on much smaller  issues.

But we have here Ministers so intoxicated with, power that they must cling on to

power -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I remind the hon. Member that we are on the Third

Reading  of the Bill, and all this is irrelevant? I, was under the  impression

that,  this  was a peroration. If it is a peroration, it must be a  short  one.

The  Member should wind up his speech. But, it he goes on and on in this  trend

he is completely irrelevant. I will allow a peroration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I have no wish to say much more, Sir, except to tell the

Prime Minister, for heaven's sake, not to threaten and intimidate the people  of

Singapore.  Every  time  he opens his mouth, he says, "Either  you  have  merger

peacefully  and harmoniously or willy-nilly..." What does he  mean  by  that?[Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Prime Minister tries to answer that question I will

have  to  pull  him up because it is completely irrelevant. Has the  Member  for

Queenstown completed his speech?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am unable to agree with the Member for

Anson in his amendment that this Bill is either inappropriate or inadequate  for

the purpose for which it is set out to do, namely, to find out what the majority

of  the  people of Singapore consider about the mode and manner of  merger.  Mr

Speaker, since I last spoke, I have come upon another referendum which is  going

to  be  held in the territory of Uganda. I refer you now to the London Times  of

28th June, page 9. The issue involved is how two countries in Uganda are to  be

disposed of: whether it belongs to the Kingdom of Bunyoro or to the Kingdom  of

Buganda. Both kingdoms claim these two what they call lost counties. A referendum  is  going to be held in these two lost counties to ask the people to decide

between  three choices. First, to remain under the  rule of Buganda. Second,

to  be  transferred to Bunyoro's rule. Third, to remain  permanently  under

Central  Government control, namely, that of the central Government of  Uganda,

which  includes  the  kingdoms of Bunyoro and Buganda. Sir,  this  has  been

processed no doubt by some of their best men in the British Treasury,  on  the

Bench, men trained in the highest traditions of, parliamentary democracy. They

are  presented  with a thorny problem - two kingdoms claim two  lost  counties.

Nobody  has been mad enough to suggest to ask the people of Buganda, "Do  you

wish  to join Buganda; yes or no? And if the answer is no, then you remain  lost

counties." But very sensibly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>



they  have  said,  "Your future can be determined in one  of  three  practicable

alternatives - either you go with Buganda, under which you are  now  administered;

or  you go with Bunyoro; or you remain outside Buganda and outside Bunyoro under

the  Central Government. Nobody has said this is undemocratic. The London  Times

of the 28th of June -

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No blank votes?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Well, Sir, I am glad we are coming to something because I am

grateful  for  the interjections of the Member for Anson, because from  time  to

time  he  helps  to clarify the situation. By his interjection he has  clarified

that  15  representatives is fair. He has written to the newspapers now  to  say

that it is fair. By his interjection now he says it is fair to put these choices

to the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am obliged to the Prime Minister. I trust he will not wish to

misrepresent  me. I did not say it was fair. I said it would be  fair  to  have

proportionate  representation, but we are prepared to accept the  discrimination

in  reference  to 15 representatives because it is not vital.  As  regards  the

blank votes, I shall say nothing. Sir, Let him continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is not my, Recollection of what I read in the, newspapers. He was at great pains to point out to the editorial writer -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is a bit

irrelevant and the argument can continue afterwards in the C.P.A. room.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir I am told that the argument has already, been started

here.  Before I go back to the debate, may I just point out to the  Member  for

Anson that he, in effect, admitted in the radio forum on a certain date that if

he  were  allowed to put what he calls complete and unconditional  merger  as  a

choice, it would be a fair choice-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes or no.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister will appreciate that all this

will come out, I suppose, when we debate his own motion. Let us come back to the

Third Reading of this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> So, Mr Speaker, Sir, coming to the reasonable voter who

goes  into the polling booth, he is being asked by the Government, which is  not

obliged to ask him; the Government has a mandate to carry this thing through. It

is  not  obliged  to  ask him. But because we wish to give  him  the  choice  of

complete and unconditional merger

-Penang/Malacca, says the Member for Queenstown; unconditional, says the Member

for Anson, Johore, says the Member for Hong Lim -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Brunei!

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Well then, there it is. He can indicate his choice. We in

this  Assembly  by  a  majority of 32 recommend to the  voter  that  certain  arrangements  we  have made are just and equitable. But if he  decides  to  reject

them,  he  can do so, and he can go in as a complete constituent State  with  no

reserve powers. Therefore, he marks his choice; he indicates his vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was the Member for Queenstown who said in the radio forum in September

last  year  that  he was against a referendum in general. He  wanted  a  general

election. He is not interested in a referendum, it does not achieve his purpose.

People  are  not  accustomed, he said, to a referendum; they do not  understand.

Sir, we have paid due regard to what he says. We always do, Sir.

Whatever they say, we listen most attentively, even when it is repeated for  the

tenth  time,  in case there is a variation or a change of mind, or a  change  of

heart. Because possibly some people may not understand. They may not cast  their

vote  at  all, because they may not be able to understand the symbols, they  may

not  be  able  to  read  the two propositions that we intend  to  put  to  them.

Therefore, since nobody suggests that because some voters cannot understand, the

whole nation should remain undecided. Obviously, the nation must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>



decide;  a decision has to be made and proceeded with. The obvious thing is  not

to  proceed  against the resolution of this House, but in accordance  with  the

resolution  of  this House. What is undemocratic about that?  If  a  man  understands  the  issues, intelligent, educated man like the Member for  Queenstown;

he  is  literate, Sir, although from time to time he makes noises which suggest

there  are  more  primeval instincts in him. I am sure he  understands.  I  was

talking  of  primeval  instincts  and  it  immediately  drew  a  response.   He

understands  it, he knows the process, and he marks his choice. All  right.  So

be  it,  the  lesser of the two evils. He does not want both.  Either  way,  he

knows  a  cordon will be closed. He knows this is zugzwang. He  does  not  want

merger.  He is against it on principle. But, of course, he made the unfortunate

mistake  of publicly saying he wanted more merger -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think

the Prime

Minister is going far away from the Third Reading. The Third Reading is confined

to  the  contents of the Bill. If the Prime Minister can relate what he says  to

the contents of the Bill, then he is in order.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The voter having indicated that he likes Penang and

Malacca - he does not like it at all really, he does not want to let us  have  his

vote - he  then  writes his name and address. As he has said, he is  going  to  do

that. Well and good. Then we say.

here  is a man who has not been cheated by anybody, he is literate, he has  gone

through  the process and he invalidates his vote. It is fair enough. At the  end

of  it all, what do we get? We have two bundles and a little bit extra, a third,

where  chaps like the Member for Queenstown will indicate that they do not  wish

to  be  counted in at all. One bundle will indicate those who are in  favour  of

alternative  A; one bundle will indicate those who are in favour of  alternative

B, and  the  duty of the Superintendent is to announce the result;  thereby  it

becomes  the  duty  of the Government to follow the will of the  electorate  and

bring  about  merger; much to the discomfiture of the Member for  Queenstown.  I

wish to tell him that I cannot, at this stage, tell him exactly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>



when the happy day will be, but I can assure him that it will be well within the

allotted  programme, the target date of June 1963, and all being  well,  I  hope

June 1963 - [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> All being well, we hope to have the pleasure, if not of his

company, at least of his felicitations, when we celebrate the great event.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, everytime I

want  to  face  the  Prime Minister to ask him something, he shows  boredom  and

discomfort.  After  what I have heard him say, I feel he has  not  answered  the

Member  for  Anson and the Chairman of our Party as regards the passing  of  the

Third Reading of this Referendum Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel the Third Reading stage of this Referendum Bill

should  not be passed. Physically using such a Bill to defend democracy is  just

like  asking a patient to take opium or morphine. In the whole history  of  this

Legislature,  this  Bill is on the negative side. There is not  in  the  Bill  a

single positive encouragement to the people's confidence in democracy. There are

many  clauses  in the Referendum Bill but no clause to encourage the  people  to

express  freely their choice in regard to the questions on merger.  On  the  contrary,  the  Bill contains many clauses which seek to restrict and  exploit  the

people's  right to express their free choice. There is not a single clause  that

encourages  the  people  and the different political Parties  to  express  their

detailed plans for merger. On the contrary, the Referendum Bill prohibits people

from  expressing their views as regards merger which are contrary to those  held

by the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, because of this, I feel that by using such methods to pass

such a Bill, the Government cannot achieve the aim of protecting democracy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.35 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Second Reading of this Bill and in the consideration of this Bill in

Select  Committee we saw that the Government did not intend to follow the  views

of  the  people.  Actually  the  main aims of the  debates  in  this  House  and

discussions  in the Select Committee are to accept the views of the  people.

Representatives of various people's societies and organisations have

appeared  before  the  Select  Committee and expressed their criticisms and

suggestions  in

regard  to the unreasonable clauses in the Bill, but the Government has paid  no

attention whatsoever to these criticisms and suggestions. On the contrary, after

the  Second  Reading and the Committee stage on this Bill, the  Government  have

imposed  another more unreasonable clause. During the proceedings on the  Second

Reading, we can see another characteristic of the Government, that is, they have

no  answers to the criticisms by societies and unions and political Parties.  On

the  other hand, the Government are afraid of the views of the political Parties

and of being put into a mess.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the final stage of the Second Reading, some Ministers suggested some

clauses that after the merger of Singapore and the Federation, the Bill would

be  discarded. This proves that the Government agree that many clauses  in  this

Bill  do  not  have  the approval of the people, because these  clauses  are  unreasonable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, this Bill should not be read a Third time, because the

clauses in the Bill are basically inadequate. During its Second Reading, we have

seen the Government use unreasonable ways to get it through. We are not prepared

to  go  through  clause  by  clause  to  say  which  clause  is  inadequate  and

unreasonable  and which is forcibly put in. We can only generally say  that,  on

the  whole, in the whole history of this Legislature, the sole aim of the ruling

Party  is to attack the Opposition Parties through the clauses of this Bill.  To

achieve this, some of the clauses of the Bill exploit the fundamental rights



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>



of  the people - that is, they are contrary to established and ordinary laws. Just

now, our Leader as well as the Member for Anson pointed out the inadequacies  of

the  Bill, because, as regards the choice between "Yes" and "No", the Bill  does

not  specify  the  form  of  the ballot paper or how the  Superintendent  should

announce the voting results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has clearly pointed out that in our Elections Ordinance,

there  are  altogether  17 Schedules. In our present National  Referendum  Bill,

there is not even a Schedule, but there are some inadequacies. That is why  this

Bill should not be read a Third time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out something that is of special interest and requires

special attention. This point has been mentioned by the Member for Anson on  the

Second  Reading  of the Bill. It is clause 32. When a voter commits  an  offence

under  this clause, and if he is a Member of this House, he will have to  vacate

his seat here. But this is contrary to section 42, subsection (3), paragraph (a)

of the Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council, 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Health on the Second Reading of this Bill confessed that this

was  a legal point needing the solution of legal experts. From this we can  know

that  the  provisions, the wording and the power as provided in the  clauses  of

this Bill are ultra vires the present Constitution. Whether those provisions are

correct,  proper  or  legal will have to be decided upon  by  international  constitutional lawyers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government have decided upon those provisions only by the strength of their

majority vote of one. That is not the proper attitude to take in legislation  by

a government. The whole purpose of this Bill appears to be to put the Opposition

Parties to death. If that is so, this Bill should not be read a Third time,  and

we oppose its Third Reading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, I am of the opinion that the P.A.P. Government, when passing

the Second Reading of this Bill did not have the majority support of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>



the  Members  of the House. We consider that the P.A.P. gets its support  mainly

from  U.M.N.O. and S.P.A.; and even U.M.N.O. and S.P.A., in fact, not  long  ago

condemned  this Bill, arguing that it is contrary to the views and will  of  the

people  and  is  undemocratic. On the Second Reading of the Bill,  when  several

unreasonable and undemocratic provisions were discussed in this House,  U.M.N.O.

and  S.P.A.  Members took our side and criticised those clauses; but  now  under

pressure  from  the  Government of the Federation of Malaya, they  have  changed

their stand. That is why the Bill passed its Second Reading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen)</b>: The Member for Upper Serangoon is completely out of order when he

alleges  that  the Opposition Members of U.M.N.O. and S.P.A. are under  pressure

from the Federation Government. As he knows, a friendly government should not be

dragged into a debate in this Chamber. Mr Chan Sun Wing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

I  only wanted to point out that what I meant was that the P.A.P. Government could

get  the  Bill  through its Second Reading because of that characteristic  event

which helped them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, the passage of the Second Reading of this Bill will give the people of Singapore a very profound political lesson. That is why we support the

contention that the Bill should not be read a Third time. It is because we  feel

that   if   this  National  Referendum  Bill  were  passed  under  the   present

circumstances,  it would make the people come to the inevitable conclusion  that

the  law  can be manipulated by the Party in power. If this House were  to  pass

such  an unreasonable Bill, then the House would be debasing the concept of  law

and  would confuse the people as regards the true value of legislation, and that

would  go  contrary  to  the protection, preservation  and  maintenance  of  the

democratic system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mammen, Sir, this point is very important, because the purpose of

legislation is to enable the people to respect the process of legislation and to  see

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>



value  of law. Only when legislation is done in such a positive way can it bring

something good to the system of democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall that in 1959 at the general elections, the Prime Minister made a speech

at  a  mass  rally  in  Fullerton Square, and quoted the history  of  the  Asian

revolution.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> We are now having a general debate on the Third Reading of

this Bill, and I do not see any relevancy in the reference to the Prime Minister

when  he  talked about the Asian revolution in 1959. If the Member continues  on

that line, he is completely irrelevant to the Third Reading of this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Deputy Speaker, Sir, I believe this point is very relevant. I only want  to

quote  a  very  short  passage - just  one instance.  It  is  because  the  P.A.P.

Government want to force this Bill through. We oppose this Bill and we tell them

they  cannot  achieve the purpose of democracy and service to the  people  which

they claimed was what they wanted to do. As they have said before, the value  of

a  government  does not depend on how many houses or hospitals or  what - not  the

Government  have  built. The most important thing is to reform  society  and  to

enable the people to understand the system of democracy, the Legislature and  to

change  their  views in regard to this House and their views on  the  government

machinery;  because in the past the people did not value very much these  organi

sations  because  they were under a colonial government. But if  the  Government

were  to  pass  this Bill in this House, they would not be able  to  change  our

people's hatred towards these organisations and institutions as they had under a

colonial  government. Under these circumstances, as I have earlier pointed  out,

the measures adopted by the Government are

just like giving a patient opium or morphine. It may perhaps prolong the life of

the  patient  or stimulate him for some time, but in the end, the  days  of  the

patient will be numbered. It is only a matter of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>



time.  For these reasons, we cannot agree that the Bill should be read  a  Third

time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the debate on the Referendum Bill, which is

designed for the people of Singapore to decide on the mode and manner of merger,

has  reached its final stages in this Assembly. The Communists and their stooges

in  the  Barisan Sosialis have made strenuous efforts to prevent the  Bill  from

being passed. They tried to do so on the First Reading of the Bill; again on the

Second  Reading,  and in the Select Committee. Having already  failed  on  three

occasions,  they  are now making a desperate bid to prevent the  legislation  of

this Bill at all costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the debate has elicited one stark fact, and that is,

the  nefarious  motives of the Communists and their stooges to  prevent  merger.

They  are  basically opposed to merger. It was because of this basic  difference

that  they decided to part company with the P.A.P. and take a negative  attitude

towards  merger  and this Bill. Because they have failed in their  bid  to  foil

merger,  they  are  now  raising  the cry that we  are  being  undemocratic  and

dishonest  to the people. These charges are, of course, unfounded, because  when

we  examine their attitude during the debate on merger and the Referendum  Bill,

we are able to expose their real intentions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, firstly, every political Party has stood for the

reunification of Singapore with the Federation. The Barisan overtly want merger,

but covertly do not want merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang):</b> Point of order, Sir. Are we debating this Bill or the merger issue?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I was listening to the speech by the Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Minister for Labour and was trying to discern this  particular

point  affecting merger, but before I could pull the Parliamentary secretary  up

for being irrelevant, the Member for Choa Chu Kang jumped up on a point



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>



of  order. If he had been a little late, of course, the Chair would have carried

out  its  natural role and stopped anything that is out of order. Mr  Wee  Toon

Boon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, as I was saying just now, I just want

to  establish  the  negative attitude of the Barisan  towards  merger  and  this

Referendum  Bill. As I have said just now, the Barisan overtly want merger,  but

covertly  do not want it. When the Communists and their stooges were  confronted

with  open  discussion  on  merger, they immediately  shifted  their  stand  and

demanded only complete internal self-government- [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I think

the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to the Minister  for  Labour  is  going  into  an

argument,  or  inviting  the Opposition to go into an argument,  on  the  merger

aspect. He should skip that particular part of the merger issue and come back to

the  Third  Reading  of the Referendum Bill, as the general  principle  and  the

clauses have been accented in the Committee stage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, that is exactly what I wish to

establish.  They are criticising that the Government is dishonest,  because  the

Government  is  not  going to put the White Paper as  a  question  only  in  the

referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their reasons for this are too obvious and I will not belabour this point.

When  the absurdity of their stand, which, in fact, would mean the perpetuation

of  colonial  rule, was exposed, they shifted their stand. When the  Government

announced that it would negotiate with the Federation Government for  a  merger

with  autonomy in Labour and Education, as now contained in Command  Paper  No.

33,  the  immediate reaction of the Communists and their stooges was  that  the

White Paper -

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I think

the  Parliamentary Secretary is completely irrelevant at this stage. There  will

be a motion on the White Paper



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>



aspect, and when we come to debate that motion, the Parliamentary Secretary will

be able to put all his views regarding Command Paper No. 33 and the Opposition's

views - particularly, the Barisan's views - on the merger issue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  as  you  please. But what I was trying to say just now  was  first  to

establish their stand.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I have made my ruling and ask the Parliamentary Secretary

to skip that particular part and come back to the Third Reading of this National

Referendum Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, -



<br><br>5.00 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Will the Member take a long time?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> No, it will not

be  long, Sir - only a few minutes. The question of merger has been fully  debated

in  this  Assembly, and the Assembly has accepted the principle of merger.  What

remains to be done now is to get the views of the people on the mode and  manner

in which merger should be

realised.  It  is  only  for  this reason that  the  Referendum  Bill  has  been

introduced. Having failed in every other way to frustrate merger, they  are  now

attempting to prevent this Bill from becoming law by attacking especially clause

29  pertaining  to unmarked and uncertain ballot papers. If they had  their  own

way,  they would probably have a clause of their own to legalise the destruction

and  defacement of ballot papers, so that their sinister aims could be achieved.

Clause 29 would never have

found its way into the Bill had it not been for the attempt by the Communists to

destroy  and deface ballot papers. This is the only way to defeat the Communists

and their stooges in their further attempt to wreck the referendum and merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's intention in introducing clause 29 is only to prevent the

Communists from wrecking the Referendum Bill with a view to frustrating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>



merger.  Under  normal  circumstances, the percentage of blank  votes  would  be

negligible,  and  there  is no reason to suppose that  it  will  be  other  than

negligible in this referendum. But the Communists and their stooges have  shown

beyond  doubt  that they want to cajole the people into casting blank  votes  by

confusing  them  with  such  falsehoods as saying that  they  would  lose  their

citizenship if they were to cast properly marked ballot papers. If, on the other

hand,  the  people were left to decide freely for themselves, there will,  I  am

sure,  be  very  few  blank votes, which is exactly what the Barisan  and  their

Communist  ranks  fear.  Instead, they are trying  to  divert  the  people  from

expressing their free will. They are trying to cheat the people, but they say we

are trying to hoodwink the people instead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, on a point of order. What should be the quorum in this House

before the Assembly can continue? May I know the quorum?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> The quorum should be one-fourth of the Members present in

the  Assembly. I allowed the Parliamentary Secretary to carry on with his speech

because he said he would take only a few minutes. The Member has now raised  the

question  of a quorum of the Assembly. There is no quorum. Therefore, I  suspend

this sitting until 5.35 p.m.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended</i></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just now I was about to conclude my speech

but,  unfortunately, my exposure hurt the Barisan Members so much that they  had

to  interrupt  the proceedings. However, now, Sir, I will proceed from  where  I

left.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, they are trying to divert the people from expressing their free will.

They are trying to cheat the people, but they say that we are trying to hoodwink

the people instead.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This seems to be completely irrelevant. I do not know how

that arises in the Third Reading. Can the Parliamentary Secretary explain?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was explaining how the clause on the

blank votes was being brought into this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is, of course, completely irrelevant too, because we have

done  all that. We have debated as to how the clause came into the Bill. I  have

already  indicated, and I think I will do it once more. Clause  29,  however  it

came  into the Bill, is in the Bill and therefore must be accepted as  being  in

the  Bill, and if hon. Members want to touch upon it on the Third Reading,  they

can  say how desirable it is, what the effect is, what it might do and could  do

and then say from those reasons whether they give the Bill a Third Reading or do

not  give  the  Bill  a Third Reading. That is what must be done  in  the  Third

Reading.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I accept your guidance and I have made my

point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in conclusion, I would like to say that the separation of Singapore from

the  Federation  was  a  painful  incision which  was  not  of  our  making.  As

nationalists, it is our sacred duty to rejoin the people of the two  territories

because  we  are  intrinsically  one  and the  same  people.  We  are  therefore

determined  to  see  that merger is not foiled by the evil machinations  of  the

Communists.  The reunion of the two territories will bring possible an  economic

stability which will enable us to build a more prosperous society. Mr  Speaker,

Sir, I therefore oppose the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a nursery song which used to be

very popular among little children



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>



called  "Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush" and the refrain goes, "The Mulberry

Bush, the Mulberry Bush and so on till 12 o'clock in the evening."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the debate in the Committee of the Assembly on the Referendum Bill

seems  to  show that the Member for Queenstown in his early childhood must  have

been very fond of this song. It seems to have left a permanent impression on his

mind  that  this  is the proper way to conduct debates in this  House,  for  his

performance has come to no more than endless circuits round the mulberry bush.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take a very simple example, yesterday, the hon. Member said that our refusal

to grant him permission to hold a meeting in Fullerton Square was-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must not allow this. If the Minister now goes on that

tack, that is going to invite a debate on that subject. I cannot allow it on the

Third Reading of this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I just wanted to make the position clear; it is not a matter

of  great moment. Well, let us get down to the basic issues of this Bill. To me,

they  are clear and simple, and all the arguments have been concentrated in  the

main  on  two  clauses - clause 5 and clause 29. In the first instance,  that  is

clause  5,  the issue was whether only one form of merger should  be  posed  for

acceptance  or  rejection  or whether, as Government  claims,  there  should  be

alternative  choices  or possible forms of merger. As regards  the  latter,  the

Government claims that if the choices offered in the referendum are honest, then

our amendments to clause 28 and 29 on the blank votes are fully justified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, there is very little doubt that both common sense and constitutional

precedents elsewhere support the Government's stand in regard to clause 5;  that

is,  it  will  be  perfectly  correct and proper to  pose  alternatives  in  the

referendum.  All  the Opposition did was to quote examples in  other  countries

where a single question is submitted to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>



a  referendum  which  admits of a yes or no answer, but they  have  conveniently

ignored  referenda  in  other  countries whose  situations  at  that  time  were

distinctly similar to ours. So I think in regard to the amendments to clause  5,

the  Government's case is overwhelming. So the Opposition's next line of  attack

is  to  say  that the alternative we are posing in the referendum is a dishonest

representation of their stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as there is going to be a debate on this subject, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do

not  intend  to  dwell at length on it. I only want to say that  if  charges  of

dishonesty  are made, then there must be certain tests which can be applied,  so

that  a proper judgment can be reached. One test is a purely technical one which

requires that the question should be clear, unbiased and easily understood,  and

I  think  on  this  ground there is not much difference of opinion  between  the

Government and the Opposition. But there is the other test which gives  rise  to

heated  debate  and  upon  which I want to dwell at  some  length.  The  Barisan

Sosialis  and  the Workers' Party say that an honest question  is  one  that  is

acceptable to them;

that is to say, they say that the form of a merger to be put to a referendum can

be  considered  honest  only if it is approved by the Barisan  Sosialis  or  the

Workers' Party. Now, Sir, I regard this contention as sheer nonsense. Whether  a

party approves or disapproves any question or questions put to the referendum is

purely a subjective matter.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think if the Minister goes into details he will be

irrelevant  to the Third Reading. This would be an argument which can be put forward

when  we  debate the Prime Minister's motion. In passing, he can  just  indicate

what is in his mind, but he should not go into details, otherwise he will excite

a debate in a debate.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am just trying to summarise the arguments that were

advanced in the Committee of the Assembly on clause 5.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is exactly what the Minister cannot do. We have

finished with the Committee. We have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>



now  got a clause and I have indicated  that

what Members must address themselves to is the effect of that clause, and if the

effect of that clause is desirable, then of course there is nothing against  the

Third  Reading. If a Member thinks it is undesirable, then he votes against  the

Third Reading. It is a question of accepting that the clause is in the Bill; and

then arguing whether it is desirable or undesirable, or how it fails.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Now, Sir, clause

5, as it now stands in the Bill, to me is completely desirable because it allows

proper  alternatives  to  be put to the people of Singapore  at  the  coming  referendum.  I  cannot  understand why the Barisan Sosialis should  say  that  the

clause  as  proposed by the Government is improper and would lead to undesirable

consequences. I think they base their objections to the Government  position  on

this  clause in that they will not be able to put their own proposition  at  the

referendum.  They  will not be able to say that the type of  merger  which  they

favour - complete  merger  with automatic conversion of  Singapore  citizens  into

Federal citizens - will not go in, and in particular the Member for Nee Soon,  who

is the most agile intellectual among them, tried to justify the Barisan Sosialis

stand  on that and he stated the position of his Party in page 62 of the  script

dated 28th June, 1962 [Hansard Vol. 18, No. 2, col. 236]. He disagreed with  our

stand,  that  the  two choices offered under this clause would be  adequate  and

acceptable  because  we  say  that  one of the alternatives  would  be  complete

equality  with  the  other States. Now, he says and he has  quoted  me  in  this

reference:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Minister for Finance keeps on harping on his theme that we can get only

what  the  other eleven States got. But the Prime Minister himself at the  Radio

Forum, during one of the moments when he thought he was clever, stated that  the

various  States of the Federation of Malaya got into the Federation at different

levels. For instance, he said that Pahang got in on better terms than Johore and

Johore  go in on better terms than Penang or Malacca. And all this business  of

getting in on different terms or better terms took place before Merdeka Day. . '



<br><br>and  he  goes on to say that the Constitution of the Federation of Malaya allows

variations and that what the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>



Barisan Sosialis ask for is not very much. Now, Sir, if you cut through all  his

waffle,  what the hon. Member meant really is this; that all the States  of  the

Federation  are  equal but some are more equal than others. Singapore,  however,

must be the most equal of them all and he says he is not asking very much.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Minister must agree with me in view of what I

have said that this is irrelevant to the Third Reading. It will be very relevant

when we come to debating the Prime Minister's motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I wind up my observations on clause 5 merely with a

proposition that the objection of the Barisan Sosialis to clause 5 was based  on

a  completely  dishonest attempt to force through a form  of  merger  referendum

which will give them the best chances of wrecking the referendum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, as regards clauses 28 and 29 on the blank votes, these clauses are

obviously necessary in order to ensure

a  proper referendum to be carried out under circumstances in which we know  the

Barisan Sosialis will attempt to

create  mischief and I would say that in getting these two clauses through  this

Assembly, the Government has scored

its  greatest  victory  in this debate. I am not, of course,  referring  to  the

actual  results of the voting. I am referring to the fact that the real  purpose

of these clauses has at last been made clear

through the debate in the Assembly, and for this, we on the Government side  can

take  credit for presenting the problems as we see them. But more than that,  we

owe a great deal to the Barisan

Sosialis for helping us to convince the people of the necessity of these two

clauses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say, Sir, before the debate, we tried to convince the people of Singapore of two things which clauses 28 and 29 are intended to safeguard? First, we

said  that the Barisan Sosialis did not want merger although they pretended that

they  did,  and secondly, we tried to convince the people that given the  honest

alternative of complete merger on equal terms with any of the eleven  States  of

the Federation or the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>



alternative  of  merger under the White Paper proposals,  the  Barisan  Sosialis

would  instigate  them to cast blank votes. That was what  we  told  the  people

through all the possible media of publicity, but we found that before the debate

it  was  rather difficult to convince the majority of the people. Many  of  them

said  that we were trying to impute motives on our political opponents and  they

therefore  preferred to reserve their judgment, but during the debate  on  these

two  clauses  we  found that more and more people began to understand  the  real

purpose  of these two clauses and they are now convinced - as I have said  before,

not  because  of what we have said but of what the Barisan Sosialis  have  said -

that  the Barisan Sosialis are opposed to any form of merger and that they  will

instigate people to cast blank votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me give a concrete example of this, and I refer to a Member of this

Assembly  who  will be able to bear witness here. Before these two clauses  were

discussed in this Assembly, I tried

to  convince the Member for Tanglin that these two clauses are desirable because

we want to checkmate the Barisan

Sosialis  from  creating mischief. I said that they did not want merger  in  any

form  whatsoever and that during the referendum they would instigate  people  to

cast  blank votes. Now, Sir, everybody knows that the Member for Tanglin is  not

only  an  honest  man  but  a God-fearing man and his sincerity  in  matters  of

personal  conviction, I think, is beyond any dispute. But when I  tried  to  convince  him of our stand on these two clauses, he was most dubious. He asked  me,

why should the Barisan Sosialis want to do this shady, complicated and dishonest

thing?  I  tried to give a political analysis with reasons, but  he  thought  it

still  looked  very  odd to him although he was willing to concede  that  having

worked  with  the Communists and their stooges for so long we were in  the  best

position  to  understand how they think, plot and act. He  conceded  that  there

might be something in what we said about these two clauses.

Nevertheless, he preferred to reserve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>



judgment.  But after listening to the speeches of the Barisan Sosialis  in  this

Chamber,  he is now completely convinced that what we said is correct. In  fact,

he went on further and told me that in the situation which we are facing on this

referendum, blank votes are not blank votes in the ordinary sense of  the  word.

In  normal  circumstances, a blank vote means a person is undecided and  has  no

opinion one

way or the other, but the Member for Tanglin said - and he can confirm it

that  blank votes in the coming referendum would have a most sinister  meaning;

the  Barisan Sosialis would instigate the people to cast blank votes through the

racialist and pro-Communist propaganda line they would claim that merger in  any

form whatsoever would mean the subjection of the Chinese by the Malays.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Minister will be right if he goes on with

those details. Up till now, he is

all  right; he is completely relevant. I do not think he should go into  further

details.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Now, Sir, the point I want to make is that these clauses

are  desirable and in this matter I made the point that the Member for  Tanglin,

who  could  not  understand  the  position at  the  outset,  is  now  completely

convinced; after having heard what the Barisan Sosialis themselves have said, he

says  that a blank vote in these circumstances is not a blank vote but a  loaded

vote and, as such, clauses 28 and 29 are necessary to ensure that this menace is

properly  dealt with. Well, I am greatly gratified at this change of  conviction

on the part of the Member for Tanglin, but as I said. I cannot claim much credit

for  it  because it was really the Barisan Sosialis who convinced him of it,  because speaker after speaker from the

Barisan Sosialis said that if the choice were complete merger on an equal  basis

with  any of the eleven States of the White Paper merger, then the people  would

cast  blank  votes and would make no bones about their position in  this  event.

Therefore, this is a complete justification for clauses



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>



28  and  29.  As I say, the real purpose and intention of these clauses  is  now

getting  wider  and  wider  recognition. To me, the fact  that  people  are  now

becoming  more  and  more aware of the purposes which  clauses  28  and  29  are

intended  to serve is a major victory on the part of the Government,  a  victory

which, as I have said before, was gained by us with the unintended and unwitting

assistance of the Barisan Sosialis. I would almost like to thank them for  that,

but  since  the  results which we have achieved are very gratifying - though  they

were unintended - I must, therefore, withhold any expression of gratitude.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi):</b> Mr

Speaker,  this is the final round that we, the Opposition, are fighting  against

the  Bill  and  against  the P.A.P. Government in this Assembly.  But  we  shall

continue  to  fight against the Bill and against the Government and  the  P.A.P.

type  of  merger outside the Assembly. Sir, if the P.A.P. Government is  sincere

enough and honest enough to the people, then this Bill should be introduced  for

the purpose of holding a referendum to ascertain the wishes of the people on the

question  of  merger with the Federation of Malaya. Sir, if  there  is  no  such

merger issue in which the basic rights of our people are to be deprived, then  I

believe there will not be such a heated debate in this Assembly. Sir, the merger

issue and the Referendum Bill, which are both inter-related, would not become  a

controversial issue in this country. Now in every corner of Singapore people are

cursing the Bill and cursing the P.A.P. Ministers. We in this Assembly time  and

again reminded and warned the P.A.P. Ministers that if they insisted on the sell-out  merger and the undemocratic clauses of the Referendum Bill, then they would

face  great opposition in this Assembly and outside the Assembly. In the  P.A.P.

the  Member  for  Bras  Basah has now walked across  the  Floor  to  oppose  the

dictatorial  and undemocratic attitude of the leadership of the  P.A.P. and  to

oppose the sell-out merger that the P.A.P. Government prepares to carry through.

Her decision to walk across the Floor clearly proves that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>



the P.A.P. Government wants to take away the democratic rights of our people  in

order not to allow our people to have their final say.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I see the Member for Bras Basah is in the Chamber. I do not

know whether the Member for Changi is expressing what is in her mind.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Bras Basah issued a

statement  in  the  Press  accusing  the  dictatorial  attitude  of  the  P.A.P.

Ministers.  Sir, the P.A.P. Government does not allow people to have  the  final

say  on  any  and  all matters affecting their constitutional  status.  All  the

illegal steps to stop the people from expressing their own free will are now put

into words and clauses in this Referendum Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The will of the people shall be the will of the Government. That is to say, the

Government  must  do things according to the wishes of the  people  and  in  the

interests  of the people. In other words, the Government must first consult  the

people  on  matters affecting the people and affecting the nation. After  having

got  a mandate from the people, the Government can then proceed according to the

wishes  of  the people. Only by this way can the views of the people  be  freely

expressed and freely consulted. But what do we see in this Bill? I am not  going

to  read  out the clauses which have been thoroughly discussed in the Committee.

All  I  want  to say is that when a referendum is held to decide the  matter  of

merger  the  people will not be allowed to say yes and no. The  people  will  be

forced  to choose between two and more unacceptable proposals submitted to  them

by  the Government in the referendum. They will not be given a chance to abstain

or  to reject any questions proposed by the Government. Since the people have no

right  to  reject  or  to abstain but to accept, where then are  the  democratic

rights of the people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the period of referendum is the period of fear and torture, it is a period

where  people,  especially political workers and party  members,  excluding,  of

course,  the P.A.P. members, will not be able to move freely, to talk freely  and

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>

work  freely  so as to explain to the people about merger and about the

referendum.  Sir, where can we exercise our democratic rights that the

people of  Singapore are fighting for? Now we see the basic rights of our

people deprived by the Government  whom  the people elected in 1959. Just

now I said the  will  of  the

people  shall  be  the will of the Government, but the will  of  the  Government

cannot  be the will of the people especially on matters affecting all the people

of  the  nation.  Why then did the P.A.P. Government, who were  elected  by  the

people, become so dictatorial? Why did the Government introduce such a Bill with

so many clauses prohibiting people from exercising their democratic rights on  a

national  issue  such as merger? It is because the interest of the  P.A.P.,  the

interest of the colonialists, and the interests of the colonial stooges are  now

coming  into conflict with the people and there are only two ways for  them  to

choose. One-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy): Point of order. Is it relevant to say all these things on the Third

Reading?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member has indicated that there are certain clauses that

prevent the people from making their free choice and perhaps he is on the border

of being relevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just now I have said there are only two

choices  for  the  P.A.P. One is to fight for the interest  of  the  people  but

against the interest of the colonialists and the colonial agents. The second  is

to fight for the interest of themselves and for the colonialists and their agents

but  against the interest of the people. But it is a pity the the P.A.P. choose

the second one. They want to appear as democrats and leaders of the people. They

say to the people, "You will have a say in matters of merger and we will have  a

referendum." But what do we see in this P.A.P. Referendum Bill? It is a Bill  no

better  than  the P.P.S.O. The present provisions of the Bill do not  allow  our

people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>



to  reflect their true wishes especially when the blank and uncertain votes  are

to be counted as in support of the P.A.P. merger stated in Command Paper No. 33.

It  is  a very curious provision because the basic right of our people to decide

their  constitutional  future is deprived. This basic  right  is  the  right  to

abstain, accept  or  reject.  We  urge  the  Government  that   any   proposed

constitutional  changes must first have the approval of  our  people,  otherwise

there will be chaos in our country. We on this side of the House will take steps

to  prevent any move that threatens or undermines the democratic rights  of  our

people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> What is that? Are you afraid?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a flood of words, mostly foul epithets, flowed

in  torrents from the mouth of the Member for Anson last night when he moved his

amendment  to  the  Third Reading of this Bill. He said  that  the  Bill  was  a

specific  Bill to enable a referendum on merger to be held, but that  Government

has  dishonestly said that this is a general Referendum Bill and pretended  that

under  this  Bill referenda could be held on toddy shops, Malay as the  official

language, and  smoking,  so that the provisions which  were  usually  found  in

specific Referendum Bills would not find a place in this Bill. He said  that  if

the  Bill  were  a  specific Bill on merger, it would  have  included  Schedules

providing for the form of a ballot paper and a format for the returns to be made

by  the Superintendent. He quoted, as examples, the Referendum (Federation) Law,

1960,  of Jamaica and the Newfoundland Referendum Act. Sir, the scope of a  Bill

is  indicated  by  its  Long Title, and if the Member for Anson  had  taken  the

trouble to look more closely at the legislation to which he referred the  House,

he  would  have  found that there is a difference in the Long  Titles  of  these

enactments  and  the Long Title of our Bill. The Long Title  of  the  Referendum

Federation Law, 1960, of Jamaica is in the following terms:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A law to provide for the ascertainment by means of a referendum of the opinion of the people of Jamaica with respect to the continued participation of Jamaica in the Federation of the West Indies.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Long Title of the Referendum Act of Newfoundland of 1948 is in the following terms:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'An Act to provide for ascertaining at the referendum the wish of the people

as to the future form of government of Newfoundland.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Long Title of the New Zealand Military Training Poll Act of 1949 which the

Select Committee has also considered is in the following terms:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'An Act to provide for a poll relating to compulsory military training.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Long Title of our Referendum Bill, on the other hand, states that

Bill is an Ordinance to provide for the holding of a national referendum and for

matters connected therewith. It does not follow that any legislation enabling  a

referendum  to be held in Singapore on merger must take the form of  a  specific

Referendum Bill restricting the scope of the Bill to the merger issue, and if it

does  not,  then the Bill is open to the charge that it does not conform  to  accepted  parliamentary practice. This is utter nonsense, Sir.  Sir,  whether  the

long  Title  of a Bill restricts its scope to the holding of a referendum  on  a

specific national issue or whether it enlarges the scope of the Bill to enable a

referendum to be held on any national issue is not of any importance, as all  referendum legislation, whether it takes the form of specific Referendum Bills  or

a  general Bill, must contain provisions which will enable the question or  questions to be put to the electorate, must include the procedure which is to be followed in the holding of a referendum, and must provide safeguards to ensure that

the  referendum  is  fairly and honestly conducted. That is why  all  referendum

legislation either imports the identical provisions of the electoral  procedures

and  the  laws  governing  the holding of general elections  in  the  referendum

legislation itself, or specifically requires that recourse should be had to  the

procedure set out in the laws governing the holding of general elections for the

purpose of holding a referendum. In a Referendum Bill on a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>



specific national issue, it is usual for a clause to be incorporated setting out

the question or questions that are to be put to the electorate, and this was the

procedure  followed  in  the Jamaican, Newfoundland and New  Zealand  referendum

legislation to which I have referred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson moved amendments to clause 5 of the Bill to provide

that the matter should be submitted to the electors for a referendum by the Head

of  State  only  when  he  is advised by the Minister  at  the  request  of  the

Legislative Assembly, and a further amendment to this clause to provide that not

more  than  one  question  should he submitted to the electors  in  any  one  referendum, and such question shall contain only one issue and the electors  shall

only  be required to answer such question in the simple affirmative or negative.

We  on  the Government side have maintained that as the Long Title of  the  Bill

very clearly indicates that the scope of this Bill is not limited to the holding

of  a  referendum on a specific national issue, powers must be given to the Head

of  State  to submit the matter to the electors for a referendum on any national

issue  by way of an Order made under clause 5 of the Bill, and under section  20

(2)  of the Singapore (Constitution) Order in. Council he must act on the advice

of the Cabinet when he makes the Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have maintained that the amendment proposed by the Member for Anson

limiting  the  matter  to be put to the electorate for a  referendum  under  the

provisions of this Bill to a single question containing one issue and  requiring

the  elector  to  answer such a question in the affirmative or  negative,  is  a

limitation  which is contrary to the scope of this Bill. Such  a  limitation  is

also  without precedent as referenda have been held in Newfoundland,  Australia,

New Zealand and the Cameroons, where more than one question have been put to the

electorate  and  where the electors have been invited to make a  choice  of  one

question without being required to answer in the affirmative or negative to each

of  the  questions put. In the case of the Cameroons, the referendum  was  supervised by the United Nations itself, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>



the  procedure of the choice of one of two questions received the approval  from

an unimpeachable source.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only difference between our Bill and the referendum enactments of Newfoundland, New Zealand and Jamaica is that the questions placed before the electorate in these enactments are incorporated in a section of these enactments.

Government  has already tabled a notice of a motion indicating the questions  to

be  put  to  the electorate on the merger issue, and this motion will soon  be

debated  in  the  Assembly.  If  these questions receive  the  approval  of  the

Assembly,  then they will be put to the electorate by an Order of  the  Head  of

State made under the provisions of clause 5 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what difference then does it make whether the questions are incorporated in

the  text of the Bill itself in a specific referendum Bill, or whether the  questions,  after  debate and approval of the Legislative Assembly are  put  to  the

electorate by way of an Order of the Head of State made under the provisions  of

clause 5 of the Bill?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has also said that if a specific Referendum Bill had been

introduced  by  Government  on  the question of  merger,  the  Bill  would  have

contained  Schedules indicating the form of the ballot paper and the  format  of

the  return which the Superintendent would have been required to make after  the

holding  of  the referendum. Sir, I have here with me the actual  texts  of  the

Federation Act, of Newfoundland of 1948, the Federation Law of Jamaica of

1960, and the New Zealand Military Training Poll Act of 1949; all copies printed

by the Government Printers of these territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Newfoundland Referendum Act of 1948 has 25 clauses with not a single

Schedule. The Jamaica Referendum Act has six clauses with not a single Schedule,

and  the New Zealand Military Training Poll Act of 1949 has six clauses with one

Schedule  indicating the question that is to be put to the electorate. How  then

can  the  Member for Anson say that our general Referendum Bill is open  to  the

objection that it does not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>



conform  to accepted parliamentary practice, because no Schedules are  indicated

in the text of the Bill?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has also said that clause 21, which incorporates the

identical provisions of compulsory voting found in the Singapore Legislative  Assembly  Elections Ordinance into this Referendum Bill, is to be deplored because

the  voter  who fails to vote will have to wait until the next revision  of  the

electoral register before he can exercise his right to vote again. The  Minister

for  Home  Affairs  has already told the House that 58,000  electors  failed  to

record  their  votes in the last general election, and up to date a  very  small

number  of them have taken the trouble to get their names restored to  the  electoral register. I cannot see how, in view of this evidence, it can seriously  be

stated  that clause 21 is perfidious and dishonest and should not have  been  included  in  the  Referendum  Bill. A provision like clause  21  would  have  the

advantage  of  bringing home to the elector the existence of this added  penalty

which will serve as a deterrent to voters keeping away from the referendum polls

and  stimulating larger attendances at the polls, thereby helping to achieve the

object  for  which  compulsory  voting has been  introduced.  There  is  nothing

undemocratic that I can see in such a provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the objection that the court should be given a discretion to impose a

fine in respect of the offences enumerated in clauses 32, 38 and 42 of the Bill;

these  are  serious  offences,  and  it is  the  practice,  in  the  framing  of

legislation  where offences are serious, not to give the court a  discretion  to

impose a fine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, the argument that the deprivation of civic rights following

on  a conviction for an offence under these clauses should be left to the discretion  of the court is without any substance. If there is to be a deprivation  of

civic  rights  following  upon  a conviction for  any  of  these  offences,  the

deprivation  should  be the same for everybody. It would make  nonsense  of  the

deprivation if it could vary from person to person.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>



Nor is there any substance in the argument that when an offence is committed  by

a  Member  of  the Assembly, he should, although deprived of his  civic  rights,

nevertheless continue as a Member of the Legislative Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposition that it should not be an offence for an elector to

intentionally deface his own ballot paper is too absurd to require  any  serious

consideration.  The  Member  for Anson and the Barisan  Sosialis  have  attacked

clause  29  of  the Bill which provides that any person whose  ballot  paper  is

unmarked  or uncertain is thereby deemed to accept or is willing to  accept  the

decision of the Legislative Assembly on the matter referred to referendum.  They

have  argued  that as there is to be compulsory voting, under this provision  in

the  Bill,  a citizen is deprived of the fundamental human right of recording  a

blank  vote and saying 'no' if unacceptable proposals from their point  of  view

are  put  to the electorate. What they are contending for is what they claim  to

be  a democratic right to organise a campaign for the recording of blank votes,

if  the  questions put to the electorate are unacceptable from  their  point  of

view.  They are making a pretence that they are champions of parliamentary  democracy  and, at the same time, they say they are not prepared to accept questions

which  will be put to the electorate after debate and approval by the  Assembly.

They  contend that even if the choice of questions receives the approval of  the

Assembly  after debate, if it is not acceptable from their point of  view,  then

they  should have the democratic right to organise a campaign for the  recording

of  blank  votes to frustrate the referendum on merger. This clause in the  Bill

will  effectively check any move on their part to mount such a  campaign,  which

they could easily do by the malicious spreading of rumours and whispers that the

voter  would lose his citizenship if he made a choice. Surely there  is  nothing

undemocratic and unconstitutional in taking counter measures to put  a  stop  to

this,  so long as the elector is given the freedom to make a democratic  choice.

It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>



is  well known that in elections and by-elections blank votes form a very  negligible  proportion of the total votes cast, as there is no temptation for  anyone

to  organise  a  campaign for the recording of blank votes.  Is  it  not  right,

therefore,  that Government should take countermeasures to frustrate  what  they

propose  to do? As the Prime Minister has already pointed out to the House,  the

elector  has under the provision of clause 28 (1) (b) of the Bill the  right  to

say  'no' if he indicates his choice on the ballot paper and then writes in  his

name and address by which he can be identified. Such votes will be rejected  and

not  included  in the count. Where then is there any substance in  the  argument

that  if  an unacceptable choice from their point of view is put to the elector,

he has no right to say 'no' if he considers his choice to be unacceptable?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In section 48 (1) (c) of the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance, there is a similar provision. The only modification made is that he will

have  to  indicate his choice before he identifies himself to nullify his  vote.

Speakers  on the Government side have during this debate repeatedly exposed  the

dishonesty of the proposal which the Barisan Sosialis and its allies consider to

be an acceptable choice from their point of view. They, in fact, do not want merger but they have not got the courage to say so openly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis and its allies have also pressed for separate returns to

be  shown,  electoral  division  by electoral  division,  of  all  unmarked  and

uncertain  votes  cast.  It has been explained that as there  is  no  political

contest  among candidates in constituencies in a referendum, there is no  reason

why  such separate returns should he included in the Statement of the Referendum

which the Superintendent has to publish under the provision of clause 30 of  the

Bill.  The  only information of any relevance in a referendum is the  number  of

votes  cast  in  respect  of  the questions put  to  the  electorate,  and  this

information will be provided.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, there is no reason why we should give the Barisan Sosialis and

their manipulators outside the Assembly an opportunity of mounting a campaign of

calumny and falsehoods by showing separate returns of such votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new amendment which the Minister for Home Affairs has introduced to

clause  43  of  the  Bill has been referred to as an example of  the  depths  of

perfidy  and  dishonesty  to  which the Government  has  descended  in  this  un

democratic Bill. The housewife who goes shopping on referendum polling  day  and

the farmer and hawker who go about their daily routine on referendum polling day

have  no reason whatsoever to be afraid of the provisions of this clause.  These

provisions  provide  the  machinery whereby those  who  organise  canvassing  on

referendum  polling day can be detected and brought to book for their  misdeeds.

There  is  nothing undemocratic in including such provisions in  this  Bill, as

experience  has  shown that where there are no means of detecting  and  bringing

offenders  to  book  for  canvassing on polling  day,  the  prohibition  against

canvassing on polling day is quite meaningless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An objection has also been taken by the Member for Anson to clause 52 (5) of

the Bill, which enables the Referendum Judge to take account of secret documents

referred to him by the State Advocate-General when he is to make a decision on a

referendum  petition.  I  have already pointed  out  to  the  House  that  in  a

referendum petition, there are no accused persons and there is no danger of this

secret  information being used to the prejudice of any individual  person.  Such

information is necessary and useful to inform the Referendum Judge of  what  has

taken place to enable him to make a determination on the referendum petition.  I

have  also  pointed out that those who are called upon to show  cause  why  they

should not be reported for corrupt or illegal practices in a referendum will  be

given an opportunity of being heard and of giving evidence and calling witnesses

to  show  why they should not be so reported, and in such proceedings  The  Bill

does not permit secret information available to the Judge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>



on  the referendum petition itself to be used against them. As there has been  a

hue  and cry that a specific Referendum Bill should have been introduced for the

merger  issue itself, although, as I have shown, there is no substance  in  this

objection,  the  Government has introduced a new clause to the Bill  to  provide

that  it  will be repealed when merger is accomplished. Sir, I have disposed  of

all  the matters which the Member for Anson and the Member for Queenstown  claim

to  be undemocratic in this Bill. As this Bill is entirely satisfactory for  the

holding  of  a  national  referendum on merger and  will  give  the  elector  an

opportunity to make a democratic choice of the questions to be put to him  after

such  questions  have received the approval of the Legislative Assembly.,  there

is, therefore, no substance in the arguments which we have heard from the Member

for Anson and the Member for Queenstown. I ask the House to reject the amendment

of the Member for Anson to the motion for the Third Reading of this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, after the P.A.P. has been in power for three years,  this  is

the first time that this House has asked for the rejection of a Bill proposed by

the  P.A.P., that is, the National Referendum Bill. I believe this is the  first

time  in this House that we have this incident. If my memory is correct,  during

the  previous  Lim Yew Hock Government no occasion arose when  Members  of  this

House asked for the rejection of a certain Bill by the Government. Therefore, we

can see very clearly that the request for the rejection of the Third Reading  of

this Bill by the Opposition is justified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this National Referendum Bill was tabled for the First

Reading in December last year, and we, the Opposition Parties, found that  there

were many undemocratic provisions in the original Bill.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We cannot go as far back as that. We must come straight on to

the Third Reading. Members must accept the clauses as they have been put in. And

when  I say accept, I mean accept the fact that these clauses have been inserted

in the Bill, and then show how



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>



these  clauses are unsatisfactory, undesirable, or, from the Government's  point

of view, desirable.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to point out to you that the Opposition Parties have introduced  about  34 amendments, but all these amendments were  rejected  by  the

Government. These amendments, in our opinion, would have a very great effect  on

the democratic rights of the people of Singapore. We cannot accept the fact that

the  Government should reject our reasonable amendments. I do not wish to  speak

at  length on all these 34 amendments, but I wish to refer to the speeches  made

by  the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Law. Their explanations cannot

cover up their dictatorial acts and approach to this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Law, a while ago, said that clause 5 is

very  reasonable  because in Newfoundland, New Zealand and Jamaica,  there  have

been  similar  provisions. Therefore, the Government is correct in  posing  more

than  one question to the people in the coming national referendum. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Minister  for  Law tried to justify the P.A.P.  Government  as  being

democratic  by  citing  examples from various foreign countries.  Just  now  the

Minister  for Law said that the main purpose of this Bill is that it  should  be

used to conduct a national referendum on the question of merger. Therefore, this

is  of national importance and affects the whole State. But we cannot accept the

simple examples given by the Minister for Law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this question of national importance will be proposed by the

P.A.P.  Government,  namely,  Command Paper No.  33,  which  is  passed  by  the

Government with the support of the

S.P.A.     Therefore, the question to be posed to the people should  be  Command

Paper No. 33 and not other questions. This House has not debated other questions

as  to the form of merger and, at the same time, the Government has not proposed

other forms of merger to be debated in this House.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member says that the Government has not proposed any other

forms of merger to be debated in this House. Is that correct?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to point out to you that the motion tabled by the

Prime  Minister, that is, the question of a national referendum, completely  distorts our stand which we proposed in this House on 21st November last year.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not wish to stop the Member unnecessarily, but that is what

the  Member  will say and can say when we come to debating the Prime  Minister's

motion.  All  he  can  say now is that in his view these two  questions  are  unacceptable,  and finish with that. But he cannot go into details. Those  details

can be debated when we come to debating the Prime Minister's motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I wish to point out that since the Minister for Law has  said

that  this  Bill  was a specific Bill on the question of merger, therefore,  the

question to be posed to the people should be Command Paper No. 33, that is,  the

White  Paper  merger proposals. Mr Speaker. Sir, a while ago the  Minister  for

Finance gave reasons why the Government wanted to put in clause 5 and clause  29

in  this Bill. It was because these two clauses were intended to be used against

the  Communists, and also because we, the Barisan Sosialis, wanted to  take  the

blank votes as negative votes. Mr Speaker, Sir, we have not demanded that blank

votes  should  be regarded as negative votes. Our stand is very  clear  and  the

Member  for  Queenstown has also expressed this stand on the question  of  blank

votes  very  clearly in the Select Committee. What we want is that  blank  votes

should  be considered as void and not as votes in support of or opposed  to  any

proposal or question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the 4th July, when clause 29 was debated in this House,

the  Member  for Hong Lim moved an amendment, namely. In page A12, line  16,  to

delete  the  words "accepts or is willing" and insert the words "rejects  or  is

unwilling".  That  is to say, the Member for Hong Lim wanted the  Government  to

consider blank votes, which the Government wanted to consider as votes accepting

the  decision  of  this House, to be considered as votes which are  against  the

decision of this House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>



When  the  amendment was put to the vote, the Member for Hong Lim  asked  for  a

division. Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the Official Report of this House on the 4th

of  July, and the result of the voting was that three votes were in favour, that

is, the Member for Aljunied, the Member for Punggol and the Member for Hong Lim.

These  were the votes in favour of the amendment. 25 votes were against, 4  were

absent,  and 19 votes abstained. Mr Speaker, Sir, these 19 votes that abstained

included  the 13 Members of the Barisan Sosialis. Therefore, our stand  is  very

clear  from this voting. We have not requested that blank votes should be deemed

as  negative votes. Therefore, the tactics of debate adopted by the  P.A.P. are

like  that. When they are cornered, when they have no more arguments  to  offer,

they  will  try to distort our stand. However, the record of this House  clearly

shows our stand on the question of blank votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the only explanation of the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister for Labour and the Minister for Finance with regard to the blank  votes

is  Communist  instigation, because the Government  are  unable  to  cite  other

precedents and examples to justify their stand that blank votes should be deemed

as votes in support of the Government. They are not able to justify their stand.

Therefore,  under  these  circumstances, the Government  can  only  produce  the

pretext of Communists hoping to confuse the people and to make them believe that

these two clauses are reasonable. Mr Speaker, Sir, the opposition to clause  29

is  not only confined to the Barisan Sosialis, the Member for Anson, the U.P.P.,

the  Liberal  Socialists, but the S.P.A. had also objected  to  clause  29.  But

because  of  events  a  few days ago, the S.P.A. have to save  the  P.A.P. from

collapsing  and  to maintain their Government. Mr Speaker, Sir,  the  Secretary

General of the S.P.A., at a mass rally organised by the Workers' Party, strongly

opposed-



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, is all this relevant to the motion now before the House?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Choa Chu Kang is endeavouring to answer a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>



point made by the Minister for Finance. He has answered that point and now he is

becoming irrelevant by going into details.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I am trying to explain now that the blank vote clause was

opposed  openly  by  the S.P.A. on the 24th of June. In the Select

Committee  the

Member for Cairnhill also opposed it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must stop the hon. Member because all that took place in

Committee.  We have finished with that. I have said repeatedly that  the  Member

must  accept the fact that clause 29 is in the Bill. Now he can indicate why  he

thinks it is undesirable if it is in the Bill, and will not serve the purpose of

holding a referendum on merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I accept your instructions, but I have to point  out  to  the

Government  here that their attitude towards blank votes, their only explanation

is  because of Communist instigation. Such an explanation will not convince  the

people of Singapore. Their statement that this is for use against the Communists

will not be accepted. The Government has said that all those who oppose the Bill

are  Communists.  I  can  tell the P.A.P. Government  that  all  the  people  of

Singapore, everyone of them, are against this clause with the exception of a few

in front.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Minister for Law said that, according to past

election  and  by-election  experience, blank votes were  negligible;  therefore

clause  29  was  necessary. In the elections and by-elections blank  votes  were

negligible, it is true, but this time this is not an election or a by-election,

it  is  a  national referendum. Especially with regard to clause 5 of the  Bill,

such a clause makes the people of Singapore choiceless, so they have to put  in

blank votes. Therefore, the explanation put forward by the Minister for Law  was

just  to  hide  their dirty tactics so as to enable some people to believe  that

their ways are reasonable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Law also said that clauses 39 and 40 of the

Bill were necessary, but we feel that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



such  severe  penalties  should  not appear in  a  democratic  society.  If  the

questions suggested by the Government were to be supported by the people,  there

should  not be such clauses. If the people would not object, such clauses  would

not  be  necessary. The questions posed by the Government are not wanted by  the

people. Therefore, in order to force all the citizens of Singapore to accept the

P.A.P. suggestions, therefore, the Government has suggested clauses 38 and 39 to

oppress those citizens who are dissatisfied with the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Law wants to give the impression to some

people that such occurrences are few, but in actual fact it is not so. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the Minister for Law also said that if people organised  parties  for

canvassing  on polling day, then clause 43 was necessary. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  we

debated  this question lengthily yesterday. The conclusion was that the Minister

for Law pointed out that such a provision was to deal with the Barisan Sosialis.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I pointed out yesterday that according to paragraph  (a)  of

clause  43  (1),  no one can visit others. The Government thought  that  such  a

paragraph  was necessary, and tried to suppress the people from visiting  others

and  also  their political opponents. Mr Speaker, Sir, we cannot  let  the  Government have such a provision to abuse their powers to deal with those whom they

do  not  like.  If such a provision were to be put to use, then I  say  that  in

future referenda the Government could easily make use of this provision to  take

action  against their political opponents when they now cannot do  so.  The  Government could then use this provision to the full to suppress those whom they do

not  like  and  also their political opponents. So we can clearly see  that  the

whole  Bill is in opposition to the will of the people. Therefore, the amendment

moved by the Member for Anson clearly explained that the Opposition Parties were

thinking  of  the interests of the people. If the Government do  not  take  into

consideration our views, then in future national referenda they will  adopt  the

tactics of Hitler to oppress the people of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, why are the people of Singapore showing dissatisfaction with

this  Bill?  The  Member  for  Cairnhil has often  said  that  his  Party  is  a

responsible Party and is one that looks after the welfare of the people.  It  is

now  time for the S.P.A. to show their real stand as to whether or not they  are

in support of the

P.A.P.    Government on this issue. This is the time for them to show their real

attitude towards the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Government really want to look after the interest of

the people, then they should accept the motion by the Member for Anson.

Bill  has  lost its original meaning. There is no democratic justice in  it  any

more.  Therefore, I cannot support it. The Minister for Finance  has  just  said

that  clause  29 is their victory. The victory as conceived by the Minister  for

Finance is not glorious. Therefore I cannot support this Bill.

objecting - after the Bill has been amended.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the National Referendum Bill is now

at its last stage, and once



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>



the  Bill is approved by this House, it will become law and the chances are that

within  the next couple of weeks or so - in any case before the end of July - there

is going to be a referendum held under the provisions of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I may be wrong in this, but if I am wrong, I am always

prepared to stand to be corrected. I think I know exactly when they want to hold

the  referendum, but in any case. Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt in the mind

of  the  Barisan  Sosialis that this Bill is primarily meant for  holding  of  a

referendum on the merger issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Select Committee and also the Committee of the whole Assembly,

and even just now when the Minister for Labour was speaking -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Minister for Law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I always think of him as the Minister for Labour and Law because of

my past association with him. But, anyway, even when the Minister for Health and

Law  was  speaking just now, he gave us the impression, as they  did  in  Select

Committee  and  in the Committee of the whole Assembly, that  this  is  still  a

general  Referendum  Bill. But I say to this House that if  it  was  in  fact  a

general Referendum Bill to decide on matters like whether one should drink toddy

or  whether one should smoke a pipe, we in the Barisan Sosialis would  not  have

initiated  a  marathon debate - which I am sure the Members have found  a  little

tiresome. But because we know that the primary purpose of this Bill is to hold a

referendum on the issue of  merger,  we  have thought fit to make sure that we put forward all  our  arguments as clearly as possible, because after this Bill is passed, then, Sir, what

is to happen is just anybody's guess.



There has been so much talk of parliamentary democracy. There has been a lot  to

talk  of the glories of parliamentary democracy, and so on. I can only say, Sir,

that if this Bill is passed with the present provisions, then it simply means

- whether  the  Government Members want to admit it or  not - that  the  people  of

Singapore will lose confidence in the parliamentary system.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> That is what you want.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I have already stated that I do not want to claim to be a

champion  of  parliamentary democracy. It is for people like  the  Minister  for

Finance  to say that his life is dedicated to preserving the democratic  system.

It is for them to realise that the very act they are indulging in now will spell

the   doom   of   parliamentary  democracy.  Sir,  all  this  talk - all   these

contradicting  statements - and conflicting talk of this general Referendum  Bill,

Merger  Referendum Bill and so on and so on, I do not want to go and  quote  the

various  statements the Ministers have made; they have been making contradicting

statements. At times to suit their convenience they have said this is a  general

Referendum Bill; at times to suit their convenience again they have said this is

a Merger Referendum Bill. All this has confused and misled our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the Barisan Sosialis, knowing well that this is a Referendum Bill

for  merger,  are absolutely clear in our minds that the Bill is inadequate  and

that the provisions contained in it are completely inappropriate for the purpose

of  ascertaining the views of our people on any issue, particularly on the issue

of  merger which affects all our lives and the lives of our generations to come.

It  is  the Government's aim to hold a referendum under the provisions  of  this

Bill  to ensure continuity of their political survival. Sir, they think that  if

they  hold a referendum under this Bill they will zugzwang the Barisan Sosialis,

they will fix their political opponents, they will ultimately get a result which

they  can  proudly say has been in favour of their White Paper Merger proposals.

Sir, I do not want to go back and discuss once again the merits or otherwise  of

clause  29,  but the Referendum Bill as it stands, particularly with clause  29,

means  even  if  90 per cent of the people oppose the Government's  White  Paper

Merger, the Government would bring about a result of the referendum on this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>



merger  issue  to  show  that  more than 90 per cent  support  the  White  Paper

proposals  and that, I think, is the fundamental position that every  Member  in

this House must recognise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are so many provisions which, in our view, are completely

inadequate  for this purpose, but the main provision is clause 29  and  we  have

stated  this over and over in the Select Committee debate and the debate of  the

whole  Committee. I repeat what I said; it is possible that even if 90 per  cent

oppose  the Government's White Paper merger and if that 90 per cent is unwilling

to choose between two alternatives, the Government would bring about a result to

show  that  more  than 90 per cent support the White Paper merger.  I  say.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, any man who suggests that this Bill with this certain provision is

adequate,  is  a  reasonable  Bill, is a Bill which  will  provide  a  fair  and

reasonable  machinery  for consulting the views of the people,  must  either  be

lying or must be insane.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I say with a clear conscience and a clear understanding of the P.A.P.

thinking that the sole purpose of this Bill is to fix their political opponents,

is  to ensure the continuity of P.A.P. political survival; and my answer to this

is,  the political opponents of the P.A.P. are those in the Barisan Sosialis  or

the  Communists that are talked about so much by the P.A.P. leaders.  I  am  not

going  to  make  a statement. Sir, if it were a question of 300  odd  Communists

getting  into a zugzwang because of this Referendum Bill, then I  say  it  is  a

waste  of time having sat here and talked this Bill over day in and day out  for

the last week or so. This Bill, whatever the purpose of the Government, will fix

the  future  of  our  people without giving our people a fair  chance  to  state

clearly, without ambiguity, whether they support the constitutional arrangements

or not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is the responsibility of all of us in this House, whether we are in

the Barisan Sosialis, the Workers' Party, the United People's Party,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>



S.P.A. or P.A.P., to make sure that we do not put a vote in support of  a  Bill

that  will  mean putting our people in a zugzwang, in the words of the  Minister

for  Finance.  It  is as simple as that. Sir, if they want to  fix  the  Barisan

Sosialis,  there  are  various means other than this Bill  to  fix  the  Barisan

Sosialis.  I do not have to suggest what they ought to do, but they know,  as  I

said,  it is not the 300 Communists, or whatever membership the Barisan Sosialis

has, who would be involved in just voting; it means 624,000 people going to  the

polls on a referendum on merger and saying whether they support the Government's

White Paper proposals or whether they support any other proposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What is wrong?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> We will come to that. Mr Speaker, Sir, we will have a lot of time

for  the  motion standing in the name of the Prime Minister. There is  a  motion

standing  in the name of the Member for Queenstown. We will come to that  as  to

whether it should be complete merger, whether it should be unconditional merger,

or  whether  it  should  be merger on certain terms. As  far  as  this  Bill  is

concerned,  so long as clause 29 is there, even ignoring the other  undemocratic

features of the Bill, it means if a vast majority of the people, even if 90  per

cent  of  the people, oppose the White Paper merger, the Government  will  bring

about a result to show more than 90 per cent support for the White Paper merger.

As  I said, if 90 per cent of our electorate are unwilling to choose between two

unacceptable  alternatives and put in blank votes, five per cent  vote  for  the

Government's White Paper merger, and five per cent vote for something else, then

the  ultimate result declared will be 95 per cent in support of the White  Paper

merger,  and this is something they cannot get away from. This is their zugzwang

and  I say this is something that fundamentally is not acceptable to the Barisan

Sosialis.  Sir,  with the passing of this Bill, it means all opposition  through

debates in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>



honourable House is over and the Bill will be passed. I do not think  there  are

very  many people in the Government at the moment who would have the courage  to

stand up and say, "I oppose it." The Bill will be passed, and when it is passed,

the  consequences  following  the  implementation  of  a  referendum  under  the

provisions of this Bill shall rest solely and squarely on the shoulders  of  the

men  who  hold  power. Ten Ministers and the higher-ups in the P.A.P. hierarchy

who,  for their own political future, are thinking of fixing 624,000 voters  and

the lives of 1.7 million people.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the S.P.A. has attacked certain

provisions  of the Bill and, because of their strong and responsible opposition,

we have secured certain concessions from the Government in that the questions to

be  posed in the referendum will be fully debated and decided by the Legislative

Assembly and that the life of the National Referendum Ordinance will come to  an

end after the merger referendum. Having secured those important concessions, the

S.P.A. see no objection to this Bill passing into law. The S.P.A. wants a merger

referendum and the S.P.A. therefore supports the Third Reading of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, most of the attacks of the Member for Anson and some other Members from

the  Barisan  Sosialis have been on the grounds that the Government had  claimed

that  this National Referendum Bill was a general Referendum Bill, and later  on

it  became  a specific Referendum Bill, and still later on it became  a  general

Referendum Bill. Sir, the Government could have carried on with this pretence of

a  general Referendum Bill had it not been for the opposition of the S.P.A. who

insisted that if they wanted to adopt certain provisions in the Bill to  contain

the  Communists and to frustrate any merger referendum, they would not have  met

with our strong opposition and so they made up their minds that the life of  the

law would come



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>



to  an end after the merger referendum. So, in one way, if one were to read  the

Bill over and over again after it had gone through a Committee of this Assembly,

it  could still be maintained that it was a general Referendum Bill. But let  us

not  worry ourselves whether it is a general Referendum Bill or a specific  Bill

for  merger. The fact is that it will be a law brought in to see to  it  that  a

referendum  on merger is held under conditions that will be free from  Communist

subversive  activities. Sir, the questions are to be debated in  this  Assembly.

Notice has already been given and I too have given notice of an amendment  which

I  propose to move. All the attacks by the Members on my side of the House  have

been  based on the belief that there would be two questions. Surely,  Sir,  when

the  motion is being discussed Members of the Opposition, even the Barisan,  the

Workers'  Party,  the United People's Party, can put up their ideas  about  what

questions should be submitted for a referendum and have them fully debated here.

There  could be two, there could be three, there could be five. We do not  know,

because we cannot anticipate the debate on the motion, nor can we foretell  what

would  be  the result of that debate. Sir, I have this to say of the Member  for

Anson.  His  vitriolic attack on this Bill is due to his lofty  ideals.  He  has

lofty  ideals  and  he always maintains that he should fight  for  parliamentary

democracy and is prepared even to lay down his life for parliamentary democracy.

But  I would like to make this point to him and ask him to ponder whether it  is

right  that  he  should put up this strong fight without thinking  of  what  may

happen.  What  is behind this clause 29? The Barisan Sosialis, of course,  speak

very strongly against clause 29 for obvious reasons. They want to frustrate  the

merger  referendum and they want to be given free rein to do it, but the  Member

for Anson is guided by different motives. He says it is democratic. I agree with

him it is democratic, but in as much as the P.P.S.O. was democratic, so is this.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Undemocratic!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Undemocratic.

I am sorry. In as much as the P.P.S.O.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>



was undemocratic, so is this. And it was the Member for Anson, when he was Chief

Minister,  who introduced that undemocratic law and maintained it in this  House

against  all opposition. Why did he do it? Because he said the security and  the

well-being of the people of Singapore must come first, the Labour Front second.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> In as much as he was guided by that lofty ideal, may I say

this, that the interest of the people of Singapore must come first, the Workers'

Party  second? And yet the Members of the Barisan Sosialis shout and  shout  and

shout  against  this undemocratic provision of clause 29 in the Bill.  And  when

they,  the  13, who are now sitting behind me were sitting on that side  of  the

House,  they  were the people who were a party to increasing  the  life  of  the

P.P.S.O. from three years to five years. At that time they never thought it  was

undemocratic,  because they were doing it, so what they did was right  and  what

other  people  did  should be wrong. That should not be the  way  to  behave  as

responsible representatives of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been asked whether I would declare our stand, whether I would fight for

an  undemocratic act. I have abstained from voting, but if that is the  way  the

Barisan  Sosialis  want to dare the Singapore People's Alliance,  the  Singapore

People's Alliance say this, "Any time the Singapore People's Alliance will fight

the  Barisan;  any time." And the Singapore People's Alliance now say,  if  they

want  us to declare our stand, we have only just to repeat, "We will see  to  it

that  any  attempt by the Communists, by Communist front leaders,  by  Communist

front  organisations, to  damage the interest and  welfare  of  the  people  of

Singapore will be dealt with by us ruthlessly."



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The Minister for Home Affairs.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Member for Changi stood up and said this is the final

round.  I  hope to God it is the final round and that one of the two  contending

parties would be knocked out, maybe



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>



the  Barisan, maybe the P.A.P. But it is the wish of the people of Singapore

that in this final round both parties be knocked out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Barisan Party Member says this clause 29 is to revive the P.A.P. I say

the   P.A.P. is  dead.  No  amount  of  rejuvenation  could  make  them  alive.[Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> They are dead.

But  the  purpose of their having this clause 29 is to see to it  that  the

Communists  who  had been sleeping with them would not be given an  opportunity  to

damage  the interests of the people of Singapore. For that, I would like to  pay

tribute to their fight. Do not have any qualms. If it is the Communists who  are

trying  to  endanger the security of Singapore, fight to the bitter end  and  we

will  stand  behind  you.  Let then say what they like, the  Singapore  People's

Alliance  is  supporting  the P.A.P. The Singapore People's  Alliance  will  and

continue  to  support what is right, support justice. The Singapore People's

Alliance will fight with any Party against any attempt to damage the well-being of

the people of Singapore. Sir, we have been ridiculed by the Barisan Sosialis and

it would seem that they are now centering their attack on the Singapore People's

Alliance, or perhaps they are reading the stars. The Singapore People's Alliance

will be the only force left to teach them that lesson if they survive. I do  not

think  they will ever survive. In fact, they have been well and truly  contained

and in this fight to exterminate them, we will be with the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b>

Shame on you.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Strange, Sir, another member of the Barisan Sosialis, I think

it  was  the  Member for Choa Chu Kang, praised the Singapore People's  Alliance

again.  The  Singapore People's Alliance is not so bad. During the time  of  the

previous  Lim Yew Hock Government there had been no Bills that had been attacked

on  the  Third Reading. Sir, all I can say is I am always wary of  the  kiss  of

Judas. I will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>



not  be  deterred  by  them from doing what I think is right.  What  the  S.P.A.

maintain  is  right. The security of the country comes first.  Let  the  Barisan

Sosialis ridicule us as much as they want. The time will come when we will  meet

them if they are still alive, when the next general election takes place.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker,

thousands of words have been uttered by the Barisan Sosialis against the Referendum  Bill  and  it would be difficult for the general public to  understand  the

vehemence of their opposition unless we reveal in this House the line  of  their

thinking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members in this House will recollect a radio forum held on 21st September.

1961,  in which the Member for Hong Lim, the Member for Farrer Park, the  Member

for  Queenstown  and the Minister for Finance took part on the subject  of  "The

political  situation  in Singapore today". This was what  the  Chairman  of  the

Barisan Sosialis, the Member for Queenstown, had to say. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As regards the referendum. I don't think it is suitable, because a referendum

is something new in Malaya. As you know, the people are not very conversant with

the  democratic  process and it will take some time before people  will  realise

what it is all about.'



<br><br>This utterance by the Member for Queenstown betrays the real line of thinking of

the Barisan Sosialis, namely, that right from the beginning, they were against a

referendum.  Therefore when we proposed this Bill, their line of action  was  to

oppose it and during the past few days, we have seen how they have tried to

filibuster, adopt delaying tactics, to prevent this Bill from being passed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what the Member for Queenstown has said reveals two important points.

One,  in  relation to the attitude of the Barisan Sesialis towards  the  people.

Two, what they have to say about clause 29. In effect, the Member for Queenstown

displayed absolute arrogance towards the people when he said that the people are

not very conversant with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>



the  democratic process and that it will take some time before they will realise

what it is all about. When the Barisan Sosialis talk of preserving parliamentary

democracy and accuse the Government of breaking down

the  democratic  process, it is the Barisan Sosialis really who do  not  believe

that  the people are fitted for the democratic process. Assuming what the Member

for  Queenstown has said is true, that it will take some time before the  people

will  realise  what  it  is all about, then it is pretty obvious -  in  spite  of

whatever  explanations  the  Member for Queenstown and  his  colleagues  in  the

Barisan  Sosialis may care to offer about the referendum - that it  will  take  a

very  long  time  for the people to understand even what the referendum  is  all

about.  Under the circumstances, would it not be expected then that blank  votes

will  be  cast  if  the people do not understand the purpose of the  referendum?

There  is  a possibility indeed that blank votes will be cast. Surely, if  blank

votes  are  cast, then that would indicate that those who cast them  would  have

done so because they did not understand what the referendum was all about. It is

pretty obvious that we cannot allow people who do not understand what it is  all

about  to  decide  the destiny of 1.6 million people in Singapore.  We  are  the

elected representatives and if those who cast blank votes do not understand what

it  is  all about, it is right and proper that we in the Assembly should  decide

the  question  on their behalf. Therefore, clause 29 provides that  blank  votes

will  be decided by the Assembly. But as the Member for Cairnhill has said  just

now,  the Barisan Sosialis have a conspiracy to instigate the people and may  be

even  to  intimidate the voters to cast blank votes. Under a  cloud  of  such  a

possibility,  we cannot allow this conspiracy to succeed. Those who  cast  blank

votes cannot be allowed to decide our fate and our future. So we come back again

to  clause  29  which  provides that such blank votes will  be  decided  by  the

Assembly, by us who have been elected, by us who are here as legislators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other objection which the Barisan Sosialis has raised is to clause 5 which

relates  to  the  type  of  question or questions  that  can  be  asked  in  the

referendum.  During the debate in Committee on clause 5, the  Barisan  Sosialis,

and even the Member for Anson, insisted that there should be a simple yes or  no

answer.  May  I  refer  the House again to what the spokesman  for  the  Barisan

Sosialis had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>

to say in the radio forum? This is what he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In principle, all of us are agreed on merger.

But  how  is  that  question to be posed? If an elector should  agree  with  the

principle of merger but disagrees with the details of merger, how is he going to

vote yes or no?'



<br><br>Precisely, Mr Speaker. It is ridiculous if in the referendum on merger  we  are

to  ask the voter to vote yes or no. Because we understand the impossibility  of

the  position, this Bill provides that a question or questions can be  asked  in

the referendum. As Members in this House are now aware, a motion in the name  of

the  Prime  Minister has been tabled in which the nature of the questions  which

will  be  asked in the referendum on merger will be debated and the  Member  for

Cairnhill has also indicated that he will be moving an amendment to this motion.

In  other  words, in this referendum for merger, since all of us have agreed  on

the principle of merger, what is now necessary is to ask the electorate the mode

and  manner  in  which reunification with the Federation will take place - whether

they want merger or closer relationship along the lines of Command Paper No.  33

with autonomy in education and labour; whether they want complete merger, or whe

ther  they want merger as proposed by the Member for Cairnhill. So, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  what I sought to do was to prove to this House the insincerity and "humbuggery" of the Barisan Sosiahs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Humbugging?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Right from the beginning they have never been in favour

a  referendum, because in their arrogance they do not believe that  the  people

are  ready for the democratic process; and to hammer it down the throats of  the

Barisan Sosialis again, let me repeat what their Chairman said, "The people  are

not  very  conversant  with the democratic process and it will  take  some  time

before  the  people will realise what it is all about." These are the  so-called

champions  of  parliamentary democracy, when at the same time they  despise  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, all the dust that has been raised by the Barisan Sosialis over clause 5 and clause 29 on the question of the blank votes is just to confuse the

issue-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir. Since none of us are in a

position to reply - having spoken, Sir - is it proper for the Deputy Prime Minister

to go into the merits or demerits of individual clauses as though we were on the

Second Reading or at the Committee stage?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have not understood the Deputy Prime Minister to be going into

the  merits  and demerits. He is only saying how those clauses will  affect  the

Barisan  Sosialis when they are applied. I do not think that he  is  arguing  in

favour or against. He has accepted the fact that the clauses are there.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all I am trying to prove to the House is

that  the dust that has been kicked up by the Opposition - in particular  by  the

Barisan Sosialis, aided and abetted by the Member for Anson - is simply to confuse

the people over the referendum. They do not want the referendum.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That which has no meaning to it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Therefore, they

seek  to create confusion in the minds of the people over the Bill in this  way.

Let me ask the House simply and clearly:

this  Bill  which contains several clauses is a piece of legislation  containing

many  legal technicalities; how many of the 600,000 odd voters have really  read

the. Bill and how many have really been angered by the opposition which has been

raised  to clause 29 or clause 5? And there is a reason for their conspiracy  to

cover  their utter rejection of the referendum. They do not believe in parliamentary democracy.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hooray!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Shame.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> They despise the

people  because they are not ready for the democratic process. But, Sir, we  all

know  that  constitutionally  and  legally the  Government  have  the  right  to

negotiate merger.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There I think the

Deputy Prime Minister is going too far.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I was just trying to compare the attitude adopted by

the  Government with the attitude of the Barisan Sosialis, namely,  that  unlike

them,  we believe that this question on merger must he submitted to the  people,

because although we believe that the Government-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think that is irrelevant. I think we must come back to

the  Third  Reading  and  the speech made must have specific  reference  to  the

clauses.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I now come to the part of the Bill against which the

Member  for  Queenstown  and his colleagues on the opposite  side  strongly  and

vigorously  protested, and that is those clauses dealing with the time  for  the

referendum  campaign. The Members of this House heard, only this very afternoon,

an admission by the Member for Queenstown that his Party had already started the

referendum campaign "long, long ago." Those were his very words. They started on

April  the  1st. They went visiting houses, they held mass meetings  and  public

rallies.  But  I  will  tell them this, they can visit as many  houses  as  they

please;  they can hold as many rallies as they please, but merger is inevitable,

just as it is inevitable that the sun will rise over the horizon tomorrow.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That certainly is not an argument in favour of any clause.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I will just end up by saying that the protest by the

Barisan  Sosialis that they do not have adequate time to carry out a  referendum

campaign  is  sheer  nonsense. They have been carrying out this  campaign  since

April  the 1st, on their own admission. Therefore, the clauses relating  to  the

times  in  respect  of  the referendum campaign, as stated  in  this  Bill,  are

adequate.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I had not intended to speak on this Third Reading of the

Bill -

<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> Then why do you rise?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> - until the Deputy Prime Minister's remarks have

forced me to stand up to speak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main theme of his argument, Sir, is that the Barisan Sosialis are insincere about the referendum. He went on at great lengths to quote the leader

of  the  Barisan  Sosialis in his radio forum address -

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> "Leader" in

quotes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is the stand of the Barisan Sosialis

that on all matters of national importance a referendum should be held, but that

referendum  should  be  an honest referendum in which the  people  are  able  to

express  their views and their wishes and are able to record down whatever  they

feel. In whatever way they vote or record their feelings, their expression  must

be  respected  by the Government. The Deputy Prime Minister contradicts  himself

when,  on the one hand, he says that all the people who are likely to cast blank

votes are blind chickens.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I did not say it;

you said it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> The equivalent of that, Mr Speaker, that they are confused

and  unable to exercise their minds and therefore they have no business deciding

the  future  of the people of Singapore. I believe I am quoting what the  Deputy

Prime  Minister has said, and I stand here subject to any correction. The Deputy

Prime Minister has said those people who are incapable of saying either 'yes' or

'no' and who return a blank vote -

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> You do not want

'yes' or 'no'.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> - have no

business  to  decide the future of Singapore. He further says, therefore,  those

votes must be counted as Government votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Assembly votes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker.

Sir,  this  happens to be a friendly note from the Member for  Anson.  [Interruption]. As a man with a great deal of humility, I never hesitate to accept any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>



advice from anybody provided that advice is given in honesty and in sincerity. I

have acknowledged, Mr Speaker, in this House [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Member for Nee Soon takes notice of all these

interjections, I think we will never finish the debate. I would suggest that  he

just  ignore  all  these interjections and speak to the Speaker. [Interruption.]

Order.  May I ask the Government Bench also not to interject? Just when  I  have

pulled up the Member for Nee Soon, we get further interjections. There seems  to

be some disrespect for the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to put on record what I said

previously,  and  that  is, I always acknowledge advice from  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister  and  the Prime Minister when that advice is good and sincere.  I  note

with  a  great  deal  of  pleasure, Sir, that the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  just

hesitated before he left the Chamber.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Now, if the hon. Member for Nee Soon deliberately gets out of

order,  I  must exercise my powers under the Standing Orders. He was  pulled  up

before when he was making speeches for being out of order. I have always said  a

Member is entitled to walk out of this Chamber without any reference being  made

to that fact.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg your pardon. As I was saying, the

Deputy Prime Minister was arguing that those people who cast blank votes do  not

know what they want and therefore they have no business to decide the future  of

the  people of Singapore. I cannot understand the logic of his second  argument,

because  he says, since they are not able to decide the future of the people  of

Singapore, their votes become Government votes. Surely, Mr, speaker, Sir, when a

subject matter is sent for a referendum, the answer must be either this  way  or

that way, and people who cannot decide must not be allowed to use their votes to

be weighted in favour of the Government. The Deputy Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>



Minister  is  exactly contradicting himself because he says  since  they  cannot

decide, let them decide in favour of Government.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Member for Nee Soon must put those words

into  the  mouth  of  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister.  I  do  not  think  he  said

"Government".  I think he said "Assembly". I do not think he can  say  that  the

Deputy  Prime Minister said "Government". All that the Member can imply is  that

he  means the Government, but he cannot say that the Deputy Prime Minister  said

"Government"; he said "Assembly".



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Thank you for your guidance. In parliamentary democracy,

as  I understand it, Sir, the Assembly is, in fact, the Government, because  the

Government have a majority.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Nee Soon does not understand or does not

choose  to understand. What I am trying to indicate is that the Member is  wrong

in putting words into the mouth of another Member which never came out from that

Member's mouth. He can put his own interpretation, yes, he is entitled to  that;

but  he  must  not say a Member said A.B.C. when in fact the Member  never  said A.B.C.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, the outstanding thing about the Deputy Prime Minister's speech just now was

that  it  contained so many contradictions. The first contradiction I have  just

mentioned.  The  second  contradiction is that  he  has  ridiculed  the  Barisan

Sosialis.  [Interruption.] I am very tempted to reply, Mr Speaker, Sir,  but  I

try  very  hard  to look at you. The Deputy Prime Minister contradicted  himself

when  he  tried to put up a facade that he believed that the people of Singapore

were  ripe for democracy and that the Barisan Sosialis did not believe that they

were  ripe for democracy. The first part of his contention may be true, but  the

second  part is certainly not true. The Barisan Sosialis believe that the people

are  ripe for democracy, but in the presence of legal rigging by the Government,

democracy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>



takes  on  added meaning and such democracy, I am sure, the people of  Singapore

cannot  understand. So, on the one hand, he says that the Singapore  people  are

ripe for democracy, and yet, on the other hand, he justifies his stand that they

are  not ripe for democracy by saying that when they cast blank votes, they  are

all  confused and know nothing about democracy. If in this referendum more  than

half  the  people of Singapore actually cast blank votes, then the Deputy  Prime

Minister must swallow his words. Of course, under the legal provisions  of  this

Referendum  Bill, it is not possible for us to know how many  per  cent  of  the

people  have  actually cast blank votes because the Government have taken  great

care  to  hide  that figure and because the Government know that  if  ever  that

figure  became  known,  the  mock  democracy the  Government  practise  will  be

completely exposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister asks, why all the dust kicked up over this Bill? He answers it himself; that it is because the Barisan Sosialis want to confuse the

people. But have the Barisan Sosialis the apparatus to confuse the people?  Have

the Barisan Sosialis control of Radio Singapore and their Radio P.A.P.? Have the

Opposition control of the Press, the Ministry of Culture vans? Have the  Barisan

Sosialis-



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Television.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Television will be coming later, Mr Speaker, Sir, but when

it comes it may be very welcome under the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The S.P.A.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> It may well be the S.P.A. But those who look at reality will

know which is more real.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The Workers' Party.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Barisan Sosialis minus all the

propaganda apparatus available to the Government is able to help more than  half

the people of Singapore to make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>



up  their  minds, it only means one thing, Sir - that the people  believe  in  the

Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Less than half the people.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> If the Deputy

Prime  Minister disputes that fact, surely then the Deputy Prime Minister should

persuade  the Government in the forthcoming referendum to record the  percentage

of blank votes cast.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member has made his point. Let us now

come back to the Third Reading.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister asked a question: how many people in Singapore have been angered by clause 29?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Clause 5.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Clause 29.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Clause 5.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I will come to that by and by. I will endeavour to look at

you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kandasamy:</b> Take your time.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I submit to you, Sir, that all people with intelligence

have expressed their anger and their disgust with clause 29. [Interruption] Even

the Member for Cairnhill, when he was in Select Committee and away from the eyes

and ears of the people from the Gallery-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There again the Member for Nee Soon is disorderly, making

reference to people in the Gallery. They are not part of this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had just intended to say that the Member

for  Cairnhill, on behalf of the S.P.A., opposed clause 29 in Select  Committee.

And  I  grant him, Sir, intelligence because he has opposed it. And I  say:  all

intelligent  people  in Singapore oppose it. We have seen  statements  from  the

University of Singapore Students' Union, we have seen statements from the  other

University unions, we have seen statements from so many organisations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kandasamy:</b> Including the Animal Lovers League.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Culture  was  at one time the Deputy Speaker of this Assembly, and  I  think  he

ought to know the Standing Orders.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I say it is my contention that most of

the people, intellectual or otherwise, in Singapore have been angered by clause

29.   The Deputy Prime Minister is, of course, entitled to his own views. He  is

entitled to believe that, say, only one per cent, perhaps a half per cent of the

people  had  been angered by it. Now, it is a matter of my opinion against  his.

And  the only way to have a concrete figure as to how many people oppose  clause

29,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would submit, is to  have  a  referendum.  If  that

referendum was ever held, the results would certainly be a foregone conclusion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is that on blank votes?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I beg your

pardon?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will there be any blank votes?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Oh, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  thank you for your advice. I nearly forgot about all  the  blank

votes.  You  see, if clause 29 is put to the electorate, and if only one  simple

question is posed, I am sure there would not be any blank votes because there is

no confusion. And in the absence of confusion, I do not see any reason why blank

votes  should  be  cast. To that extent, Mr Speaker, Sir, we believe  that  the

people of Singapore are ripe for democracy.



<br><br>8.05 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that if a referendum is not rigged, where the questions have not

been complicated, there will be no confusion. So if the Deputy Prime Minister is

really  keen  on finding out how many people oppose clause 29, I will  tell  him

that a good way to do so is to put the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>



matter to a referendum. Clause 29, being such an important clause, I am sure, is

worth  the $400,000, that is the cost of a referendum. He further said, "Let  us

contrast  the attitude of the Government with the attitude of the Opposition  on

the  Referendum  Bill." He went on to say that in so far as  the  Government  is

concerned,  the Government believes that the issue of merger must be  submitted

to  the people for a definite decision. Of course, the Government tosses a  coin

on the table and tells us, "Heads, I win;

tails,  you  lose.  Let's  bet." What kind of a bet can  there  be,  Mr  Deputy

Speaker, Sir, when the coin turns out to be heads on both sides? Even if it  was

tails  on the other side of the coin, still the Opposition lose if it turns  out

to be tails.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on the matter of time for campaigning, the Deputy Prime Minister

justifies  the  Government's stand by saying that the Barisan Sosialis  have  already  started  campaigning  since the 1st April this  year.  That,  Mr  Deputy

Speaker, Sir, is a statement of fact.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Whose statement?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> And why is it openly acknowledged that it is a statement of

fact? It is acknowledged because it shows that the Barisan Sosialis is the  only

organisation  today  that is able to have a house-to-house campaign  on  such  a

scale in the circumstances. If you will just cast your mind to the later days of

1958 and the early days of 1959, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Mr Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kandasamy:</b> On a point of order. I do not see how all this has any

relevance  to the motion at hand. The provisions therein are "inappropriate  and

inadequate" for the purpose. I do not see the relevance, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I think the Member for Nee Soon is trying to reply to the

point  raised  by  the  Deputy Prime Minister that  canvassing  by  the  Barisan

Sosialis started on April 1st.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. My argument is:

in 1958 and in 1959 the P.A.P. had the organisation-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>





<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> If the Member

for Nee Soon is going back to 1958 and 1959 he is going completely away from the

Third  Reading  of  the Bill. As regards the point raised by  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister, I think the Member for Nee Soon has made his point.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> With great respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would say, in

so  far  as the P.A.P. won the 1959 elections because of its better organisation

and  its  campaigns and mass rallies, having taken precedence in time  over  the

other Parties, so would the Barisan win the referendum if the referendum is  not

rigged.  Even  with the provisions of the Bill hamstringing the Barisan  in  all

ways, should the Government be sincere and honest enough to allow the Barisan to

pose  the Barisan's stand on merger as interpreted by the Barisan on the  ballot

paper -



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. There is no such clause on the posing of questions in

this  Bill. There is a motion which will come up for debate in this Assembly  on

the  posing of questions. So all these arguments - what type of questions  should

be  posed and so on - can, I think, be brought up by the Member and a full  length

debate on it can be held in this Assembly when we come to

it.  Perhaps he will skip this now and come back to the Third Reading debate.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, may I suggest one final point which I

would  like to make on the Deputy Prime Minister's remark before I sit down?  He

quoted  at length what the Member for Queenstown said at the radio forum.  After

so  many  days  of debate, both on Malaysia and on the Referendum Bill,  it  has

turned  out that the suspicions of the Member for Queenstown were well  founded.

He  had  contended that unless the issues were posed to the people in clear  and

unequivocal terms, the electorate would be bound to be confused. I believe  most

of us would agree with such a statement. In the circumstances, our stand that as

referendum is not the best way of ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the

people becomes very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>



solidly  founded. I would like to quote the Minister for Finance  on  his  views

about questions on the Referendum-



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I have already indicated that we are not debating

on the questions to be posed in the referendum. We are debating on the amendment

to  the Third Reading of the Bill. If the Member for Nee Soon wants to bring the

Minister for Finance's views on the questions to be posed, the appropriate  time

will be when we come to item No. 3, that is, the motion standing in the name  of

the  Prime Minister in the Order Paper. When we come to that, he can then  quote

all  these things - the manner of the questions, how they are to be posed, and  so

on.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Thank you, Mr

Deputy Speaker. Perhaps if I were to relate my remarks to clause 5 of the  Bill,

I  might be able to explain to you in what way I have brought this matter up. It

is  the  contention of the Opposition that there should be one simple and  clear

question.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy):</b> On a

point of order. Are we debating on the merits or demerits of clause 5?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I think the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Finance  should be a little patient. The Member for Nee Soon has indicated  that

he  will  convince the Chair that his arguments - not in detail but in  general - have some connection with clause 5.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Thank you, Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, I was just endeavouring to relate clause 5 to  the  Opposition stand that there should be one clear, simple and unequivocal question.  In

respect of that, may I refer you, Sir, to the Select Committee Report No. 3  of

the 8th May, 1962 -

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. May I

remind the Member again that we are not going into details on the clauses  while

we  are  on  the Third Reading of this Bill? We are only discussing the  general

principles of the Bill. If the Member for Nee Soon wants to quote



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>



from the Official Report of the Select Committee and go into the details  of

the  clauses,  he is completely out of order. He can deal with  the  general

principle of any clause.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I do appreciate

that,  Mr  Deputy Speaker. I am only endeavouring to quote one  short  sentence  to show that our stand is right and relate that to the remarks of  the

Deputy  Prime  Minister. Can I refer you, Sir, to the debate in  the  Select

Committee on 8th May, 1962, at column 136? The Minister for Finance said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As a statistician, it is part of my discipline to study the composition

of  questionnaires  in public opinion polls, and it is an  absolute  primary

condition that the questions should be clear and unambiguous.'



<br><br>My  point,  Sir, is that if that view had been accepted by the

Deputy  Prime Minister  and if that position is going to be the position of

the referendum that  is coming ahead, then the Barisan Sosialis stand on the referendum  is

that  it would be an honest referendum. But that is not to be so, Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir. We know that unacceptable alternatives are to  be  posed  to

the  people,  and in the light of two unacceptable propositions,  a  lot  of

people may not want to vote at all. What is worse, blank votes are going  to

be Government votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Assembly votes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Assembly votes,

may  it please you, Mr Deputy Speaker. In view of that, Mr Deputy Speaker,

we  cannot  accept the result of the referendum, in view of that,  Sir,  the

remarks  made by the Member for Queenstown at the radio forum and quoted  at

length too by the Deputy Prime Minister, are

surely sensible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong (Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have been debating this National

Referendum  Bill  for the past few days. We in the Opposition  Parties  have

pointed  out many of the undemocratic provisions in the Bill. We have  moved

many  amendments  to these undemocratic provisions without success.  If  the

Government want to pose a question of national importance to the people for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>



their decision, it should be done in a democratic and fair manner. Our object in

moving  the  amendments  is  to  ask  the Government  to  conduct  the  national

referendum  in  a  fair, reasonable and democratic way. But the Government  have

rejected all our amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regard to the National Referendum Bill, the

Ministers  and their Parliamentary Secretaries stressed in the Select  Committee

that this Bill is a general referendum Bill. At the same time, they pointed  out

that  this Bill may be used to ascertain the views of the people on the question

of smoking or the hours for the sale of toddy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these examples cited by the Government cannot convince us. Therefore, when

the  Second  Reading of this Bill was debated in this House, the Ministers  also

said  that this Bill was a general Referendum Bill. But when we sought to  amend

the  undemocratic  provisions,  the  Government  could  not  advance  reasonable

arguments to rebut us, and so they had to change their stand by saying that this

Bill  was  a specific one to hold a referendum on the merger issue. Our Minister

for  Home Affairs then suggested that when the national referendum on the merger

question  has  been  held, this Bill will be repealed. From their  contradictory

statements  and  their  inconsistent arguments,  we  can  be  certain  that  the

Government is not sincere in moving this Bill. The Government will not ascertain

the  views  of the people in a democratic manner. The introduction of this  Bill

was motivated by their personal selfish interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we the Barisan Sosialis have stressed time and again

that  the people must be consulted on any question of national importance.  Then

the  Government  must sincerely put forward the question to be  decided  by  the

people in a fair and democratic way. But they dare not do so. Therefore, we feel

that this National Referendum Bill cannot ascertain the wishes and views of  the

people of Singapore. We therefore oppose its Third Reading. Not only will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>



this  Bill not reflect the views of the people, but at the same time the  Government will have to spend $400,000 on this national referendum, and on polling day

the 600,000 Singapore citizens will have to lose one working day and at the same

time  they  have to face two unacceptable alternatives and make  a  decision  on

that.  The  Government cannot convince the people by their  trying  to  bulldoze

through the National Referendum Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance says that they have been

able to convince the people and rally their support for their stand on the blank

votes  question. Now, that is the spirit of Ah Q. Their so-called great  victory

on clause 29 is humbug. Even the Member for Bras Basah, who had been a member of

the Executive Committee of the P.A.P. for several years, resigned from the Party

on  account of this undemocratic provision. This goes to how the Ah Q spirit of

the  Minister for Finance. We are not able to understand their logic. What  kind

of a logic have they?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have also heard the Ministers and their Parliamentary Secretaries say the opposition to the blank votes clause is instigated

by  the Barisan Sosialis, or inspired by the Communists. Now, if they are  going

to  try  and  explain away their stand, the resignation of the Member  for  Bras

Basah can be termed-



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I think the hon.

Member  for Toa Payoh must know that all these arguments, except the resignation

of  the  Member  for Bras Basah, were dealt with at length during the  Committee

stage  when  the Assembly was in full session. If the Member is going  into  the

reasons  as  to  why the Member for Bras Basah resigned and so on,  it  will  be

completely irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Deputy  Speaker, Sir, just now we heard the Minister for  Finance  and  the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour say that all those people who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>



are opposed to clause 29 are Communists or encouraged by the Barisan Sosialis to

do  so.  I  am  trying to point out the fallacy of their arguments.  Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, today it is only the S.P.A. who are acting on the same  lines  as

the  P.A.P.  Why  does the Member for Cairn hill strongly oppose  this  National

Referendum Bill and the undemocratic provisions therein in the Select Committee?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I think

this is going to be a mere repetition of what the Member for Nee Soon has said.

I must ask the Member for Toa Payoh as far as possible to avoid repetition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to give one example to illustrate my point,

i.e., the Member for Cairnhill -

this sitting until half-past nine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Original

Question was, "That the Bill be now read a Third time." Since which an amendment

has  been moved to leave out from "That" to the end of the Question and  to  add

instead thereof the words which appear on the Order Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to be left out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, just now I talked on the subject of the national  referendum.

This  Bill  was  not  put forward on democratic terms. The  Government  have  no

intention, of ascertaining the will and wishes of the people through democratic

means.  That is why we on the Opposition side are strongly opposed  to  it,  and

that  is why some societies and organisations have protested vigorously. On  the

other hand,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>



in  spite of the request by the Opposition Parties to the Government to  let  us

have  sufficient  time  to go and explain to the people on  such  subjects  like

voting,  the Government insist on having their own way. Therefore, we feel  that

the  Government  have not considered carefully the opinions  of  the  Opposition

Parties  of  this  House; neither have they considered  the  opinions  of  other

people.  They have insisted on carrying out the undemocratic provisions of  this

Bill. On the grounds of interest and welfare of the people, we vigorously oppose

the passing of the Third Reading of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister has said that when the people of Singapore could not make a decision as a result of which they cast blank votes, then such blank

votes  should  be  taken  as in favour of the Government.  This  shows  his  low

estimation of the political knowledge of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore actually know everything about this. The Government

can  look  after the welfare of the people of Singapore. The people of Singapore

are  capable  of making their own decision. They are capable of voting  for  the

Party  which seeks their welfare and interest. Therefore, when the Deputy  Prime

Minister says that the people of Singapore, when they could not make a decision,

would cast blank votes, I say that he is not correct.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The Member for Toa Payoh, like every other Barisan Sosialis

Member, is always referring to the fact that the Deputy Prime Minister says that

a blank ballot paper would be in support of the Government's question. Sir, this

is a continuous repetition of a falsehood.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think I have mentioned the point before. The hon. Member must

not  put  words  into  another Member's mouth. The  Deputy  Prime  Minister  has

indicated  that  a  blank  vote  would be in  favour  of  the  decision  of  the

Legislative  Assembly,  not  the  decision  of  the  Government.  There   is   a

distinction. The Member might say that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>



means  the  decision  of  the Government, but that is quite  a  different  thing

entirely. He must not say that the Deputy Prime Minister has said that it is  in

favour of the decision of the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  because the Deputy Prime Minister has just expressed the opinion that when

the  people  could  not make a decision they would cast blank  votes,  so  I  am

replying to him.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member has probably misunderstood me. Of course, he can make a

reply.  I am not stopping him from making a reply. The point is that the  Member

has  alleged that the Deputy Prime Minister said that a blank vote  cast  was  a

vote  cast  in  favour of the Government. The Deputy Prime Minister  never  said

that.  He  said that a blank vote cast was a vote cast in favour of the decision

of  the Legislative Assembly. The Member, of course, is entitled to say that his

interpretation  of what the Deputy Prime Minister said is that the  decision  of

the  Legislative Assembly, in fact, is the decision of the majority Party, which

is the Government. He is entitled to say that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  when  the White Paper was passed by this House, it amounted to the  P.A.P.

passing  it.  We have just heard the Deputy Prime Minister saying  that  we  the

Barisan Sosialis would confuse the people during the national referendum, but if

there is such confusion, it is not because of the Barisan Sosialis. In the  past

we  have heard the Prime Minister over the radio on national citizenship and  so

on.  This confused the people as regards the terms "national" and "citizen". Mr

Speaker,  Sir, according to our views on this Bill, we feel that it is  most  undemocratic  that  the  P.A.P. should pass it  just  in  the  interests  of  the

Ministers. Therefore, I oppose the Third Reading of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Member  for Anson has expressed  his  surprise  at  my

abstention. Probably he will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>



more  surprised when he hears that I am standing up to oppose the amendment  and

support  the Third Reading. I would like to say, Sir, that I appreciate  and  am

grateful  for  the courtesy he has accorded me when he said that,  in  spite  of

that,  he still thought that I was sincere and honest in my actions. The  Member

for  Queenstown  also, Sir, not in this Chamber but in  the  C.P.A.  Room,  has

claimed  that he did not mention what I had said at the forum outside, that  is,

condemning  the Referendum Bill, in order to spare me from embarrassment.  I  am

glad  to  know  that  chivalry still exists and I am indebted  to  him  for  the

chivalry and consideration that he has accorded to a lady Member of this  House.

However, Sir, I would like to state that I do not need to be spared. In fact,  I

cannot  understand why it is so difficult for the Member for Queenstown, or  any

Member  of  the Barisan Sosialis, to understand why I and my colleagues  in  the

S.P.A. have condemned the Bill outside but are now supporting it here. Can  they

not  see the reason? Can they not see the difference of the Referendum Bill then

and the Referendum Bill today in these circumstances?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at that time we were against the Bill because we felt that clause 29 was

a  clause which would force the people, as the Member for Anson said, to  choose

between  beating your wife or beating your daughter. It was true then, Sir,  but

now since our leader, the Member for Cairnhill, has suggested

- and  it  has  been  accepted by the Government - that the  questions  should  he

discussed  and debated here and each political Party should be allowed  to  pose

the  question  that they want to pose and present the type of merger  that  they

want, where would there be the necessity to cast blank votes then?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir, I am indeed indebted to the Lady.

Is  the  Lady from Mountbatten satisfied? Can she point to any part of  Hansard

where we have the assurance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>



that  each  political  Party will be permitted to pose  the  question  that  it

wishes?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, I think the Minister has agreed, and the Member for

Cairnhill has mentioned it several times, and the Government have not denied it,

that they are now agreed that the questions will be discussed and posed here, at

least  discussed here and each Opposition Party or each Party in this House  is,

of  course, entitled to put their views, the type of merger that they  want  and

the questions that they want to pose in the referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Members of this House have been voted into this Assembly by the

majority  of  the  electorate.  Parliamentary  democracy  deems  us  to  be  the

representatives of the majority of the people. Laws are passed here  which  have

been accepted by the people outside. In the case of merger, it is true there has

been  a  certain amount of doubt as to the type of merger the people  want,  and

this House has agreed that there should be a referendum. Sir, in this House none

of  us have ever said we do not want merger, and the referendum is only to  find

out  what  type of merger we want. If we, the people in this House, are supposed

to  be  the  representatives of the majority, and each Party has  presented  its

views  on  the type of merger and the type of questions they want to  be  posed,

then  surely we can expect the electorate to choose one of them. Supposing, Sir,

in  spite  of  all  these questions posed by all the political Parties  here,  a

majority  of  the electorate say, "We do not want all of them." What  does  that

mean? It can only mean one of two things; that there has been an effort to wreck

the  referendum in order to obstruct merger, or something has gone so very wrong

that the P.A.P. supporters are rejecting their P.A.P. representatives here,  the

S.P.A. supporters  are rejecting the S.P.A. representatives here,  the  Barisan

Sosialis supporters are rejecting the Barisan Sosialis representatives here, and

soon  with all the others. Now, I am sure it would be ridiculous to assume  that

otherwise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>



what  else  can  it be, if all of us have posed all our questions  and  all  the

questions are rejected? That means nobody in Singapore wants any of us  in  this

Assembly, which I think would be a ridiculous thing to assume. Therefore, if  inspite  of  the  fact that all the questions of the different Parties  have  been

posed,  the  majority of them still put in blank votes, then there may  be  some

truth  in the Government's claim that there has been an effort by the Communists

to  wreck the referendum. After all, Sir, we must give credit to this fact, that

the  P.A.P.,  the  Party  in power, has had a lot of experience,  having  worked

together  with the Communists - I would even say corroborated with them, protected

them  and advised them, and have been put into power by them. We must admit that

they  do  know a lot more about the Communist tactics than we do, and we  cannot

just  dismiss that claim of theirs that it is the Communist tactic to wreck  the

referendum, and if clause 29 is not in, the Communists will succeed.  We  cannot

dismiss  this threat, Sir, without a certain amount of risk. Therefore, I  think

the leader of the S.P.A. has done very well because, instead of taking that risk

and  saying, "No, we insist that clause 29 be out," instead of taking  the  risk

that  there may be some truth in the Government's claim, he has very efficiently

and effectively handled the situation so that you get the same effect without  a

risk. The effect is that clause 29 no longer means that the people will have  to

choose between two undesirable things, that they will have the question of their

own representatives in this House posed to them. Is it reasonable then to expect

that they should vote for one of them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, Sir, is the change of the situation that has made us vote for

the  Third Reading rather than oppose it which we thought we were going  to  do,

Sir.  When  I  spoke, I meant every word that I said. In all  honesty  and  with

sincerity,  I meant to come and vote against and speak against. But in  view  of

the change in the situation, we felt that it is wiser



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>



to  take  the  step that we have taken. Moreover, Sir, as I have  said,  in  the

excitement and anxiety of the different Members of this House - some to see merger

through; others to block merger

- a  very  important point has been dealt with very lightly and it has  not  been

given sufficient emphasis.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Justice.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> I refer to the Bill, Sir, if it was to be used at all

times under all conditions, on all national issues, in the way that it was  when

I  spoke at a forum, not with the special conditions that have been agreed to by

the Government today. At that time, under those conditions, I said that there is

no  guarantee that if it is a general referendum Bill in the next referendum the

Government is going to allow the Assembly to discuss and debate the questions or

pose  the  questions. The conditions will be worse still if the next  Government

happens  to  be a pro-Communist Government. Can you see the danger of  this - what

our General Secretary calls a lethal weapon in the hands of the Government to be

used  as they wish, when they wish and for whatever they wish? Personally I  was

against the Bill because it was going to be a general referendum Bill, at  least

for  merger,  even  without the special conditions,  Sir.  Although  we  do  not

advocate  undemocratic  measures, we can be consoled by  the  fact  that  if  it

results  in  the proposals set out in Command Paper No. 33 - whatever the  Barisan

thought  about  Command  Paper No. 33, the Member for  Anson  admitted  that  he

respected  this  view  of the S.P.A. - it will be the first  step  towards  closer

relations. Now, if the Member for Anson respects that, then in spite of all  the

undemocratic  terms  of  the  Referendum Bill, if it  leads  to  prosperity  for

Singapore in closer relation with the Federation, at least we can be consoled by

that thought. As I said, Sir, although we do not advocate it, we can be consoled

if  it  must  be so. But today we have sought means and ways to take the  undemocratic sting out of clause 29. Now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>



that  the  Bill is not going to be a general referendum Bill, we are  supporting

the  Third  Reading  because we feel that we have won the  day.  We  wanted  the

questions to be posed here and to be debated here. We have got

it.   We wanted the Bill to be only on merger and not a general Referendum Bill.

We have got it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, talking about the questions being debated here, it has been the desire of

the  Barisan Sosialis - they have been clamouring for it for a long time - that this

should  be done. But with all their clamouring, shouting, scolding, abusing  and

the washing of dirty linen here, they have not achieved

it.   It  was  because  the Member for Cairnhill at a radio forum  claimed  that

clause  29  was undemocratic and also because of the way he handled  the  matter

here  that  the  Government have been forced to agree to  the  questions  to  be

debated here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hooray!



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> That is why I feel that it is we who have won the day and

there is no reason now for us not to support the Third Reading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that we feel that the special clauses now will not

be able to be used in the future under different conditions and different terms  at

the  expense of freedom and democracy. The Member for Anson has always  shown  a

very  unbiased attitude, and I must give him credit for that, Sir. He has  never

looked at things from a biased point of view, which is rare amongst politicians.

They  are always prejudiced or biased when they talk to you of their views about

what you think. But the hon. Member has always been unbiased and I ask him, Sir,

to  consider  this. We are now faced with two alternatives. Are we going  to  be

democratic and kill democracy or be undemocratic and preserve democracy?



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng (Serangoon Gardens)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, this Bill

has  been debated for seven days in Select Committee. Today we are on the  Third

Reading of this Bill before



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>



this  House.  From  the  debate, you can see that the  position  of  the  P.A.P.

Government is not steady now. They are rather uneasy and their refusal to accept

the views and opinions advanced by others is similar to the attitude adopted  by

the  Ministers  in  Select  Committee when they  refused  to  accept  the  views

contained  in  the  representations of civic organisations.  During  the  Select

Committee  sittings the Ministers of the P.A.P. refused to accept the  views  of

the Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have said time and time

again  that we have completed Committee work. We had a Select Committee  and  we

had  a Committee of the whole Assembly. We are now on the Third Reading and  the

Member must address himself to the clauses which appear in the Bill and then  he

must  try  to  indicate how those clauses are undesirable, or inappropriate,  or

inadequate in relation to the referendum on merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I only want to point out simply how the Bill had been carried

in the Second Reading because it was-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We have passed

the  Second Reading. We are now on the Third Reading. The Member must urge  that

there should be no Third Reading.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Although  this  Bill has passed the Committee stage, we know that  outside  this

House  there  are five political Parties which have joined hands to  oppose  the

P.A.P. in relation to this Bill and their other actions. The P.A.P. have refused

this Joint Action Council to hold meetings in protest against this Bill. We know

that  even  inside the P.A.P. itself the few leaders have adopted a monopolising

attitude and they do not accept the opinions of executive members and members of

the  Party.  That  is  why  today they have only 25 seats  in  this  House.  For

instance, the Member for Bras Basah recently resigned and crossed the  Floor  to

sit on this side of the House because she objects to clause 29 of this Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy</b> rose and then resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary, of course, anticipated the Speaker

who  was  rather busy. It is in fact irrelevant. Let us come back to this  Third

Reading.  I have indicated what the Member must do, and he must do what  I  have

indicated. We are on the Third Reading of this Bill. He must look at the clauses

and tell us how he thinks those clauses are quite unsuitable for a referendum on

merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

I  was  just  trying  to  say how their Executive Committee  members  have  been

dissatisfied with certain provisions of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is irrelevant. I am not interested in what the Executive

Committee  members of the Party are doing, or whether they are dissatisfied.  We

are not interested in that in this particular debate. We are interested only  in

discussing the clauses which are in the Bill. The Member must indicate how those

clauses  are not suitable for a referendum on merger. Under Standing  Order  54-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Speaker or the Chairman, after having drawn attention to the conduct of a

Member,  who persists in irrelevance, or tedious repetition either  of  his  own

arguments or of the arguments used by other Members in debate, may direct him to

discontinue his speech.'

<br><br>I  do  not  like  to do that. I have not done that and I do not want  to  set  a

precedent. Mr Leong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I accept your ruling on that. I will now touch  on  the  main

topic.  As  a result of the debate in the last few days, we can have  access  to

certain  secrets  of the P.A.P. in relation to this Bill. Let  me  quote  a  few

examples. For instance, this Bill has been said to be a general Referendum Bill,

but  later  on  it  becomes a specific Referendum Bill. It is  intended  by  the

Government  that after the holding of the referendum the Bill will be  repealed.

It  would appear, therefore, that the P.A.P. is not honest and is not consistent

throughout.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that the P.A.P. has no confidence in its White Paper on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>



merger. That is why it will pose two questions to let the people choose, because

they know that the people will not support them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that the P.A.P. has recognised that the people are not

satisfied with certain provisions of the Bill. That is why they are adopting the

present tactics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point is this. The provision in relation to the limitation of the

publicity campaign; we can see that the P.A.P. is afraid of the Barisan Sosialis

carrying out a publicity campaign, thus disclosing the dictatorial manner of the

P.A.P. to the people. They want to curb us. As a representative of the people, I

have the duty to air my opinion here, that the National Referendum Bill of the

P.A.P is not a democratic one, because its purpose is to enable the P.A.P. to

adulterate the views of the people. Because the provisions of the Bill are

undemocratic and unreasonable, I support the amendment moved by the Member for

Anson, and we should refuse to let the Assembly have the Third Reading of this

Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, in the course of the debate in the past few days on the

National Referendum Bill, the Bill has passed the Committee stage. Now, let us

examine the details of this National Referendum Bill and let us ask whether we

should give it a Third Reading. The P.A.P. in bringing up this National

Referendum Bill want to prevent the people from opposing their merger proposals.

Many unreasonable clauses have been written into the Bill with the support of

the reactionary political forces which survive up till today. Although

unreasonable clauses have been incorporated into the Bill, this Bill looks like

this - that is, the Government has let loose a tiger embodied in this Bill to harm

the people of Singapore. You can see, Mr Speaker, that the clause in relation

to blank votes and uncertain votes is unprecedented in the history of the world,

but it has been incorporated into the Bill. It is put in with the purpose of

deceiving the people of Singapore, so as to carry on with-





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have to mention that the Member for Moulmein is the eleventh

speaker  from  the Barisan Sosialis and he seems to be repeating  the  arguments

which have been advanced by the other ten speakers. I would suggest to him  that

this  repetition is now becoming a bit tedious. The Speaker has this power under

Standing Order 54 - If a Member persists in tedious repetition either of  his  own

arguments  or  arguments used by other Members in the debate,  the  Speaker  may

direct  that he discontinue his speech. So I would ask the Member not to  repeat

what his fellow Members have said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, this National Referendum Bill has passed the Committee  stage

with  all the unreasonable clauses incorporated into it, and my colleagues  have

explained very clearly how these clauses are unreasonable and undemocratic.  Let

me  quote to you the Sixth Anniversary Celebration Souvenir of the P.A.P., 1960.

The  title of the article is "Nation Building and Socialism", Written by Dr Toh

Chin Chye, on page 50 [Mandarin version]:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A government rules by the consent of the people, it is a first axiom in

politics.  This of course implies that the government must not be divorced  from

mass  thinking and mass aspirations. However, keeping in touch with  the  people

must take an active form by mass participation and co-operation in the plans and

administration of the government.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from here we can see what they said before, but the provisions in the National Referendum Bill are used to preserve their party

prestige. Formerly they had 26 seats opposite, but today they have only 25.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I wonder if the hon.

Member will indicate which clause in the Bill has any reference to the Party  in

power now having 25 seats as against 26 seats?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

It is relevant to this point. The said Member, if he cannot be relevant, to wind up his speech.

I do not want to exercise my power unser Standing Order No. 54 if I can help it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):



Although  today the P.A.P. is acting contrary to the interest and  will  of  the

people  by trying to force through this unreasonable and undemocratic Bill,  the

people  of  Singapore will remember forever their unreasonable and  undemocratic

acts in bulldozing through this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members are aware, the Government have decided to implement the principle

of equality for woman officers in the Government service. The difference in

treatment of woman officers is historical. It began in pre-war days when few

branches of the civil service had woman officers. Only in the teaching service

were women employed in great numbers compared to men but were paid four-fifths

of the men's rate. In fact, with very few exceptions, the woman officers in the

civil service receive roughly 80 per cent of the pay of their male colleagues.

As for the conditions of service, they are also less advantageous. Woman

officers lose their permanent status when they marry, for then they are required

to resign and are re-employed on a temporary basis. They therefore lose their

pension rights when they reach retiring age. They are also required to retire at

45 years but are not allowed to serve up to the normal retiring age which was,

until recently, 55 years. This policy of discrimination against women has no

place in a just society. The P.A.P. announced in the 1959 general election that

it would observe the equality of status for women in our society so far as this

is possible. This pledge has now been fulfilled in respect of woman officers in

the civil service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it will not be possible to rectify the anomalies overnight. They will

have to be brought about by stages and by January 1965, all woman officers in

the civil service will be paid the same salary for the same type of work as men

officers. Administrative measures have been taken to carry out this policy. It

is also necessary to amend the relevant sections of the Pensions Ordinance to

give effect to equal terms of employment to woman officers. Woman officers

appointed to the service on or after 1st March, 1962, will no longer be

required to resign or to retire on marriage. They will remain permanent officers

and be allowed to serve up to the same retiring age as men. It is, however,

necessary to make provision



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>



that  woman officers in the service prior to 1st March, 1962, can opt to  retire

at  the existing age of retirement or to retire on marriage to qualify for  gratuity.  The opportunity is also taken to implement the decision to allow  Gurkhas

serving  in  the Gurkha Contingent in the Singapore Police Force to retire  with

full pension benefits on or after completing 15 years of service, as it has been

ascertained that the average span of service of a Gurkha soldier in the  British

Army is 15 years. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  rise to support the Bill. By this Bill the injustice that has been imposed on

women  officers in the civil service will be removed. I cannot help but  observe

that this Bill is brought in only at a time when the P.A.P. Government is having

its last gasp.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.-[Dr Goh

Keng Swee].

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1-

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is another Pensions (Amendment) Bill which is

going to Select Committee. So in clause 1 of this particular Bill which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Ordinance may be cited as the Pensions (Amendment No. 2) Ordinance,

1962.'.

<br><br>probably the "No. 2" should come out. Will the Minister agree?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is another Pensions (Amendment)

Bill.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, but this is being dealt with first in time, and so I think

"No.  2"  should  come  out of this Bill and should be  inserted  in  the  other

(Amendment) Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I see. Yes, I quite

agree.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We will take "No. 2"

out then as a typographical amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 2



stand part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, only on a

point of elucidation. Sir, the proviso to clause 2 (i) states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"Provided that in the case of a female officer she was in the service before

the  1st  day of March, 1962, and has opted to retire on or after attaining  the

age of forty-five years; or";'.



<br><br>Does  that  mean that a woman who has a child and who was in the service  before

the  1st day of March but has opted to retire before that date - does that include

women who have already retired before the 1st day of March?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

section 7 of the Pensions Ordinance allows the payment of pensions, gratuity and

other  allowances  to  certain grades of persons. This amendment  is  to  enable

pensions and other allowances to be paid to women who are already in the service

but  who opt to remain on the present terms. Put it this way: women officers who

are engaged on or after the 1st of March, 1962, are employed on exactly the same

terms  as men, that is to say, even if they are married, they still retain their

pensionable  status. It does not affect them at all. And they cannot  retire  at

the age of 45. They have not got the option of retiring at that age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if they were employed before that date, they have certain privileges

which they may want to retain. For instance, if they marry and if they have  put

in 10 years of service, section 17 of the Pensions Ordinance entitles them to  a

marriage  gratuity of one month per year of service. This section  is  to  allow

such women who want to retain these rights that they have. On the other hand, of

course,  they  may  want  to opt into the new terms, and they  are  particularly

entitled to do so, which means that they will retain their pensionable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>



status  after  marriage, at a price, of course, of foregoing these  benefits  of

marriage gratuities. I hope I have made the position clear.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I understood that that meant what the

Minister  has  said  it to mean. But my question is: on top  of  all  that,  the

proviso:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"Provided that in the case of a female officer she was in the service before

the 1st day of March, 1962, and has opted to retire..."'.



<br><br>Now,  if  a  woman has opted to retire and has retired, then do the  words  "has

opted to retire" mean that? Or do they mean that she has opted to retire but has

not retired? Which does it mean?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> This is all very confusing.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can the Minister answer that at this time of the night?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It means that she has opted to retire but has not retired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the question which the hon. Member wants to ask really is this: in the

case of women who have already retired, what are their pension rights? Now, with

this  amendment, when all women who take advantage of this option of a  complete

equality with men

- whether they marry or do not get married - retire, they get full pension  rights.

Formerly, that was not the case. A married woman loses her pensionable status on

marriage,  and if she has served for say 10 to 15 years, she draws an  allowance

of  half  the full pension rights. And if she has completed more than 15  years,

she gets 60 per cent of full pension rights. These quantums are regulated not by

this  Ordinance  but  by  regulations. Regulation 22 sets  down  the  allowances

payable to persons in non-pensionable establishment - both men and women who  have

retired  after so many years of service. Therefore, the eligibility to  pensions

of  women  officers  who have already retired remains as  before,  and  is  not

affected  by this Ordinance. If we want to give them the pensions to which  they

would  have  been entitled if this policy had been in force in  the  past,  then

amendments to these regulations made under the Pensions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance would be necessary. Whether or not there is a case for doing so is  an

extremely  complicated matter. There are arguments for and against. The  obvious

argument  is that women officers who retired before 1st March, 1962,  are  in  a

sense  done out of something. Supposing she retires on 28th February,  then  she

would have lost certain rights. Therefore, it could be said that there is a case

for  giving  such  women full pension entitlement. But there are  many  horrible

complications.  I  have gone through these in some detail.  For  instance,  some

women  draw  pensions  in  respect of services both  in  Singapore  and  in  the

Federation.  Then what do we do about that? Then certain women have drawn  their

pensions  in the form of capital grants; others have not. Although  I  have  not

made  up  my mind finally on this subject, it does seem to me that the case  for

preserving  the  status quo is rather stronger than the case for making  further

changes to the regulations made under the Pensions Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in dealing with women, of course, there

will  be a lot of complications. It could be horrible; it could be exciting;  or

it  could  be  romantic. There is the other complication which I would  ask  the

Minister to explain - if it is a complication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens to a female officer in the service before the operative date? She

got  married, she got her marriage allowance, but can she now apply to be on the

pensionable  status, after having taken the marriage allowance?  Would  it  also

mean that she would have her marriage allowance deducted from her pensions?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, she can apply for transfer into the permanent

service  in the usual way. I think what the hon. Member meant is that they  have

retired  on marriage and have been re-engaged on a temporary status. Such  women

can  apply  for  admission into the permanent service.  And  if  their  original

appointment  had been made by the Public Service Commission, then  the  transfer

would be automatic.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>



As  regards pension rights, the service in respect of which marriage  allowance

had  been  drawn, would not naturally count as pensionable service.  Pensionable

service would begin from the date of re-engagement.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, I think what the Member for Cairnhill has in

mind  is this: supposing a woman gets married after 9 years of service and  has

drawn only one year's salary maximum. There is a maximum to the gratuity. But if

that 9� years is given to her and counted in her years of service, then when the

pensions  are  calculated, it would mean much more to her than  the  one  year's

salary  which  she  has  received as gratuity. Can she return  that  one  year's

service and claim pensions from the day that she was originally appointed, which

would mean that in her old age she would have a bigger pension to live on?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> That is why I say, never deal with women.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> There are two reasons. Technically, there has been a break in

service because she has retired. And, of course, the other reason is that such a

woman would then try to get the best of two worlds.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> They always do!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported with an amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<br><br>10.45 p.m.



<div align="center"><b>ADVOCATES AND SOLICITORS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to provide for the more effective supervision, of

advocates  and  solicitors and of solicitors' clerks.  The  Bill  seeks  in  the

proposed section



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>



41A  to  empower  the Singapore Bar Committee to make rules to provide  for  the

keeping of accounts by advocates and solicitors in respect of money held by them

on behalf of their clients.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the proposed section 41B provision is made for the delivering of an annual

certificate by an accountant in respect of such accounts. It is felt that  these

provisions will enable a more effective control to be exercised over the keeping

of clients' money by advocates and solicitors. The proposed section 41B provides

for  the  maintenance  and  administration of  a  compensation  fund  to  enable

compensation  to be paid where any person has sustained loss in  consequence  of

the dishonesty of any advocate or solicitor or any clerk or servant employed  by

him  in  connection with his practice. Failure to comply with the rules relating

to  the  keeping of accounts will constitute a disciplinary offence for which  a

complaint  can  he  made to the Bar Committee, and it is also  provided  that  a

certificate  to practise will not be issued to an advocate and solicitor  unless

he  satisfies the Registrar that he has complied with the provisions relating to

the keeping of accounts and the delivery of an accountant's certificate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power is given to the State Advocate-General to refer any information touching

on the conduct of a solicitor in his professional capacity to the Bar Committee.

That is provided for in clause 7.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent abuses, it is proposed that a solicitor will not be allowed to make an agreement with his client for the payment of a commission,

percentage or salary to him. This is provided for in clause 11.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions relating to the employment of solicitors' clerks are contained

in  the  proposed new section 35, which is clause 8 of the Bill. It is  provided

that no solicitor shall, without the consent of the court, employ any person who

has  been  struck  off the roll, or suspended from practice,  or  who  has  been

convicted of an offence involving dishonesty  of touting or of holding himself

out to be a qualified person or who has been listed as a tout or who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>



is  a  public  servant. The purpose of this amendment is to remove all  opportunities  for touting and to ensure that only persons of integrity will be employed

in  the  offices of advocates and solicitors. It is, however, intended to permit

the  employment of advocates and solicitors and qualified persons even  if  they

had  previously been in Government service. I will move an amendment at the  Committee stage of the Bill to make this intention clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is made for the ad hoc admission of Queen's Counsel to appear in

cases  in  Singapore. I shall be moving an amendment to this clause  to  provide

that  such  Queen's Counsel may only be admitted by the court for  one  or  more

special  reasons  in  the  public interest and that such  Queen's  Counsel  have

special qualifications or experience for the purpose of the case for which  they

are to be admitted. Before admitting such persons, the court will have regard to

the views of the State Advocate-General and the Bar Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present position in Singapore is that Queen's Counsel can be admitted

to  the Singapore Bar without much formality, and the practice has been that  no

opposition  is  raised  by the Singapore Bar Committee or  the  State  Advocate-General.  In the Federation of Malaya, however, statutory provisions  have  been

strictly enforced, and in a recent case, the Chief Justice of the Federation has

decided  that  the  provisions  of section 7 of  the  Federation  Advocates  and

Solicitors  Ordinance, 1947, must be complied with. This requires,  inter  alia,

that the person applying to be admitted must satisfy the Board appointed by  the

Bar  Council  that he has an adequate knowledge of the laws of  the  Federation.

There is no corresponding provision requiring knowledge of the laws of Singapore

in  Singapore.  All  that is required in Singapore is that the  persons  seeking

admission  should satisfy the examiners that they have an adequate knowledge  of

the  practice  and  etiquette of the profession and  of  the  English  language.

Queen's  Counsel, therefore, have had no difficulty in satisfying the examiners.

In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>



the Federation there have been no applications other than the one which recently

came  before  the  Chief Justice made by a non-resident practitioner,  while  in

Singapore there has been a number of such admissions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal for ad hoc admissions will restrict the admission of non-resident

practitioners, as  Queen's  Counsel will  only  be  admitted  to  appear  in  a

particular case. It is proposed to restrict the right still further by requiring

the Queen's Counsel seeking admission to show that he has special qualifications

and  experience  for the purpose of the case. The court is further  required  to

have  regard to the views of the State Advocate-General and of the Bar Committee

before admitting such a person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the power to grant leave to qualified persons and managing clerks to

appear  before  the Judge or Registrar in Chambers is to be extended  to  enable

such  persons  to appear in Chambers before a District Judge or Registrar  of  a

District Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a good Bill and I welcome it. I compliment the Government particularly on the tact and good sense shown by them in

listening to criticisms - unfortunately not usual - in weighing those criticisms and

reappraising their stand with sincerity. The Government has now produced a  Bill

which I believe and hope will receive a welcome from all sides of this House  in

respect of all its aspects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, though the Government is roasting the people of Singapore on a spit like

a barbecued lamb -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Are those extravagant phrases really

necessary? They are completely irrelevant to the Bill. We are dealing with the

Advocates and Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, and the Member for Anson is

endeavouring to generate heat.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No, Sir, I am not seeking to generate heat. I am seeking to

explain,  Mr  Speaker,  that however strongly we may  feel  about  some  other

conduct,  nevertheless, in this context where they offer us a drop of water,  I

want  to  say  that I am grateful for that drop of water and I thank  them  for

this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is perfectly in order. But I think when the Member

embarks  on extravagant phrases which are completely irrelevant to the  Bill,  I

think the Speaker is entitled to pull him up.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I will not argue with your entitlement, Sir, I would like to

say that the members of the Bar, as a group of professional persons with special

privileges, privileges which give them the right to a career of dignity and,  in

most cases, of profit [Laughter] Should I add, Sir, or would this generate heat?

Not  as  much  profit nor power as certain lustful politicians for politics  and

position. The members of the Bar are conscious that they carry special  responsibilities  to  the community they serve. I know that there has been  considerable

anxiety, Mr Speaker, caused amongst members of the Bar of Singapore as a result

of the widely publicized occasion when a member of the Bar committed a breach of

trust  of  vast sums of money. The extent of the defalcations and the repute  of

the advocate and solicitor concerned brought home with a shock to all in the Bar

the possibility that this incident or similar incidents may recur. And it is  in

these  circumstances that the Bar has been very anxious to create a compensation

fund  to  which  the  Bar  itself would contribute whereby  clients  who  suffer

pecuniary loss from the misconduct of a member of the Bar may be compensated out

of  a fund for which all members of the Bar would be equally responsible. And in

conformity with the high traditions of its profession, the Singapore  Bar  seeks

to  implement the concept, Sir, that all members should be responsible  for  the

pecuniary loss arising from the professional misconduct of any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>



one  member, in order to protect the community in its trust of this professional

group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed section 41D, which creates the compensation fund, is the first

effort  in  this  part of the world to implement the concept  of  the  pecuniary

responsibility of a group of professional men for the misconduct of one of  themselves.  This clause is only part of the answer to the problem. It is  my  hope,

and  I  believe the hope of many members of the Bar, that as soon  as  the  fund

grows in strength, amending legislation will be introduced to enable clients who

suffer  pecuniary loss from criminal misconduct of solicitors to claim from  the

fund  the  full loss and not merely to receive an ex-gratia grant.  Furthermore,

Sir, I would like to see in due course this fund becoming the insurer for all pecuniary  loss  arising  not  only from criminal misconduct  but  also  from  the

negligence of a member of the Bar. When this is achieved, the Bar will have made

adequate  provisions to meet to the full its responsibilities commensurate  with

the privileges which it enjoys.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate that this is not at present possible and will not be possible for

some time until the fund is of adequate size. It is my hope that the aim will be

kept  in  sight  and  that the Bar, as a whole, must carry the  full  burden  of

pecuniary loss arising out of negligence or misconduct of its individual members

in order to maintain and enhance the trust and respect of the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compensation fund will be of particular assistance to many young men now

coming into the profession whose background is not publicly known, and whom  the

public  will  be  the readier to trust if they know that should their  trust  be

misplaced  they  can always seek redress from the compensation fund.  It  is  my

hope,  Sir,  that though the younger members of the Bar are the  ones  who  will

benefit  most by this provision, nevertheless the Bar Committee will see  to  it

that  there will be differential payments to the compensation fund in  order  to

assist junior members of the Bar in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>



their first few years when they may be unable to meet the full normal quota that

is expected of all of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to say, Sir, that I welcome the provisions for compulsory

and  exhaustive accounting by solicitors. Sir, it is a curious thing  that  many

members of the Bar, in common with most members of the public, loathe accounts.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> What about

accountants?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Many have but a sketchy idea of accounting. It is true that, this

will  help  accountants. But I am certain that the Government did not introduce

these  provisions to help the accountants. But these provisions, and I refer  to

sections  41A and 41B, are good in that they compel exhaustive accounting  under

the  supervision of professional accountants to avoid any possibility not merely

of  conscious  fraud,  Sir, which is very rare, but of innocent  mishandling  of

clients'  funds. I know that it would mean a certain expense to the  member  of

the  Bar and bear heavily again on the younger members who have recently  joined

the  profession  and who practise on their own. This additional  burden  can  be

heavy for this small group, but for the welfare of the profession as a whole  it

seems  to me that the provisions of sections 41A and 41B are essential  and  the

small  group of junior advocates and solicitors who are practising on their  own

must carry the additional burden.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am particularly delighted with the action of the Government in adverting to views expressed in respect of section 7A, the clause whereby Queen's

Counsel  are  permitted to come to Singapore' specifically for one case.  As  it

originally stood, Sir, that clause would have permitted Queen's Counsel to  come

at  will and pleasure. Very fortunately Sir, and I would like to say this; that

it is not a matter of professional jealousy cm the part of the Bar, but it is  a

matter  of reoognising that if the members of the Bar in Singapore are  deprived

of  the  opportunity of handling important cases, such deprivation can  have  an

effect on their own efficiency. I say, Sir, that I am



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>



indeed  glad  that,  by a fortuitous coincidence, there was a widely  publicized

case which went before the Chief Justice of the Federation of Malaya, himself an

expatriate, who nevertheless criticised any suggestion that Queen's Counsel  may

practise in the Federation as of right. I think it is important to read  it  and

to  recognise the good sense the Government showed in giving weight to the  view

expressed by the Chief Justice of the Federation and in seeking to amend  their

provisions to conform with a view which clarified the position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am reading from the Straits Times of the 5th of April, 1962 and the

heading  is: THE CHIEF JUSTICE ON 'OUTSIDE COMPETITTON'. It is dated from  Kuala

Lumpur and it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Justice, Dato Sir James Thomson, today dismissed an application by

an  eminent  Queen's Counsel to appear in a civil appeal here next week,  saying

that the legal profession here should enjoy a certain measure of protection from

competition from outside.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one stage of the hearing, Dato Sir James commented: "If all the cream is

taken  away  by members of the English Bar, there will only remain skimmed  milk

for local lawyers."'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a sense of consideration for the local Bar which does him credit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In his judgment, the Chief Justice said:

"The  application is made by a very eminent Queen's Counsel and it is admittedly

made for the purpose of coming to this country on a single occasion to appear in

a single case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to be noted that it is the first occasion since the setting up of a

judicial  system  of the modern type in this country that it  has  been  thought

necessary or desirable to make any such application.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, of course, aware that such applications have been made from time to time

in  the  former Straits Settlements and the State of Singapore, but this is  the

first occasion in the history of this country that such an application has  been

made."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dato Sir James said the application raised two difficult questions. In the

first place, the public interest had to he considered.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note, Sir, that that phrase has been utilised by the Government:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: "There is here a young, rising legal profession, and in the public

interest  it may well be that the profession should enjoy a certain  measure  of

protection from competition from outside.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For myself, I would not countenance for a moment, unless compelled to do so by

the strongest statutory requirement, any attempt to protect the local profession

simply and solely for the benefit of its members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be wrong in itself, and it would be contrary to the intention of

the  Statute which is clearly to be construed with an eye to one thing  and  one

thing only - and that is the public interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point, however, is whether it is not in the public interest, as distinct

from the individual interests of practitioners, that the profession should enjoy

a certain measure of protection."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dato Sir James added: "Again it would appear that, as between the profession

locally and the profession in England, there is no reciprocity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is to be a one-way traffic, the question arises whether that is

altogether consistent with the status of an independent country."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, we cannot claim that last element. But you will see, Sir, how

vigorously  he  came  out. A sense of justice, not merely  for  the  profession,

individuals, but for the stature of the profession and in the public interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note, Sir, that we do not exclude a Queen's Counsel completely.

I  am  sure no member of the Bar would seek that. But rather, we permit  Queen's

Counsel  to be admitted in the court's discretion, Sir, and not in that  of  any

administrative or Government officer - if it is in the public interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recognise, Sir, that in a State where there are, I understand, some

150  members of the Bar, there are certain aspects of the law which  are  rarely

adumbrated. I have in mind, for example, Sir, a case of two or three years back,

or  maybe a little more, where one oil company was claiming over $5 million from

another oil company in respect of deposits of oil which were taken over  by  the

Japanese.  Now, that was a particularly difficult case with overtones  of  international  law, the law of confiscation during the War, and in that case  it  was

quite  appropriate  that the Government itself should have had  Queen's  Counsel

from  England,  and  the  oil  companies concerned  themselves  engaged  Queen's

Counsel.  But,  Sir, you are not unconscious of other occasions  which,  if  not

frivolous,  and however important to the individuals concerned, were  not  of  a

character to require the presence of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>



eminent Queen's Counsel, since the issues involved were such as were dealt  with

daily  by members of the Bar locally. But because of the wealth of the parties,

Sir,  we  saw  not  one, or two, but teams from the English Bar  to  handle  the

issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not Queen's Counsel we want, except very rarely, and I am glad to

see  the provision made where on such occasions they can be admitted, but it  is

solicitors that we need, and that is why I have not moved, and I would  like  to

emphasise  it, will not as yet move, any amendment to this Bill to prevent  non-citizens of Singapore and Malaya from practising in Singapore. This should come,

Sir,  this  must  come,  but I will not seek to urge it until  I  am  completely

satisfied  that, in fact, we have from our University an adequate  supply  of

those  trained  of  a calibre such as those we have had the pleasure  of  seeing

graduate but recently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be my pleasure to support and vote for this Bill.



<br><br>11.09 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, this is indeed a very happy occasion. To be able to agree with

the Member for Anson on anything that he propounds in this Assembly has been one

of  my dearest wishes since he entered this Assembly. This evening, Mr Speaker,

we are completely at one. This is made doubly pleasurable when the Member for Anson  and I can agree completely and wholeheartedly with the Government. I wonder

if  such  occasions will occur in the future. I hope they do;  perhaps  after

merger, they might.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome the Bill and, if I may say so, I am in complete

agreement with its provisions. As the explanatory statement says, Mr Speaker:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This Bill amends the Advocates and Solicitors Ordinance to provide for the

more effective supervision of solicitors and solicitors'

accounts and the control of the employment of solicitors' clerks.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may be forgiven, I am myself a solicitor practising in

this country, and I do not object one bit to the more effective supervision that

is  being  imposed upon me and my firm and those like me who are  practising  in

Singapore.

I do not object to it, Mr Speaker, for this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>



reason: it is my good fortune to practise as a solicitor, and as a solicitor, it

is  my  duty and my privilege to uphold the rule of law in this country. Without

the  rule  of  law,  the  basic  foundation of our  system  of  government  will

disappear.  On  that basis, I am happy to be a solicitor and I am  happy  to  be

associated  in  the  maintenance of the rule of law. But  when  one  occupies  a

position  of privilege and, if I may say so, a position of power, that  position

necessitates that one does not exercise privilege and power wantonly, that there

must  be  curbs on that power. I am glad that these curbs are being  imposed  on

this  honourable profession in order that it might remain and continue to remain

and, if I may say so, occupy an even more honourable position in our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the other point which might be controversial and on which I

wish  to speak, is the question of admission of Queen's Counsel. I only recently

came  to understand that a part of the provision of this new section is  not  entirely  in accord with the wishes of the general members of the Bar. I was  only

informed  this  afternoon that during my absence from Singapore this  particular

provision  was  posed before the general meeting of the Bar Committee  and  they

felt  in  their  wisdom  that  the phrase "in the public  interest"  should  be

omitted.  I  am not in a position to know the reasons for that conclusion  which

the  meeting of the Bar came to. But as a Member of the Assembly, I am  speaking

more  in the general interest of the country and of the future of Singapore  in

relation  to the Federation. I would say that in all such matters, the Singapore

Bar  should work in unity with the Federation Bar, and I support this  provision

although  it would appear that I am at variance with my fellow practitioners  at

the Bar on the basis that in future the Singapore Bar and the Federation Bar, in

view of the political future of the two territories, should work together. I say

that  in  all  earnestness,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, because  the  Bar  is  intimately

connected with politics and because we are the upholders of the rule of law and,

without the rule of law, our political system cannot survive.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am delighted to hear the words of kindness



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>



that flowed from the Member for Anson for once in our lifetime.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> It will never happen again!



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are sagacious enough to know that it would be

useful for us to take these words at their mere face value.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is churlish.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the matter which the Member for Farrer Park

referred to just now, I was surprised to receive a note from the State Advocate-General this morning informing us that this particular provision of the Bill had

been  considered by the Bar Committee and that they were most dissatisfied  with

it.  And in the letter to the State Advocate-General from the Secretary of  the

Bar  Committee,  the  Bar  Committee referred the State  Advocate-General  to  a

resolution  approved  at a general meeting of the Singapore  Bar  held  on  28th

April,  1962, where the Member for Anson's amendment to include a proviso  after

the  words  "discretion",  "for special reasons  in  the  public  interest"  was

considered. He drew our attention to the fact that the proviso was defeated by a

majority  vote. But nevertheless, I think, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is necessary  in

all  these  matters  for  us to keep in line with the Federation,  and  I  think

despite  the views that the Bar Committee holds we would be acting appropriately

if we proceeded to enact this clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.-[Mr

Byrne].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.

intention, and the amendment makes the provision clear.
