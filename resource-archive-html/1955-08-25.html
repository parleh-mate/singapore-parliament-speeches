Speaker,  Sir,  in  view of Standing  Orders,  it

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on

Question - [24th August]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with

subsection  (3)  of  section 3  of  the  Emergency

Regulations Ordinance, 1948 (No. 17 of  1948),  as

amended  by  the Emergency Regulations (Amendment)

Ordinance,  1948  (No.  39  of  1948),   and   the

Emergency Regulations (Amendment) Ordinance,  1951

(No.  9 of 1951), adopts the Proclamation made  by

the  Governor in Council on the 16th day of  July,

1955,  and published as Notification No. S 199  in

the  Gazette Supplement No. 58 of 22nd July, 1955,

as  contained  in Sessional Paper No.  S.L.  23  of

1955,  prolonging for a further  period  of  three

months commencing the 22nd day of July, 1955,  the

period  specified in the Proclamation of Emergency

made on the 21st day of April, 1955, and published

as   Notification  No.  S  113  in   the   Gazette

Supplement No. 30 of 21st April, 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, having had the advantage of 12 hours to think

over what the Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode)

did  say, and what the Hon. the Chief Minister did

not  say, we, the People's Action Party,  do  not

think  that anything useful can be served at  this

moment by saying anything on this matter. We shall

reserve  our judgment until such time as  we  have

studied  the  improvements and  other  advantages

which this new legislation will introduce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot, of course, go so far with the Chief

Secretary as to vote for his motion. On the  other

hand,  we  would not wish to appear  unnecessarily

obstructive. We shall therefore abstain  until  we

see what he proposes to do.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Still cannot make up their minds!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with subsection

(3)  of  section  3  of the Emergency  Regulations

Ordinance, 1948 (No. 17 of 1948), as amended by the

Emergency Regulations (Amendment) Ordinance,  1948

(No. 39 of 1948), and the Emergency Regulations

published as Notification No. S 199 in the Gazette

Supplement No. 58 of 22nd July, 1955, as  contained

in Sessional Paper No. S.L. 23 of 1955, prolonging

for  a  further period of three months  commencing

<div align="center"><b>SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSEMBLY STAFF</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the motion

that stands in my name seeks the appointment of  a

Select  Committee with you as Chairman to consider

the   question  of  staffing,  both   as   regards

personnel  and  conditions of  service,  for  this

Assembly. I cannot do better, Sir, than  use  your

own  words, when discussing this matter  with  me,

when you said, "It is essential and desirable that

the fact that the Assembly staff is independent of

the  Government should be widely known and  should

be  absolutely obvious." I could not  agree  more,

Sir.   Although  we,  on  this  Bench,  have   the

privilege  and  the  honour  today  of  being  the

Government, we are also Members of this  Assembly,

and  we are acutely conscious of the necessity  of

this Assembly being absolutely independent of  the

Government  of the day, being able to control  its

own  staff  and  provide the necessities  that  it

deems   requisite  for  its  existence   and   its

proceedings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, Sir, there is no friction at all. No

one  can vouch for the future. At present all the

staff  are appointed by Government and are subject

to  General Orders. The motion that stands  in  my

name  seeks  the appointment of a Committee  which

will itself recommend the appointment of staff  as

regards  personnel, and which  it  is  hoped  will

produce a scheme, to be approved by this House, of

salaries, remuneration and conditions of  service,

so  that  this House will have employees, who  are

paid  through Government agency with its approval,

absolutely independent of Government control.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to move, Sir, the motion that stands in my

name, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Standing Order 62 be suspended to enable the

following motions to be made:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) That a Select Committee be appointed to

enquire    into,   report   upon,   and    make

recommendations in respect of the staff at  all

levels  in the employment of the Assembly,  the

methods of their appointment, their salaries and

terms  of  service, and generally  all  matters

relevant to the Assembly staff; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) That the Select Committee do consist of

the Speaker as Chairman and five Members to  be

nominated by the Committee of Selection.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> I

rise to second.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That Standing Order 62 be suspended

to  enable the other motions to be made." put, and

agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

consider  that this motion is a very  timely  one.

Having  had the privilege of serving in  the  last

Legislative Council. I have observed very  closely

the  volume  of work that the staff  of  the  then

Council   had  to  undertake.  After  the  general

elections, of course, the volume of that work  has

considerably increased, and I have also known  the

extent of the stress and strain that the staff has

to undergo in the discharge of their functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully associate with whatever the Chief

Minister  has expressed regarding the independence

of the staff, and I endorse his motion very whole-heartedly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, no one can

doubt  that this is a very important step forward.

It  is  not  only important because it  creates  a

completely  independent institution  separate  and

distinct from the Government, but it also marks  a

break  from the past, when the Colonial  Secretary

directed how things should be done by his  minions

in this House. He seconded someone from his office

and  appointed  him  Clerk of Councils,  and  this

person  had to do the bidding of the then Colonial

Secretary!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We welcome this move as the first step. It does

not  go  all the way to an independent Parliament,

but we shall be here pushing it until we have gone

the whole distance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> You did not push this!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

we welcome this step, and I think it is one in the

right direction and should have been done very

much earlier. Indeed it has our support because

the Assembly staff should all the time be neutral

and should all the time be serving the Assemblymen

in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) That a Select Committee be appointed to

enquire    into,    report    upon,    and    make

recommendations  in respect of the  staff  at  all

levels  in  the  employment of the  Assembly,  the

methods  of their appointment, their salaries  and

terms   of  service,  and  generally  all  matters

relevant to the Assembly staff; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) That the Select Committee do consist of the

Speaker  as  Chairman  and  five  Members  to   be

nominated by the Committee of Selection,



<br><br>put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) That a Select Committee be appointed to

enquire    into,    report   upon,    and    make

recommendations in respect of the  staff  at  all

levels  in  the  employment of the Assembly,  the

methods of their appointment, their salaries  and

terms  of  service,  and  generally  all  matters

relevant to the Assembly staff; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) That the Select Committee do consist of the

Speaker  as  Chairman  and  five  Members  to  be

nominated by the Committee of Selection.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE ESSENTIAL (AMENDMENT) REGULATIONS, 1955</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. J. Davies (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr E. J. Davies):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion standing in

my name on the Order Paper, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (2) of

section   3   of  the  Transfer  of   Powers   and

interpretation Ordinance, 1949 (No.  9  of  1949),

resolves  that the Singapore Essential (Amendment)

Regulations, 1955, published as Notification No. S

216  in  the  Gazette Supplement No.  65  of  13th

August, 1955, as contained in Sessional Paper  No.

S.L. 26 of 1955, be approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Essential Regulations originally passed

in  1945  have been kept alive for the purpose  of

enabling  the determination of a very  substantial

claim  for compensation by the major oil companies

arising out of the requisition



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>



of  stocks  of  oil  by  the  British  reoccupying

authorities.  The  claim is  being  heard  by  the

Compensation Board set up under those Regulations,

and the President of the Board, who is a Judge  of

the  Supreme  Court,  has made representations  to

Government  that  Regulation 54, which  refers  to

appeals  from  decisions of the Board,  should  be

clarified so as to ensure that there is  no  doubt

whatever as to the right of appeal by either party

to the dispute from the decision of the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very complicated issues of law, both

international and municipal, are involved, as well

as  a  considerable  sum of  money,  running  into

millions of dollars, and the dispute will probably

be  taken all the way to the Judicial Committee of

the Privy Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments which the Regulations make are

based on those provisions relating to appeals from

the  Income Tax Board of Review. They have had the

approval  of  the  President of  the  Compensation

Board  and the agreement of counsel on both sides.

In these circumstances, Sir, I would ask that this

Assembly approves of the Regulations.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> I

second  it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

Section   3   of  the  Transfer  of   Powers   and

216  in  the  Gazette Supplement No.  65  of  13th

August, 1955, as contained in Sessional Paper  No.

under  the  Heads  of Expenditure  and  for  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to obviate the need for an

introductory speech and to save the  time  of  the

Assembly,  a  brief explanation of  each  item  is

given  in  the Sessional Paper. Hon. Members  will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



note  that a full description has been given  of

<div align="center"><b>DETENTION OF MR. FONG SWEE SUAN AND MR. YONG KOK KIM</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the motion

which  stands in my name, namely,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House deplores the continued detention without trial of

Mr Fong Swee Suan, Secretary of the Singapore Bus

Workers' Union, and Mr Yong Kok Kim, President of

the Singapore Factory and Shop Workers' Union, and

considers   that  the  Government  should   either

release them or give them an opportunity to answer

the  Government's allegations against them in open

court,



<br><br>is  unique  in that it  has  achieved  its

purpose  before it has come to be debated!  It  is

therefore my singular pleasure with the  leave  of

the  House,  to  ask permission to  withdraw this

motion - unless,  of  course,  the  Chief  Minister

wishes us to debate the matter still?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I am at your disposal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Do I have the permission of the House, Sir?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>APPOINTMENT OF MORE ASSISTANT MINISTERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, over a

month ago the Press published an item on a move by

the  Chief  Minister  to  appoint  more  Assistant

Ministers. This immediately drew a great  deal  of

adverse criticism from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



public. I have met hundreds of people since then,

and  every  time I put the question to them  they

return   the  answer  'No'.  I  put  it  to   the

businessmen, and they are also of that opinion. I

have  talked it over with office workers,  clerks

and all, and they also come forward with the same

answer.  I  have even heard from  people  in  the

streets - hawkers    and   labourers - people    who

congregate  in  their usual  haunts,  say  coffee

shops, and the conclusion they have ever come  to

is always 'No'. That is the strong feeling of the

people   about   the  appointment  of   Assistant

Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the other section, we have the Press. They

are  also  fully  aware of  the  opinion  of  the

people, and I think everybody in this House knows

it.   They  criticise  this  move  of  the  Chief

Minister,  and  they support the opinion  of  the

people. In this one case, we can say that opinion

in  Singapore is unanimous. They are all  opposed

to  this  question  of  the appointment  of  more

Assistant Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From their accounts and from the views they have

aired,  the  people of Singapore  have  indicated

that this question is one of public interest and,

such being the case, should deserve the attention

of  the  Assembly. However, as a Member  of  this

House, I have received no official indication  of

this  matter  until  after  the  release  of  the

correspondence   between   His   Excellency   the

Governor  and  the Chief Minister. I  voice  this

because in a matter which the people of Singapore

believe   to   be   of  great   interest,   their

representatives in this Assembly should,  at  the

very least, be given first-hand information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we come on to another aspect of the

question.  If public opinion had been taken  into

consideration - and rightly so - then  this  question

of  Assistant Ministers would not have plunged us

into a constitutional crisis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What a pity that would have been!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> The Chief Minister during

the  debate on 18th August informed us  that  the

appointment of Assistant Ministers is a very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



minor   issue,   that  matters   concerning   the

constitution are of the first importance. I agree

with that and I think it should remain so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the constitutional crisis is over. We have

got  the answer from His Excellency the Governor,

and  we  have  had the answer to the first  three

parts   of   the   Resolution   concerning    the

interpretation of the constitution  given  us.  If

this matter of appointment of Assistant Ministers

were  to  be pushed, it would seem then that  the

Government side was using that as a lever to  get

what  it wanted. You will note in my motion  that

we  do  not  say that you must not,  you  cannot,

appoint Assistant Ministers. We say that  at  the

present  time it is undesirable, because it  will

give  the people of Singapore a thoroughly  wrong

impression, and it will put a thing  that  is  of

first importance in not too good a light.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would also like to draw the attention of hon.

Members of this House to the very small number of

elected  representatives. We have only 25 elected

Members, and this small number is divided between

those sitting on the Government side and those on

the  Opposition side. That leaves us a  Coalition

Government with a total of 13 elected Members, two

nominated and three official Members. We have  on

the Government side nine Ministers, one Assistant

Minister, and one Deputy Speaker. That leaves  us

with  only  seven  Government  Back-benchers.  If

another  four  Members were to  be  appointed  as

Assistant Ministers, then we would have  a  sorry

state  of  affairs where the Government has  even

less followers than leaders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is that not the case?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Should the threat of the

appointment  of  an Assistant Minister  to  every

Ministry  be carried out, then we would have  the

ludicrous  situation of the Government having  to

persuade at least one Member of the Opposition to

join  them and be made an Assistant Minister.  My

sincere  hope  is  that such a  situation  should

never  happen  and that Singapore should  not  be

made an object of ridicule to the world at large.

It is ridiculous.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again let us remember that of the nine

Ministers we have on the Government Benches, five

of  them  are always in the forefront  of  public

opinion.  They  are  in the forefront  of  public

opinion  by  virtue of the fact  that  they  were

elected  by  the  people.  In  the  eyes  of  our

neighbours, they are the people who are in charge

of  the  affairs of Singapore for the very  first

time. We do agree that their responsibilities are

great, perhaps greater than the official Members,

but  let  it  be  said that they are  responsible

people,  that they are not afraid of  hard  work,

that  they  are  not  afraid of  great,  or  even

greater work and responsibilities. Let it be said

that  they  can  discharge their responsibilities

ably   and  efficiently.  Any  attempt   to   add

Assistant  Ministers to these Ministries  without

extremely  good reasons will create an impression

that may not be favourable to us, the people  who

have a say in the affairs of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now since the subject of the appointment of

Assistant  Ministers was broached - and  it  was  a

short  while  back - we  remember  that  the  Chief

Minister in an address first said that it was one

of  necessity.  Later on we  had  another  Press

release  saying that it was one of training.  Now

we  agree  that our local people must be trained,

but   we   must  also  remember  that   Assistant

Ministers are not going to be our permanent civil

servants. They may not remain in the service  for

a long time. After receiving their training, they

may  not  come  back again. There  are  too  many

uncertainties.  But  let  us  be  generous  about

it - they   may  not  want  to  contest  any   more

elections; they may want to withdraw voluntarily.

Or  the people may get tired of all this play and

no  work,  and  they may not be  returned  again.

There  are  too many uncertainties. Public  money

must  be spent wisely. All the same, the cost  of

training  will  be very high. It  will  cost  the

taxpayer  $1,500  per month for  every  Assistant

Minister - $18,000   per  annum.   Four   Assistant

Ministers, if appointed, will cost us $72,000 per

annum. This figure will exceed $160,000 per annum

if  we  have  all  the  nine Assistant  Ministers

appointed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am thinking about this because the Chief

Minister,  during the elections, did promise  the

electorate  that  he  would  keep  the  cost   of

government down. That was not very long ago.  How

is   he   going  to  reconcile  this   with   his

electorate? This is a matter between him and  his

constituency. I would rather leave it at that!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose we even agree to the appointment of more

Assistant  Ministers - and we  say  that  it  is  a

matter of training - it must be admitted that most

of   us   here  are  new  to  this  business   of

government. We are all learners. If  you  put  an

Assistant Minister to be guided by another one as

fresh as the one appointed, it would appear to me

like  putting  a person, who is learning  how  to

drive  a  car,  under the care and  direction  of

another learner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now all these things do indicate to us that it

is  not  desirable at this very moment to appoint

Assistant Ministers. Perhaps after we have gained

a  little  bit  more experience and  we  have  an

enlarged  House, this question may be brought  up

again. So, Sir, on these grounds, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House is of opinion that the

appointment  of more Assistant Ministers  at  the

present time is undesirable.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

to  second the motion. The issue before us  is  a

perfectly  simple one even if recent events  have

tended to cloud it over. It is whether or not the

appointment   of   more   Assistant   or   Junior

Ministers, or Parliamentary Secretaries, will  be

conducive to better and more efficient government

within  the  context of the present  constitution

with   its   Assembly   of   32   Members.    The

constitutional question does not enter into  this

motion.  It  is purely a question of whether  the

present administration will be improved or not by

such appointments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I suggested in this House previously, can it

really  be desirable that in a Government  of  18

Members, there should be 14 posts - four additional

Assistant  Ministers being the original issue - and

if  you  like  to  include the  unpaid  posts  of

Government  Whip and Deputy Speaker, 16  or  half

this House;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



and  would  this be desirable even if  the  Chief

Minister   could  call  on  all  the  talent   in

Singapore  to pick from? We are not convinced  on

this point, nor are we convinced - and this is  the

real   issue - that  it  will  result   in   really

efficient government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the proper functions of Ministers?

Surely  these do not and need not go beyond  the

dictation  of policy, the control of  policy  and

the  issuing  of  directives to  see  that  their

policy  is carried out by the departments through

the  Permanent Secretaries? I will grant that  it

may take three months, or even six months, for  a

new  Minister to find this out and find his feet,

but  after that, he should be on top of his  job.

The  fact of the matter is that there are now two

men  at  the  top - the Minister and the  Permanent

Secretary - to   drive   the   machinery   of   the

department,  instead of one as before.  Assistant

Ministers would make it three instead of one, and

anyone  who  knows anything about  administration

surely  knows that too many men at the  top  mean

bottlenecks  and  delay,  or  contradictions  and

confusion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what are the Assistant Ministers functions

to   be?  They  cannot  take  full  charge  of   a

department,  as  they  must always  refer  to  the

Minister,  who  is responsible to the  Council  of

Ministers for the policy laid down by him. If they

are  to  be  understudies, then they are  to  gain

experience  from  those who themselves  are  still

learning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, however, a clue, and a very disturbing

clue,  in a statement the Chief Minister made  to

the  Press  sometime ago stating his reasons  for

wanting  Assistant Ministers.  His  third  reason

apparently  was to strengthen his hold  over  the

non-domiciled  civil service to ensure  that  his

new  policies are carried out. Now the Press  may

have misquoted him, and I am sure my hon. Friend

will  correct me if I am wrong, but I  understand

that  to  mean, firstly, that expatriate officers

are  not loyally carrying out the policies of the

Government, and secondly, the Assistant Ministers

are   intended  to  be  bearers  from  the  Chief

Minister  of  directives on policy in departments

in   which  the  Chief  Minister  has  no  direct

control. The first is a very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>



serious allegation to make. Even if it were true,

have the officers, in fact, been given any policy

to  carry out? We on this side of the House  have

seen no signs that the Government has a policy in

very many matters, in matters of great importance -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Such as?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> The second, -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Such as?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> - if true, is hardly flattering to the

Chief   Minister's   own   fellow-Ministers.   If

interference  is at the root of the matter,  then

it  is  better that the Ministers should be  left

free  to get on with their jobs rather than  have

expensive  recourse to Assistant  Ministers  with

their  salaries, plus the extra expense of  their

offices, office staff, Permanent Secretaries, and

the rest of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far I have only referred to the Ministries

which    were    mentioned   in   the    official

correspondence between the Governor and the Chief

Minister,  that is to say, those four  Ministries

to  which  it was originally intended  to  attach

Assistant  Ministers. But it may be that  finding

that this was not a popular move in more quarters

than one that the Government has been looking for

a  way out, and it has been re-reading the Rendel

Report  with  its reference to the fact  that  an

Assistant   Minister  might   be   appointed   to

understudy  the  Financial  Secretary,  with  its

logical   extension  to  the   other   ex-officio

portfolios. Now if the Rendel Report is to be our

Bible -  and it seems to be very much  less  of  a

Bible  than  it  was a few weeks  ago  when  this

motion was first tabled - there might be something

in  this  argument,  on two conditions:  firstly,

that  there are men of the highest qualifications

on   the  Government  side  today  available   to

understudy   one   or  more  of   these   onerous

portfolios; secondly, that they would, in fact, he

trained  with a view to their taking  over  these

portfolios  in the near future. I  do  not  think

that  these  conditions can be fulfilled  at  the

present time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue before us, therefore, is

this:  Will the Assistant Ministers' appointments

produce a more efficient administration? If hon.

Members think that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



they  will  not - I have given reasons to show  that

they  are  ill-conceived - then they must  vote  in

favour  of  this motion. If the Chief Minister  is

still  seriously  considering the appointments  of

Assistant  Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries,

whichever you like to call them, I would  ask  him

to  ponder once more in all seriousness: Will  the

Government, which is almost all Front  Bench  with

no  Back-benchers,  be  a satisfactory  democratic

government? Will it not suffer from a lack of self-criticism?  Will it not be rather too  subservient

to  the  policies of the Chief Minister, resulting

in  autocratic  and  not  democratic  methods,   a

tendency  which we of the Progressive  Party  have

criticised in the past with real concern?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> When you were in power?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> If the ways of democracy are to be

established  on this island, they  must  not  only

flourish,  but be seen to flourish. The  next  nine

months,  which  must be months of  calm  and  good

sense  if  full confidence is to be restored,  are

the  testing  time.  I  speak  with  the  greatest

sincerity when I say that we, in this part of  the

House,  would  be the more inspired  to  make  the

fullest  contribution to that calm and good  sense

in  the  coming months if the Chief Minister  will

be,  as we think it, far-sighted enough to eschew

making appointments which, I am convinced, in  the

unbalance  of  the Government Benches  they  would

cause,  may  do  untold  harm  to  the  democratic

institutions which it should be our first  concern

at this stage to foster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I rise to support the motion before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a small island of only about 230

square miles -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> All man-made.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> - not 90 square miles as the

Chief    Minister   yesterday   by   mistake    - [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> - said. It has only a

population  of  1,200,000,  one-thirtieth  part  of

Calcutta, our nearest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>



city. Up to the time of the election, the cost  of

running  the  government was 53 to  55  per  cent,

which is indeed very, very high.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, after the election, you have Ministers

with   their  salaries,  their  staff  with  their

salaries,  with  their  entertainment   plus   the

expenses of cameramen to give them publicity! Sir,

this all adds to the cost from the revenue. How is

it  to be met? I have said on many occasions  that

we  have  got  no natural resources. To  meet  the

cost,  we will have to find a way to increase  the

revenue,  which will be a burden not only  to  the

rich, but also to the poor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before this Government came into power, or

before  the election, we had hon. Members  of  the

Legislative   Council  who   did   the   work   of

legislation   and   also   ran   the    Government

departments. Those gentlemen are now the Permanent

Secretaries, and they are very efficient men. They

are  not to do any legislative work now, but their

whole  time is to be devoted to carrying  out  the

policies laid down by the Ministers. When you have

got  such  efficient men at the helm to carry  out

the  policies  of  the  Ministers,  where  is  the

necessity of having further Assistant Ministers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Labour Front we have ten elected

Members. Out of them, four are Ministers  and  one

is  an Assistant Minister. I do not count the Hon.

the  Minister  for Communications and  Works  (Mr

Francis  Thomas) because he is a nominated Member.

He  is  sitting  there  at  the  pleasure  of  the

Government. If the Government falls, he also falls

too;  so  I  do  not count him at  all.  So,  five

elected  Labour Front Members have got,  should  I

say,  jobs,  or  should I say, Ministerial  posts,

then  only  five are left. Out of  them,  two  are

recommended  to be Assistant Ministers,  according

to  the  correspondence between the Chief Minister

and  His  Excellency which has been circulated  to

us - one  to  be drawn from the Opposition  and  one

from  the  Alliance. In other words, out  of  ten,

seven  Labour  Front  elected  Members  will  have

Ministerial posts if they are nominated.  This  is

very  ridiculous - out of ten, seven  getting  jobs,

three as Back-benchers. Why is this being done?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have here the Progressive Party, very

long  and  well established. Here  you  have  got

another   very  big  Party  called  the  P.A.P. - a

regular  Party.  Then you have got  the  U.M.N.O.

Alliance. They are all regular Parties, having  a

paying  membership,  having  regular  monthly  or

yearly meetings, and having their own offices. In

other  words,  these Parties are  run  on  proper

party lines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now take the Labour Front Party. What is it? Is

it a Party? If I may be allowed to quote, a Press

digest  dated  16th July, 1955, of  a  vernacular

newspaper - it is the Tamil Murasu, a Tamil  paper,

Sir. I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Chief Minister of Singapore has explained

and  given  his reasons for attempting to  appoint

four   Assistant  Ministers,  but  none  of  these

reasons  seems to be satisfactory to  anyone.  The

argument  that  the  administration  of  Singapore

could  be  carried on effectively  only  with  six

Ministers and five Assistant Ministers is  not  an

appropriate one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Differences of opinion existed within the Labour

Front, even the Ministers chosen for the Council

of  Ministers. The Chief Minister may deny  this,

and  say that all is well with the Labour  Front,

but  those who are aware of the condition of  the

Labour Front would not accept this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the work of the Labour Front was a

complicated affair. The leaders of the Party have

no  opportunity  to  do the things  which  would

establish the Party in a proper manner. Even they

could not answer the question whether or not  the

Party has developed and taken its full shape."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, this is the position: here is the

Labour Front Party in coalition with the Alliance

running the government, and in order to keep  the

Party members together - if this is an insinuation,

Sir, I am willing to withdraw it.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the hon. Member imputing

improper motives?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I will tell a few home truths about him!



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> I will be very happy -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Now, Sir, it is, I think, not

very wise to keep the Party together -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I object to that, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> I withdraw it, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I ask that he immediately

withdraw  it  and  that an  apology  be  made  in public -



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> I withdraw it, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> - and that I be given the

right to reply to the filthy and malicious

things that this gentleman across the floor has

been indulging in in respect of my Party in the

past.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I have your point of order, Mr

Chief Minister? I take it your point of order  is

that  you  are objecting to the Member for  Telok

Ayer imputing improper motives?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Malicious imputations, and I

ask for a full apology - not a withdrawal, but an

apology - or that I be given the right to -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I just proceed, Mr Chief

Minister?  The point of order is whether  or  not

the  Member  for  Telok Ayer  has  been  imputing

improper   motives.  As  I   indicated,   I   did

anticipate that he was coming very near  the  bar

and he, in fact, did over-step the bar. I ask him

to withdraw his statement unqualifiedly.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I bow to the Chair's

decision.  Yes, Mr Thomas, any point  of  order? [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Sir, I cannot help recollecting -

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order, Mr Thomas?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker. This infringement

by  the  Member for Telok Ayer (Mr R.  Jumabhoy)

has  been  repeated  and deliberate.  It  is  not

accidental. You can see that he was going to make

insinuations, as he has done continually  in  the

past. I do not know what point, Mr Speaker,  you

are -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is hardly a point of order, Mr

Thomas.  It is just drawing my attention  to  the

conduct of a Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Member for Telok Ayer please withdraw

his   statement   and   refrain   from   imputing

improper -



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, apart from -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member please sit

down? I have not finished! I would like some order

in  this  House.  When  I am standing,  no  Member

should  stand. That is quite clear under  Standing

Orders.  I  was  saying,  will  the  hon.   Member

undertake   not  to  continue  imputing   improper

motives  to any Member of this House in connection

with this motion?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I bow to the Chair's wish.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not impute any bad motives

against a person. Rather I was attacking a  Party,

but   still,  if  you  think,  Sir,  that  it  was

improper, I do withdraw without any qualification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, this is the state of the Party position

in  this  House: that out of ten elected  Members,

five  are  already there, excluding the hon.  Mr

Thomas, and if two more posts are created -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the hon. Member take a

seat?  He  is,  in fact, forgetting  his  Standing

Orders. No Member shall refer by name to any other

Member.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, he is a nominated Member. I

would request you to clarify it.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Oh, I beg the hon. Member's pardon!

Yes, he is a nominated Member.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, it is not in the interests

of  good  government, this idea  of  one  or  more

Assistant  Ministers  to be  appointed.  I,  as  a

taxpayer, would say it is highway robbery  of  the

public purse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, coming to the question, if a vote is

taken, I am sure the interested persons should not

be   allowed  to  vote  whose  names  are  already

mentioned in the correspondence between the  Chief

Minister and His Excellency. Also I hope the three

official  Ministers, that is the Chief  Secretary,

the  Financial Secretary and the Attorney-General,

will abstain from voting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, continuing further on this subject,

Singapore  before  the war was controlled  by  one

Governor,   whose   jurisdiction   included    the

territory  of  the  Federated  States  of  Malaya,

Penang and Malacca. We had Pan-Malayan departments

with less officers and our cost was less.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> The population was less.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> The population might have

increased,  say, by about 300,000 to 400,000, but

it  suited  Whitehall, for reasons best  known  to

them,  to  divide  this territory  into  two  with

separate  departments  and with  separate  staffs.

This is a burden on the taxpayer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, under the Rendel Constitution, nine

Ministers and three officials have been mentioned,

but  is there any necessity for a small city  like

Singapore  to  have nine Ministers  to  administer

this  Colony, with a population of only 1,200,000?

It  could  very  well be done  by  three  or  five

Ministers  instead of nine, but we  cannot  change

the  Rendel Constitution at present; but those who

say  they work for the Colony, or for the  voters,

or  for the people of Singapore, should not add to

the  cost.  They  should look at other  countries.

There  they  have  Ministers who  have  their  own

income or who live in a very modest way. They draw

no  salary;  or even if they draw a  salary,  they

give  it  back to the revenue. Now,  this  is  the

position: if Singapore is to develop in  a  proper

way,  I  think  an example should be  set  by  the

Ministers or the Government in power that they  do

not further draw on the purse of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Sir, there is one surprising

misunderstanding - I see the Member for  Telok  Paku

is running away -!



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> On a point of order, Sir. It is

very  surprising that a Minister cannot  and  does

not   remember  what  one  particular   ward   one

represents;  It  is  not  Telok  Paku - revise  your

geography!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I do apologise to the Member

for Telok Ayer - water, not a nail! As a businessman

or  as  any organiser, he must be aware  that  the

size of an organisation is not necessarily related

to the number of people it serves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a simple example which occurs to me as a

schoolmaster.  If you have only one  student,  he

cannot learn unless you have a teacher. Even  one

student would need a teacher, although that  same

teacher  can teach 10 students or 20  or  30:  in

Singapore, I regret to say 40, which is too  many;

but  the  fact remains that if you are  going  to

have any teaching at all, you have got to have  a

teacher,  and  if your school is  going  to  have

several  teachers,  you  have  got  to   have   a

principal  in charge of them. You will  seek,  no

doubt,  to  have an appropriate number of  pupils

per  teacher,  but  if  you  are  going  to  have

teachers,  you must have them and you  cannot  run

the  school  without them. In the same  way,  the

fact  that Singapore has a small population  does

not mean that, therefore, you have not got to see

to  the  work that has got to be done. The office

work   remains  substantially  the  same  without

regard to the actual size of the territory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion was made by one speaker from the

Opposition  that the Permanent Secretaries  could

do  most  of  the work and the Ministers  confine

themselves  to  thinking  out  present  plans  of

policy  and  then  saying, 'Permanent  Secretary,

will  you please carry this out for me?' and then

I  suppose go home for a cup of tea! It does  not

work  like that at all. It is not in the least  a

matter  of merely saying, 'We would like  you  to

know this is our policy and will you now carry it

out  for  us?'  That would not  be  a  democratic

process  at  all. There is a very great  deal  of

office work. I cannot possibly describe it to you

in  detail, but I would suggest you come and look

at my office sometime and see the number of files

that  I  have to pass across my desk. Apart  from

the  formulation of policy, there is an  enormous

bulk  of  routine work that has to go across  the

Minister's    desk   because   he   is    finally

responsible. It is perfectly impossible  to  say,

'I   will  sign  everything  that  the  Permanent

Secretary  puts before me, without  reading  it.'

Take   an   example  in  my  own  Ministry.   Air

Navigation  Orders have to be revised.  What  you

see  at  the  end  is a sheet or  so  of  Gazette

Notification, but what, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>



fact, have passed across my desk are four or five

bulky  files dating back to pre-war and recording

massive  memoranda  from the International  Civil

Aviation  Organisation  and  the  interpretations

adopted elsewhere. A tremendous bulk of stuff has

to  be  studied which has very little to do  with

the  formulation of policy but is merely  routine

work. The more the routine work fills the time of

the  Minister, the less time he obviously has  to

devote  to,  what you very rightly  say, is  his

basic  duty, the formulation of policy  which  is

based on discussions, investigations and study at

very considerable length.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to refer also to a

misunderstanding  by  another   Member   of   the

Opposition  who  seems to  have  been  trying  to

conduct a sort of Gallup Poll at cocktail parties

and  in  the coffee-shops of Singapore. He  comes

back  with  a statement that hundreds  of  people

have  all  agreed with him. Now, that  calls  for

comment  indeed, considering the  people  he  has

selected to speak to, where everyone agrees  with

him. I am going to say that a Gallup Poll is  not

a  thing  which you can conduct on the  basis  of

cocktail parties and coffee-shops, or even  going

round  labourers'  lines. It is a  scientifically

conducted  survey which must be done  by  people

who  are  known to be impartial and  who  take  a

proper  segment of the population on a scientific

basis  of  selection. No weight whatever  can  be

attached  to going round talking to your  friends

and  finding that they agree with you - they  would

not be your friends if they did not.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  cannot see my way clear to support the  motion

before this House. It is unrealistic. To me,  the

motion savours of betrayal of the true intentions

of the Progressive Party and should not have been

tabled  at  all.  The motion states  that  it  is

undesirable  to appoint more Assistant  Ministers

at the present time. I repeat these words 'at the

present time'. May I ask the Member for Serangoon

(Mr  Lim  Choon Mong), when will it be desirable

to appoint more Assistant Ministers?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> When the Progressives are in

power!



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> He will perhaps say, 'When the

Progressive   Party  is  in  power, of   course.'[Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> On this issue, my Party's

position  has  always been that the  Labour  Front

Coalition Government as yet has not presented  its

case  to the people and to the Assembly as to  the

necessity    of    more    Assistant    Ministers.

Furthermore,  the  people and the  Assembly  would

also  like  to know more about the qualifications,

probity,  etc, of  the persons proposed  for  the

position of Assistant Ministers. It is surely  not

enough   to   ask  us  to  accept   any   proposed

appointments only on such ground, that it  is  for

the      purpose     of     giving     the     men

experience - experience at the  taxpayers'  expense?

Surely, a better case can still be put forward?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, Sir, I would remind Government

to  safeguard the interests of the people  at  all

times,  as  far  as  possible, in  regard  to  the

question of spending public money. I would suggest

that,  if necessary, an All-Party Committee should

be  set up to review and consider the question  of

the appointment of Assistant Ministers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the debate

on  this  motion is an anti-climax. Sir, one  month

back   it   sparked   off  an  extremely   unhappy

situation, and it is a real pleasure to be able to

come this morning and talk lightly on these things

because  the Hon. the Chief Minister is a man  who

never  takes anything lightly, not even the Member

for  Telok  Ayer  (Mr  R.  Jumabhoy)!  Sir,  this

Assembly gets curiouser and curiouser day by day -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> And you know it!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, when the election results

were  first  known,  we, in  the  People's  Action

Party,  stretched  ourselves and  said:  "Ah!  Ten

Labour Fronters of doubtful cohesive qualities,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>



3    U.M.N.O.-M.C.A.-Malay   Union   Alliance,   4

Progressives,   2   Democrats,   3    P.A.P.,    3

Independents. What a magnificent combination!  All

the magnificent ingredients for a French Chamber!"

By  the time this Assembly has run its full  life,

every  Member  will  have become  Chief  Minister!

Everyone  of  us will have had the privilege  of

wearing a bush-jacket!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if no great harm would come to Singapore or

to Malaya, we, the People's Action Party, would be

only too glad to assist the personal ambitions and

aspirations of succeeding Members of this House to

occupy the comfortable seat of Chief Minister.  He

is  now occupying an office with note-paper!  There

was  no  note-paper before. If you get in  an  even

more  virile and vigorous Chief Minister, he  will

have,  his  note-paper embossed with the  Arms  of

Singapore!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the only trouble is that it does matter to

the  people of Singapore. It does matter  to  them

that  this  democratic process  should  not  fail,

because,  as one gentleman put it to me,  "We  are

playing for keeps." If we could just have fun  and

games for four years and go back again to where we

were  and  again start with zest, enthusiasm,  and

robust  speeches under apple-trees, then  no  harm

would come of it. But time never goes back, and at

the  end of the four years ... if this Assembly  lasts

four years - but nobody knows how long it will last.

Not  even the Chief Minister, because one  of  the

things  on  which the Governor need not  take  his

advice  is whether he should dissolve or  prorogue

this  Assembly. So, our Chief Minister is at  this

disadvantage in that he cannot determine  the  end

of this Assembly. From the election point of view,

that is a matter of no small importance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as I said, this debate is really an anti-climax. When the history of Singapore comes to be

written    in   some   leisurely   and   scholarly

university,  where there are men fed  and  clothed

and intelligent enough to look up the archives  of

some  dusty journal called the M.M. Magazine, they

will  find  out  how  it  was  that  the  personal

ambitions  and  political  aspirations   of   four

curious  gentlemen  sparked off  a  constitutional

crisis and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



ended  up  with  an advancement - a  small  one - but,

nevertheless,  a  real advancement  towards  self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. the Minister for Communications and

Works  (Mr  Francis Thomas) does not  accept  the

Member for Serangoon's finding or his analysis  of

public  opinion, his Gallup Poll.  I  am  glad  he

mentioned   cocktail  parties   and   coffee-shops

because -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I do not have cocktails too

often!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Obviously, Mr Speaker, Sir, our

friend  the  Member  for  Serangoon  selects   his

cocktail parties with great care!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Chief Minister and his

colleagues that, whilst we all want him to get  on

with  the job, we feel that perhaps a little  more

thought  should be given to whom he should  choose

to  get  on with the job. As my friend the  Member

for Tiong Bahru (Mr William Tan) has said, it  is

advisable   that   we  should  have   a   thorough

investigation into the - what was it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Probity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - probity - I would not like to

choose another word -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is

an  hon.  Member entitled to make allegations  and

insinuations about the probity of a Member of this

House?  If  he  is, I should like  to  return  the

compliment!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I was just on the point of

saying  that I would not go beyond what my  friend

said because my friend was in order, and I do  not

like  to  be  out  of  order,  Perhaps  the  Chief

Minister  may not like the inflection of my  voice

in  the microphone. Be that as it may, what  I  am

saying is this: If we want to get on with this job

of government, it is important that we should have

men who will get on with the job. On this question

of  the - shall we use a neutral word? - it is so very

difficult  to use a neutral word when one  is  not

neutral  in  these  matters,  but  if  one   could

say - suitability  of the applicants  for  Assistant

Ministerships, if they are men



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



with  drive, with initiative and with imagination,

then  we,  on this side of the House,  would  say,

"Good  for  the Chief Minister and  good  for  his

Government! Now let us see what can be done."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we share the hesitations and doubts not only

of  the coffee-shops and the cocktail-parties.  We

can  assure the Chief Minister and his friend  the

hon.  Mr Francis Thomas - that, perhaps, experience

in   attap  dwellings  does  not  make  a  Housing

Minister? - that  a more substantial  understanding,

grasp and capacity for work are necessary to  make

a good Assistant Minister. If one of the gentlemen

who has been named is appointed, then an even more

curious  situation will develop. As I see it  now,

it  is  a symmetrical row of two seats of eighteen

Members  elected  or otherwise on  the  Government

side. It is proposed to remove one Member from our

side  of  the House and put him on the  Government

side of the House -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is

perhaps going away from the motion itself. It just

says  "That  this  House is of  opinion  that  the

appointment  of  more Assistant Ministers  at  the

present time is undesirable." The motion does  not

say that Mr So and So should be appointed. It  is

a  question  of the appointment of more  Assistant

Ministers  at the present time, whoever  they  may

be.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am deeply

obliged  to you for reminding me of the  words  of

the motion. In so far as it is possible to discuss

this   question   of  four  Assistant   Ministers,

divorced  from  the  context  in  which  it   was

presented  to  this  House. I  shall  scrupulously

avoid  any indication of persons and personnel. We

all know, however, what reception this proposal  of

the  four Assistant Ministers got, not because the

appointment of four Assistant Ministers was  wrong

but  because  it is not advisable to do  what  the

Chief Minister wanted to do at that time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, having said that, in case it is

misunderstood  that I am in any way supporting  my

friend the Member for Serangoon, let me go  on  to

say  what  the  Chief  Minister  now  should  feel

happier



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



to  hear:  if  he  feels  that  it  is  essential,

whatever  the  reasons - Party unity or  some  other

frivolous  reasons - that have been put  forward  by

the  Member for Telok Ayer, if it is going to make

his  Government  function and deliver  the  goods,

then let him do it. We do not wish to prejudge his

requirements. We are not in a position to know  as

intimately as he does the difficulties -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Very nice!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, we are not altogether

unreasonable men at all times. The Chief  Minister

must  understand - I always hope  that  one  day  he

will - that the fact that we disagree with him does

not mean that we disagree with him all the time on

all  the issues - but only some of the time on  some

of  the issues on which he is quite wrong. Sir, if

4,  or  5,  or  6,  or  7, or 8,  or  9  Assistant

Ministers would make his experiment in working and

revising the Rendel Constitution succeed  and  not

collapse,  then let it cost $72,000 per annum,  let

it  even  cost $200,000 per annum. Does it matter,

if  we  can make this Government produce  results?

And it is results that the Chief Minister has  to

produce,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, at  the  end  of  two

years, or  three years, or four years. They  have

then to go back to the people and say - on our side,

of course, we are in a happier position of saying,

"Ah,  but we told you so!" But we will be fair  to

him;  and  when he goes back (if not to Cairnhill,

perhaps  to  some  other part of the  island)  and

tells  them that, as Chief Minister, not only  has

he  advertised the suitability of the bush-jacket,

but he has also produced 5,000, 10,000, 20,000  or

100,000  more housing units; that he  has  put  up

five new hospitals in five districts; that he  has

built 5,000 miles more roads, by-lanes and all the

other  things; that he has put up more standpipes;

that he has laid out all those amenities that make

life  worth  living; if all that can  be  done  by

paying  another $72,000 per annum, what does  this

little sum of money matter?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must get these things in perspective. We must

understand why some Members in this Assembly  have

objected,  some Members have abstained,  and  some

Members have supported Assistant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



Ministerships but are at the same time, critical.

Unless we understand that, then this Assembly is

going to become more and more an Alice in Wonderland -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Hello, Alice!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I would have thought that

if  there was anything facetious at all about  it,

it  would  have  been  that  the  Hon. the  Chief

Minister  acknowledges that he is  in  Wonderland!

May  I  remind him, after everything is  said  and

done, that he himself, not so very long ago, had a

few qualms? He came to this House and said, "If  I

get this constitutional crisis resolved - and it is

a  question  of principle on which I am fighting - I

am  quite  prepared to forego this  question.  The

minor point of the four Assistant Ministers - "



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a point of information,

Sir,  I  never said that. I said: "If  I  get  the

principle   acceded  to,  I  will   reconsider - not

forego."  There  is  a  distinction  there,  which

should be obvious particularly to a legal mind.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, may I say this: that in

the  context  and  in the circumstances  in  which

those  words  were said, 'reconsider'  could  only

mean reconsider and arrive at some decision other

than  the  one he had already arrived  at. It  is

important  that,  on  this issue,  he  should  not

misjudge  popular feeling. We would saw  that,  in

principle,  there  is nothing wrong  with  it.  In

fact,  there is nothing wrong in getting  on  even

with  nine  Assistant Ministers if that will  make

the  Government succeed. The fact that this  House

is  so  small,  as  we have been reminded  by  the

Member for Tanglin (Mr John Ede), was because  of

the  doings of his friends who arranged that  this

House should be small. At the time it was done, we

all  said that it was foolish and impractical, but

in those days there were men in power steeped in a

different  tradition. They were only in favour  of

self-government or any political advance in so far

as  it suited their personal ends. So far as  they

could  see,  their personal ends would  have  been

advanced suitably in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



a  little  Assembly where they  were  all  friends

together  and where they all got on well together.

They  quarrelled about the little things and  they

agreed on all the big things, such as helping each

other get on in life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the position has now changed. It is no

longer a question of a political Party gaining the

ascendancy  for  party  kudos  and  for   personal

advancement. We are confronted - the People's Action

Party is proud of having played a part in creating

this  new  condition - with a  real  challenge:  you

either  make democracy work or you perish!  It  is

because  we  want to make democracy work  that  we

tell  the  Chief Minister today, "If he  feels  he

needs  these men, we wish him well, let  him  have

them."  But  it  is also because we  want  him  to

succeed  that  we ask him to reconsider,  at  this

moment - I  use my words advisedly - "the advisability

of  proceeding  with something which,  rightly  or

wrongly may be misconstrued by a large section  of

the  population". But he is the best judge of  his

own  needs.  There  is  no question  of  principle

involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall definitely not support this motion and,

in  case  it  is misconstrued, we shall  also  not

oppose it. But that does not mean we have not made

up our minds. If any part of this House knows what

is  happening,  what is going  on,  where  we  are

going, and how we have made our minds up, it is my

colleagues and I on this side of the House. I hope

the  Chief  Minister - I always keep on  hoping - will

become more circumspect and more -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> The only place I know you

are going is outside!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - but let him decide carefully.

If  he  wants  it, let him have it,  but  it  must

succeed. That is the acid test.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Assistant Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one is

always  kept  wondering in  this  House  with  the

Member  for Tanjong Pagar. One does not know  what

attitude he is going to take -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Because one has not got

original principles - that is why!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> However, Sir, it is indeed

very  sad  that  some  people  are  incapable   of

thinking  straight. They would like us to  believe

that, with every move of the Government, there  is

something sinister behind it. Sir, Press  cuttings

have been read out to us this morning -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It is all in the family!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> - that would seem to indicate

that the Labour Front and the Coalition Government

are  going to fall apart. Sir, in fact, it is even

possible  that some people may be having too  much

of  wishful thinking and may come to believe  that

that  is the truth, but I am sorry for them.  They

are in for a very rude shock. We are not going  to

oblige them by falling apart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon

Mong)  has  pleaded  with us on  the  ground  that

Singapore  will be ridiculed in the  eyes  of  the

world.  Sir,  Singapore was very nearly  ridiculed

last  week when the Opposition walked out of  this

Assembly  and failed to carry out their duties  as

honourable  representatives of the public  in  the

debate before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Opinion in Singapore is unanimous against the

appointment  of  Assistant  Ministers",  says  the

Member  for Serangoon, and he goes on to say  that

public   opinion  should  have  been  taken   into

consideration. Who is and what is public  opinion,

Sir?  Who tells the Member of public opinion? Sir,

I  contend  that we, who sit here in  this  House,

represent  public opinion, and public  opinion  is

reflected through us in this Assembly -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Just you wait till the next

election!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> - unless, of course, when he

talks   of   public  opinion, he  means  backseat opinion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Serangoon has lamented the

fact  as  to  how we can produce in such  a  small

House the requisite number of Assistant Ministers.

Sir,  we  have to thank him and his Party for  the

size  of  this House. The Rendel Constitution  was

tailored by them to suit their own needs. Probably

they  thought  that they could not produce  enough

talent to fill more seats, and so they kept it  to

a very low figure; as the Member for Tanjong Pagar

said - a  cosy  gathering  that  would  quarrel  amongst

themselves but still get along.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, the Member for Serangoon says that

the  Press has been against it and that the  Press

are fully aware of the opinion of the people. That

is  wrong. The Press are not aware of the  opinion

of the people. If they were, they would be sitting

in  this  House in your seats, The Press do  guide

public  opinion  according to what their  backseat

drivers  want them to. Some sections of the  Press

have always been interested parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one cannot help feeling that no real

argument has been advanced against the appointment

of   more  Assistant  Ministers.  The  Member  for

Serangoon  mentioned  training  and  he  dwelt  at

length  on  public money being spent  on  training

when  one never knows whether these Ministers will

be returned in the next election. I say, Sir, that

the  more people you train, the more chances there

are  that  at least some of them will be returned.

Probably  he  does not want that - I think  he  does

not.  Anyhow, Sir, as I see it, no valid  argument

has   been  put  before  this  house  against  the

appointment  of  Assistant  Ministers  except  the

wishful  thinking  that there should  be  no  more

Ministers,



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very much

involved  in  this, but I am now  speaking  as  an

elected  Member of this Assembly without  fear  or

favour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel, Sir that we have wasted much time in

debating this motion. We all have our own work  as

representatives in our own divisions, and if I had

been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>



relieved  half an hour ago, I feel  that  I  would

have done a good job by helping my constituency in

some measure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first instance, I feel that this motion

is   quite  unparliamentary  because  it   is   an

anticipated  one. Normally, people who  understand

party  government will wait for the Government  to

bring  in a motion, or bring in a financial  vote,

for the appointment of the Assistant Ministers and

their  salaries. Members opposite would  naturally

take that opportunity to attack the Government  on

the measures against it. We would then all have  a

greater  opportunity  of hearing  from  the  Chief

Minister  his valid arguments for the  appointment

of  these Ministers. As such, Sir, I believe  that

this  motion is a very hasty one and it has spoilt

all the taste of a very interesting debate yet  to

come.  Actually, Sir, the mover has put  the  cart

before the horse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the debate, I listened to an hon.

Member   who   said  that,  in  the   past,   some

departments  were  carrying out  their  work  very

efficiently but that Member has forgotten the fact

that,  in  the  past,  it  was  not  democracy  in

Singapore. It was absolute bureaucracy, and in  an

elected  Assembly  like this, where  the  majority

Party  runs  the government, it is no  use  saying

that  all  work can be carried out by the previous

heads  of  departments  who  are  now  acting   as

Permanent  Secretaries.  This  is  a  transitional

period when many of the old laws, regulations  and

policies need revision to suit the policies of the

new  Government and which will also have an effect

on  the lives of the people and as such, I believe

that  the  new Government may require a  few  more

hands to assist them in their duties. That is  not

unnatural.   Probably  Singapore   is   the   only

territory in the whole world where there exist  no

Parliamentary Secretaries in the so-called Cabinet

system. If any hon. Member of this House can point

out  to  me  one country where there is a  Cabinet

Government  without Parliamentary  Secretaries,  I

will bow to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the position today and I think, Sir,

that  a  matter  like this must be very  carefully

debated  without attaching unnecessary  prejudices

not only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>



to the functions of the Government but also to the

individuals  concerned. We also have  to  remember

that  we  must  have a complete knowledge  of  the

functions  of  a government which  deal  with  the

various  aspects of public affairs.  But,  on  the

other  hand, Sir, if we regard government  affairs

as  a  minor  matter, then we  will  be  advancing

reasons  not only of the type that we  heard  from

the  mover, but also very many other reasons which

probably  some of those people who may  understand

these problems will not agree.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the Chief Minister of any

elected government is a man who is more capable of

understanding the functions of the government  and

the  volume of work it has to undertake, and I  am

in no position to express any strong views on this

matter. I think the next opportunity that I  would

take  to express my views would be when the  Chief

Minister brings in an appropriate motion  for  the

approval of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I must remind this Assembly

that   I  am  perfectly  satisfied  to  serve   my

constituency  and the people of  Singapore  in  my

present   position.  I  have   not   indulged   in

canvassing for any personal ambition, and my  only

ambition is to serve the people and as long  as  I

get  that opportunity, I am satisfied but, on  the

other  hand,  if  any  member  of  the  public  of

Singapore  misunderstands  my  attitude  in   this

matter, I can only say he will realise it when the

time comes.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while the

main issue in this debate is whether or not at the

present  time it is desirable to appoint Assistant

Ministers,  with the underlying criticism  of  the

Chief Minister's selection some weeks ago, and  is

a  matter  which this House should decide  and  on

which  I, as an ex-officio Member of the House,

should  probably not express any view;  but  there

are  two  points  which have been  raised  in  the

debate on which I should like to express my view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first was a phrase used by the hon. Member

who  moved this motion, in which he suggested that

Ministers   of   the  Government   should   devote

themselves to hard work rather than to play.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>



Now,  I  am  quite sure that the hon.  Member,  in

using  that phrase, spoke from far less  knowledge

of the activities of Ministers than I myself have,

and  I  do  welcome  this  opportunity,  Sir,   of

assuring  him and all hon. Members of  this  House

that the Ministers of this Government have devoted

themselves  quite untiringly to  the  tasks  which

have  fallen to them. The House will, I  am  sure,

appreciate  that it is no easy task for  Ministers

to  take  over the government in the way that  our

present  Ministers have had to  do.  The  task  of

familiarising themselves with the organisation  of

the  government  machinery: the  task  of  forming

their  policies and relating them to what  can  be

done:  that  alone was enormous.  In  addition  to

that, the Government has had to face at least  two

very   severe  tests,  tests  which   would   have

challenged  any  government  with  many  years  of

experience. So I do assure Members of  this  House

that,  as  far  as  the  appointed  Ministers  are

concerned, their life during the last three months

has  been  far more all work and no play than  any

suggestion of play before work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I should like to make,

Sir,  is  to try to clear up what I think is  some

misunderstanding  about the  relationship  between

the  civil  service, the permanent civil  servants

and  the Ministers. It is easy to suggest that the

phrases,  used some time ago by the Chief Minister

in   which  he  referred  to  the  necessity  for

Ministers  keeping a close control  on  the  civil

service,  were  a reflection on the integrity  and

the  loyalty  of the civil service.  But  I  think

those  who  make  that reflection have  not  fully

appreciated  the basic position of the  Government

today.  We have made a fundamental change  in  the

whole system of government. We now have an elected

Government  of the people deciding its policy  and

passing  those  decisions to the  permanent  civil

service  to carry out. Both the civil service  and

the  Ministers are newcomers to this  system.  The

Government  that has been elected is a Government

which differs radically from previous Governments.

It is inevitable, therefore, that its policies and

its   approach   to   problems,  including   minor

problems, will be radically



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>



different   from   the   approach   of    previous

Governments. It is therefore inevitable  that  the

permanent members of the civil service do  require

much  more  detailed and day-to-day  direction  on

policy  than they required in the past, when  they

could  assume the general direction in  which  the

Government  was  moving. The fact that  the  Chief

Minister  has stated - in my view quite rightly - that

it  is necessary for Ministers to exercise a close

control  over the service is not, in my view,  any

reflection  at  all  on  the  integrity  and   the

devotion to duty of the members of that service.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a story is

told  of  a man who used to refer to his  wife  as

Pegasus,   and  when  somebody  asked  him,   "Why

Pegasus?",  he  said, "Oh, you know,  the  immortal

horse, the eternal nag." Now, Sir, hon. Members of

the   Opposition,  particularly  the   Progressive

Party,  seem to consider that it is their role  to

be the eternal nags and that was put into words by

the  Member  for  Paya Lebar (Mr Lim  Koon  Teck)

yesterday  when  he said it was the  duty  of  the

Opposition to oppose. The Opposition has  no  such

duty.  I may say, with respect - as I understand  it

and,  as  I  hope, they will one day  grow  up  to

understand  it - the duty of the  Opposition  is  to

support  all measures that are for the welfare  of

the  territory, to criticise where criticism seems

justified -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> And to oppose where opposition

is justified!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> That is included in the

criticism.  Sir,  we have had today  a  remarkable

demonstration of the lack of understanding of  the

constitutional  process because this  House - though

technically it can do anything, including  calling

a  man  a  woman - in fact, has no proper  right  to

interfere  in the Chief Minister's choice  of  his

team,  and  that, I was astonished to  learn,  was

appreciated  by  the  learned Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar.  Though  appreciating it, he, nevertheless,

took advantage of this opportunity to ramble along

the  highways and byways of criticism, to the huge

amusement of his own self at his own eloquence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am indebted to my friend and colleague

the  Chief Secretary for setting right a malicious

interpretation of a perfectly legitimate  comment.

I  do  not impute malice in the Member for Tanglin

(Mr  John  Ede)  because I have no  doubt  he  is

merely carrying into this Assembly what he  and  I

have   heard  outside.  It  seems,  Sir,   it   is

impossible  to  say  anything, even  "Thank  you",

without  being  maliciously  misinterpreted,   but

there  was never any question in my mind, then  or

now,  to  suggest lack of integrity or loyalty  on

the   part  of  the  civil  service  when  I  drew

attention to the vital necessity of proper control

and  direction  in the Ministries; and  I  repeat,

there exists a vital necessity there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going through a period of revolution,

bloodless    and    peaceful,    but    revolution

nevertheless. We are changing the whole tradition.

We  are reorientating policies and we need men to

keep the pulse on what is happening, to understand

the  procedures, to understand the details of  the

problems,  and  to  pass the  information  on  for

policy  as  well as they themselves acting  as  an

additional arm of policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has been made of the question of

public  opinion, and I will face these unpleasant,

improper  and  unfair imputations and insinuations

that have been smilingly made and directed to Back-benchers on my side of the House as well as to the

Member  sitting on the opposite Bench.  "Where  is

the proof of that probity?", asks the leader of the

Democratic Party (Mr William Tan). I would remind

the leader of the Democratic Party, if I may, that

they,  who are here as the elected of the  people,

are  as good, as fine men as any that sit opposite

and,  in  fact,  Sir, when I look at  the  Benches

opposite, I thank heaven for my colleagues. Let me

hold  up  the mirror to these gentlemen who  never

see  themselves - who need 24 hours  to  say  "Thank

you"; their excuse being "We cannot think as  fast

as the gentlemen on the Government Benches" -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> We think before we speak!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> You never think at all.

Walkouts,  Sir, in the true fashion of  mobs  when

they have the democratic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>



process  of  voting, refraining  from  voting,  or

voting  against, but they prefer the ways  of  the

mob - walkouts. They want one Select Committee after

another  in order to shelve vital legislation  and

yet simultaneously -



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> On a point of order, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order, Mr Chief Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Chief

Minister  speaking on the motion or on  something

which  has  passed already? If he is making  these

remarks,  we  should be allowed  to  talk  on  the

subject.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> As I understand it, Mr R. Jumabhoy,

the    Chief   Minister   is   answering   certain

allegations which have been allowed on  the  floor

of the House by me, and if he will confine himself

to that, I think he is in perfect order.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir.

I  ask  you,  Sir, to consider for  a  moment  the

nightmare possibility that we would have to form a

government from the opposite Benches. Think for  a

moment, Sir, and look around you and then look  at

my  Benches,  Sir,  and  you  can  understand  how

grateful I am to Providence for having provided me

with the colleagues that I have -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> For forming a government you

were never prepared to form!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Laughter - simulated

laughter - will not hide the basic truth of what  I

am  saying, and I say that the people who are  on

my  Backbenches, Sir, and whom I have in mind for

these  posts,  are  as good as  and  better  than

anyone that I can see opposite -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> You must change your glasses!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It is suggested that as we

have  a House of 32, we are too small for a  large

Front Bench. That is a cogent argument, Sir, whose

validity I have never denied and it is one of  the

basic  reasons why I have been striving, and  will

continue to strive, to increase the membership  of

this House in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>



order to make available not only the appropriate

material  but the necessary quality, but the  fact

that  we  are  in this restricted space  does  not

prevent us from having to do an efficient  job  of

work. The same work is there, Sir, whether we  are

25, or whether we are 50, and there is far greater

necessity today for Assistant Ministers than there

will be in four years -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Yes -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please, let us not have

interruptions.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> - and the reason simply is

this,   Sir,  that  this  is  a  period  of  basic

reorientation,  of  drastic  reorientation,  whose

equal I cannot imagine unless there is to be chaos

and  disaster  in any future time. We  are,  today

laying  the foundation-stone and doing  the  spade

work on which the future is going to be built.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested that we should work more

and  not  be  afraid of hard work.  If  I  may  be

permitted,  Sir, I have to remind the  Member  for

Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong) that the windows of

the  Assembly House look upon High Street and when

he  has finished playing his games or going to his

cinemas, he can look me up and come in for  a  cup

of  coffee and he will find me still at  work.  We

have  never shirked work, but I shall say no  more

about that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one other basis, Sir, this argument has been

presented - a   plausible  one -   pressed   by   the

Progressives and their soul-mate, the  Member  for

Telok   Ayer  (Mr  R.  Jumabhoy).  It  has   been

suggested  that  there will be an  expenditure  of

$18,000 per annum per Assistant Minister, and  the

Member for Telok Ayer even went so far as to say -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order, Mr R. Jumabhoy?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> I want to tell you, Sir, he is

misquoting me.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Well, in that case, the hon. Member

must wait until the Chief Minister gives way.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> And it has been suggested,

Sir, by the Member for Telok Ayer that, if we were

real  patriots, we would give our salaries to  the

people. I have not heard of his giving his  salary

to the people, Sir, although he has other means of

livelihood. What I would like to point out, on the

question  of economy, to the Member for  Serangoon

is  that in anticipation of his Party coming  into

power, there has been -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. I think the Chief

Minister is very near beginning to impute improper

motives to a Member -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> No, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> - in anticipation of his Party coming into power.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Not what he did, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> - but what, in fact, their

officials  did, if you will permit  me,  and  then

decide on it, Sir; I would say, in anticipation of

his Party coming into power, it was already on the

stocks that the Chief Minister should have a  car,

a  liveried  chauffeur, a $700,000  house,  liveried

servants -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Good show!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> There is no imputation

against him, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What about a wine cellar?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Well, Sir, I have -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, Mr Chief Minister. Now,

this debate is really getting perhaps a little out

of  hand.  I have allowed interruptions because  I

think  there  should be an atmosphere of  friendly

discussion  in this House. I am not quite  certain

whether  the Chief Minister was relevant  when  he

brought  in  what he has just brought in  in  this

debate.  Let  us try to confine ourselves  to  the

motion before the House - that is whether or not  at

the   present   moment  Assistant  Ministers   are

advisable.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I always

bow  to  your  ruling,  but  having  accepted  the

criticism that it would cost



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>



a  certain amount of money to appoint  Assistant

Ministers, it is surely valid for me to point  out

to  what extent this Government has economised  in

the  expenditure of public money by refusing these

trappings of office. I have no other purpose  than

that  and I trust you will permit it to remain  on

the record.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a curious conception on the part of the

Opposition  that  they  can control  every  single

movement of mine in Government, and the leader  of

the  Democratic Party, in fact, went so far as  to

suggest that there should be a Committee appointed

to  teach me how to suck eggs - if you will  forgive

that  schoolboy expression, but it is no more than

that - a Committee to be appointed to consider  what

Assistant  Ministers I should have - the  height  of

impudence -!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> That is what it is!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> - and that is what I will

always think, and what every reasonable person who

knows anything about parliamentary procedure  must

think.  It is suggested, Sir, that the appointment

of  a large number of persons to be Ministers  and

Assistant  Ministers will destroy  the  democratic

process.  That  is not fully accurate  because  we

have,  in any event - as Parties opposite are  fully

conscious - a Whip. Parties opposite themselves have

used   it   to   considerable   effect - detrimental

perhaps - when they walked out of this Assembly only

last  week,  but  there is a Whip. Government  can

control Backbenchers by using the Whip without any

question   of   appointing   them   as   Assistant

Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a remark made by the Member for

Tanglin  to which I take strong exception,  and  I

challenge  him to clarify it unless,  Sir,  it  is

made  in the normal traditional course which  has

been  indicated by that Party in the past. He says

that  Government  has indicated  that  it  has  no

policy  on  a  large number of  matters  of  grave

importance.  I  challenge him and I challenge  his

leader to name one -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Better make it three -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> - just one, or withdraw it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am conscious that regarding the persons I

seek  or  have  in  mind to appoint  as  Assistant

Ministers. I would like to say this: that  when  I

did  indicate I would reconsider the  position,  I

meant  it;  and  depending upon  this  debate  and

depending  upon the voting - because if  the  voting

goes  against  me, quite naturally,  Sir,  however

improper  I might think it is, I would accept  the

direction  of this House - but depending  upon  this

debate  and  what  has  transpired  during   these

proceedings, as well as what has transpired in the

intervening   period   since   the   exchange   of

correspondence with His Excellency on the subject,

it   is  my  intention  to  reconsider  the  whole

question   of   the   appointment   of   Assistant

Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am conscious that we have no Angel Gabriels

on  our  side of the House. I do not know  if  the

Opposition  pretend to have any. I do not  pretend

to  be  an Attlee or a Nehru, Sir. We have to  use

the  tools we have. If our ancestors who lived  in

caves  waited  for  the crane  and  the  pneumatic

drill,  they would still live in caves. We  cannot

wait  for  perfection and the perfect Minister  in

order  to  fill appointments which are  essential

for our daily work. We have men as able as any  to

be  found anywhere. That they are perfect, I  will

never  pretend  but  that  they  are  capable  and

adequate, I believe and, to that extent, Sir, they

will  be of service to the people. That I believe,

because  I  will never, at any time, consider  the

question   of  appointment  or  the  question   of

utilisation of any of my powers otherwise than for

the welfare of the people of this territory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been one further suggestion made - by

implication - by the Member for Telok Ayer,  and  it

is  that I seek to appoint Assistant Ministers for

the  purpose of unifying my Back-benchers.  It  is

difficult to follow the logic, Sir, because to the

normally  intelligent person, it must  immediately

be  appreciated that the suggestion that a  Member

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>



the  Opposition - not  so  much  Opposition - but  the

suggestion  that an Independent should  be  chosen

for  the post of Assistant Minister must instantly

and  quite  naturally rouse antagonism amongst  my

own  Back-benchers, and if that  is  considered  a

unifying  force, I find it a little bit  difficult

to understand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat, Sir, what has already been made

abundantly clear. This Government, at the  present

moment, needs not so much more power as more men.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> We heard a different story a

short while ago!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> We need more men in the

civil  service.  We  need more  men  who  can,  as

Assistant Ministers, assist in the reorientation of

past  policies,  clarification and enforcement  of

new policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of training, Sir, goes much

further.   I  am  more  anxious  about   immediate

results,  but the question of training  cannot  be

ignored. There are three ex-officio Ministries  to

which  I  am  very  anxious to  appoint  Assistant

Ministers and frankly - [Interruption.] -  as  I  see

things at the present moment, Mr Speaker - you will

forgive,  I  trust, the Member for  Tanjong  Pagar

(Mr Lee Kuan Yew) who only loves hearing his  own

voice,  and I have been somewhat long  on  my  own

feet - but I was suggesting, Sir, that the  type  of

persons  we want to put in as Assistant  Ministers

in  the  ex-officio Ministries must be men of  the

very first calibre and it is my intention - I do not

know  whether it will be possible, but as soon  as

some Assistant Ministers have proved in my view to

be  adequate  to take over Ministries - to  ask  the

existing Ministers to allow themselves to  be,  at

least,  technically demoted in order to  serve  in

the  ex-officio Ministries, because to  me  it  is

vital  to  have able men in those Ministries  very

soon  and that. Sir, is part of my training scheme.

The  Member for Tanjong Pagar seems to be  wanting

to  talk  all  the  time. In the circumstances,  I

think  I will refrain from further addressing  the

House  and,  no  doubt, he will  shortly  have  an

adjournment and a completely empty House to  which

he can talk to his heart's content.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information,

Sir.  The  Chief  Minister has indicated  that  he

would  abide  by  the decision of this  House.  Of

course,  he  must. He has the Party  Whip  and  he

could  easily  make the voting go his  way.  Do  I

understand  by his remark that the Party  Whip  is

withdrawn and that there will be a free vote?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  started the debate today on  a  friendly

basis.  We intended to carry on on that basis  and

I,  for  my  part,  am  very  sorry  that  it  has

descended  to  a  much lower level.  I  have  been

deploring,  during the last few weeks, the  manner

in  which  debates have been carried  on  in  this

House,  which I consider in my mind to  be  a  mad

House.  Simply because we were courageous  enough,

shall  we  say, to put suggestions  in  the  House

about the Land Acquisition Bill and to criticise -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. Can the hon. Member

please confine himself to the motion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I find it very hard to

confine myself when so much abuse has been  heaped

upon  us  during  the  two hours  allowed  to  the

debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been called nags. Surely, I am entitled

to  explain  that simply because we dare  to  make

some suggestions, we have been called nags, and we

do   resent  such  things.  Apparently,   whenever

anybody  thinks in a different way from  the  Hon.

the Chief Minister, he is a nag.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has caused me great surprise to learn that

the  Chief Minister has changed his opinion of his

Backbenchers so greatly within the space of a very

short  time. He now thanks heaven that he has  not

got us instead. The only reason I can think of  is

that he is quite certain in his mind that we shall

not follow him blindly, whatever he wants to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Stamford (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy)

said  that  the  Government,  or  his  Party,  now

represents  the  public opinion of  Singapore.  To

that,  I  must point out to him, again, that  less

than 30 per cent of the electorate voted them into

power. The Governor in -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> No, Sir, point of

information.  I  did not say that  my  Party  only

represents, but I said 'We in this House'.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> His Excellency the Governor

in  his  letter of the 9th of July  to  the  Chief

Minister  sees the position clearly when  he  says

that the Government would certainly be subjected -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> There are Standing Orders,

Sir, which forbid this House from referring to the

Governor or utilising his name for the purpose  of

influencing the Assembly, and unless  there  is  a

substantive motion to suspend that Standing Order,

Sir,  I  would respectfully suggest that he cannot

be allowed to continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The point, of course, is that you

have  interrupted, I think, a bit too soon.  I  do

not know what is being said.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> He said the Governor's letter.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Governor's letter has been

before  the  House, and I think it will  be  quite

proper  for  any  Member to refer to  any  letter

which has been before the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> This illustrates the point

that  we are not allowed to have any free thinking

in this House. The Governor said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... the Government would certainly be subjected

to  the  criticism of providing additional  places

for  supporters  and that the  good  name  of  the

Government might be seriously jeopardised.  I  was

not  satisfied that the addition to the Ministries

of Assemblymen who, so far, have had no experience

of Government administration, would strengthen the

particular Ministries...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, that is a very objective view and I

think  that represents the view of a big  majority

of the people in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer to the words of the Chief Minister,

reported  in the Official Debates of the  26th  of

April, 1955? There it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, a short acquaintance, a very short

acquaintance,  with  Government,  does   seem   to

indicate that we are apt in many spheres  to  live

on  a somewhat extravagant scale, and we intend to

take  action  shortly to bring about a realisation

by  the various Departments of the important  need

for economy."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see no more truthful words than these - the

serious need for economy in all what we do.  I  am

viewing   with  concern  the  expansion   in   the

Government  departments. To a certain  extent,  as

explained by the Hon. the Chief Secretary, that is

necessary, but we must bear in mind that  we  have

not  yet provided for all the social services that

are  in the mind of the Government today, and only

yesterday or the day before we were informed  that

the  cost  of education alone might be trebled  in

the next year or two.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I can understand the position of the

Government  at  the  present  moment.   They   are

overworked  because they are trying to  take  over

some new duties which they are not accustomed  to,

and if it is impossible for the Ministers to carry

on  their  duties,  is  it not  better  to  engage

temporary  Secretaries,  men  who  have  been   in

Government  service, versed in the  administration

of  a  particular Ministry? These posts can always

be  scrapped whenever their services are no longer

required, and no further expense will be  incurred

by the country.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the debate on the first

five  motions took only 25 minutes, but the  sixth

motion has taken us nearly two hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has spoken on the various

points  raised by the mover and the supporters  of

the  motion. I find it necessary to speak  on  one

point  that he has not touched upon, and  that  is

the stand as claimed by Mr Lee Kuan Yew - the stand

of the P.A.P. -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, Mr Lim.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> - the Member for Tanjong Pagar,

Sir. That shows how tiresome a long debate can be,

and I am sorry. I mean the stand of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P. as  expressed by the  Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar.  He  said  that "We, the  P.A.P., know  our

stand. We, the P.A.P., know in which direction  we

are  going",  and yet he told the Hon. the  Chief

Minister  that "We are with you if you need  those

Assistant  Ministers.  We  will  not  support  the

motion." Yet he turned round to the mover of  the

motion and said, "But we will not oppose it  too."

This  brings to my mind the cartoon in  Saturday's

Straits  Times -  "The  Tempestuous  Honeymoon" - the

honeymoon of the Chief Minister and the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar  since July up  till  the  18th  of

August,  when  he was just being  taken  into  the

bridal  chamber and, on the threshold,  the  bride

escaped  and ran into the arms of the  Member  for

Serangoon. Now he believes, "Well, it is better to

have  both rooms, if I can." So he says,  "Let  me

have a share of that bed and, please," to the  new

bridegroom, "I want to share your bed too. That is

why I say we do not oppose nor do we support."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

just like to answer a few points raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a democratic country. We have to feel

the  pulse of the people. The people have  elected

us   into  this  Assembly,  probably  on  our  own

manifestoes,  or on our ability to  convince  them

under any apple-tree, but it was their opinion  at

that  time  that  sent everyone of  us  into  this

Assembly. However, I am not too sure that when  we

come  into  this  Assembly,  we  will  always   be

expressing  what the people want us to do,  unless

you  are  a  diviner, and, if you want  to  divine

anything, you have to go out and find out. I  will

say  in  any  one  matter where you  need  a  snap

decision, we make that decision, but, in a  matter

where it is the talk of the town, you cannot  help

listening  to  it.  It is poured  into  your  ears

everywhere. You say that your opinion, which suits

your own purpose, should be called the opinion  of

the public. I must differ from that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, when we started this debate, as my

friend  has  said, we expected it  to  be  not  as

stormy  and  not  as  lengthy  as  all  this;  but

somebody  must  bring  in some  other  things  not

connected with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



debate, and talk about tailors making suits  which

should  have been discarded, or probably  somebody

else cannot wear them. But they are very happy  to

wear  them  today, and they make use of  his  good

services without thanking him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the point raised by the Hon. the

Chief  Secretary about the work of the Ministries.

I  understand it; I know it. I have said that  the

work  that the Ministers are doing is not easy.  I

say  they have great responsibilities but  I  only

say   that   local   men  are  never   afraid   of

responsibilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House is of opinion that the

appointment  of  more Assistant Ministers  at  the

present time is undesirable.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Division, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

is  it  proper at this stage to answer the  Member

for  Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) to  indicate

that there will be no Whip used?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Oh, yes, certainly.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Thank you, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  does the Chief Minister understand  that  if

there is no Whip, it is not a motion of confidence

before this House?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think that is a proper

question.
