<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Committee Stage read.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>2.32 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  beg to move, "That the Chairman do report

progress and ask leave to sit again."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after seven months of careful

consideration,   the   Minister   presented    the

Industrial Relations Bill to this Assembly on 13th

January. In the space of less than one month,  and

on  the very day that the Bill was to come up  for

debate  on  its  Second Reading, the  Minister  in

charge  found it necessary to put into  our  hands

seven pages of 50 amendments. Out of a short  Bill

of  37  pages,  50  amendments had  to  be  rushed

through.  Sir,  I  use the term "rushed  through",

because the amendments were given to us just a few

hours on the very day of the sitting at which  the

debate on the Bill was to take place.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had the amendments been in the nature of

corrections,    or   alterations    or    sentence

construction,  or printing errors, or  even  minor

oversights,  then  it would have  been  of  little

consequence.  But  as it is, Sir,  the  amendments

consist  of  very  important changes.  In  several

cases,  the most vital principles of the Bill  are

to be negatived by the amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Opposition Bench praised the Bill

at  the  last sitting because there were signs  of

genuine effort to promote industrial peace, giving

(as  was stated by the Hon. the Prime Minister)  a

fair  deal  to the workers and, at the same  time,

creating   conditions  conducive   to   industrial

expansion. It was, in fact, a courageous Bill,  in

my opinion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the honourable

Member  is perhaps going a bit too far. She  ought

to  confine herself to reasons why she thinks that

the  Chairman should report progress and beg leave

to sit again. I think she is probably now making a

Second  Reading speech. She should confine herself

to the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, I am saying all this

just  to  show  the importance of postponing  the

Committee  stage  to another  day.  I  am  giving

reasons  why it should be postponed, and although

it  might seem irrelevant now, I hope, when I tie

up  my  reasons, to show that they  are  relevant

and  why  I  think the Committee stage should  be

postponed. We thought that the Bill was  designed

to  prevent  the reoccurrence of the mistakes  of

the  past.  But there are amendments  which  have

been  sent  to  us two days ago  which  take  the

essence out of this -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Chicken!



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> - take all the essence out of

this  genuine effort to promote industrial  peace.

Sir,  first  the Bill was presented  to  us.  Then

before  it  could  be  passed,  it  has  now  been

mutilated  beyond  recognition by  50  amendments.

Surely it will do no harm if a little more time is

spent  on  putting  it  into  a  shape  which   is

acceptable to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



all  concerned,  which will be of benefit  to  the

State  and  all its people, and which  will  be  a

credit to the Government. I hope the Minister will

agree  to postpone the Committee stage to  another

day.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Before I propose the Question, I

might   inform   honourable   Members   that   the

Government  were in time when they sent  in  their

notices  of  amendments. The notices of amendments

were,  in fact, received in the Clerk's Office  on

the  8th of February. Admittedly, it did take some

time for the Clerk to go through the amendments to

put them into a shape acceptable to me, and it was

not  until  the  morning  of  10th  February  that

Members  received their copies of the  amendments.

So,  in  so  far as the Government are  concerned,

they were in time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the Chairman do report

progress and ask leave to sit again."



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think this point had

already been dealt with by the Prime Minister when

the  principles  of the Bill were debated  at  the

last  sitting. Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall later  be

moving  amendments which will clearly show to  the

Opposition Front Bench that the amendments do  not

in  any way affect the main structure of the Bill.

They  are in respect of points of detail. And when

I  do  so, I think I will be able to promote peace

between the Opposition and ourselves.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I received my copy of the amendments

of  the Minister for Labour and Law when I arrived

in  this  Assembly about ten minutes  before  2.30

p.m.  I therefore had no time to become acquainted

with   the  proposals  outlined  in  the  proposed

amendments. I do not say, Sir, that the Government

were  out  of time in submitting their amendments.

But I do say that had the Opposition been aware of

such  amendments  that were  being  proposed,  the

speeches  of the Opposition on the Second  Reading

of  the  Bill  might  have  been  of  a  different

character.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said that there was no useful purpose in referring this Bill to a Select

Committee because the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



question of principles was not involved. But I  do

respectfully  submit,  Sir,  that  the  amendments

proposed by the Minister for Labour and Law  go  a

long way to upset the balance that was aimed at in

the Bill - the balance of conflicting forces - so that

there  could be industrial peace. I do again  say,

Sir,   that,  because  of  the  very  nature   and

character of the Government amendments, more  time

should  be  given  to the Opposition  and  to  the

public to become aware of their implications.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Member for

Cairnhill  has  just complained  that  he  had  no

opportunity   of   looking   at   the   Government

amendments   until   2.30  this   afternoon,   the

Government  is prepared to postpone the  Committee

stage to after item No. 5 on the Order Paper.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

if I had been able to read the proposed Government

amendments  before I made my speech on the  Second

Reading, I would most certainly not have spoken in

the  tenor in which I, in fact, had done. When  we

met  here  the day before yesterday, I thought  it

was  an excellent Bill, a courageous Bill, because

the  Government  was attempting to  solve  a  very

difficult  problem, which is to hold  the  balance

evenly  between  employees and  employers  in  the

overall interest of the State. Sir, after  I  have

had  the  opportunity to look  at  the  Government

amendments and to realise their implications, I am

now   satisfied   that  the  balance   which   the

Government  had so strenuously sought to  preserve

in the original Bill has been whittled down to the

extent where one of the parties to a dispute would

have lost confidence in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if the primary aim and objective of

this Bill is to secure industrial peace, it is,  I

think,  imperative that both sides to the  dispute

should  be  satisfied  that  it  is  a  fair   and

impartial  Bill. At the moment, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

as  the amendments stand, the Opposition feel that

the  Bill is weighted with the amendments  on  one

side, and the balance is not held equally.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that he has received representations from both employers and employees,

and  as  a result of those representations he  has

framed  these  amendments. If I may  say  so  with

respect  to  the  Minister, these amendments  have

been  filed  at the instance and at the suggestion

of   employees.  May  I  ask  him  whether   these

amendments have been put to the employers to  find

out  what  their views are on them? I  venture  to

suggest  to  the Minister that if these amendments

had been put to the employers, they might not have

readily  accepted the Bill in its amended form.  I

therefore  beg  of  the  Minister  to  defer   the

Committee  Stage, Sir, so that the  employers  and

others  who  are interested in the Bill  could  be

given   adequate   opportunity  to   examine   the

amendments and to see what their effect will be on

industrial peace.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, at the last

sitting  of  the  Assembly, every  Member  of  the

Assembly  who spoke said that this Bill  was  very

important and vital to the interest of the  people

of  Singapore. Therefore, I do not wish to be left

behind  in expressing my dissatisfaction with  the

method  by  which this Bill is going to be  rushed

through without first giving an opportunity to the

Opposition to review it thoroughly, because it has

been   found,  as  expressed  earlier,  that   the

amendments  just tabled by the Government  clearly

show that they are contrary to what the Government

claims  them to be, that is, the Bill  is  in  the

interest of all concerned. We have just been made

to  understand that the Government has considered

these  amendments after receiving  the  views  and

representations  of  many  trade  unions  who  had

offered  their  views. Hence  the  Government  has

tabled   many  amendments.  It  cannot  be   said,

however,  that  only trade unions were  given  the

opportunity  to express their views  on  the  Bill

which affects industrial relations. Similarly, the

Opposition  are not satisfied, as  they  were  not

given  an opportunity. We must not forget that  in

this Assembly we are not representing the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



workers  or  employers but we are here responsible

for the enacting of Bills which give protection to

all  sections  of the community in Singapore,  and

not  merely  a certain section. Hence  it  follows

that the views expressed by the Opposition for the

postponement  of  this  Bill  should  receive  the

attention  of  the Minister, because  we,  in  the

Opposition, will also be held responsible for  the

enactment  of any Bills that are put  before  this

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  remember  the Prime  Minister  saying  on

Wednesday that there was no principle on which the

Government  could give way. But I do submit,  Sir,

that  the amendments proposed by the Minister  for

Labour and Law constitute a withdrawal of some  of

the  major principles adumbrated in the Bill.  The

Minister in his Second Reading did not consider it

necessary  to  inform  this  House  that  he   had

discussions  with  representatives  of  the  trade

unions  and  representatives of the employers.  It

was  left to a Government back-bencher to disclose

it  to  this  House. I do submit that, in  future,

when  matters  of  importance  are  involved,  the

Minister should inform this House of what has been

taking place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, he has not informed the House

in   what   way  the  representatives   had   made

objections to him. Sir, if he will be so  good  as

to  inform  this House, I would like to  know  the

names  of the representatives of the trade  unions

who   saw  him  as  well  as  the  names  of   the

representatives of the employers.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think perhaps the debate is

ranging  a  bit  too far. If the Minister  is,  in

fact,  going to disclose these names, I  think  he

would probably be out of order, because we are now

debating  whether or not proceedings on this  Bill

should be postponed. The debate must therefore  be

confined to the reasons why consideration  of  the

Bill should be postponed, and nothing further.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Why I ask for the information

is  because it is felt by the Opposition that  the

amendments  proposed are as a result of  one-sided

discussions between the Government and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



some  of the trade unions. As you have ruled, Sir,

we   will  not  be  in  a  position  to  get   the

information   we  want.  But  I  do  submit   that

questions of principle are involved, and that what

the  Prime Minister told the House last Wednesday,

that  the  Government would not give  way  on  any

principle  whatsoever, is not  borne  out  by  the

amendments to be proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

when  we debated the Bill two days ago, the nature

of  the  amendments proposed was not known to  the

Opposition  nor, Sir, was it known to the  public.

We  did  not  realise that the amendments  are  so

vital  that they practically change the  character

of the whole Bill. On that ground, Sir, we believe

that  the  public must be kept informed  of  later

developments so that there can be a test of public

reaction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, when the principle of

this Bill was being debated, I remember that in my

reply  I  charged the Opposition Front Bench  with

showing  so  very  little or no attention  to  the

contents of this very important Bill. Mr Speaker,

I  did  say  in my speech when I moved the  Second

Reading of the Bill that the Explanatory Statement

published  in  the Bill summarises in considerable

detail  the  main provisions of the Bill.  I  also

went  on  to  say that in Committee I  would  move

certain  amendments  which would  not  affect  the

general  features of the scheme  embodied  in  the

Bill. Those were the exact words I used.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when the Member for Cairnhill was speaking, it appeared to me that he was not

informed of the amendments that the Government had

sent   in,  and  I  interrupted  on  a  point   of

information and pointed out to the House that  the

amendments  had,  in fact, been submitted  by  the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Government is also charged with having given no publicity to these amendments. Mr

Speaker,  I gave an interview to the reporters  in

the Chinese Press and the Straits Times on Tuesday

afternoon,   and  the  main  provisions   of   the

amendments which the Government will move were, in

fact,  published in the Straits Times on Wednesday

morning.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Members of the Opposition

have  had  ample  time to consider the  amendments

that  Government proposes to move this  afternoon.

In  fact, there was a public holiday yesterday and

the  House  was not in session, and if the  Member

for Cairnhill is the champion of the people, as he

wants  to make out that he is now, surely he could

have  spent some time yesterday looking  at  these

amendments.  Or if he had not got a  copy  of  the

amendments, he could have got one from his learned

friend  sitting next to him, the Member for Farrer

Park.  I  am horrified to know that he  told  this

House  this afternoon that the first time that  he

had  received these amendments was this  afternoon

at 2.30.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> No, no.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Let him say no. But I always say we

speak the truth.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think there has been some

misunderstanding.   I   think   the   Member   for

Chairnhill  said he saw these amendments  at  2.30

p.m. on Wednesday.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir. That means,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, that he has had ample  time  to

look at these amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have pointed out repeatedly that the amendments do not in any way affect the main

structure  of  this  Bill. For  that  reason,  the

Government  wishes  to  proceed  with  all   these

amendments this afternoon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of my discussions with

representatives  of employers and  representatives

of  trade unions, I had referred to all these when

I  replied during the debate on the Second Reading

of the Bill. As a result of the discussions that I

have  had  both  with the representatives  of  the

unions  and  the  employers, the  Government  has,

after  taking  into account both  representations,

drafted the amendments which we hope to move  this

afternoon,  so that it has' not been  a  one-sided

manoeuvre,  as  the  Opposition  Front  Bench  are

trying to suggest now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since they require a little

more time, I do not mind giving them a little more

time.  We  will  come back to the Committee  stage

after item 7 on the Order Paper for today.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there was nothing

on  the  Second  Reading of  the  Bill  which  the

Opposition  could have said. The Opposition  quite

frankly  informed  the House  that  they  were  in

complete agreement with the principle involved  in

the  Bill. As the Second Reading is concerned with

the debate on the principle of the Bill, there was

nothing   that   the  Opposition  could   say   in

criticism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it was the Hon. the

Prime  Minister who said that this was  the  first

attempt made by the Legislature to bring the  rule

of  law into industrial relations where previously

the  rule  of  the jungle had prevailed.  That,  I

thought,  was an admirable sentiment and something

which  is  very necessary if confidence is  to  be

established  which will attract  capital  to  this

place  and  keep  it  here. If  we  are  going  to

introduce  the rule of law where the rule  of  the

jungle had prevailed, then the Court must be  able

to  enforce  its awards both against the  employee

and  the  employer. That is the rule of law  as  I

understand  it,  Mr  Speaker.  The  rule  of  the

jungle,  as  we all understand it,  is  where  the

superior  survives and the inferior is  destroyed.

We  want  the  rule of law. But when we  read  the

amendments,  Mr Speaker, Sir, we  find  that  the

awards  can be enforced against the employer,  but

it seems that the employees are not so bound. That

is  our  reading  of the amendments.  If  that  is

correct,  then there are no sanctions attached  to

the failure on the part of the employee to observe

an award. If that is the correct interpretation of

the  amendments, Mr Speaker, where  then  is  the

rule of law?

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Mr   Speaker,   Sir,  various  Members   of   the

Opposition have based their request for a delay in

that  the  amendments proposed by  the  Government

of  the Bill. But none of them have given a single

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> - they might have read into the

amendments things not meant to be read into.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us not go into a panic over these

things.  The  Bill  in  its original  and  in  its

amended   forms   sets  out  the  procedures   and

regulations  whereby disputes between  unions  and

employers  can  be settled in an orderly  fashion.

That was the aim of the original Bill and that  is

the  aim  of the Bill as amended. Again, there  is

the claim that the amendments have been so drastic

as  to  alter  the balance between  employers  and

employees - a  balance which the Opposition  Members

approved  in  respect of the  original  Bill,  but

which   they   disapprove  in   respect   of   the

amendments,  presumably because they suspect  that

the  amendments  have  given  concessions  to  the

unions  but not to employers. This apparently  has

caused  considerable dismay among Members  of  the

Opposition  who  everyone knows  represent  vested

interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us put both our feet firmly on the ground

and  let  us  not indulge in flights of  fantasies

about  the effect of these amendments in reverting

industrial  relations to the rule of  the  jungle.

May  I ask the Opposition to remember always  that

the  P.A.P. Government acts with decision? It  has

not  been hasty in drafting the Bill. It has given

due   consideration  to  proposals  and   counter-

proposals  from  the parties affected.  But  there

must  be some finality in these things, and if  we

were  to  act in the manner which Members  of  the

Opposition want us to, that is, to preserve a fine

balance between the groups concerned, we would  go

on  balancing for the next five years. Members  of

the  Opposition may well be reminded of the  story

of  Columbus when he wanted to balance an egg. The

best way is to bang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



the  egg  and break one end of it and the rest  of

the egg stands quite stably in this way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I have no sympathy whatsoever with the pleas for delay by the Opposition. I think

they  have  completely exaggerated the  extent  to

which the changes proposed have altered the nature

of this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not go

into  the  details of the proposed  amendments  in

order   to  air  our  stand  that  the  amendments

proposed by the Government go a long way to  alter

the principle of the Bill. I thought that if I had

done that you might have ruled me out of order. To

suggest -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think I probably would

have  ruled the hon. Member out of order. I  would

suggest  that  the way to tackle  this  particular

problem,  in  so  far  as  the  complaint  of  the

Opposition  are concerned that the  principles  of

certain clauses have been altered, is to raise the

point  when  we come to the particular clause  and

then  move that consideration of the clause itself

be  postponed. If that meets with the Opposition's

wishes, perhaps we can proceed.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> May I proceed, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Tun Lim Yew Hock.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With respect, Sir, it was

because you have allowed the Hon, the Minister  to

say  that  we  had given no valid  reason.  I  was

trying to say why we could not.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I appreciate that and I

think  the House does appreciate that. There  must

be   some  valid  reasons  in  the  minds  of  the

Opposition why they think that the principles have

been  departed  from. Probably  the  Minister  for

Finance  knew that and said what he did  say  with

his  tongue in his cheek. But I am just trying  to

direct  the Members of this Assembly on a speedier

course. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



seems to me that we are debating round in circles.

Perhaps  if some agreement can be reached  on  the

lines I have proposed, we can proceed.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we had hoped

that  the  Committee stage of this Bill  could  be

postponed  to  a  later stage whereby  the  public

would   have   at  least  considered   the   major

amendments   proposed  by  the   Government.   The

Minister for Labour and Law has suggested that  if

we  had qualms about the amendments he might agree

to  taking the Committee stage when all the  other

business  of the day has been disposed of.  May  I

respectfully  submit, Sir, that such a  suggestion

is nothing but frivolous?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think I have ruled the

word  "frivolous" out of order.  Will  the  Member

please withdraw?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I withdraw, Sir. I will

therefore  say that such a suggestion  is  not  in

keeping with the dignity of this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I suggested

just now that the Committee stage of this Bill  be

taken  after item No. 5 on the Order Paper, I  did

so  because I mistakenly believed that the  Member

for Cairnhill had said that the first time that he

had   seen  these  amendments  was  at  2.30  this

afternoon. As a matter of fact, it was pointed out

to me that he had seen these amendments at 2.30 on

Wednesday afternoon. This has made the case for an

application for an adjournment even more - I am very

much tempted to use the same word, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the principle of the Bill was

carefully  gone into when the Second  Reading  was

debated  last Wednesday. When replying, I remember

I  pointed out where the amendments departed  from

the  main  provisions  of  the  Bill.  I  remember

informing  this  House that  the  Government  had,

after discussions with the unions, agreed to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>



take out the provisions in the Bill dealing with

the de-registration of unions. I remember

informing the House that the Government had, after

discussions with the unions, decided that the

provisions restricting the activities of union

leaders, when they were found guilty of contempt

of court, were to be preserved. I remember dealing

with all these matters, and I am very surprised

that the Member for Farrer Park has got so lost in

the jungle of his thoughts that he should have

suddenly accused the Government of wanting to

introduce the law of the jungle in industrial

relations. If he had been a little more careful

and given more thought to what I had said when

replying to the debate on the Second Reading, then

he would not have made that very unfair remark.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

concerning the remark that we could have  spent  a

few  hours  yesterday studying the  amendments;  I

would  like  to  say this. It is because  we  have

studied them thoroughly that we now feel, not  for

our sake, but for the sake of the public, that the

public  need  to be informed of these  amendments,

and they need to give thought to them. This is why

we  are  proposing a postponement of the Committee

stage. It is not for ourselves. We spent the whole

day yesterday discussing them.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I take it that the suggestion by

the  Government that the Committee stage be  taken

after  item 7 on the Order Paper is not acceptable

to  the  Opposition. I shall then put the Question

on  the  motion, and the Government side  will  no

doubt vote in the way they think appropriate.

progress and ask leave to sit again."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question accordingly negatived.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Before we proceed, I wish to draw

the attention of the Opposition Members to

Standing Order 71 (7) which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A clause may be postponed, unless a decision

has already been taken upon an amendment thereto...".



<br><br>Therefore, if any Opposition Member wishes to move

that a clause be postponed he or she should do so

before an amendment is moved or considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2-

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendments (i)* and (ii)+ appear to be connected. Perhaps the

both.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* See column 235.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Amendment (ii) reads as follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, lines 21 to 23, to leave out "and any department of Her Majesty's Government in

the United Kingdom functioning within

Singapore".

<hr size="2" noshade>

* See column 234.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when moving the Second Reading

of  this  Bill,  I  explained why  Government  has

thought  it necessary that the Services and  their

employees should be left out of the provisions  of

this  Bill and I do not propose to repeat  what  I

have already said.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Opposition  would  indeed  be  grateful   to   the

Minister  if he would repeat the reasons which  he

gave  during the Second Reading of the Bill.  Sir,

the reason I ask is that we do not have a copy  of

the Hansard.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Sir, that proves my point earlier on

when  I said that the Opposition Members gave very

little attention either to -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is

it  out of order for a Member of the Opposition to

ask for information?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is not a point of order. No

point of order has arisen.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> If I am not mistaken. I think the

Member for Cairnhill has asked me to repeat what I

said  when I moved the Second Reading of the Bill.

My  point is that if he had paid attention to what

I  was saying, then there would have been no  need

for  his asking me to repeat what I then said.  In

order that he may he informed, I shall now proceed

to  restate what I then said on the Second Reading

of the Bill:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... we have also decided to leave the Services and

their  employees  out of the  provisions  of  this

Bill.  This  is because our State is  fully  self-governing  in  internal  affairs  but  is  not   a

sovereign  State as far as external relations  and

internal security are concerned. For that  reason,

we   are   in  no  position  to  pass  any   local

legislation  binding on Her Majesty's  Government.

That  being  so,  we consider  that  it  would  be

advisable  to leave it to the Services  and  their

employees to decide whether they would freely wish

to  avail  themselves  of the  machinery  we  have

provided  in  this  Bill  for  the  settlement  of

industrial  disputes, and it would be up  to  them

therefore to decide whether they would freely come

in or keep out altogether."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>



I also said then, Mr Speaker:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this connection, I have been advised by the

United  Kingdom  Commissioner in  Singapore,  with

whom  both  the  Prime Minister  and  I  have  had

discussions,  that the United Kingdom  departments

are not opposed in principle to the objects of the

Bill,  since  indeed arbitration courts  have  for

long  been  a  normal  feature  of  civil  service

negotiating machinery in the United Kingdom."

<br><br>

I also informed the House:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have also been informed by the United Kingdom

Commission   here   that   the   United    Kingdom

departments  could  not,  however,  agree  to  the

Bill's  application without modification to  cover

certain  aspects  which  are  governed  by  United

Kingdom statute or practice and are not within the

direct  competence of the United  Kingdom  Service

departments functioning in Singapore."



<br><br>I also expressed the hope that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...it will be possible in the near future for the

United  Kingdom Service departments  10  reach  an

agreement  with their employees on the application

of the Bill on such terms as may be agreed between

them,  and, if such agreement is not possible,  to

settle their problems by other amicable means."



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did listen

to  the  Hon. the Minister when he was moving  the

Second  Reading of the Bill. I just wanted him  to

repeat it in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear, Sir, that a self-governing

constitution  is much worse than the  constitution

of a colony. When Singapore was a colony from 1955

to  1959, yet our laws could legislate to  contain

and   embrace  any  department  of  Her  Majesty's

Government.   And  we  are  told  today   by   the

Government that because we are self-governing  we,

therefore, cannot do it. Yet when we were  running

a  colonial  government we had been challenged  by

leaders of the P.A.P. as to why we did not  insist

that  employees of Service departments  should  be

covered   by   law.  Because  of  that,   we   had

discussions with the British Government and had it

included  in our law. It could be easily  verified

if  you  look up the Labour Code and other  labour

legislation  that  a  Service  department  of  Her

Majesty's Government is so covered. And  today  we

are told in this House that because we have a self-governing constitution we cannot do what we  could

do when we were a colony.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government's stand is

sincere  and  consistent, and  not  like  that  of  the

previous  Government. We see the Member  for  Cairnhill

standing up today accusing this Government of giving no

protection whatsoever to Service employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to state here that I had

been  employed  in the Army and was actively  concerned

with a certain union. We are aware that if the Services

or the British Government desire that Service employees

be  covered  in  this Bill, then all the provisions  in

this  Bill  must  be acceptable to  them.  But  in  our

experience - I  personally have had  this  experience - any

local legislation which will benefit the Services  will

be  acceptable to them, but if any local legislation is

detrimental  to  them  they  will  not  wish   to   get

themselves involved in it, and they will say that  they

have their own legislation in the United Kingdom. I can

say  frankly in front of the Member for Cairnhill  that

he himself knew that many disputes arose in the Service

establishments when I was an Assemblyman for  Sembawang

and that I did bring such matters to his attention, but

he  replied  that he was in no position to settle  such

disputes.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today it seems that he is trying to make it

appear   as  if  we  have  neglected  or  shirked   our

responsibility to the Services employees. I think  such

an  accusation is unfounded. As I have said earlier  in

my  speech, we are frank, outspoken and sincere. If the

Services  departments  wish to  accept  completely  the

legislation passed by the local Government, they should

wholly abide by the legislation, and not accept part of

it  and reject the other. I have personally experienced

this, and I am sure the Services unions will agree with

me in this respect.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, all that the Hon.

the  Minister has said does not deny the fact  that  in

the  Labour  laws  of  today, Service  departments  are

covered.  If  they  could  be  covered  in  the  Labour

Ordinance, if they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



could   be   covered  in  the  Workmen's   Compensation

Ordinance,  if they could be covered in any other  law,

why  cannot they be covered in this law? It is the same

law!  If  it  is necessary to delete it, then  I  would

suggest  to the Government that they should  amend  all

the  laws  that are in existence today - to take  out  of

them  the coverage of the Services departments  of  the

United   Kingdom  Government.  Sir,  there  is   enough

protection  of  Her Majesty's Government here,  because

the  employees  working  in  the  Services  departments

cannot  be so declared as employees until the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara has so declared. And the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara is a representative of Her Majesty in the  State

of  Singapore. Now, if we do not have it in there, Sir,

then  how  are we going to give protection  to  Service

employees?  I  am  not  a  lawyer.  Suppose  today  the

Services  union says, "Yes, we want to come under  this

law";  the Services departments say, "Yes, we  want  to

come under this law"; then how are they to come in when

for  the  purposes  of  this  Ordinance  they  are  not

"employees" or "employers"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is quite obvious that

the  Member  for Cairnhill had been seeing visions  and

dreaming  dreams all the years when he was in politics,

from 1948 to 1959. If he was a realist at all, he would

have  known,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, that no  non-Sovereign

legislative  body  can  bind Her Majesty's  Government.

That is a well-settled constitutional point, and I need

not in any way argue it here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Services and their employees

were brought into the present Labour Ordinance, it  was

by  agreement. If it is possible for them to  reach  an

agreement - and I have expressed the hope that they would

do  so - it  will  be  quite easy for  us  to  amend  the

Ordinance  to provide for their coming in. We certainly

would  be very pleased if they could agree to come  in.

But   as   I  have  pointed  out,  the  United  Kingdom

Commissioner  here has made it clear  that  they  would

only  agree  to  their employees coming in  on  certain

conditions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



And until those conditions are agreed, I think  we

would have to leave the position as it is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still repeat what I have said before, that we

do really and sincerely hope that both sides would

get  together  and iron out their differences  and

then  come  to us and say, "We want to be  brought

under the provisions of this new procedure for the

settlement  of industrial disputes." I can  assure

the  Opposition  Bench that there  would  be  none

happier   than  ourselves  to  introduce  amending

legislation for that purpose.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I do not understand why

it  should  be deleted now and then amended  at  a

future date if, as the Hon. Minister has said, the

Services  departments of Her Majesty's  Government

are  not against coming under this Bill. I do  not

see  why it should be so. What the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara  can  do is to wait until an  agreement  is

reached with Her Majesty's Government. Without the

amendment,   it  will  put  the  matter   in   the

forefront.  And as soon as agreement  is  reached,

the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara will then so declare.

If  this is not to be there, I submit that all the

laws  that  cover Services departments  should  be

abolished.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to

labour  this point. I just want to repeat that  we

would  be  very  happy  to  welcome  the  Services

departments to the fold as soon as they can  agree

with   their  unions  to  be  brought  under   the

provisions of this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with the

Minister  for  Labour  and  Law  that  legislation

normally does not bind the Crown, unless the Crown

itself  submits to that legislation. It is because

of that that the words "and includes an officer or

a servant of the Government" have been put in. But

that  is not the end of the matter. Merely putting

in  the  phrase  "and includes  an  officer  or  a

servant  of  the Government" does  not  in  itself

place a Government employee within the meaning  of

this Ordinance. It is the inclusion by the Yang di-

Pertuan  Negara  by  way of a  proclamation  which

finally  makes him an employee within the  meaning

of this section. What then



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



is  the necessity for deleting the words sought to

be  deleted from this Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir, when

the   inclusion  of  those  words  would  not   in

themselves  bring  that group of employees  within

the  framework of the Ordinance, unless and  until

the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara so  declares?  So  it

seems to me, Mr Speaker, Sir, particularly as the

Minister himself has said, that there are only one

or  two  points  on  which  agreement  has  to  be

reached, and as soon as that is achieved, the Yang

di-Pertuan Negara can then so proclaim.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the essential point

is  this: that the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, as  our

Head of State, would on the recommendation of  the

Cabinet, be able to make a declaration to  include

certain  categories of Government servants  within

the definition of "employee". But what the Yang di-Pertuan Negara cannot do on the recommendation  of

the  Cabinet  is  to  place,  say,  categories  of

Services   employees  within  the  definition   of

"employee". He can do that only after agreement is

reached  between this Government and Her Majesty's

Government. It is only then that he can make  such

a declaration. But he could easily declare a local

Government  servant  as  an  "employee"  for  this

purpose on the advice of the Singapore Government,

and that is the distinction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, we understand the position that

the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara is the Constitutional

Head   of   State.  He  cannot  act  on  his   own

initiative; he can only act on the advice  of  his

Ministers.  As  and  when  agreement  is   reached

between  the Cabinet and Her Majesty's  Government

in  the United Kingdom, that agreement, Sir,  will

be  the  subject  matter  for  discussion  by  the

Cabinet.  As  a result of the Cabinet's  decision,

the responsible Minister then advises the Yang di-

Pertuan Negara, who will then gazette. Where  then

is the need for the deletion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we feel that it

would  always  be  better for an agreement  to  be

reached  between  the Services  as  employers  and

their own employees before any approach is made to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



the  Singapore Government. We do not want to enter

into agreements with Her Majesty's Government over

the  heads  of their own employees' organisations.

We would like them to get together and discuss the

conditions  under which they will be  prepared  to

come  in, before we welcome them in. Surely, there

is nothing sinister in that?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment made: In page 2, lines 21 to 23, to

leave  out  "and any department of  Her  Majesty's

Government   in  the  United  Kingdom  functioning

within Singapore".-[Mr Byrne].



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, to leave out lines 28 to 32

inclusive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the definition of "essential service".

This  amendment is consequential to the  amendment

to  clause 28 (c) of the Bill. I will explain  the

purpose  of this amendment when we come to  clause

28 (c) .



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There are two methods whereby we

can deal with amendments of this nature. One is to

enter   into   a   debate   immediately   on   the

advisability  of  leaving out "essential  service"

from  the  ambit of this Bill; the other  way,  of

course,  is  to  postpone  consideration  of   the

amendment  to  clause 2 under  the  provisions  of

paragraph 11 of Standing Order 71.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment can be considered under the

provisions of paragraph 11 of Standing  Order  71,

which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After all clauses and schedules have been gone

through,  any  Member may, with the leave  of  the

Chairman,  move  an  amendment  to  a  clause   or

schedule   already  passed,  provided   that   the

amendment  is made necessary by an amendment  made

to any other clause or schedule."

<br><br>

That is, consideration of this amendment could  be

entered into under paragraph 11 of Standing  Order

71 after consideration of all the other clauses of

the  Bill.  But perhaps it would be convenient  if

the  Minister  would  make a  speech  now  on  the

advisability   of   omitting  the   reference   to

"essential  service". That would cover  clause  28

(c) as well as the Schedule to the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if Members of this

House  will look at clause 28, they will see  that

the   Industrial  Arbitration  Court   will   take

cognizance of a trade dispute in the circumstances

there provided:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) with the consent of the disputants,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) when the President so directs,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) when the Minister, by notification in

the   Gazette,  certifies  that   the   trade

dispute be referred to the Arbitration  Court

when  it  is  a  trade dispute  affecting  an

essential service, and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) when the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, by

proclamation,  declares that the  dispute  be

referred   to  arbitration  in   the   public

interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have given notice of an

amendment to leave out clause 28 (b) of the  Bill.

In my reply in the debate on the Second Reading of

this   Bill,   I  explained  that  the  Government

considered it unfair that the President,  who  was

to act as a conciliator, -



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Perhaps I did not make

myself  quite  clear.  At  this  stage  will   the

Minister  please confine himself to  the  question

whether or not essential services should come  out

of  the  ambit of the Bill? Later on, he can  deal

with the other amendments to clause 28. I take  it

that  clause  28 (b) does not concern itself  with

essential services?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> That is so.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> So if the Minister will now

confine  himself to the principle  of  taking  the

essential  services out of the ambit of the  Bill,

he can proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry I have

to refer to clause 28 (b) in some detail, because,

unless  I  did so, it would be difficult for  hon.

Members  to  understand why we have  suggested  an

amendment to clause 28 (c). Mr Speaker, Sir, I do

not  think I need repeat what I have already  said

with regard to clause 28 (b). I will go straight



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>



on  from there to clause 28 (c). There it  is  now

proposed that the Minister be given an over-riding

right  to  refer any trade dispute to arbitration.

In  clause  28  (c),  it  was  proposed  that  the

Minister  could  so direct only  where  the  trade

dispute concerned an essential service. But it  is

now  thought  that to enable the unions  to  place

some  value on their collective strength and their

bargaining position, it would be advisable to give

the  Minister this over-riding authority, so  that

in  any  dispute, whether it concerns an  ordinary

trade   dispute  or  an  essential  service,   the

Minister  would  be in a position  to  refer  that

dispute  to  arbitration; so  that  references  to

arbitration  would  therefore  arise   under   the

amendments  to  be  proposed in  cases  where  the

parties  agreed  to  go to arbitration,  in  cases

where the Minister decided to refer the dispute to

arbitration,  and  in cases  where  the  Yang  di-

Pertuan Negara in the public interest declared  by

proclamation  that  the  dispute  should   go   to

arbitration.  If  this amendment is  adopted,  Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  this  definition  of   "essential

service" would be unnecessary.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The supposition then that

essential services were coming out of the ambit of

the  Bill  is  not correct. They  would  still  be

within the ambit of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Essential services, Mr Speaker, Sir,

would  be  within the ambit of the Bill, but  they

would  come  within  the  definition  of  a  trade

dispute.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> They come indirectly under the

provisions of clause 28 (c) so far as disputes are

concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> That is so.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In the debate that may follow,

hon.   Members   may  range  over   the   proposed

amendments Nos. (iii)* and (iv)+ to clause 28,  at

page 51 of the Order Paper Supplement.



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Amendment (iii) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Amendment (iv) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 12, lines 15 to 18, to leave out

"certifies  in  respect of a trade  dispute  with

the  provision of, an essential service  that  it

is in the public interest" and insert "directs".

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, do I understand the

Minister  to say that the deletion of those  lines

really  makes no difference? It seems to  me,  Mr

Speaker, that where under the clause as framed  in

the  original  Bill persons in essential  services

had certain rights, it could well he that now,  as

a result of the amendment, they have been excluded

from those rights.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is a very

simple   point.  They  would  have   recourse   to

collective bargaining under the provisions of Part

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, while we

have  no  objection to the deletion  proposed,  we

feel  that the amendment proposed by the  Minister

to clause 28 (c) is a matter which I would like to

discuss at its proper time, because I too have  an

amendment to that particular clause.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member will not, of

course, be debarred from raising his points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.

Industrial Relations Officer appointed under

section 26 of this Ordinance;'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have also moved an amendment to clause 26 of the Bill to provide for the

appointment    of   Conciliation   Officers    and

Industrial Relations Officers.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister wishes to speak on

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have provided in

this Bill that practising advocates and solicitors

should  be  excluded from participating either  in

collective bargaining or from appearing before the

Industrial  Arbitration  Court,  except  in  cases

which  are referred to iii clause 62 (1) (b) (ii).

Mr  Speaker, in view of that, the Government  has

considered  that  it would be  wrong  to  leave  a

vacuum,  as  it were. If I am right, I  think  the

Member  for  Cairnhill said yesterday  that  until

such  time as the unions were able to train  their

own  officials  in this work, legal representation

should  be allowed to them. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  we

had  that point in mind when we proposed that when

legal  representation was withdrawn  it  would  be

proper  to  institute a new category  of  officers

known as Industrial Relations Officers in addition

to   the   Conciliatory  Officers  who  would   be

appointed to handle this work for those unions who

would not be able to train their own officials  to

handle  this sort of work. That is the reason  for

this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> As indicated by the Minister, the

debate  may range over the proposed amendments  to

clause  26 and also over the principle whether  or

not  a  trade  union should be represented  by  an

advocate and solicitor.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support   the  creation  of  Industrial  Relations

Officers to assist trade unions in negotiations or

in arbitration proceedings before the Court. But I

would like to inform this House that an Industrial

Relations  Officer is a servant of the Government.

He  is under the directive of the Commissioner for

Labour  and,  through him, the Minister.  When  an

Industrial  Relations Officer  is  selected  by  a

trade   union   to  represent  it  in  arbitration

proceedings, is it understood that he is  for  the

time being working for that particular union,  and

taking  orders  and directives  from  that  union,

without  being encumbered with a higher  directive

that the Industrial Relations Officer shall not go

beyond this?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can assure the

Member   for  Cairnhill  that  it  is  never   our

intention  to try to appoint stooges as Industrial

Relations  Officers. They will  have  a  perfectly

free  hand in espousing the cause of unions before

the Arbitration Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Cairnhill, who used to be an absentee overlord in the Ministry of

Labour,  knows  very  well that  in  the  Ministry

itself  there  is a Labour Court and  there  is  a

President  of the Labour Court. He has the  powers

of a Magistrate, and he is designated an Assistant

Commissioner  for  Labour. I  would  not  want  to

impute anything against anybody, but I do not  for

a  moment believe that it has ever been the policy

of  the Government ever to threaten this person in

the  exercise of his discretion when he sits as  a

President  of the Labour Court. The same  position

will  obtain  with regard to Industrial  Relations

Officers.  When they are selected by  the  unions,

they  will  have a completely free hand to  handle

the  unions representations before the Arbitration

Court.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, what I said just now was

an  attempt  to  save  the  Government  from  some

embarrassment.  I  did  not  impute   any   motive

whatsoever.  I  said that if it is  known  to  the

unions  that  an Industrial Relations  Officer  is

there  for  them  to use as they like  during  the

course at the proceedings, the Government would be

saved  from embarrassment. The trade unions cannot

say:

"Well,  who  is  that man? He has received  orders

from so and so that he should only go that far and

no farther." Sir, I have helped the Government out

of a predicament.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, we have got to get on

with our work. I do not think that the Member  for

Cairnhill  is  really so serious  as  to  want  to

concern  himself with saving this Government  from

any  embarrassment. This Government can always  be

trusted to do its duty and to do it wisely.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 3, lines 27 and 28, to leave out "not be

deemed to be a public servant but" and insert  "be

deemed to be a public servant and".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of this amendment

is  to  find  out  why  it is necessary  that  the

President of the Court shall not be deemed to be a

public  servant.  As  he will  be  holding  public

office,  he normally will be considered  a  public

servant.  Is  there  any special  reason  why  the

President  of  the  Industrial  Arbitration  Court

should not be a public servant?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already

referred  to  clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill  when  I

replied  to the debate on the Second Reading.  For

the  information of the Member for Farrer Park,  I

would  like to draw his attention to clause 3  (1)

of  the  Bill,  which provides that the  President

shall  be appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

in   accordance  with  the  advice  of  the  Prime

Minister.  A similar power of appointment  appears

in  the Constitution in respect of the appointment

of  the  Chief  Justice.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the

purpose  of this provision - that "The President  of

the  Court  shall not be deemed  to  be  a  public

servant" - is to shut out this appointment from  the

provisions  of the procedure that is  followed  in

appointments to the ordinary public service. It is

intended  that  the President of the  Court  shall

have  the same rights, privileges, protection  and

immunity  as  a  Judge of the  Supreme  Court.  As

Members  are  aware, the office of a Judge,  under

our  Constitution, is not a public office.  It  is

not   intended  that  this  official   should   be

appointed  by  the  Legal Service  Commission;  so

that,  Mr Speaker, Sir, we have used these  words

to  make it clear that this appointment will be an

appointment made by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>



the advice of the Prime Minister, and that it will

be  outside  the provisions of the Public  Service

Commission's  procedure  with  regard  to   public

appointments.  There is nothing  sinister  in  our

proposal, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not think there has been such

an allegation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Not the way we look at it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I understand the

Constitution, Judges are not supposed to be public

officers  for the purposes of appointment  by  the

Public  Service Commission. It is limited to  that

specific purpose. But in every other aspect,  they

shall  be public servants. If I am right  in  that

contention, Mr Speaker, Sir, a Judge of the  High

Court  is a public servant, and the Chief  Justice

is  a  public servant for every purpose other than

an  appointment by the Public Service  Commission.

If  it is quite clear from the Ordinance that  the

President of this Court shall be appointed by  the

Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara in  accordance  with  the

advice  of  the  Prime Minister,  why  should  the

President of the Court not be a public servant for

all purposes?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under our

Constitution  a public Servant is not  defined  at

all.  The  Constitution defines a  public  office.

"Public office", for the information of the Member

for  Farrer  Park, according to our  Constitution,

means  "any  office  of emolument  in  the  public

service".  "Public officer" means "the  holder  of

any  public  office"  and  `"public  service",  in

relation to service on or after the appointed day,

means  service under the Government of  Singapore,

or service as a Judge of the Supreme Court or as a

judge  or magistrate of a subordinate court;  and,

in  relation to service before the appointed  day,

shall be similarly construed.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In section 75 (b) of Part IX of the Constitution

dealing  with  the Public Services, it  is  stated

that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'the expression "public office" shall not

include the following offices, that is to say:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the office of Judge of the Supreme Court;';



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



and  I  am advised by our legal officers that  the

Judges  do not hold public offices except for  the

purposes of their pension rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the intention here is that the

President  shall  be appointed  by  the  Yang  di-

Pertuan  Negara  acting  in  accordance  with  the

advice  of  the  Prime Minister.  The  Member  for

Farrer  Park  wanted  to know  why  the  President

should  not  be a public servant. I am advised  by

the  law  officers of the Crown that the President

of  this  Court is a judicial officer and  he  has

powers of supervising the procedure in this  Court

or  punishing contempt under clause 54 of the Bill

and he has got all the powers which appertain to a

Judge.  For that reason, it is not desirable  that

there  should  be any declaration in  this  clause

that the President should be a public servant. For

that  reason, we have chosen the form of words  as

appears in clause 4.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with respect, if

that  were the intention of the Minister, all that

need  to be said would be: "The President  of  the

Court  shall  have  the same  rights,  privileges,

protection and immunity as a Judge of the  Supreme

Court."   I,  therefore,  must  assume  that   the

Minister is not using the words "President of  the

Court shall not deemed to be a public servant"  as

mere verbiage. I must assume those words to have a

special significance over and above the expression

"The  President  of  the  Court  having  the  same

rights,   privileges,  protection ...".   If   the

President  of  the Court is not  deemed  to  be  a

public  servant,  then  could  a  Member  of  this

Legislature become the President of the Court?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have pointed

out   just  now  in  the  definition  of   "public

service",  it  has  been  made  quite  clear  that

"public   service"   means   service   under   the

Government of Singapore or service as a  Judge  of

the  Supreme  Court. He is in the public  service,

there  is no doubt about that. But it is usual  in

penal  statutes to provide that officers  discharg

ing  executive functions shall be public  servants

for the purpose of exercising



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



those  powers. Mr Speaker, Sir, in this case  the

President will, in fact, be discharging the duties

of  a  Judge, and it is not usual to provide that,

in the case of the appointment of a Judge, he will

be  liable  under  the penalties provided  in  the

Penal  Code  if  he  does not act  properly  as  a

judicial  officer. It is for this reason  that  we

have  been advised that it will be proper  to  use

the  form of words that appears in clause  4,  and

that  these  words "shall not be deemed  to  be  a

public servant" are included there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not satisfied

with  the  Minister's  explanation.  Sir,  in  our

Constitution  it is provided that Members  of  the

Assembly  are deemed not to hold public office  by

virtue  of the fact that they are Members  of  the

Assembly. As clause 4 stands, the President of the

Court  shall not be deemed to be a public servant,

so  it will be quite possible for the Minister  to

appoint  somebody  from this Assembly  to  be  the

President of the Industrial Relations Court. If he

does  so, that person can retain his seat in  this

Assembly and still be President of the Court. I am

not  saying  that  it  will  happen,  but  it   is

possible.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is, of course, possible to

postpone consideration of clause 4. Is it agreed

then that we postpone consideration of this clause

until we have dealt with the other clauses?

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further consideration of clause 4 postponed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 5, line 24, to leave out "an order made

under".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a small drafting

amendment. Under the new provisions which  we  are

putting into clause 54, the disqualification  will

follow  from  the  fact that the person  has  been

punished for contempt, and not from the order that

the union be de-registered as it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>



is  under  clause 56. It is an amendment which  is

necessary,  as  the  Government  now  proposes  to

negative the provisions of clause 56.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In that event, shall we then deal

with that amendment as 1 have indicated on page 56

of  the  Order Paper Supplement? That is that  the

figure   "56"  be  altered  to  read  "54".   This

amendment  is  necessitated by  the  amendment  to

clause  54  and the deletion of clause 56  of  the

Bill.  We will then deal with that amendment under

the provisions of Standing Order 71(11).

Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 5, line 29, at end, to add-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(f) is a

committee member of a political party or of

any of its branches,".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this particular clause deals with the

disqualification of a person to become a member of

a  panel of the Court. We feel that, particularly

in   trade   disputes  where  the  law  has   been

introduced  to  see  that  there  should  nor   be

unnecessary  industrial strife, committee  members

of  political  parties or any  of  their  branches

should be debarred from holding office. This  does

not mean to say, Sir, that we think the Government

will  do such a thing - putting in committee members

of  political parties - but we do say that it  would

be  a  good  thing  if we could take  a  political

figure out of the panel of the Court.

Member  for Cairnhill whether he believes  that  a

committee member of a political party or of any of

its   branches  is  necessarily  a   person   with

prejudices? Surely such a person can be fair if he

is appointed to such a panel. Mr Speaker, Sir, if

it   is   found  that  he  has  not  been   acting

impartially, there is already provision in  clause

9 (2) for the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to remove him

from the panel on the grounds that he is not a fit

and proper person to be selected to constitute the

Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government considers that

it is very unfair to place



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



such a restriction on a person just because he  is

a  committee  member  of a political  party  or  a

committee member of a branch of a political party.

The fact that he is occupying that position should

not exclude him from the panel on either side.  If

he  is  a  person  who  is good  enough  to  be  a

committee  member of a political party or  of  its

branch, he is equally good enough to be on a panel

like this, either on the employer's side or on the

union's  side. If he shows that he is a prejudiced

person  and  is  unfit to continue  to  hold  that

office,  there are provisions to remove  him  from

the   panel.   Surely   that   is   a   reasonable

proposition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Somewhere in this Bill, Sir, it is

said  that  the proceedings before the  Industrial

Arbitration  Court shall be deemed to be  judicial

proceedings. I just cannot lay my hands on  it  at

the   moment,  but  I  think  it  does  say   that

somewhere.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, as the  proceedings

before   the  Industrial  Arbitration  Court   are

judicial proceedings, the three persons who sit on

it  are  therefore persons carrying out  functions

appertaining to judicial proceedings. One does not

suggest that in every case things could go  wrong,

but the main thing about a Court, Mr Speaker,  is

that  its composition should be such that it would

inspire confidence in both the parties before  the

Court, and if the composition of the Court is such

that that confidence is lacking either on one side

or  on  the  other, then I think  the  composition

should be looked into. It is being suggested  from

this  side of the House that if members of  either

panel   are   known  to  be  active   politicians.

particularly politicians in the industrial  field,

then  one side or the other is not going  to  have

confidence in that particular member, and as  soon

as  confidence  is lost in that respect,  then  it

could  well be that the award might not be to  the

satisfaction  of  one of the  parties  before  the

Court.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Has the hon. Member clause 69 in

mind?  It is not quite the same as stated  by  the

hon. Member. Clause 69 reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Proceedings before the Court shall be deemed to

be  judicial proceedings for the purposes  of  the

Penal Code...".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes, I probably had that in mind,

Sir, but possibly that does not cover the point  I

have  raised.  The  Minister  has  said  that  the

President should be treated as a judicial  officer

and  the  persons who sit beside him too  take  on

that mantle.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Member for Farrer Park

must  draw a distinction between those members  on

the  employer's  panel and those  on  the  union's

panel, and the President of the Court. It would be

inhuman to expect employers to have confidence  in

the people on the employee's panel. Similarly,  it

is  unheard  of  to  expect  the  unions  to  have

confidence  in  those  members  who  are  on   the

employer's panel. The very fact that you  classify

the  two  types  in this way means that  they  are

people  who, by statute or otherwise, are  closely

in  touch with, and are probably in sympathy with,

the  views and problems of employers or unions  as

the  case  may  be;  and the only  person  we  can

reasonably  expect both parties to - and  indeed  we

must   expect   both   parties  to - have   absolute

confidence   in   in   integrity,   fairness   and

impartiality is the President himself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> While accepting what the Hon, the

Prime Minister has said, I think the matter goes a

little beyond what he has said. It is not merely a

question of being a member of the employee's panel

or   the   employer's  panel.  There  are  several

political  parties in Singapore. Some parties  are

affiliated  to certain unions and some unions  are

affiliated to other parties. Now if a union, shall

we  say  belonging to political party  X,  has  an

industrial   grievance   and   goes   before   the

Industrial Arbitration Court and a member  who  is

actively connected with political party A  is  put

on, then, Mr Speaker, Sir, my point is clear.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> It can act the other way also, Mr

Speaker,  Sir. The employer can be a member  of  a

political  party, and we say that on  balance  the

Court  is tripartite. It does not follow,  to  our

way  of thinking - and we are accused of being  very

illiberal  in  these  matters - that  a  person   is

necessarily prejudiced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>



on  a  panel  like  this  just  because  he  is  a

committee member of a political party.  If  it  is

found,  by his attitude, that he is not a fit  and

proper  person,  then  there  is  provision  under

clause  39 (2) to remove him from that panel,  but

we  cannot accept the proposition that anybody who

is  a  member of a political party is a prejudiced

person  and therefore unfit to be a member of  the

panel on either side.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I did not say "any member

of  a political party". I said "a committee member

of  a  political party". Sir, I do urge  upon  the

Government   that   it  is  desirable   that   the

participants  as  well as the Court  should  bring

about  an  atmosphere of calmness without bringing

political    implications   into   any    dispute.

Therefore, in order to avoid any unhappy incidents

that  may  arise in the future, would  it  not  be

better that we take committee members of political

parties out of the Court?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if we have

a  situation in Singapore, which obtains  in  some

Western countries, where there is an abundance  of

public-spirited  people both in political  parties

and   in   trade  unions  and  so  on,  it   might

conceivably be possible that we might want  to  go

to   considerable   lengths   to   establish   the

unbiasness of any particular member either on  the

employer's  or on the union's panel. But  I  think

the Member for Cairnhill is well aware of the fact

that  we  are not in that fortunate position.  The

number of people who are actively prepared to take

a  leading  part  in  trade  union  and  political

activities  is  fairly limited. On  the  basis  of

purely  academic and theoretical debate, to strike

out  or  exclude a whole class of persons who  are

likely to be of some value because of their  trade

union  experiences, interests,  and  so  on,  just

because they happen to be committee members  of  a

political   party  is,  I  think,  an  unnecessary

restriction  on  the  choice.  Surely  it  is  not

suggested that trade unionists, who are interested

enough in the political future of Singapore to  be

members of a political party, should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



thereby become sufficiently tainted with bias as

to be disqualified from being a member of the

union's panel?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7, as amended, ordered to stand part of

the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9-



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 5, line 45, at end, to add-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(d) has

become permanently incapable

of discharging the functions of a member of the Court.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dealing with this amendment, Sir, may I also

bring in the following amendment because it is

relevant:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) In page 6, to leave out lines 1 to 6

inclusive.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I said during the Second

Reading of the Bill that the power to appoint must

carry  with  it also the power to remove.  In  the

appointment  of  members to  both  panels  of  the

Court,  there  are  certain  disqualifications  in

clause  7.  So  long as a person is  nominated  by

either  body, it does not come within the  meaning

of  that clause, and unless the Minister is of the

opinion that the person to be appointed by him  is

a  fit and proper person, such person will not  be

appointed.  Therefore, once the  Minister  has  so

considered  that  a person is  a  fit  and  proper

person to be appointed to a panel of the Court  of

Arbitration,  I see no reason why we should  bring

in  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara to have a  say  in

that  he  is  of  the opinion that the  Minister's

opinion  is not a good opinion; and we know,  Sir,

constitutionally, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  only

acts  on  the  advice of the Minister.  Therefore,

such  a  thing can only happen and may happen:  if

the  Minister, having considered a man to be a fit

and  proper person, appoints him to the Court  and

then  finds that that person is not carrying  out,

shall  we  say, the duties to his liking,  he  may

then advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to say that

that person should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



be  removed because the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  is

of  the opinion, on the advice of the Minister for

Labour  and Law, that that person is no  longer  a

fit and proper person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sub-clause (2) (a) deals with the removal

by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara of a person who "has

become  permanently incapable of  discharging  the

functions  of  a member of the Court".  Sir,  such

duties  should not devolve on the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara.  If  a  person is permanently handicapped,

surely it is easy and free for the Minister to put

in  the  sub-clause proposed by me,  that  when  a

person  has  become handicapped  to  that  extent,

therefore  the Minister shall remove  him  from  a

panel of the Court.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is on sub-clause 2. Under sub-clause 2 (a),

that  job  can  be  done by the  Minister  without

trouble,  there  can  be no  argument  whatsoever.

Whereas sub-clause 2 (b) is entirely different.  I

have  said that the Minister will never appoint  a

man  to  serve on the panel unless he  is  of  the

opinion  that  that person is  a  fit  and  proper

person. Having made that opinion, he should  stick

to  it and not bring in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

to say that the Minister is wrong in his opinion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,

"That  the  words proposed to be added,  be  there

added",  and the debate may range over the  second

amendment, that is:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 6, to leave out lines 1 to 6 inclusive.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, may I first say that it

is  a spurious hypothesis to say that the power of

appointment carries with it the power of  removal?

In  quite  a  number of judicial and semi-judicial

appointments,  the person who  has  the  power  of

appointment  does not have the power  of  removal.

For instance, take the case of Puisne Judges. They

are  appointed according to the Constitution - by  a

panel of Judges. But the Judges by themselves have

no right to remove. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



is  to give the appointee greater protection  from

the  caprice  of  the person or persons  who  have

appointed   him,  that  certain  formalities   are

required before a person is removed. Far from  the

Minister  wishing to abuse his power of appointing

a  person to a panel, it is, in fact, designed  to

safeguard  the  person who has been  so  appointed

from  being  easily removed.  In  the  case  of  a

removal,  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara  has  to  be

advised   by   the   relevant   Minister,    after

consultation  with  the  whole  Cabinet,  that   a

person, having been already appointed, should  not

be  so  flippantly removed. That  is  exactly  the

purpose of having the power of removal in  a  more

solemn form than the power of appointment.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my second

amendment lays down that there shall be no removal

whatsoever  on  the grounds of a person's  fitness

from  the membership of the panel. I did  not  say

that  the Minister should have that power. It  was

wrong.  Once  the Minister has formed an  opinion,

let  that  opinion stand. The Prime  Minister  has

said  that  it is a spurious hypothesis  that  the

power of appointment carries with it the power  of

removal.  I  am  no  lawyer  myself,  Sir,  but  I

remember, when I was sitting on the other side  of

the House and the hon. Member on this side, and we

were arguing on a Bill, that it was he himself who

said that surely the power to appoint carries with

it the power to remove.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I do not know in what

context  I  was  quoted - or rather  misquoted.  But

there  is  a simple elementary device whereby,  if

one  wishes  to protect the appointee  from  being

removed  at  the  caprice of  the  appointer,  the

removal   must  go  through  a  more  solemn   and

intricate process. For this reason, if we were  to

apply  the  ordinary  principle  whereby  for  the

lesser  offices  of  the  State,  the  person  who

appoints  also has the power to remove, it  would,

in  fact, be giving the appointee less protection.

But  we  are not going to hamper ourselves in  the

case of a member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>



on  the  panel to a point where it must be  proved

beyond any doubt that he is permanently incapable.

In other words, what one will have to do is to get

a  doctor  to certify that something  in  him  has

deteriorated.  As  Members  on  the  other   side,

particularly the Member for Farrer Park, may know,

it is difficult to get a doctor to certify that  a

man's mind has deteriorated; it is not uncommon to

find  people  in high office who everybody  agrees

should no longer be there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the Member for  Cairnhill  has

tried  to  be  logical  in  stating  that  if  the

Minister appoints a fit person, that person should

so  remain  fit. But history has proved  that  the

Chief  Minister of a colonial government  has  not

been  returned as the Prime Minister of the  State

of  Singapore. I was also glad to hear the  Member

say  that he is not a lawyer. I believe he happens

to be an Honorary Doctor of Laws of the University

of Malaya -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not know why these

personalities must creep in in this debate which

is of a very serious nature. The Prime Minister

has set the pace in this debate. Let us keep that

pace.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I am not

mistaken, I think the Member for Cairnh1ll has got

himself involved because he has seen that clause 6

(6)  provides that the Minister must be  satisfied

that  an  appointee  is a fit  and  proper  person

before he is put on the panel. Then he goes on  to

ask,  why should he be removed on the grounds that

he  is  not a fit and proper person when  the  Min

ister  himself has appointed him because of  those

attributes? Mr Speaker, Sir, we are all human and

sometimes we get appointed in a situation where we

might  be  fit  and proper persons  but  later  on

become unfit and improper persons. That being  so,

the Government is very careful to ensure that when

anybody is removed on those grounds, it will  only

be  so after considerable deliberation and not, as

the  Prime  Minister says, at the caprice  of  the

Minister. The whole position of the appointee will

be examined



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>



by  the  Cabinet. And after the Cabinet has  fully

considered  the  matter, the  recommendation  will

then go to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. Surely that

is the proper way of proceeding.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is indeed

very exhilarating to hear the Minister say that he

is  human  and is capable of making mistakes.  And

because of that, Sir, I will not press the issue.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Member withdrawing?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> May I beg leave to withdraw,

Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I take it that the second

amendment* is not to be moved.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> No, I am not moving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 9 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I should be obliged for some

clarification of clause 9 (1) (b):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Minister shall remove from a panel a person

who   accepts  any  relief  afforded  by  law   to

bankrupts or insolvent debtors;",



<br><br>particularly when clause 9 (1) (a) says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Minister shall remove from a panel a person

who  ceases to be eligible to be a member of  that

panel  in  accordance  with  section  7  of   this

Ordinance;",



<br><br>and clause 7 (4) (a) says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A person who is an undischarged bankrupt shall

not be eligible for appointment to a panel."



<br><br>Now, clause 9 (1) (a) says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Minister shall remove from a panel a person

who  ceases to be eligible to be a member of  that

panel  in  accordance  with  section  7  of   this

Ordinance;",



<br><br>so  that when he becomes an undischarged bankrupt,

he  ceases to be eligible. What meaning  then  has

clause 9 (1) (b),  "...accepts any relief afforded  by

law to bankrupts or insolvent debtors"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Sir, clause 7 (4) (a) is a

qualification:  a  person who is  an  undischarged

bankrupt is disqualified from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>



appointment. Clause 9 deals with the removal,  and

clause  7 (4) (a) deals with the position  at  the

time  of  appointment. If it  is  shown  that  the

person  is an undischarged bankrupt, consideration

is  given  as  to whether he should be  appointed;

then  he is disqualified. Clause 9 deals with  the

case  of a removal from a panel of any person who,

say,  accepts  any  relief  afforded  by  law   to

bankrupts or insolvent debtors; such a person  can

be removed. Surely that is a very simple point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I have not found it as simple as

the Minister has found it. Because it seems to  me

that  the  only  way  a person can  accept  relief

afforded by law to bankrupts or insolvent  debtors

is by becoming a bankrupt.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No, Mr Speaker, Sir. Surely -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> That is why the conception of the

expression  "or insolvent debtors"  after  persons

against  whom wage-earners' administration  orders

are made are not called bankrupts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Surely clause 7 deals with

appointments,  and  clause 9 deals  with  removals

from a panel. In clause 7, if it is found that so-and-so   is  an  undischarged  bankrupt,   he   is

disqualified   from   appointment - he   cannot   be

appointed. Now, a person may be perfectly  solvent

at  the  time  of  appointment. Later  he  becomes

insolvent, and so we proceed to remove  him  under

clause  9 (1) (b). That is a very simple state  of

affairs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I accept that. But what then is

clause 9 (1) (a) doing? It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"ceases to be eligible to be a member of that

panel  in  accordance  with  section  7  of   this

Ordinance;".

<br><br>

He  had  already become ineligible  in  accordance

with   clause   7  by  becoming  an   undischarged

bankrupt.  Why, therefore, does clause 9  (1)  (b)

say,  "accepts  any  relief  afforded  by  law  to

bankrupts or insolvent debtors"?





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in all cases, the

person ceases to be eligible to be a member  of  a

panel  in  accordance with clause 7. If he  is  of

unsound  mind, nobody will appoint him. If  he  is

appointed  and then becomes of unsound mind,  then

we will remove him under clause 9 (1) (a).



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> May I carry on a step further from

where the Minister has left off, Sir? If he were

an undischarged bankrupt at the time of

appointment, he would be appointed -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No!

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> If he were an undischarged bankrupt at

the time of appointment -

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> He cannot be appointed.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Let the hon. Member

continue. I think the Member for Farrer Park is

too much involved for the Minister perhaps to

unravel the involvement!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, if a person is not a bankrupt, in

other  words, he is not an undischarged  bankrupt,

he  is eligible for appointment under clause 7. So

he is appointed. Subsequent to the appointment, he

becomes a bankrupt. Therefore, the Minister acting

under  clause 9 (1) (a), can remove  him.  He  can

remove  persons  of unsound mind.  He  can  remove

persons who cease to be citizens of Singapore.  He

can   also   remove   persons  who   have   become

undischarged  bankrupts.  So  why   then   is   it

necessary to have clause 9 (1) (b)? The suggestion

I  am making, Mr Speaker, Sir, is this: paragraph

(b) could be deleted. Yet, if after appointment  a

person  becomes  an  undischarged  bankrupt,   the

Minister could act under clause 9 (1) (a).



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Member for Farrer Park,

if  he is suggesting that paragraph (b) should  be

deleted,  is  too  late. He ought  to  have  given

notice  of  an amendment, "to leave out  paragraph

(b)"  and then a debate could properly have  taken

place.  At  the  moment, we are on  the  Question,

"That clause 9



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>



stand  part  of the Bill", and the debate  thereon

must be a debate on the principle of the clause.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> He has missed the bus!



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I have not missed the bus. It is a

question  of whether clause 9 (1) (b) is necessary

to  carry the meaning of the Bill any further.  It

does  not detract from the Bill in any way. All  I

wanted  to know was whether clause 9 (1) (b)  took

it any further than clause 7 (4) (a).



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> It is the intention of the Member for

Farrer Park to tell us that we have said the  same

thing  twice and that we could have done it  in  a

much shorter time. But we would say that it is put

there  to  make it doubly clear. That  is  why  it

appears here, because clause 9 (1) (b) is the same

as  clause  9  (1)  (a) as far as an  undischarged

bankrupt is concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I add that clause 9 (1)

(b)  envisages  a  situation where,  although  the

person  has  never  become a bankrupt,  he  is  an

insolvent debtor - one who avoids bankruptcy by  any

one   of  the  means  (composition  or  otherwise)

be  removed if it is discovered that as  a  member

appointed to the panel, he is owing people a large

sum  of  money  and  he arrives at  a  composition

before  he  is declared a bankrupt. Surely  it  is

desirable  to  remove  him.  Clause  9   (1)   (b)

therefore envisages a situation where, although  a

man  may  not  be adjudged a bankrupt,  he  is  an

insolvent debtor or one who has avoided bankruptcy

by  the  grace of God; and we may not wish him  to

remain on the panel.

Clause 11-

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The first five amendments, Mr

Speaker, Sir, are just drafting amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 6, line 17, to leave out "workmen" and

insert "employees".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the expression "employees" is

used  in the Bill except in the expression  "trade

union  of workmen". It is now considered that  the

expression  "employees" should be used  throughout

the  Bill.  It is proposed to use this expression,

where appropriate, in future labour legislation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I merely want

further  information. The Minister says  it  is  a

drafting amendment. As the debate goes on further,

I  will  show that it is not entirely  a  drafting

amendment. Mr Speaker, Sir, if you look at page 3

of the draft Bill, the definition of "trade union"

has not been amended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"Trade union" means a trade union of workmen or

employers registered under any written law for the

time  being  in force relating to the registration

of trade unions.'



<br><br>As  the  debate progresses, Mr Speaker, you  will

find  that  the  word "trade  union"  is  used  on

several occasions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The expression "employees" is used in

the Bill except in the expression "trade union  of

workmen". It is now considered that the expression

"employees" should be used throughout the Bill. It

is   proposed   to   use  the  expression,   where

appropriate, in future labour legislation. We  use

the   word  "employees"  in  place  of  the   word

"workmen".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Minister suggesting that

the  definition of "trade union" in page  3  ought

also  to  be  amended to read "trade union"  means

"trade union of employees or employers"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In that event, we will deal with

that  suggested amendment under the provisions  of

Standing Order 71 (11) in due course. We will make

a  note  of that. That covers the point raised  by

the Member for Farrer Park.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It does.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 6, line 20, to leave out "and trade

unions of employers".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will be moving an amendment

to clause 16 for the deletion of all references to

trade   unions   of  employers.  I  have   already

explained to the House that the Government intends

to  restrict  the collective bargaining  procedure

and  procedure  before  the arbitration  court  to

single   employers  and  to  a  trade   union   of

employees.  As  I  have already explained  to  the

House,  a trade union of employers would enjoy,  a

superior   bargaining   position   in   collective

bargaining  to  a  trade union of  employees.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  it  is common  knowledge  that  in

industry  at  the  present time,  there  are  some

employers  in the same industry who are in  unions

and some who are not. If the employers who are  in

trade unions enter into collective agreements,  it

might  be  that the rates which have  been  agreed

might be such that those employers who are not  in

trade  unions will not be able to pay. If that  is

so,  then the employers who are not in the  unions

may  be put out of business, and the result  would

be that the workers would be the persons who would

suffer.  So  we  have decided that this  procedure

should  be open only to a trade union of employees

and single employers. If I am not mistaken, during

the  debate  on the Second Reading,  I  think  the

Member  for  Cairnhill posed this  question.  What

would  happen,  he asked, if there  were  a  trade

union  of  employers which enters into  collective

agreements   with   a  trade  union   of   workmen

representative  of  workmen scattered  throughout,

say,  different industries? Would the trade  union

of  employers have to conclude separate agreements

with the same trade union of employees? The answer

now is to be found in the amendment that I will be

moving,  that  is, that the collective  bargaining

procedure  should be open only to single employers

and a trade union of employees.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Since it has been proposed

that  all  references to trade unions of employers

should  be  deleted from this Bill, I submit  that

the  definition "trade union" should  also  be  so

amended. Or it might be that there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



need  be  no definition at all, because  with  the

present definition as it stands, a trade union can

be a trade union of employees - even if the Minister

were  to change "workmen" to "employees" -  and also

a  trade union of employers. In many places in the

Bill,  reference is made to "a trade union", which

can  be  taken to imply that it can  be  "a  trade

union   of   employees"  or  "a  trade  union   of

employers".   So  if  one  were  to   remove   all

references   to  "a  trade  union  of  employers",

therefore the definition of "trade union"  has  to

be  amended. And if it is amended. I think it will

be  less cumbersome if all references to a  "trade

union  of  employees" can just be described  as  a

"trade union", so that there could be consistency,

because  in  some places it is "a trade  union  of

employees" and in other places "a trade union".

the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 19 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think

there is some confusion in clause 19 (1). Although

I  have  not tabled an amendment, I would like  to

seek the views of the Minister on this sub-clause.

According  to my reading of it, if one union  were

to  serve notice on four employers and if  in  the

case  of  three employers, an agreement  had  been

reached, but in the case of the fourth



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



employer, no agreement had been reached, the union

may report to the Commissioner all the matters  in

dispute,  and  not only that matter  on  which  no

agreement had been reached. Here again, there is a

time  limit of 14 days. It says here that  a  time

limit of 14 days shall apply to the latest date of

the last notice on the last employer. Would it not

be clearer if we were to limit this particular sub-clause to just one union and one employer? So long

as  that union and that employer have not come  to

agreement  during negotiations, that matter  shall

be  reported. If it were to be a union  and  three

employers where agreement had not been reached  in

all  three  cases,  surely the  union  would  then

report to the Commissioner for Labour. The fact as

it  stands  is  that if one union has  reached  an

agreement  with two employers but has not  reached

an  agreement with the third employer,  the  whole

thing  is  in the melting pot. And vice  versa  in

case  an  employer  settles the dispute  with  one

union but not with the other two unions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in clause 16, a

notice will be served by a trade union on a single

employer. That is to say, in the case of  a  trade

union   which  is  negotiating  with  say,   three

employers,  there  will be three separate  notices

served, one on each employer, so that if agreement

is reached with two employers and agreement is not

reached  with the third employer, then the  issues

will  die  as  far as the first two employers  are

concerned,  and will still exist  as  far  as  the

third  employer  is concerned.  So  where  is  the

difficulty, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the wording

here is very clear:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"a collective agreement has not been reached

between all the trade unions and employers by whom

and  upon whom the notice was served as to all the

industrial matters set out in the invitation".

<br><br>

So  that covers all. But if you just limit  it  to

one particular notice, irrespective of whether  it

is  an  employer  serving on a union  or  a  union

serving on an employer, then this only applies  to

that  particular  notice without  making  it  more

confusing  by bringing in notices which  the  same

union may serve on other employers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it would be

advisable  to  amend  it in the  terms  which  the

Member for Cairnhill has suggested.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We are now on the Question,

"That  clause  19  stand part of  the  Bill"  and,

therefore,  it is too late to move any amendments.

to  recommit the Bill when it is reported  to  the

Assembly   after   consideration   in   Committee.

Recommittal can take place under the provisions of

consider the point in due course.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 9, line 40, to leave out "19" and insert

"20".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to correct a mistake, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is notice of a similar

amendment in the name of Tun Lim Yew Hock.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 10, line 1, to leave out "may be given

orally or" and insert "shall be".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in regard to this particular clause, this

will  only  apply when clause 18 or 20 comes  into

operation. When the Commissioner becomes aware  of

a  dispute, he will then notify the Minister,  and

it  will be left to the Minister whether or not to

direct  the Commissioner then and there to  notify

the  Registrar. The same thing applies  to  clause

20. But if the Minister feels that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



a  further attempt should be made to bring about a

settlement  of  the dispute through  conciliation,

and  he  exercises his powers under clause 21,  he

will direct that the parties concerned should come

to a conference.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sub-clause (2) , Sir, says that a direction

of  the Minister may be given orally or in writing

signed by the Minister. Sir, we have been informed

that  the  present Government, in their desire  to

bring their Back-benchers closer to the Government

have allotted a certain number of them to jobs  in

each  Ministry. It has happened - so it was reported

to  me - that  those  Assemblymen  who  are  in  the

Ministry  of  Labour and Law have  taken  it  upon

themselves to give directives in the name  of  the

Minister - that the Minister wants this and that  to

be  done, and that the Minister would be happy  if

such and such a thing could be done. Therefore, to

prevent  a  cross-current of directives issued  by

the   Minister  through  the  Assemblymen  in  the

Ministry,  I feel that such directives  should  be

given   in   writing  so  that  the   enthusiastic

Assemblymen in the particular Ministry may not  be

tempted to use the powers of the Minister and give

an oral directive, saying that the Minister has so

directed.  But if it is in writing, it  is  clear,

and  the  person receiving such a directive  shall

have  to take heed. I do not see any reason why  a

person  should be so directed by just an  ordinary

Back-bencher using the name of the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is necessary for

the person whom the Minister directs to preside at

a   conciliation  conference  to  be  given  these

powers. Mr Speaker, Sir, it often happens that if

a  conciliation is to be effected, we must be able

to  get all the parties together as soon as we can

and  there is no reason why any instruction should

be  given  only in writing. It could be done  over

the telephone and, so long as it is understood  to

be  an  instruction  that they attend  before  the

Minister, that should be sufficient. If  there  is

any doubt that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>



the  person  who  has  been  summoned  before  the

Minister is likely not to attend, you can be  sure

that  the Minister will follow up that instruction

with  a written request that he turns up but I  do

not  see  any  reason why the Minister  should  be

denied  these  powers  if conciliation  is  to  be

effected.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I have not suggested in

any  way  that the Minister should be  denied  the

power, but I have suggested, and do suggest again,

that  such  direction given to a person should  be

made in writing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the days when the

Member  for  Cairnhill was  the  overlord  of  the

Labour  Ministry are all over - thank God for  that!

If  he wants to know, we work there from half-past

eight in the morning right up to about six in  the

evening, and there is not only one person working.

There  is the Minister, there is the Parliamentary

Secretary, there is the Political Secretary, there

are  all the Assemblymen in addition to the  civil

servants working at every hour of the day. We have

even  put  officers on duty every night  from  six

o'clock  in the evening to 8.30 the next  morning,

and  they  are on call in case of labour disputes.

There  was a time when the overlord used to appear

there  at about 3.30 p.m., and he had an assistant

who  was  ensconced in an office. Nobody saw  that

assistant. Those days are over. The Minister  must

be  in  a  position, if there is a  trade  dispute

likely  to lead to a strike, to be able to get  on

to  his phone and to summon the employers and  the

trade unions. Is there anything wrong in that?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> All that still does not reply

to  what  I  have  said about  P.A.P.  Assemblymen

sitting inside the Labour Ministry using the  name

of  the  Minister  when issuing  orders.  Has  the

Minister so delegated his powers to all the  Back-

benchers who are inside the Ministry of Labour? If

he  has  not,  why should they be  there  to  give

orders to employers and trade unions alike? Or are

they  now  saying  that no such orders  have  been

given?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, they are all

entrusted  by  the  Minister  with  the  work   of

conciliation, and if they send for the parties,  I

see nothing objectionable in that. They are acting

in  the name of the Minister, and clause 21  would

expressly give them that power because they  would

be acting on the instructions of the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am indeed very surprised,

Sir, that the Minister can delegate his powers  to

one  who  is not even a civil servant - to  a  Back-bencher  of  the P.A.P. How could such  powers  be

delegated to him?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the purpose of

conciliation,  any  person  who  can  assist   the

Ministry   effectively  can  bring   the   parties

together and get them to come to a settlement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, the provisions contained in

clause 21(1) are fairly serious because sub-clause

(4) provides that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A person who, on being directed under subsection

(1)  of  this section, fails without lawful excuse

to attend a conference ...shall be guilty of an offence...".



<br><br>That  being so, it is quite important to know from

whom  the  direction emanates and to  whom  it  is

given.  It is a matter of some importance  to  the

person  to  whom the direction is given,  that  it

should  come from the proper person. I  understand

the  Minister to say that anybody in his  Ministry

could give the direction. Is that the position?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I never for a

moment   suggested  that.  I  said  that   if   an

Assemblyman was asked to act as a conciliator,  it

could be done on the instructions of the Minister,

and  if  anybody  was  summoned  he  would  be  so

summoned  on the instructions of the Minister.  It

is quite obvious that such powers are necessary in

an  emergency when it is very necessary to get the

parties  together as soon as you can. If you  have

sufficient time to get them together and if  there

is no urgency about the matter, I think the proper

course   to  be  followed  is  to  send  them   an

invitation  in  writing. If that cannot  be  done,

then it must be done over the phone.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I think we will be satisfied if the

Minister  says that the direction under sub-clause

(2)  will be given either orally or in writing  by

the   Minister  himself,  because,   unless   that

happens, Mr Speaker, Sir, the proviso under  sub-clause (4) would not follow in law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Opposition is

just   trying - pardon  me  for  saying   so - to   be

difficult.  These instructions could be  given  by

anybody.  I  could  have my Secretary  give  these

instructions  on  my  behalf.  I  could   ask   my

Secretary to telephone the parties and ask them to

come  in. They know that she is my Secretary,  and

they  will  duly  come in. What is the  difficulty

about that?

Tamil.  Therefore, in order to make that intention

clear in clause 23, I have ventured to propose the

his mind that I put in this amendment just to cash

in  on him. I know that the Government intends  to

do  it,  but as the Minister himself is human,  he

has overlooked it.

they do so, it will be necessary for copies to  be

made  of that agreement, and the copies will  have

to  be in Malay. English, Chinese and Tamil.  Does

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister referred to in this particular

paragraph is the Minister for Finance, and  it  is

necessary to have this amendment in order  not  to

confuse this particular Minister with the Minister

in charge of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

referred to there is not the Minister for Finance,

but  the  Minister  in whose portfolio  this  Bill

lies.  That Minister, Mr Speaker, is the Minister

who  is notified that a trade dispute exists,  and

is  so notified under the provisions of clauses 18

(4) and 20 (b); so that the Minister there clearly

is the Minister for Labour and Law who is notified

that a trade dispute exists.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With respect, Sir, I do not

think  so.  That is why this particular clause  is

brought  in.  For  the  purpose  of  treating  the

Government  as  an  employer,  the  Minister   for

Finance  shall  be  the  representative   of   the

Government.  And for the purpose  of  serving  the

Government  as  an  employer,  it  can  be  anyone

designated by the Minister for Finance. It can  be

the   Permanent  Secretary  in  the  Establishment

Branch,  or  it can be the Permanent Secretary  in

the  Treasury Branch. This has nothing to do  with

the Minister for Labour and Law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot understand

why  the  Member  for Cairnhill is  trying  to  be

difficult  this afternoon. When there is  a  trade

dispute,  somebody  has got to  be  informed;  the

Commissioner  for Labour has certain functions  to

perform - he has to notify the Minister. If you will

look at clause 18 (4), if there is a trade dispute

and  if any party refuses to negotiate, it is  the

duty of the Commissioner for Labour to notify  the

Minister. And the notification in regard  to  that

trade  dispute must be to the Minister for  Labour

and Law. Once it is shown that the notification is

in respect of a trade dispute, whether the parties

have  refused  to negotiate or whether  there  has

been a deadlock in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>



the  negotiations, the person to  be  notified  is

obviously the Minister for Labour and Law. But  in

this  case, it is the Minister for Finance who  is

also informed - he is the employer of civil servants

for the purposes of this Bill. The Minister to  be

notified  of  a  trade dispute  is  naturally  the

Minister for Labour and Law.

be  difficult for them to sign jointly  a  request

to  be an amendment, it should be the insertion of

not only the word "jointly" but also the words "or

separately";  so that if both parties  refused  to

sign  the letter jointly but preferred to sign  it

separately, that would be sufficient notification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the hon. Member proposing an

<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Yes, Sir, and I so move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the minds of both

parties  must  be ad idem on this, that  is,  both

must  agree  to refer the dispute to  arbitration;

otherwise it is not possible for a reference to be

made  under the provisions of clause 20 (a).  They

must  so agree and jointly make a request, because

they  both  agree  that the matter  should  go  to

arbitration. And if they separately agree  one  in

one  room, and another in another room, they still

agree.  And once they have agreed, then  there  is

arbitration. I cannot see the difficulty that  the

Member for Tanglin sees in all these matters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, if one party wants to be

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 12, line 9, to leave out from "(b)" to

the end of line 14 and insert "a trade

dispute has been notified to the Registrar by  the

Commissioner in accordance with Part III  of  this

Ordinance;".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I see that the Minister also has an

amendment  to  this clause, but I  would  like  to

explain why I consider my amendment necessary  and

why  the amendment proposed by the Minister is not

in  keeping with clauses 18 and 19 of Part III  of

this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this particular clause there are

several  ways whereby a Court can take  cognizance

of  a  trade dispute. One way is that an  employer

and  a  trade union of employees both  agree  that

they  should  refer  their trade  dispute  to  the

Court,   and  the  Court  then  takes  cognizance.

Paragraph (b), as it stands, says that even though

the Minister may have directed the Commissioner to

notify  the  Registrar of the Court that  a  trade

dispute exists, the President of the Court may, if

he feels that a further attempt at conciliation is

desirable,  not  take  cognizance  of  the   trade

dispute,  but may exercise his power under  clause

29.  As we know, Sir, there is now agreement  that

clause  29 should be deleted. I feel that  once  a

notification has been made to the Registrar of the

Court by the Commissioner on the direction of  the

Minister  in accordance with clause 18  or  clause

20,  then  the Court must take cognizance  of  the

trade dispute.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Honourable Members will have

noticed that the Minister himself has given notice

of art amendment:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 12, to leave out lines 9 to 14 inclusive-

up to that point, both the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



hon. Member for Cairnhill and the Minister are ad

idem. It is only when the amendment moved by the

Member for Cairnhill seeks to insert the words

that there is a "dispute".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will therefore first put the Question, "That

lines  9 to 14 inclusive proposed to be left  out,

be  left out." When that is agreed to, I will then

put  the Question, "That the words proposed to  be

inserted,  be there inserted." A debate  may  then

take  place  on  that Question. I  trust  that  is

convenient to honourable Members?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the words from '(b)' to the end

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the words proposed to

be inserted, be there inserted".



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems to me that

we  are  going over and over again over  the  same

ground. I have taken the trouble to explain to the

House that our intention in removing the whole  of

paragraph   (b)   is  that  we  must   give   some

recognition to the bargaining power of  unions  in

the  process  of  collective bargaining.  We  must

never  give  the impression that arbitrations  are

automatic. That is why, in removing the provisions

of paragraph (b) as we have proposed, we have also

proposed a further amendment to paragraph  (c)  of

the same clause, so that the Minister has an over-

riding right to send any trade dispute, whether it

is  an  ordinary trade dispute or a trade  dispute

affecting  essential services, to arbitration.  He

can  do this at any time, whether at the time when

both  parties refuse to negotiate, or any  of  the

parties refuses to negotiate, or at the time  when

negotiations  deadlock. Whether he has  intervened

in  conciliatory proceedings or not, the  Minister

has that over-riding right to send any dispute  to

arbitration.  We have done that, because  we  must

give some regard to the collective strength of the

unions in the bargaining process. Sometimes with a

little  show  that  they are  determined  to  take

action, the unions might be able to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>



persuade  the employers to see the reasonableness

of  their  demands. That is the reason which  has

induced  us  to  make  these amendments.  If  the

amendment  which  the Member  for  Cairnhill  has

suggested  were  to be made,  that  is  once  the

Minister  has refused to intervene and  it  stops

there - as indicated in clause 18 (4) and clause 20

(b) - then  there will be an automatic notification

to  the Registrar of the Court, in which case the

Court  automatically takes cognizance.  Now  that

could  be  a very dangerous position  to  be  in,

because  it may result in the Court being  bogged

down  with  a  lot of work if the  impression  is

given  that  these arbitrations are automatic.  I

have explained all this, and it is clear from the

amendments proposed that we are giving effect  to

this intention.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a result

of  reading this particular paragraph,  I  tabled

this  amendment, which was submitted to the Clerk

long  before the 10th of February, to ensure that

the  President of the Court shall  not  again  be

given  another  trial.  I  have  said  that   the

Minister himself agrees that clause 29 should  be

disagreed to. There we are together. But if we do

not  have  this amendment to paragraph (b),  then

under  clauses  18 and 20, suppose  the  Minister

wants  to  direct the Commissioner to notify  the

Registrar, where does he come in? Because he does

not  direct. He certifies in the Gazette. If that

is  to  be  by certification, Sir, then I  submit

that clauses 18 and 19, as approved, should be so

amended.  Clauses 18 and 19 say "notification  by

the   Commissioner  on  the  direction   of   the

Minister." If there is to be no direction by  the

Minister  to  the  Commissioner  to  notify   the

Registrar,  then  say  so.  There  need   be   no

direction. It can just be by a certification. But

once  you  have  it in clause 18 and  clause  20,

where  comes  that direction? If a  direction  is

given,  how is it going to be applied  in  clause

28?  I  am just asking that. If it can be applied

by  a  certification, well and good.  But  if  it

cannot,  some  way  must be  found  whereby  such

notification can come under clause 28.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The main point, Mr Speaker,

is this. If the Minister has the power, and it is

the  intention that the Minister should have  the

power,   to  direct  that  a  trade  dispute   be

submitted  to arbitration, it is superfluous  for

the  Commissioner for Labour to have such  power.

If we want to put it in that the Commissioner for

Labour  shall  have  the  power  to  inform   the

Registrar of the Court, then paragraph (c) should

not therefore be amended. Paragraph (c) could  be

left  out  altogether, because the  Minister  can

direct  the Commissioner to notify the Registrar.

What is envisaged in this situation is this: that

parties  to  a  dispute who do not  come  to  any

settlement may or may not find that the  Minister

would  direct that the trade dispute be submitted

to  arbitration. The procedure would be that  the

Minister,  by notice in the Gazette, so  directs,

and  the  administrative procedure would be  that

the Commissioner would be told by the Minister to

inform the Court. The reason why we consider  the

amendment by the Member for Cairnhill to  be  unacceptable is this. It would, in fact, mean a re-establishment of the original position,  and  the

original  position envisaged  in  this  Bill  was

deadlock and automatic cognizance by the Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, by this amendment, moved away from that

original  position, in that we  foresee  possible

recalcitrants, either on the part of the union or

the  employer, not wanting to reach a  settlement

by  negotiation,  because the recalcitrant  party

knows  that any way the dispute will be going  to

arbitration,  so  there is no harm  in  stalling.

This   may   result  in  one   of   two   things.

Theoretically speaking, you may get  a  situation

where   there  are  pending  in  the  Court,   by

automatic  notification,  one  hundred   or   two

hundred cases, and it will be impossible for  the

Court  to  resolve these disputes for  months  or

maybe years. Therefore until we know exactly  how

the  machinery functions, we consider moving into

a  more practical position, one where it goes  to

the  Court,  when  both parties consent,  or  the

Minister   directs.  The  Minister  directs,   he

gazettes his directions, and the Commissioner for

Labour  informs the Registrar. Whether a  dispute

goes to arbitration or not, if the two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>



parties  cannot  agree,  depends  solely  on   the

discretion  of  the  Minister.  And  whether   the

Minister   directs  that  the  dispute   goes   to

arbitration  or not depends upon the  position  of

the  Court at that time, the position with respect

to  that particular dispute. I therefore urge upon

the  House that if we accept the position - that  we

are  unable  to  predict exactly  the  pattern  of

conduct that unions and employers will follow as a

result  of the implementation of this provision - it

will then be wiser to leave the discretion to  the

Minister alone.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I can understand all that and

I sympathise with the Government. I know they have

now   changed   from  the  stand   of   compulsory

arbitration   to   one  of   not   so   compulsory

arbitration. But what I have been trying to  point

out  to  the  Government is this.  Clause  18  and

clause  20  lay down certain requirements  on  the

Commissioner.  Now  it is well  and  good  if  the

Commissioner   notifies  the  Minister   and   the

Minister  directs, "Hold your hand, do not  inform

the  Registrar." Then paragraph (c) will come  in.

But  suppose  the  Minister says,  "Go  ahead  and

notify."  Where does it come in? If  you  look  at

paragraph (c), Sir, the amendment, if I have  read

it  right, is that the Minister by notice  in  the

Gazette   directs  that  the  trade   dispute   be

submitted  to arbitration. Which trade dispute  is

it? We do not know. But it must be qualified as to

which  trade  dispute it is. But if one  says  the

trade dispute that is notified to him under clause

18  or  clause  19, one can then  understand  what

trade  dispute  it is.  But it just  says  directs

"the trade dispute". There is no qualification for

the particular trade dispute. If the Hon. Minister

will  read what this amendment is about,  then  he

will   know.  He  has  withdrawn  the  words   "an

essential  service"  but has  left  in  the  words

"trade   dispute"  which  refers   to   "essential

service", and that means nothing.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It appears to me that we are also

debating  amendment  (iv).  Therefore,   for   the

convenience of hon. Members, the debate  can  also

range over this amendment. Amendment (iv)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



is  to  leave  out in paragraph (c) "certifies  in

respect   of  a  trade  dispute  with  regard   to

employment in, or in connection with the provision

of,  an essential service that it is in the public

interest" and insert "directs".



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have a lot of

draftsmen - people    who    are    interested    in

drafting - sitting opposite us this  afternoon.  Mr

Speaker, my attention has been drawn to clauses 18

(4) and 20 (b). Those are the clauses where it  is

provided  that when there has been  a  refusal  to

negotiate  by one of the parties or  by  both  the

parties,  or when negotiation has broken down,  it

will be the duty of the Commissioner to notify the

Minister,   and  unless  the  Minister   otherwise

directs,      the      Registrar      will      be

informed - information, that is all.  There  is  all

the   difference  in  the  world   between,   say,

information, (that is, the Registrar of the  Court

is informed), and what the Member for Cairnhill is

now  wanting us to agree to, namely, that once the

Minister  has directed the Commissioner to  notify

the   Registrar,   then  the  Court   shall   take

cognizance. That is where we disagree. We say that

there is nothing wrong in this and I think that it

is  desirable  that  the Registrar  of  the  Court

should be so informed. If there is a trade dispute

between  two parties and one side has  refused  to

negotiate or both have refused to negotiate, or if

negotiations  have deadlocked, then the  Registrar

should  be informed, because he is the channel  of

communication  between the  Commissioner  and  the

Court.  But  there is also a world  of  difference

between the Registrar being informed and the Court

taking  cognizance. Now if the Member's  suggested

amendment  is  agreed  to,  then  the  moment  the

Registrar  is  informed, the Court  will  have  to

spring  into existence. The Court takes cognizance

and the President is there. He is always there. It

will  be  his duty then to get the employer's  and

employee's  panels constituted. That  is  what  we

seek  to avoid, and that is why we have taken  out

the  whole of paragraph (b) and made the amendment

to paragraph (c) of the clause.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it would

appear that the Minister cannot understand what  I

have been trying to explain to him. I did not  say

that  mine was right. I based my amendment on what

is in there. Now that the Government has withdrawn

from   the   stand   of  compulsory   arbitration,

therefore the Government's amendment is almost  in

line  with mine. Well, that is good, so let us  go

ahead  with  the  amendment. Let us  talk  on  the

amendment. Suppose a notification is necessary  to

the  Registrar,  because  the  Minister  does  not

otherwise direct.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is going to happen? At first we say it is

here  under clause 28 (b); it is going to be  this

way.  But now we are going to take clause  28  (b)

out.  But  what is going to happen? In  regard  to

clause 28 (c), the Minister has now proposed  that

he will direct that the trade dispute be submitted

to  arbitration. I again agree with him. But I  am

asking  him,  what is the qualification  for  this

dispute  that  he  directs that  "trade  dispute"?

Which   "trade  dispute"?  There  must   be   some

qualification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we seem to be

talking  round and round the subject. I have  made

the position quite clear. The Member for Cairnhill

is  now  saying to this House that the  Government

has  receded from its stand on arbitration.  Where

has  it  receded? The powers given to the Minister

in  paragraph (c) - the amended powers-over-ride all

that  the  parties may say. One side may agree  to

arbitration. The other side may violently disagree

to   arbitration.   Both  sides   may   not   want

arbitration. They prefer a trial of strength.  The

Minister  can  still intervene and  say  that  the

matter  be  referred to arbitration. So there  are

all  the safeguards written into the clause.  Now,

all that we want to do by the amendment is to make

a  distinction between a mere routine  information

to  the Court, and cognizance. We have got to draw

that distinction, because if the Court is informed

through  the  Commissioner for  Labour  under  the

provisions of clause 18 (4)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



and  clause  20  (b),  well,  that  is  a  routine

information  to  the Court. But if  the  amendment

which  the Member for Cairnhill makes is accepted,

then  on  mere  information the Court  shall  take

cognizance.  It  is  a matter then  that  is  laid

before the Court. There is a President and he will

then  have  to see that the panels are constituted

for  the Court. We do not want that to happen, and

that  is why we want to delete the whole of clause

28 (b) and make the amendment to clause 28 (c). It

is a very simple point and I do not understand why

so much difficulty is seen in it, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, could the position be this? The

Hon, the Prime Minister has said just now that  if

there  are  200 trade disputes, then the  position

will  be  very difficult. We understand that.  But

supposing  at that moment there is only one  trade

dispute,  and  under clauses  18  and  20  certain

disputes  could not be settled. What then happens?

The  Commissioner shall notify the  Minister  and,

unless   the   Minister  otherwise  directs,   the

Registrar  that  a trade dispute  exists.  If  the

Minister  directs the Commissioner to  inform  the

Registrar  and  the provisions  of  clause  18  or

clause  20  are complied with, then by  virtue  of

clause  28 as envisaged, the Court shall not  take

cognizance of that trade dispute. If that  is  the

position,  then  the only way  in  which  a  trade

dispute could be taken cognizance of would be  for

the  Minister to act under the proposed clause  28

(c).  Is that the position the Government want  to

reach?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, what we,

in  fact,  have in clauses 18 and 20, is machinery

whereby  the Court is kept informed of the general

industrial  position. Whether it is  a  particular

dispute  of  which  the  Court  will  have  to  be

informed,  unless  the Minister  intercepts  under

clause  18, will depend upon the decision  of  the

Minister. If the amendment moved by the Member for

Cairnhill  is  accepted, then it  means  that  the

Court, in accordance with the procedure of keeping

it   abreast   of  all  negotiations   which   are

deadlocked, will automatically be notified by  the

Commissioner,  again  on  the  direction  of   the

Minister - unless the Commissioner is an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>



independent entity from the Minister - and it  will

then take cognizance. There is no point really  in

this  situation because we are giving the Minister

power  anyway under paragraph (c) . So what happens

is  this,  that the Court is informed of  all  the

disputes which are deadlocked. The Minister may or

may  not  say that the dispute is for arbitration.

That is exactly the position therein.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I understand the position, Sir,I am not pressing with my amendment. What I

was saying  is -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, if the -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - if it has to be a trade

dispute in regard to paragraph (c), then it has to

be so qualified. That is all there is to it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> But surely it is not the

business  of the Legislature to try and  tell  the

Minister  how to identify a trade dispute.  If  he

cannot identify it, then I think things are  in  a

very bad way.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 13, line 14, after "Government", to

insert-

<pre>

S.I. 1958   "relating to any matter which would

No. 1956.   entail an expenditure of public funds

            or with regard to which the Yang di-Pertuan

            Negara is required under the provisions of

            the Singapore (Constitution) Order

            in Council, 1958, to act on the

            advice of the Public Service Commission

            or the Legal Service Commission".

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is the intention, by this amendment, to give the Civil Service the right to

take   a   trade   dispute  from  the   collective

bargaining  stage right up to arbitration  without

any  reference to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  only

in  such matters which do not affect public  funds

or which do not affect the functions of the Public

Service Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Government is

accountable for taxpayers' funds, it is  necessary

that,  before any trade dispute between the  Civil

Service   and   the  Government  is  referred   to

arbitration,   that  dispute   is   stopped   from

arbitration  if  it affects public  funds  or  any

matters  which  come under the competence  of  the

Public   Service  Commission.  The  amendment   so

provides, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the

amendments that have taken place to clause  28  of

the Bill, I am wondering how clause 31 can ever be

called into operation. Clause 31 says: "Where  the

Court  has cognizance of a trade dispute...".

Now  the  only way in which cognizance of a  trade

dispute could be taken by the Court would be under

clause 28. Clause 28 (a), as amended, says that it

shall be  a joint submission. Clause 28  (b)  is

off. The new clause 28 (b) [old clause 28 (c)]



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



says  where  the Minister directs in the  Gazette;

and the new clause 28 (c) [old clause 28 (d)] says

where  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara by proclamation

so declares. So applying that to clause 31, if the

Minister  for Finance and the Government union  do

not  jointly submit, it does not become cognizable

by  the  Court.  If  the Minister  under  the  new

paragraph  (b) does not direct it in the  Gazette,

the  Court  cannot take cognizance, and  similarly

under  the  new paragraph (c) the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara  does not declare by proclamation, then  it

is not a cognizable trade dispute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I dare say the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara  will not proclaim unless he is advised  by

the   Minister.  Under  paragraph  (b)   in   this

particular  instance, I cannot  see  the  Minister

directing;  under paragraph (a) I cannot  see  the

Minister   for  Finance  agreeing   to   a   joint

submission. Therefore, I cannot see how clause  31

can  ever  be called into operation.  But  as  the

original  clause  28 stood, Sir, clause  31  could

have come into operation because, under clause  28

(a),  it  could have been an individual submission

rather  than  a joint submission. In view  of  the

amendment to clause 28 (a), I am wondering whether

the  provisions of clause 31 would ever be  called

upon.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it with or without the

amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> With or without the amendment, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

problem is not as simple as has been expounded  by

the Member for Farrer Park. Under clause 28, it is

not  necessarily the Minister who  certifies.  The

Member may be aware that there are such things  as

Joint  Whitley Councils. It is true that officials

normally  act under the direction of the Minister,

but  there is nothing to prevent the Official Side

and  the  Staff Side from jointly agreeing  on  an

official  basis  that  the matter  should  go  for

arbitration  in  accordance with existing  Service

agreements. Therefore, to make the position



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



quite  clear,  we have included this amendment  so

that,  in  certain circumstances, it cannot,  even

when it comes under civil service procedure, go to

arbitration.  In the words of the amendment,  "any

matter which would entail an expenditure of public

funds  or with regard to which the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara  is  required under the provisions  of  the

Singapore  (Constitution) Order in Council,  1958,

to  act  on  the  advice  of  the  Public  Service

Commission...".  Mr  Speaker, Sir,  civil  service

Whitley  Council machinery being what it  is,  the

Government is justified in taking a very  cautious

view in these matters.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

unions   bound  by  an  award,  by  an  agreement

registered  under section 23 of  this  Ordinance,

agree  that the award or the award as  varied  by

more than three years after the date on which  it

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these amendments are regarded

as drafting improvements. As the clause stands, it

is  not clear that the parties may bargain for the

future  or approach the Court to extend  an  award

when  an agreement or an award is in force.  Under

these  amended  provisions,  the  parties  to   an

agreement   or  an  award  can  agree   before   a

registered  agreement  or  an  award  expires   to

continue the agreement or award in force  with  or

without variation. If they cannot agree to make  a

new  agreement  from the date  of  expiry  of  the

registered  agreement or award, the Court  can  so

award.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir. The

last two lines of clause 44 read:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... in any court and shall not be subject to

certiorari, prohibition, mandamus or injunction in

any court on any account."

<br><br>

Sir,  I always understood that it was part of  the

inherent  jurisdiction of the  Courts  that  these

writs  will  always continue to  run.  Is  it  the

intention  that these writs are to  be  completely

excluded? Will the Minister please explain to  the

House  why,  by  virtue of this provision  in  the

clause,   the   Courts  will  be  prevented   from

exercising their inherent jurisdiction in  so  far

as these writs are concerned?

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it must be obvious

to  the  Member  for  Farrer Park - although  he  is

trying  to be difficult tonight - that an  award  is

final  and conclusive, and that any order made  by

the  Industrial  Arbitration Court  is  final  and

conciusive as far as an award is concerned. If the

Court  goes  outside of this, then the prerogative

writ  of prohibition would be available to prevent

an  excess  of  jurisdiction.  The  power  of  the

Industrial Arbitration Court is to arbitrate on  a

trade dispute



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>



of  which it has cognizance, and a "trade dispute"

is  a dispute as to industrial matters, as defined

in  clause  2. Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Industrial

Arbitration  Court began to arbitrate  on  matters

not  in dispute, it could be prohibited. Likewise,

if  it declined to arbitrate, mandamus would  lie,

so  that in the exercising of its jurisdiction  in

the   matter  of  awards  with  respect  to  trade

disputes,  the orders of the Court are  final  and

conclusive,  but  if  it goes outside  that,  then

writs of prohibition and mandamus do lie.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> On a further point of clarification,

Sir,I appreciate what the Minister says, that  if

an  award  is  in  connection with  an  industrial

dispute

and  all  the terms set down in the Ordinance  are

complied with, then that is the end of the matter.

But  supposing some of the conditions set down  in

the  Ordinance are not complied with,  would  this

still exclude certiorari, prohibition or mandamus?

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> If it could be shown that the Court

was  not properly constituted or anything of  that

sort,  then  I  would say writs would-  lie.  That

means certiorari would lie.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Clause 51 primarily deals with the

Commissioner's powers to inquire into  complaints.

Sub-clause (5) makes it possible for any person to

complain   to   the  Minister,  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Minister, or to the Commissioner

that a trade union or person bound by an award has

committed a breach or non-observance of  any  term

of an award.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my point in moving this

amendment  is  this: where there  is  a  statutory

civil  servant  charged with the carrying  out  of

these functions, I feel it would be much better to

let  him  carry out his duties under the Ordinance

rather than for the Minister and the





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>



Parliamentary  Secretary to  the  Minister  to  be

involved in personal individual complaints. If  it

were a matter of policy, or a matter that affected

public  interest  or affected  a  section  of  the

public, then I think it would be right and  proper

that  the  Minister  should be  brought  into  the

picture.  But  here,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  is   an

individual   complaint  from   somebody   who   is

aggrieved  by  an  award.  The  statute   provides

machinery  whereby that grievance can be  inquired

into  by  the  Commissioner, as he is  the  person

charged  with  that duty. In the circumstances,  I

see  no  reason whatsoever, other than  political,

for  bringing  the Minister and the  Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister into the picture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will look at clause 49

of the Bill which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any trade union or person bound by an award who

has  committed any breach or non-observance of any

term of an award shall be guilty of an offence...",

<br><br>

there  are  several safeguards of which  a  person

aggrieved  by  an award can avail  himself.  Under

clause  49,  it  is made a criminal  offence,  and

under  clause 51 (5), the Commissioner  is  charged

with the duty of inquiring into a complaint to see

whether  such an award has, in fact, been  broken.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, other than to  complicate  the

issue,  it  could serve no useful purpose  to  let

three  persons have the handling of the particular

complaint, when eventually the complaint  will  be

directed,  to the Commissioner for inquiry.  Would

it  not be better for the Commissioner himself  to

go into the complaint and then hold an inquiry? If

there has been any breach, perhaps action might be

taken under clause 49, or the Commissioner himself

might take action under the particular clause.  My

own  view, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that once an award

has  been  made and machinery provided to  enquire

into  complaints,  particularly  when  that  is  a

criminal offence, it is highly undesirable for the

Minister  and his Parliamentary Secretary  not  to

come into the picture.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this clause deals

specifically  with the case of private  agreements

which  arise out of collective agreements.  It  is

considered  not right and proper that  a  Minister

and his Parliamentary Secretary should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>



be  deprived of the powers which are granted to an

official  of  the  Ministry, particularly  in  the

Ministry of Labour and Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in cases where this sub-clause

(5)  applies, the complaint is usually made by the

aggrieved  person - the complaint  that,  say,  his

employer  is  not  giving  him  the  terms  of  an

agreement   which  arose  out  of   a   collective

agreement between the employer and the trade union

which  represented him. In that  case,  surely  it

should be open to the aggrieved person to make his

complaint  either  to  the  Minister  or  to   the

Parliamentary Secretary or to the Commissioner for

Labour.  It may be a dispute between him  and  his

employer as to whether the award in the collective

agreement is applicable to his private contract of

service. In that situation, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  it

would   be  the  duty  of  the  Minister  or   his

Parliamentary  Secretary, or the Commissioner  for

Labour  to  refer  the matter in  dispute  to  the

Labour  Court. Under this clause, we are  not,  in

any  way,  attempting to side-step  the  procedure

that  is laid down with regard to the bringing  of

actions before the Labour Court. That will go on.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that we seek to do here is to obtain the

powers  to initiate action. If an aggrieved person

comes to us, we will accept his complaint. We will

find  out what he wants. If we can, we will summon

his  employer,  and  if the employer  agrees  that

there  is a breach of the award, we will then  get

his   consent  to  meeting  the  request  of   the

aggrieved person. If not, and if there is an issue

of  fact to be decided between them, we will  send

the matter to the Labour Court. That is all we are

seeking to do under this clause. Again I would say

that there is nothing sinister in all this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the word "sinister"

is in the mind of the Minister for Labour and Law.

Sir,  what I am saying is not sinister. What I  am

saying  is that it is highly undesirable  for  the

Minister  and his Parliamentary Secretary  to  get

into  the fray at this stage. "Award" includes  an

award not only of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>



a  collective  agreement made by mutual  consent,

but  an  award  made by the Court  of  Industrial

Arbitration.  That is how it is  defined  in  the

defining clause. `"Award" means an award made  by

the  Court'. A collective agreement,  in  certain

circumstances,  when  it is registered  with  the

Court  becomes an award. So that the award spoken

of,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, in clause 51 is an  award

which   might  either  be  given,  in  the  first

instance,  by the Court or a collective agreement

registered with the Court. What is the  necessity

for  the  Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary

when the Commissioner exists and the Commissioner

has Assistant Commissioners who, under the Labour

Ordinance,  have similar duties and functions  to

perform?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to submit, with respect, that one does not

want  to  give  these inquiries,  resulting  from

alleged  breaches of awards, a political flavour.

It  could  well  be, Mr Speaker, Sir,  that  the

Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary could be

subject to political pressure of a kind that  the

Commissioner cannot and would not be subject to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am unable to accept the

last  argument submitted by the Member for Farrer

Park.  The reason why my colleague, the  Minister

for   Labour  and  Law,  is  insisting  that  the

Minister  and the Parliamentary Secretary  should

be  among the persons to whom complaints  can  be

made  is because, from his experience in the last

eight   months,  he  has  discovered  that  union

leaders  and  union members not unnaturally  have

preferred,   in   most  cases,  to   make   their

complaints  to  the Parliamentary  Secretary  for

reasons  which  are not difficult to  understand.

The  permanent  officials are  there.  They  were

permanent officials to the last Government.  They

are permanent officials there today. It is a fact

which  we  have  to  accept. The  point  is  that

neither   the   Minister  nor  the  Parliamentary

Secretary can participate in any of the  judicial

processes to decide whether or not there has been

a   breach.  All  that  the  Minister   and   his

Parliamentary  Secretary can do is  to  ascertain

whether or not there is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>



matter  to  be  referred to the  Court  for  such

action as can proceed under the Ordinance.  These

powers  are just the powers to summon either  the

union   or  the  employer  to  answer  truthfully

questions  relating  to  the  existence   of   an

agreement.  The  enforcement  of  any  breach  of

observance of an agreement is not in the hands of

the  Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary or the

Commissioner. Whilst, politically,  I  would  say

that  it  is not a duty which the Minister  would

want   to   perform  all  the  time,  there   are

situations  where  it is more judicious  for  the

Minister himself to make such inquiries. It is, I

think,  a  common practice. When the  Member  for

Cairnhill   was  the  Minister  for  Labour   and

Welfare,  not very infrequently he  had  to  deal

with employers and unions not only in relation to

alleged breaches of awards but to a host of other

important  matters  relating  to  employers   and

unions.  There  is nothing novel  or  unusual  in

these provisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already explained that

it  is the intention of Government to negative the

the  provisions  of clause 56 which  places  trade

union    leaders    under   restriction    against

participation in trade union activities if they so

conduct themselves as to commit contempt of court.

These sub-clauses give effect to that intention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendment we propose will

enable   the  Court  to  cancel  or  suspend   the

operation   of   an   award   in   more    limited

circumstances  than the Bill originally  proposed.

The power will be exercisable only in the event of

acceptable, and repudiating those parts which  are

not  acceptable. The Court has the discretion,  in

amendment has already been moved and accepted  by

the  Opposition  that there shall  be  no  "trade

union of employees", and all reference to a trade

union  could  only  refer to  a  trade  union  of

employees.  Therefore,  I  think  that  amendment

tacked  on to paragraph (a) may be making  things

more  confusing. There is no longer a trade union

of  employers being a party to negotiations. That

has  been accepted by the Government, as a result

of   representations   by   the   trade   unions.

Therefore,  there  is no such thing  as  a  trade

union  of employers before the Arbitration Court.

Such being the case, therefore, reference to  any

trade  union  could only be to a trade  union  of

employees.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Has the Member for Cairnhill read

the  amendment right? The amendment reads  "of  a

trade union of employees" and not "employers". We

are on amendment (i).



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> That is right, Sir. What is

amended is that, being a trade union, it "may  be

represented  by an officer of the  trade  union".

This  obviously means "trade union of employers".

But  there  is  no  longer  any  trade  union  of

employers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I

have  the right to congratulate myself on  having

followed   the   argument  of  the   Member   for

Cairnhill. His argument is that since  any  trade

union  that appears before the Court  must  be  a

trade union of employees, we can safely leave out

the words "of employees". But I do not wish to go

into  the intricacies of draftsmanship. I do  not

think   the   addition  of  the  two  words   "of

employees"  really  makes the  legislation  other

than proper. It might be that even though in  the

definition the unions referred to are  unions  of

employees, there is no great loss of space by the

addition of the words "of employees" in just  one

reference to it in this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will not take all

the  sorties  from the Opposition  Members  lying

down.  To  prove  my point conclusively,  I  will

refer them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>



to  clause  62 of the Bill where the distinctions

are  made.  Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 62  (1)  (b)

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In proceedings before the Court a party or

intervener-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) not being a trade union, may be

represented-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) by an employee of that party or

intervener; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) by an officer of a trade union of which

that party or intervener is a member.".



<br><br>As  this  is  the  case, where the  party  is  an

employer,  he  can be represented. The  employer,

when  a  party, may be a member of a trade union,

and  if he is, then he can be represented  by  an

officer  of the trade union to which he  belongs.

That is the position, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Minister for Labour and Law is rather tired.  Far

from   the   Opposition  following   the   debate

unintelligently,  I  think  it  can  congratulate

itself  on  having  followed it intelligently.  I

think  what my colleague the Member for Cairnhill

means  is  this. Paragraph (a) of clause  62  (1)

reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"being a trade union may be represented by an

officer of the trade union;"



<br><br>and the proposed amendment reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"or, in the case of a trade union of employees,

by  an  officer  of  the trade  union  or  by  an

Industrial  Relations  Officer  selected  by  the

trade union".



<br><br>So therefore, the amendment there seeks to draw a

distinction between "a trade union" and "a  trade

union  of  employees". But what  the  Member  for

Cairn-hill said was that in an industrial dispute

there  cannot  be  a  trade union  of  employers.

Therefore,  the amendment does not seem  to  read

right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

want  to  allow  that  remark  to  pass.  It   is

incorrect to say that the amendment does not read

right.  It  might well be that those  with  all-embracing  minds can argue that  since  no  trade

union  of employers can appear before the  Court,

therefore,   the  words  "of  employees"   become

superfluous. But I do not see why that should  in

any  way detract from the merits of the Bill  and

the drafting of the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it does not detract

from  the merits of the Bill one bit. But what  we

are  now saying, Mr Speaker, Sir, follows on what

the  Minister  for Labour and Law  has  told  this

Assembly,  that,  as a result of discussions  with

trade unions of employees, he has considered that,

in  so  far  as  proceedings  under  the  proposed

Ordinance are concerned, there cannot be  a  trade

union of employers as defined in clause 2. I  take

it  that the Minister will be dealing with that in

due  course. In any event, he has told  the  House

that so far as an industrial dispute is concerned,

it  will  be between a union of employees  and  an

employer. If that is correct - it must be  correct,

because the Minister for Law has spoken - then  what

is  the  meaning of "being a trade  union  may  be

represented by an officer of the trade union" and,

in addition to that, it talks about "a trade union

of  employees"? Therefore, what precedes the trade

union must be the "trade union of employers",  and

the Minister himself has said that there cannot be

a  trade union of employers so far as this Bill is

concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, Sir. There cannot be a

trade  union  of employers who are parties  before

the  Court.  Clause 62 (1) envisages  a  situation

where, in proceedings before the Court, a party or

intervener - and there is nothing to prevent a trade

union of employers from intervening.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can assure the

Member  for Farrer Park that however hard  he  and

his  colleagues try to tire me, 1 am not going  to

be  tired.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, the  provisions  of

clause  62  have been carefully looked into.  That

clause  deals with the position of parties  before

the  Court. As a matter of note, Sir, it  provides

for    representations   before   the   Industrial

Arbitration   Court, and  it   deals   with   the

representations of the parties before  the  Court.

Now,  the employer may be in a trade union and  he

may  be  represented by an officer  of  the  trade

union.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, where he is  not  in  a

trade  union, if, say, an employer can participate

in   collective  bargaining,  his  employee  could

appear. The employer could under (ii) on the  next

page, page 26 of the Bill, be a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>



member  of a trade union, in which case  he  would

have  the  advantage of using the services  of  an

officer employed by the employer's trade union  to

represent him before the court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, we wish to make this

distinction - the  distinction  between  the  single

employer  who  has the advantage of  that  service

(that  is, his representation before the Court  by an officer of the trade union to which he belongs)

and  the  service that we wish to provide  to  the

employees'  unions. When we appoint the Industrial

Relations Officers, we want to make these officers

available only to the employees' unions.  That  is

all that we are seeking to do. That is why we make

this distinction to distinguish that position from

the  position that is indicated in clause  62  (1)

(b)  (ii).  I do not know whether the  Member  for

Cairnhill wants us to make a further amendment  to

make this service also available to employers.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Minister has great

difficulty in understanding what we are trying  to

say.  Perhaps  he can help us who  are  trying  to

understand what he is saying if he will explain to

us  what  is meant by the words "trade  union"  in

line 37 of paragraph (a) of clause 62 (1)?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> It means a "trade union of

employees".  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  already

indicated   that  this  clause  deals   with   the

representation   of   parties,   and   under   the

collective bargaining procedure in clause 16, the

only  parties  to  a collective  agreement  or  to

arbitration  proceedings  would  be   the   single

employer and the trade union of employees -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Or the intervener.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Or the intervener.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. Trade union of

employers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with respect to the

Minister,  I  think  the  difficulty  has   arisen

because  clause 62 has been framed in the  way  it

has  been  framed.  It  is  because  the  original

concept  was  that the words "trade union"  should

include  "trade  union of employers"  as  well  as

"trade union of employees". But we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>



have since then departed from that concept and we

now  say  that  "trade union" shall  mean  "trade

union of employees". Until the Minister takes  it

upon  himself to redefine "trade union" on page 3

of  the Bill, we will be constantly running  into

this  difficulty. Since clause 62 (1)  (a)  reads

"being  a  trade  union", we must necessarily  go

back to page 3 to find out what "trade union"  is

and  whether "trade union" is defined  as  "trade

union   of   employers"  or   "trade   union   of

employees".  Therefore,  as  the  definition  now

stands, "being a trade union of employers may  be

represented by an officer of the trade  union  of

employers;" or "being a trade union of  employees

may  be  represented   . That is  how  it  should

read,  Mr Speaker, Sir. An amendment is  brought

in  to  draw a distinction between a trade union

of employers and a trade union of employees. If I

may   take   it  upon  myself  to  redraft   this

paragraph,  in view of the changes, I  think  all

that need be done is to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In proceedings before the Court a party or

intervener-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) being a trade union of employees...,



<br><br>and that would have solved the problem.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No doubt the Minister will

consider  that point when he deals with  the  new

definition of "trade union".



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we have

made  the  position clear. A trade union  may  be

represented by an officer of the trade union, and

we  go  on to add this provision in the amendment

that we propose - "or, in the case of a trade union

of employees, by an officer of the trade union or

by  an  Industrial Relations Officer selected  by

the trade union".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are making the distinction.

We  show quite clearly the difference between the

provision  of clause 62 (1) (b) (ii) which  deals

with the representation of employers by officials

of  their trade unions, and the services that  we

propose for the union of employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 26, to leave out lines 3 to 7 inclusive

and insert "but may be represented by an advocate

and solicitor if so desired.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I tabled this amendment because I felt that

to   deny  the  trade  unions  a  chance  to   be

represented  by  an  advocate  and  solicitor  to

present   their  case  concisely,   clearly   and

effectively in the Arbitration Court would be  to

make it difficult for them. I did say, Sir - and it

has  now been accepted by the Minister for Labour

and  Law - that  not all trade union  officers  are

well trained and capable of handling the cases of

their  unions before the Arbitration  Court.  And

past  experience  has shown that  where  a  trade

union  has  the  benefit of the  services  of  an

advocate and solicitor to represent it either  in

conciliation proceedings or in a Court of Inquiry

or  in  an Industrial Court, that union  has  the

advantage of having its case very well presented.

That  union,  with the help of  an  advocate  and

solicitor,  would  come out of  the  conciliation

proceedings  in a much better light  than  if  it

were  denied the right to engage an advocate  and

solicitor to look after its interests.  In  fact,

Sir, it has been the practice - in fact, the custom

too - in  previous years that in trade disputes  of

this  kind,  unions were wont to  call  upon  the

services of advocates and solicitors who put  the

benefit of their knowledge and experience to  use

when  presenting the unions' case. I do not  wish

to  suggest  that,  because those  advocates  and

solicitors referred to by me earlier in my speech

are  no  longer  in  a position  to  render  such

assistance  to the trade unions, other  advocates

and  solicitors should be so denied. I know  that

that  is  not the case. The way I look at  it  is

that  the  Government, in moving this  particular

clause,  says  that it must be an  officer  of  a

trade  union. They do not want lawyers;  they  do

not   want   professional  agitators.  Therefore,

clause 62, so far as it goes without the proposed

amendment, is good. I would have accepted that, I

would  have said an additional amendment  "of  an

industrial  officer to assist a union"  would  be

good  but  now -  I must range over  the  proposed

amendment of the Minister - the Minister in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>



his proposed amendment, which is to be moved after

my  amendment, throws the gate wide open to people

who  may  not be honestly and sincerely  connected

with  the trade union movement. I refer,  Sir,  to

professional  agitators. If we want to  close  the

gate  to  advocates  and solicitors  from  helping

trade  unions  in presenting their case,  we  must

also  close the gate to all those people  who  are

not   trade  unionists  or  who  are  not  closely

connected with the trade union movement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Member for

Cairnhill  knows,  the  intention  is  to  exclude

advocates and solicitors from taking part  in  the

collective   bargaining  process   or   from   the

representation of interests before the  Industrial

Arbitration Court, except in cases where there are

proceedings for contempt of the Court's  authority

or    where   the   State   Advocate-General   has

intervened, The reason why Government has  decided

to  exclude  advocates and solicitors  from  these

functions is that, though it is accepted that they

are   skilled  in  the  orderly  presentation   of

arguments  before the Court and in the examination

and cross-examination of witnesses, this very fact

would  give  the proceedings a forensic atmosphere

which  would put a lay advocate at a disadvantage;

so  that the side that does not have Counsel feels

at  a  disadvantage. We have pointed out  that  it

will be necessary to make proceedings arising from

collective bargaining before the Court as informal

as they can be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is also the question of

the  costs  of  professional  representation.  The

employer's  side can well afford these costs,  but

in  most cases they are prohibitive as far as  the

employees'  unions  are  concerned.  What  we  are

seeking  to do is to extend to the arbitral  stage

that  spirit  which  prevails  in  the  bargaining

process  rather  than to introduce Counsel,  forms

and  the sort of approach that is common in courts

of  law, where technical points are usually  taken

in the course of arguments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the purpose

of  this  legislation should be to  encourage  the

officers of trade unions on either side to  handle

their  own members' affairs. If they receive  this

en-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>



couragement, they will thereby increase their  own

prestige  in this field. It is quite obvious  that

they  will  not be able to develop this skill  and

prestige  if, as soon as the case that is  handled

by  them during the collective bargaining stage is

passed on to the Court of Arbitration, Counsel are

brought  in and they take over from them. That  is

not  the way of increasing their prestige  and  of

developing  the  sense of responsibility  that  we

want to see developed in these union officials.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Mr Speaker, Sir, union officials

on  both sides who meet round the bargaining table

and  in the Court develop a habit of dealing  with

each  other on friendly terms, and they  will,  by

close  association, be able to have confidence  in

each other and to establish close friendships.  In

dealing with each other, they will be able to feel

that  they  are in industrial relations  together.

Say you get trade union officials of employers and

you  get trade union leaders appointing their  own

officials,  Now in the bargaining process  and  so

on,  there  will be very hard words passed  across

the  table,  but  they will  get  to  respect  one

another in these discussions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the exclusion of advocates and

solicitors  only extends to those  who  appear  as

such. There is nothing to prevent an officer of  a

trade  union from being a professionally qualified

man,  but special provision has been made in  this

legislation  to prevent a practising  lawyer  from

having  himself  appointed as an  officer  of  the

union for a particular case so as to get round the

provisions     directed    against    professional

representation.   Such   a   person   must    have

relinquished his practice for six months before he

meddles in these matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to draw

attention  to the fact that paid agents  are  also

excluded.  This is to stop people starting  a  new

group  of  industrial  advocates - a  kind  of   new

industrial legal profession.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  are  indeed very surprised that this amendment

should  be made to the Bill, because, in the  eyes

of  the  Minister,  it looks as if  advocates  and

solicitors who participate in the work of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>



reconciling the different parties in a trade dispute are

highly  undesirable  people. It  also  implies  that  in

previous  years,  the Hon, the Prime  Minister  and  the

Minister  for Labour and Law himself, by their; example,

proved  that  they  were  highly  undesirable.  If  they

believe  that  their top leaders performed an  important

function  in trade disputes in previous years, there  is

no  reason  therefore  why their  fellow  advocates  and

solicitors should at this time be barred from conducting

the  activities which they did before, Although it would

bar a former Chief Minister from activities in the trade

union  field, we on this side have decided that, in  the

interest  of industrial peace, the door should also  not

be  open to others who would make it more difficult  for

industrial peace to be achieved, But when the amendments

proposed by the Government open the door to anybody,  by

whatever  name,  to  come  in  and  interfere  in  trade

disputes,  I think it is wrong to exclude advocates  and

solicitors.  If  it is the intention  of  Government  to

bring about an amicable atmosphere conducive to an early

settlement   of   disputes,  and  that   advocates   and

solicitors   should   not   be   included   to   prolong

negotiations,  I  think  the  next  amendment   by   the

Minister* should not come in. The public, Sir, may infer

that this is an attempt by the Government to prevent the

return  of  a  former  Chief Minister  into  the  public

limelight.

* The amendment reads as follows

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 26, lines 9 to 11, to leave out "a

person in the employment of a trade union as  a

full-time  secretary  or  assistant  secretary"

and insert-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"for the purposes of any proceedings before

the  Court a person appointed by the  body,  by

whatever  name called, to which the  management

of  the  affairs of the union is entrusted,  to

represent    the   trade   union    in    those

proceedings".

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It might interest Members on the

for  the  rights  of  advocates and solicitors,  on  the

theory that a case is best presented when

you  have two trained, skilful and disciplined advocates

rapidly  crystallising the issues in a case, My view  is

that  that should be the position. However, I have  been

persuaded  by my colleague, the Minister for Labour  and

Law, who informs me that far from helping to crystallise

the  issues  at  dispute, they very  often  befog  their

clients.  He is firmly of the opinion that  it  is  more

likely  that justice will be done if both employers  and

unions,  through  being naive, honest and  sincere,  put

forward   points - both   good   or   otherwise - in   their

respective  cases,  and  that an intervention  from  the

sometimes  skilful and sometimes less  skilful  advocate

only  helps to prolong and be devil a proper  and  rapid

conclusion of the hearing of an arbitration.

save time by excluding advocates and solicitors -
