<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on

Question [30th July, 1971],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the following Address in reply to the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore,

express  our  thanks to the  President  for  the

speech  which  he  delivered on  behalf  of  the

Government at the opening of the Second  Session

of this Parliament.".'. - [Dr Chiang Hai Ding].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in the addendum to the

President's speech relating to the resettlement of

hawkers,  it  is  stated that a  provision  of  $5

million  has  been  allotted to  the  Ministry  of

Health  for  the  acquisition of land  to  put  up

hawker centres in order to resettle the hawkers in

Singapore. Mr Speaker, Sir, this announcement  has

come  as  a piece of very good news to the hawkers

in  Singapore. The life of a hawker is  very  hard

indeed.  This is particularly so for those hawkers

who  have  a big family to support. Rain or  shine

they  have  to  go out in the streets  to  earn  a

living.  Their livelihood is a very difficult  and

precarious  one. Some of them have been  "illegal"

hawkers  for 10 to 20 years. They are not sure  of

the  next  meal, so to speak. Most of the  present

hawkers  in  Singapore became  hawkers  originally

because of the unemployment situation in the past.

Although  many new factories have been established

in  Singapore  after  the  implementation  of  our

industrialisation programme and thus provide  many

job   opportunities,  these  hawkers   cannot   be

absorbed into the factories because they  are  not

skilled  workmen. Moreover, they have big families

and  the wages paid in these factories are too low

to maintain a big family. The wages are only three

to  four  dollars a day. Our hawkers are indeed  a

social problem.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the statistics supplied by the

Hawkers'  Department,  there  are  about   25,000

hawkers  in Singapore. About 56 per cent of  this

number,  that  is  14,000 have been  issued  with

licences  and they thus become licensed  hawkers.

The  balance of 44 per cent are still  unlicensed

hawkers  and  they  ply  their  trade  at  street

corners, in back-lanes or on mobile vehicles.  We

cannot  allow them to sink or swim by themselves.

We  should shoulder the responsibility of looking

after their welfare, particularly those who  have

families to look after. We must first start  with

the  registration  of  all  genuine  hawkers   in

Singapore and issue them with licences,  so  long

as the places in which they operate are not areas

scheduled for redevelopment and they do not cause

traffic  obstruction.  In  this  way,  all  these

hawkers  will  be given licences and  thus  their

mental   torture   will  be  ended.   They   can,

therefore, earn their living with peace of  mind.

This is an urgent task at the moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under the urban renewal scheme,

I  think the Hawkers' Department should go a step

further  and make a survey of all the hawkers  in

the  various constituencies. It can get in  touch

with all the Members of Parliament in the various

constituencies and, in conjunction with the State

and  City Planning Department, work out a  scheme

for  the  allocation of proper vacant  places  in

areas  to  be used as markets and hawker centres.

The scheme will thus help to resettle our hawkers

on    a    rational   and   island-wide    basis.

Consequently,  all the hawkers in Singapore  will

be  able  to  do their business at  ease  in  the

proper centres provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is gratifying to note that

the  Government, in conjunction with the  Housing

and  Development  Board, will build  more  hawker

centres  and  let  out the stalls  at  subsidised

rentals.  The  hawkers will thus be  able  to  do

their  business  better and in an attractive  and

clean   environment.   However,   I   think   the

Government should go one step further in  looking

after the family and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



the  children  of  the hawkers,  particularly  in

regard to their long-term welfare. It must try to

form  a hawkers' association on a national  basis

for  all the 25,000 hawkers in Singapore. Perhaps

assistance  can be obtained from some experienced

unionists  in  the  N.T.U.C, in  organising  the

hawkers  into a national association for hawkers.

A dollar a day can perhaps be collected from each

hawker. In this way, an insurance policy  can  be

taken  up  or a savings account opened for  them.

They  will  thus  be able to form a  co-operative

society  through which they can buy  Housing  and

Development Board flats under the home  ownership

scheme.  In this way the survival of the hawker's

family will be assured.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, over the past few years,

industrialisation has succeeded in providing many

job  opportunities  in  Singapore.  However,  the

wages  paid are low and they are only enough  for

meals, refreshment and transport expenses of  the

workers.  The unemployed people are not attracted

by  the  low  wages paid because  they  have  big

families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some pioneer industries are protected by tariff

laws. They also have the legal provision to  stop

the  workers  from asking for higher wages.  They

also   have  priority  concession  of  the  local

market.   In   spite  of  all  this  preferential

treatment,   the   products  of   these   pioneer

industries  are  still being sold  at  very  high

prices.  This is indeed a pity, in spite  of  all

that  we  have done. The prices of local products

are  going  up  with the setting  up  of  pioneer

industries. This generally increases  the  burden

of  the  Singapore tax-payers. The cost of living

is increased to some extent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the addendum to the

President's speech, it is also stated that  early

next  year  when  a comprehensive assessment  has

been  made  of  the full effect  of  the  British

military withdrawal, the Government will  make  a

review   of  its  wage  policy.  This  is  indeed

necessary,  particularly so in  regard  to  those

pioneer industries and companies which have  made

very high profits over the past few years. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



cannot  allow them to treat labour as a  commodity

to  be  purchased at a very cheap price.  We  must

recover  the oriental traditional concept  of  the

sanctity of labour, and raise the minimum standard

of wages so that labour in Singapore will have the

respect  due  to it. We must accord our  labour  a

fair  share  of good living for the  family  as  a

result of our national prosperity and our economic

growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to avail myself of this

opportunity to stress another point in  regard  to

the daily-rated workers in the Government or semi-Government  organisations. There are  about  7,500

daily-rated   workers  in  the  public   cleansing

service  and in the Public Health Division.  About

17 per cent of them are provided with quarters. In

the Public Works Department, there are about 2,800

daily-rated workers, and only 36 per cent of  them

are  provided with quarters. In the  case  of  the

Public  Utilities  Board, there  are  about  6,600

daily-rated  workers,  and about  24.2  per  cent,

namely, 1,600 of them, are provided with quarters.

But  in  the  case of the Housing and  Development

Board, which has 2,200 daily-rated workers, 54 per

cent  of them are provided with quarters. In  view

of this, a great number of the daily-rated workers

in  Government  and semi-Government  organisations

have  to  pay rent for their private accommodation

at  $30 to $40 per room. On a small monthly salary

of  $120  to  $130,  they have to  spend  quite  a

considerable  portion  on  rentals.  The  cost  of

living  has been rising in recent years, and  this

has proved quite a burden to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Housing and Development

Board  is  building better accommodation  for  our

people.  Even  the  daily-rated  workers  in   the

Housing and Development Board have been given good

accommodation at subsidised rentals.  This  is  in

fact  a  step  in the right direction  and  is  in

keeping  with  our  policy  of  providing   better

accommodation  for the poor people  in  Singapore.

But  how is it that the daily-rated workers in the

other  Government departments and statutory bodies

are  not given the same privilege? We should  give

it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>



to them so long as they are Singapore citizens. We

should  not discriminate against them. They should

not  be  made to watch the daily-rated workers  of

the  Housing and Development Board enjoy this kind

of  treatment when they themselves are  not  given

the  same treatment. I would like to appeal to the

departments and authorities concerned to work  Out

a  scheme with the Housing Board and the State and

City Planning Office to provide better housing for

their own daily-rated workers. They can also build

low-rental  high-rise flats  in  the  suburban  or

rural areas so that all the daily-rated workers in

Government service and in the statutory boards may

be  provided with proper accommodation. We  should

allocate  some  funds  for  such  a  purpose.   If

necessary, the rentals can be subsidised  so  that

these daily-rated workers and their families  will

be  able  to live in a more congenial environment.

This  is  necessary because many of these  workers

are  living  in  squalor.  When  the  workers  are

resettled  in  modern  high-rise  flats,  all  the

shacks  and attap houses in which they were living

could be demolished and the land could be acquired

for   building   better  buildings  and   economic

development beneficial to the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the time is not ripe yet to raise

the  wages of workers generally as it will  affect

our  economic  growth, we should be able  to  look

after  the  lot  of  the  daily-rated  workers  in

Government  service  and the statutory  boards  in

terms  of wages now. There are some who are  given

only  a  five-cent rise in wages after five years'

continuous service. All this is really a  heritage

from the colonial days. We should pay attention to

this point and give serious considerations to  the

rationalisation  of  wages  for  the   daily-rated

workers. According to my own survey, most  of  the

daily-rated  workers  in Kampong  Kapor  have  big

families  to support and are in debt. So in  order

to  make  ends  meet, they have to undertake  some

other  tough job in the evening after a hard day's

work in order to make more money to maintain their

families. Sir, all this hard work throughout these

years is actually a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



contribution towards our national economy. So why

deny  them  the opportunity to enjoy a share,  in

the  form  of  wage increase, in  the  prosperity

arising out of our economic growth to which  they

have contributed? Perhaps they can he given a  10

per cent rise in their wages so that they will be

so pleased that they will work even harder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President has also stressed in his

speech  that  we  must unite all  the  people  in

Singapore,  and since stability and security  are

assured  for  several years ahead, we  must  make

full  use  of  this time to consolidate  our  own

defence  capability. We must  build  up  our  own

expertise,  produce our own engineers, managerial

and  marketing personnel in order to promote  and

cope  with  a faster and higher rate of  economic

growth,  and  be  our  own  masters.  This  is  a

guideline  for our country in future.  Only  then

will  we be able to raise the standard of  living

of  our  people. Only then can our children  have

better  schools and a better environment to  live

in and enjoy better amenities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on behalf of the people of Kampong

Kapor,  let  me express my felicitations  to  the

President on our future prosperity that is  bound

to come under his judicious guidance.



<br><br>2.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ghazali Bin Ismail (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Inche Mohd. Ghazali Bin Ismail):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I rise to join my  colleagues  in

thanking  the  President for his  speech  at  the

opening  of  the  Second Session  of  the  Second

Parliament on the 21st of last month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to examine with you the

internal situation we are in today. I am  not  so

much  concerned with the political  and  economic

aspects,  important  as they  are,  as  with  the

composition  of  our society.  We  are  multi  in

almost   everything.  We  have  a  diffusion   of

cultures,  a diffusion of languages, a  diffusion

of   religions   and   so  on,   and   the   very

heterogeneous nature of our society, open  as  it

is to the influence of Western



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



ideas,  makes  it imperative for  all  of  us  to

understand   fully   the   implications   of   an

uncritical adoption of certain aspects of Western

culture.  I  am  not saying that  some  of  these

aspects  of Western culture are decadent,  but  I

must say that some of them do not conduce to  our

efforts  to consolidate our people into a  viable

and  rugged nation. The Chinese, the Indians  and

the  Malays, each has a distinct form of  culture

in  which,  in its various ways, is prescribed  a

code  of ethical behaviour that has more or  less

withstood  the test of time. Each has a  built-in

system  of  dynamic  growth, and  throughout  the

centuries,  the cumulative effects of  succeeding

changes  have  made our respective  cultures  the

floating-buoys to which we have clung,  and  from

which  we  have  derived our basic strength.  Our

religions  preach the brotherhood of  man,  extol

the   qualities  of  the  human  mind,  make  the

achievement of peace the supreme pursuit of life,

and   frown   upon  irrationalism  in   all   its

manifestations. In truth we have, each one of  us

here,   a   clearly-defined  rule   of   conduct,

adherence to which can ensure our survival  as  a

united and strong people. We have nothing  to  be

ashamed  of,  and  yet today we  see,  among  our

youths,  almost a total disregard for the  values

which  we have accepted without question. We  see

before us the collapse of traditional values. Non-conformity, anti-collectivism, anti-establishment

and  divergent thinking - whatever that may  mean

-would  seem to be the order of the day.  We  see

manifestations  of these in the outlandish  dress

of  some of our youths, the taking of drugs,  the

reading  of  pornographic literature. Existential

philosophy  from  Soren  Kierkegaard  to  Jacques

Maritain has been perverted to mean the denial of

God  and  the ridiculing of all existing cultures

and  the  mocking of social values  dear  to  the

older  generation. Art for the sake  of  art  has

been  venerated at the expense of the social ends

that  art  is  supposed to sub serve. Traditional

faith and values no longer serve for some of  our

youths  as  the  guide-lines of  their  life  and

pointers to their conduct.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be pertinent, at this juncture, to

examine the root causes of this apparent weakening

of  our moral fibre and to think of ways and means

of  overcoming it by providing our youths with the

appropriate alternative moral and ethical  values,

lest we plunge our society into chaos. We must  at

all costs, prevent the degeneration of our society

into  one  that is effete and is immersed  in  the

pursuit of material and sensual pleasures. We must

think of alternatives to a society that thinks  of

humility,  a society that thinks of pity  for  the

weak and incompetent as vices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world that emerged from the Second World War

had  very  little  resemblance to  the  dreams  of

idealists  before  the outbreak of  the  conflict.

There  was hunger, fear, hopelessness, misery  and

unprecedented  violence. The hopes of  people  for

peace  and  security  were rudely  shattered.  The

revival of power politics, the fear of the  spread

of  nuclear  war,  and the use of  bacteriological

means of destruction, the outbreak of conflicts in

South-east  Asia,  the  Middle  East   and   South

America, all these had their deleterious effect in

moulding the thoughts of our thinking youths.  The

old  order  is simply not strong enough to  ensure

peace  and understanding among nations. The  great

religions  of  the world have been found  wanting,

and,   as   established  institutions,  they   had

apparently  served their purposes.  Some  idealism

was still left behind. The spectacular advances in

science,   the  achievement  of  independence   by

various  countries which were former  colonies  of

the  imperialist powers, the emergence  of  newly-independent nations in Africa, the United  Nations

Organisation lent a ray of hope to a  sick  world,

but apparently these did not contribute enough  to

sustain  the  idea that peace and  plenty  was  at

hand. Reactions of the most extreme kind began  to

make  themselves apparent all over the world.  The

spread  of education through the mass media merely

accelerated  the development of these  deleterious

trends    and    not   even   the    authoritative

pronouncements  of church and of Government  could

put a stop to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



them.  Overnight, certain countries that professed

democracy  chucked it overboard and  imposed  upon

their  peoples the most authoritarian of  regimes.

The  world saw the rise of societies that insisted

upon  rigid  conformity to the officially-preached

code  of conduct and of others that permitted  and

allowed  the  growth  of  irrationalism  in  their

midst.  In these fluctuations, the youths  of  the

world  have  been the main casualties.  They  feel

alienated  from society, whether authoritarian  or

otherwise, and this feeling of alienation has  led

them  to  adopt the more nihilistic principles  of

life. The destruction of the old order - economic,

political,   cultural  and  religious   -   became

paramount, no matter what the succeeding situation

might prove to be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Singapore have not escaped from the

outbreak of such irrational rashes as those  which

are  plaguing Europe and America today. We do  not

differ  in  kind but in degree only. We  see  such

aberrations as the adoption of the hippie  way  of

life among certain sections of our youths. We  are

now  hearing of drug-taking by our boys and girls.

We  see  other  manifestation of  this  nihilistic

philosophy  in our midst today. The propensity  to

indulge  in  the pleasures of the senses  for  the

sake  of  enjoying such pleasures,  the  ceaseless

search for material comforts at the expense of the

less  tangible modes of life, the quest for quaint

methods  of  escaping from the grim  realities  of

life  are  all too real, and, given a  measure  of

permissiveness,  one  never knows  how  far  these

trends might develop for the worse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would attribute the collapse of many of our

traditional   beliefs   and   practices   to   the

indulgence  of parents towards their  offspring's.

When  a  certain  firmness is  necessary,  such  a

quality, when it is most needed, is found  grossly

wanting. One thing leading to another, it is  such

want  of  firmness that tends to lead our children

to become undisciplined and disrespectful to us. I

do not advocate a return to the days when the cane

was  the  principal instrument for the enforcement

of discipline at home. But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>



I  do  wish that parents would exercise a  greater

firmness in deciding what is essentially good  for

their  children. An understanding of  their  needs

would  be  necessary  but, at  the  same  time,  a

clearer  realisation of the goals  they  have  for

their  children would, in no small  measure,  help

them to show the correct path for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I was in London last year, a British

newspaper  published a picture taken at Hyde  Park

showing a girl stripping off her clothes until she

was  completely naked. I did make a press  cutting

of  the  picture so that I can produce it here  or

anywhere as an illustration, but unfortunately, my

travelling  colleague, the Member for Mountbatten,

to  whom I had given the picture, told me  he  had

lost  it somewhere. It was reported that the  girl

strolled   through   the   park,   unashamed   and

apparently  oblivious  of the  crowd  around  her.

Strange  to  say, the crowd in the  park  on  that

summer day did not pay much attention to the naked

girl.  I was, to say the least, rather abashed  at

this   display  of  defiance  of  the  established

etiquette of social conduct, and it was a surprise

to  me  that such a thing should have been allowed

at all. I fail to understand the social clime that

could sanction such indecencies as this. I visited

various other places in England and Scotland,  and

it  would seem to me that many of the things  that

the  English  and Scottish youths  did  in  public

could  not  be condoned here, but it  is  possible

that  as  a result of the permissive attitudes  of

the  English and Scottish parents such  things  as

those  I have mentioned were everyday occurrences,

and  were  accepted as such by them. Our  oriental

heritage would frown upon an excessive display  of

affection  in public because we believe  that  the

display  of  such affections can be made  at  more

appropriate  places. We see here,  therefore,  the

existence of differing standards of measuring  and

evaluating  conduct. It must be pointed  out  that

such  evaluation of conduct has validity  only  in

the context of where it occurs, how it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>



occurs, what personalities are involved and  under

what   social   circumstances  such   conduct   is

displayed.  In an oriental society  we  would  say

that a departure from the accepted norms of sexual

practices  is  contrary to our customs  and  would

consequently produce harmful effects on  us,  and,

therefore, we would insist on conformity  in  such

matters as I have mentioned above.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our island state, strategically placed as it is

at  the  cross-roads  of the East  and  West,  has

become  almost a melting pot for various races  to

mix  and  rub  shoulders.  We  now  enjoy  a  mild

economic   boom,  but  apparently  the  Republic's

economic  success  has gone  to  the  heads  of  a

considerable segment of our more affluent  youths.

Unfortunately, these are the youths  who  set  the

trends  and  the  pace  which  are  too  willingly

imitated   by  our  less  affluent  youths,   with

disastrous consequences. I say so because the more

affluent youths of our society are, on the  whole,

better  educated and consequently are in a  better

position  to apprise their actions than  the  less

affluent  youths.  The  former  are  in  a  better

position  to recover from their misdeeds and  more

quickly  than  could  the  latter.  That   is   my

assessment.  I must say that there are  more  less

fortunately placed youths than the rich ones,  and

whatever  these  youths do might  have  more  far-reaching  repercussions  upon  our  society.  They

might  not  be trend-setters or pace-setters,  but

the  fact  that they uncritically ape and  imitate

the ways of the less inhibited affluent youths  is

an  indication of the trends towards a society the

principal    characteristic    of     which     is

permissiveness.   These  youths,   I   feel,   are

alienated   from  society  due  to   a   lack   of

understanding  of  their  roles.  This   lack   of

understanding  of their roles, in my  opinion,  is

attributed in a large measure to some deficiencies

in  our society. The people that count-parents and

teachers,  community leaders  and  certain  public

figures  in industry and commerce-have  failed  to

imbue in our youths the feeling that living  in  a

developing society such as ours would need them to

sacrifice their pleasures and devote much of their

time  and energy towards more constructive efforts

rather



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>



than the mere pursuit of mundane pleasures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr C. V. Devan Nair, the N.T.U.C. Secretary-General, had occasion last year to mention the

danger  of becoming complacent about the  economic

and  social success of Singapore. He mentioned the

increasing  proneness to insular  smugness,  self-satisfaction   and  self-centredness   which   was

completely  unjustified because Singaporeans  live

in  one of the hottest trouble spots of the world.

As   a   remedial  measure  to  ensure  that  such

complacency is shattered, he suggested that "large

therapeutic doses of geopolitical realism was  the

only  way the distorted and self-satisfied insular

perspectives could be corrected. Only then can we,

as  a  people, get our priorities right." I cannot

but  agree with what has been said by Mr Nair.  It

would  seem  to me that only the most concentrated

efforts on our part are necessary to instil in our

youths  the  need  for  an  understanding  of  the

realities  of  our situation. We must,  if  it  is

necessary,  jolt  our people into  a  serious  and

thoughtful mood. We must ask ourselves if  we  can

survive  as  a  nation without the ingredients  of

national  survival,  national unity  and  national

progress. We must ask ourselves how the  poor  can

be  uplifted from their poverty, and how  everyone

of  us here can be secure in our society. We  must

ask  ourselves how we can ensure that  the  racial

sensitivities of our people are not hurt, and  how

we  can  inculcate  in  our youths  a  feeling  of

loyalty  to  this  country. These  are  imperative

questions  and our answers to them  pave  the  way

either to progress and prosperity, or to chaos and

destruction.  An  awareness of all  these  in  our

youths  may conceivably lead to a shedding of  the

fetishes they have so uncritically taken from  the

more irrational aspects of Western culture. In  my

opinion, in the interest of our survival, governed

as  we  are  by the imperatives of the moment,  we

have  to  set  up the machinery to re-educate  our

youths  in the ways that point to our survival  as

an  entity. Such practices as the sporting of long

hair,  the smoking of ganja, the taking of  drugs,

the wearing of outlandish sartorial fashions and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>



the  like are alien to our way of life and  cannot

fill the cultural and spiritual vacuum that we are

supposed  to experience today. In other words,  we

must  have our priorities right, and to do  so  we

must develop in ourselves a capacity to understand

the day-to-day implications of the significance of

events  that  move around us, around  our  nation,

around  our people and around our region. We  must

be  proud  of  our own respective  cultures,  only

drawing   upon  other  sources  that  enrich   and

strengthen  them.  We must discard  anything  that

tends  to  enervate and encourage  the  growth  of

others that give new impetus to the development of

our  own. In this way, we can not only ensure  the

continued survival of our cultures, but also their

strength,  so that they become the source  of  our

own  power, the fountain of our creative  energies

and  the guarantor of our civilization. Our youths

must  be  made aware of this, as such an awareness

is the catalyst to pride and joy in being nurtured

to  full manhood, through an appreciation  of  the

achievements   of   our   forefathers,   of    the

tribulations they underwent, and of their triumphs

in the face of great adversities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Asia today is poised for great changes.

We  are part of these changes and we are in  them.

If  the  sixties have given us much, we can expect

more  from the seventies but we need to develop  a

maturity of understanding so that, in anticipation

of  these  great  changes, we are not  looking  at

things  through  the perspective  of  a  stagnant,

backward  and un-progressive society. The dynamics

of  survival  in a turbulent corner of  the  world

should  serve  as  a  spur  to  us  to  accelerate

performance  in all the fields of human  endeavour

so that, in a world torn by strife and dissension,

we can serve as a beacon, as a light for others to

emulate and to follow. Our youths must know  this,

and  they  must  realise that the  imperatives  of

survival  are  paramount and must take  precedence

over  all else. The alternative to this awareness,

I think, is stagnancy and death.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have already spoken at some length on

the  inherent  dangers  that permissive  attitudes

have   or  dangers  that  can  result  from  being

permissive. I have now to go a little further into

the  matter. By being non-permissive, it must  not

be construed that I am advocating that our society

should  be a closed one. There is always the  fear

that  if  one  is  not  permissive,  then  one  is

logically authoritarian. This does not necessarily

follow if we understand that in being disciplined,

one  proceeds  in a manner socially acceptable  in

going about one's business, and that none of one's

actions are outside the framework of the norm. The

question of permissiveness does not arise here, as

what one is doing is within the accepted framework

of   social   conventions.   For   instance,   all

legitimate intellectual endeavours must  not  only

be  sanctioned  but  encouraged  and  nurtured  as

furthering  our own cause. In matters of  cultural

pursuits,  any  that  does  not  conduce  to   the

furtherance of our culture should he frowned upon.

A body of ideas, be they philosophical, religious,

political  and economic, which do not run  counter

to  the  general welfare of the masses,  that  is,

they  are not inimical to the state, ought  to  be

supported. That is my opinion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, a pragmatic approach to

the  complex mechanics of survival should  be  the

criterion  with  which we judge our  actions.  Our

youths  should  be  critically  discriminating  in

their   choice  of  Western  ways.  The  perennial

questions to ask are: Are these useful to  us?  Do

they  conduce  to the overall development  of  our

state? Do they lift us to a higher stage of  life?

If  the  answers  are in the negative,  we  should

instantly reject such ways and be emphatic in  our

denunciation  of  them. Any  protagonist  for  the

adoption of such ideas must be out of his mind and

he  must quickly be put right before the youths of

our   state  are  corrupted.  After  all,  certain

aspects  of our life have a more permanent  value:

respect  for  our  elders,  personal  honesty  and

integrity are universal qualities. On the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



other hand, such qualities can be mocked at and be

looked upon as quaint survival of a past age,  but

what  substitutes can we have for  them?  Can  the

transitory    pleasures   of   the    pipe,    the

irrationalism of hippie behaviour and  psychedelic

music  replace  the more lasting  satisfaction  of

having  honestly done a day's work?  Only  a  sick

society  can  permit itself to  be  permissive  in

matters that mean the difference between life  and

death.  Only  a sick nation can be indifferent  to

the  destructive forces that are in its midst. And

only  a  nation  that has ceased to  struggle  can

tolerate a philosophy that extols the qualities of

negativism. We live in a state of constant change,

of  tension, of an incessant urgency to  improvise

and innovate. Surely the more reasonable approach,

and  perhaps  the  only logical  approach  to  our

problems,  is  the cultivation of the  virtues  of

leading a more Spartan life. The vital question is

to  know our priorities. Here we cannot be in  two

frames of mind. We know in which direction we  are

heading,  and this awareness should determine  the

pace and the trends of our developmental patterns.

Our  priorities will dictate our policies and they

will, taking precedence over all others, determine

the shape of our society.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan (Crawford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, we gather once again to examine  the

past and to plan for the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a democracy, Parliament has a solemn duty to

the  people, as the decisions made in this Chamber

will  gravely  affect their livelihood.  For  this

reason,  the  Government's decisions and  policies

must  be  thrashed  out in this  Chamber.  And  as

representatives of the people, we have  no  choice

but  to carry out this duty without being affected

by personal considerations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fundamental question that we must ask is: for

whom  are  we planning and working, and  in  whose

interest  are we asking the people to work  harder

and make sacrifices?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to this question will spell out our

basic political beliefs and objectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must work for the creation of a fairer and

more  equal society for all, and not just for  any

minority group. This will guide us in our work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me thank the Government for

assuring us that, as soon as we can ascertain  and

overcome  the  overall  effects  of  the   British

military  withdrawal, we will rethink  and  adjust

our  existing wage policy. I hope and believe that

this is not an electioneering tactic, but a clear-cut acknowledgment of our workers' contribution to

our  country's economic growth. In the  past,  our

workers   have  worked  hard,  accepted   stricter

discipline  and contributed much to  our  nation's

economic  progress.  Foreign and  local  investors

have  obtained good returns for their investments.

It  is  now time for us to consider rewarding  our

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to make a rethink of our policy to ensure

that  we are able to distribute the fruits of  our

progress more fairly and equally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean that our people, especially

those  in  the  front line of the "battle"  -  our

workers  - can now relax. Far from it. We have  to

work harder to get better results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a progressive society, our immediate task is

to  afford  better and up-to-date  facilities  for

workers  to  learn  and acquire better  skills  in

keeping   with   the  progress  in   science   and

technology. This is one sure way of increasing our

workers'  productivity  and  contributing  to  our

country's  future progress. This will  be  in  the

interest  of  the people as a whole and  they  can

make further and greater contributions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot hope to continue for long to attract

foreign investments by providing cheap labour with

the blood and sweat of our workers. We have to  be

proud of our right-thinking workers who are better

equipped  and  skilled in attracting  foreign  and

local  investors and in carrying out the  task  of

ensuring our survival.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider it to be unwise to attach too much

emphasis on widening the gap between the rich  and

the poor as conducive to economic growth. This may

be  applicable to countries dependent  on  foreign

aid  where many economic theorists gain honour for

advocating  such  thinking.  Such  thinking   will

inevitably  strengthen the roots of a  society  in

which  man  will  exploit man. It  advocates  that

human  beings  should  worry only  about  material

gains  and discard the higher ideals of  life.  It

converts  society  into  a  gathering  place   for

monsters  and  walking dead.  It  denies  man  the

opportunity to develop normal relations  with  his

fellowman,  and,  in  so doing,  affords  economic

aggressors    the    opportunity    to     exploit

contradictions  between  men.  Finally,  it   will

degrade  the  poor working-class to the  level  of

labouring  tools  for  the  rich,  who  are   only

conscious  of  their ability to work and  produce.

The  end  result  of  their hard  work  will  only

enhance the growth of the pyramid of wealth of the

rich.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think this is agreeable to hon. Members

whose basic political convictions are based  on  a

socialistic outlook and the enhancement  of  human

dignity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage of our development, in order to

ensure  that  our  economic  growth  rate  is  not

impeded, we have to place greater emphasis on  the

cultivation of sound knowledge and greater  skills

in  our workers and the elevation of the level  of

their thinking in the interest of the country.  We

have  to  ensure that the dignity of every citizen

is  protected  and enhanced, so that with  greater

determination we can achieve greater  gains.  This

will  ensure that both foreign and local investors

will have greater faith in us. Coupled with proper

governmental planning and guidance, we  will  then

be able to achieve greater heights of prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since entering politics, our new Minister for

Labour  has demonstrated without reservation  that

he  is  a far-sighted and capable leader.  He  not

only   cares  for  the  working-class,  but   also

identifies his interests with theirs. I am sure he

will not disappoint the people but will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>



work  for greater protection of the workers' right

and dignity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of rapid industrialisation and

urbanisation, and the improvement in our  material

well-being,  Singapore, like many other  countries

in   the  world,  is  daily  faced  with  imposing

environmental problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that the Government immediately set up

a  statutory board with sufficient powers to  look

into  and deal with problems associated with urban

renewal, land use, planning and pollution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, we have not been able to look more

closely at the chain effects which industrial  and

economic progress has on our environment. In order

to  achieve  a higher growth rate of our  GNP,  we

have  not paid enough attention to the more subtle

"social   cost"  involved.  This  is   regrettable

indeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have to look boldly at the problems,

and the following are basic guide-lines:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) We have not reached the stage of some of the

more affluent countries. To a certain extent,  our

people  are  still  preoccupied  with  the   basic

requirements  of  daily subsistence.  We  have  to

depend  on further economic growth to elevate  the

standard   of  living  of  our  people.   However,

economic progress and the protection of a gracious

living  environment need not be  contradictory  if

proper policy planning is made of the use of  land

and the distribution of population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) No environmental planning should run

contrary to the intellectual requirements of  man.

We    should   primarily   consider   the   proper

development of interrelations between communities,

and between man and his fellowman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) No plans that will curtail the full

development of individual potential and add  undue

stress  and  strain  on the individual  should  be

approved without sufficient reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) We have to emphasise the intangible "social

cost"  involved in the evaluation of any  economic

programme.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The public must have sufficient say in any

plans affecting their living environment. We  have

to  encourage public participation in our planning

process  and  not  be  solely  dependent  on   the

technocrats and experts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, urban renewal is meant partly to

enhance  the  living  conditions  of  our  people.

Therefore,  our urban renewal planning  should  be

made to suit the needs of the people. The best way

to  do  this  would be constantly to  consult  and

listen to the views of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) As problems relating to the environment and

anti-pollution   measures   are    involved    and

extensive, we have to rely on the co-operation  of

the   more   advanced  countries  for   up-to-date

techniques in these fields.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) In any anti-pollution measure, we have to

stress more on the educational aspects than depend

heavily  on the enforcement of the law. I  believe

we will make progress in these fields.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of anti-pollution measures reminds me of

our water problem. I think we have to try to solve

it from three directions, namely, by:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) increasing our sources of water supply and

ensuring that these sources are not polluted;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) strengthening our water management

techniques,  and employing up-to-date  methods  in

the case of water management; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) educating our citizens on the value of

water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, any programme aimed at increasing our

sources of water supply is expensive. Very careful

consideration must therefore be given to prevent a

wrong decision being taken. Most of the scientific

methods of water purification and desalination are

still  in  the  experimental stage, although  much

research  and  progress have  been  made  in  this

field. I agree we should not attempt to adopt  any

scheme  that  has not been tried on an  industrial

scale elsewhere. We cannot afford to experiment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the P.U.B, has assigned specialists to

study the water problems



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>



so  as  not to make any grave mistake. Any mistake

we  make  in  this  respect will cause  us  severe

financial losses and we may not have the  time  to

make good our losses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of water management, I think we

should send some of our younger technicians to the

more  advanced  countries  to  study  and  acquire

expertise.   Water   management   techniques   are

progressing  at a fast pace. We cannot  expect  to

tackle these problems by staying stagnant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interest of our security, and in ensuring

that  our  future generation will  have  a  better

chance  of  survival, we cannot fail. We  have  to

educate  actively our people to preserve and  care

for  our water supplies. Within limits, incentives

must  be given to those who are exemplary in  this

respect. I think the Government must work harder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a multi-racial country like Singapore, anyone

who,   wittingly  or  unwittingly,   ignores   the

potential  danger  of  fooling  around  with   the

language issue is looking for trouble. Anyone  who

wants  to stir up communal frustration is  playing

with  a time-bomb which, when exploded, will  hurt

the  player first. This will do nobody  any  good.

When  an  individual or group  displays  any  such

tendency, it is the duty of the Government to  put

a stop to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has pledged to treat equally all

the  four languages, religions and races.  In  the

interest  of  the  people,  we  have  to   support

unreservedly  the  Government's  efforts  in  this

direction.   Of   course,  we  also   expect   the

Government   to  demonstrate,  in   concrete   and

tangible form, this policy of equality for all the

races, languages and religions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Member of the governing party, I call on

the   Government   leaders  and   those   directly

connected  with  us  to  demonstrate  unreservedly

their faith in this policy. No one irrespective of

his  position, must be allowed to be  hypocritical

about  this  and make statements contrary  to  the

Government's proclaimed policy. Otherwise we  will

only  increase our enemy's firing power and weaken

our own camp.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether or not we can produce in as short a time

as  possible  a good number of young  Singaporeans

conversant in two or more than two languages  will

determine  to  a  large  extent  our  chances   of

survival  as  a sovereign country. Of  course,  we

will  require  the younger generation  to  receive

their  education first in their mother tongue  and

then  learn  a  second, or even a third  language.

History  has shown that through the "mother-tongue

education",  we  have been able to  produce  hard-working  and  proud  "sons of Singapore".  In  our

history,   the  majority  of  those   who   fought

colonialism  and  stayed  at  the  front  line  of

industrialisation  on the factory  floor  are  the

products of the "mother-tongue education". Without

them, we would not be here today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The language problem is a sensitive one. When

trying  to  examine  the  problem,  no  amount  of

hysterical outcry will help. Similarly,  to  clamp

down  on  the  discussion of the problem  is  also

unwise   as  this  will  only  sweep  the  problem

underground temporarily. Both these methods can be

exploited by our enemy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take as an example the case of one of our

neighbouring countries. They have mismanaged their

language  problem.  At one stage  they  encouraged

open  and  unreserved discussion.  They  got  into

trouble and many people were killed. They then had

to stop the discussion by force and ultimately had

to impose a constitutional clamp on discussions of

such   issues.  Their  mismanagement  had   caused

irreparable damage to their own country!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider the best way to solve the question is

by   a   concrete  and  tangible  policy  and   to

demonstrate  our faith and belief  that  a  multi-racial approach is the only workable solution.  We

have to be sober and alive to the problem from the

long-term point of view and interest. This  cannot

be  a  simple problem, otherwise there  would  not

have been so much bloodshed all over the world  on

such  issues. However, it is a problem  that  will

decide our survival and we have to face up to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now turn my attention to the problems of

our youth. This is also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



related  to  the  problems of  continuity  in  our

leadership. No government can escape this problem.

It is the duty of the Government to lead our youth

along the path of righteousness and pro, vide  our

country with vitality so that our progress can  be

further enhanced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us admit that our young people are no

different  from  others. They are never  satisfied

with  the present realities of life. They ask  for

changes  which may be considered extreme. If  they

do    not    have   ways   of   expressing    such

dissatisfaction,   they   will   develop   certain

tendencies    that   might   well   destroy    the

establishment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, in view of our material prosperity

and   also   because   of  the   overemphasis   on

materialistic  achievements, such youthful  desire

for  changes may not be apparent. However, is  not

the  path  taken by the youth in some of  the  so-called advanced countries an eye-opener to us?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This temporary phenomenon, which runs contrary

to human nature, will soon come to pass. Our youth

will  soon  wake  up.  No  one  has  succeeded  in

suppressing the problems of youth by force or  the

erosion  of their enthusiasm by harmful  cultures.

This can only exacerbate their resentment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong with young people being

enthusiastic  and  idealistic.  It  is   precisely

because members of our present Government in their

young days were prepared to be "action-packed" and

willing to fight for their ideals that we have the

Singapore of today. Therefore, we have to call  on

our young people to be prepared to make sacrifices

for  the cause of high ideals. Then and only  then

can  they  contribute  and  bring  us  to  greater

heights of achievements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But just what do we see? Our society is one of

glorifying  in greater materialistic  achievements

and of encouraging achievements without regard  to

the  rightness  of the means employed  to  achieve

them.  There  is a lack of ideals and respect  for

the  better  side  of  human  life.  We  have  not

provided our youth



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>



with  the  right atmosphere and infrastructure  to

constructively bring about changes for the better.

In  their  upbringing, as it were,  we  have  only

inculcated  in them the ability to listen  and  to

follow,  and not the ability to question and  find

out the truth. Are we moving backwards? It is time

for us to ponder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, quite a few years have passed

without  any opposition in this House.  Obviously,

the  people  will pass judgment on our performance

under  these  circumstances.  The  surest  way  to

destroy  Singapore  is to deny  the  people  their

rights  under  a  democracy.  Our  task  as  loyal

Backbenchers  is  made more than  difficult  under

existing  conditions. Luckily, both the Government

and  we  ourselves possess sufficient  courage  to

accept   criticism  and  are   willing   to   make

adjustments where necessary in the interest of our

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the recent announcement by the

Government to increase the compensation for  those

affected  by  resettlement and  new  measures  for

tackling the hawkers' problems are laudable.  They

must not be taken to be electioneering tactics but

a demonstration of the Government's will to submit

to  the wishes of the people, and the Government's

profound    understanding    of    the    people's

difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years to come, the Government will have

to  strengthen  its resources in ascertaining  the

views  of the people to ensure that they  will  be

attended  to.  This will enhance  our  chances  of

surviving as a united nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reporters and editors of the press must know

their  obligations  to the people  under  existing

circumstances.   Similarly,   I   call   on    the

Government,  through its Ministry of  Culture,  to

enhance  the social status of our journalists  and

writers,  They  are able, to a  great  extent,  to

reflect  and  bring forward the  thinking  of  our

people.  We  ask them to fulfil their obligations.

Therefore,  we  must also recognise  their  social

status.  This  is  one  of  our  basic  tasks   in

protecting   and  enhancing  the  principles   and

practice of democracy in our country.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will be naive enough to deny the inevitable

return of opposition to this Chamber. But we  must

annihilate  all those who are working for  foreign

interests   and  wish  to  gain  ground   in   cur

confusion.  We  should also not  allow  anyone  to

disrupt the unity of our people on the pretext  of

airing democratic views but with sinister motives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, people of all descriptions have been

busily  organising  political parties.  Some  pro-labour  intellectuals  are even  airing  the  view

that, as they are uncertain of the political stand

of  the successors to the present Government, they

propose  that  at  some  opportune  time   a   new

political  party  should be organised  to  protect

labour  interest.  All these  are  adding  colour,

confusion   and  complications  to  the  political

scene.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come what may, the Government must fearlessly

carry  out  its  policies in accordance  with  the

basic  interest of our people. In the  end,  I  am

sure our people will solidly give their support to

those who are working in their interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an era when President Nixon, the leader

of  a nation proud of its military might, will  be

visiting  China,  a country that  thrives  on  the

sheer  will of her people. In such an era  let  us

keep  reminding  ourselves that no  other  country

owes it to us that we should survive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only we ourselves can ensure our own chances of

survival, and if we fail there will be no  one  to

regret our destruction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to support the motion moved by the

Member for Ulu Pandan.



<br><br>3.40p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like to refer to a particular statement  in

the  President's  speech, and generally  voice  my

thoughts on it. The President has declared, "If we

are   to   remain  a  cohesive  people,  we   must

concentrate on the factors which bind us together,

and not those which will divide us."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us view some possible areas in the life

of our people wherein we may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



highlight those factors which tend to unite us. We

may then decide to stress the development of those

unifying features of our society. Perhaps  we  can

discern  more clearly such areas of common purpose

if  we bear in mind the aspiration and striving of

our  people for a better and ever better  life  in

all  ways.  One  such  important  area  of  common

striving is the area of the economic life  of  our

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At work, Sir, co-operation between workers and

management  continues to be  crucial  to  economic

progress.  One  significant  way  in  which   such

cooperation  can be fostered is in  the  ways  and

means  through  which  the  quality  of  Singapore

products   may  be  ensured,  thus  resulting   in

increased productivity. To do this, the experience

of  our  workers  will have to be married  to  the

skill of our managers and technologists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I therefore welcome the

declaration  in  the addendum to  the  President's

speech  related  to the Ministry  of  Science  and

Technology  to  the effect that  among  incentives

being   considered  to  stimulate   research   and

development  in  the  industrial  sector  is   the

possible  provision of tax relief for  expenditure

on  equipment  and  technical  manpower  used  for

quality control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management should take advantage of such

incentives  when  they are offered.  At  the  same

time,  after  management has been  persuaded  into

introducing  quality control and  maintaining  it,

the  benefits of increased productivity should  be

passed   on   to  workers,  who  will  also   have

incentives  to co-operate in the progress  of  the

enterprise  they  work  in.  Here,   it   may   be

interesting to note the success of quality control

circles  in  Japan  where such circles  have  been

introduced.  It would appear that the Q.C, circle

is  "a group of workers and their supervisor,  who

organise themselves for the purpose of working  on

a  specific quality control problem related to the

work of their section of the plant." (I am quoting

from  page  1 of a little publication  called  The

Quality  Control  Circle by  a  Professor  Niland,

published in 1971, in collaboration with the Asian

Productivity Organisation.) I notice from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



a  perusal  of this little book that great  praise

has  been lavished on the achievement of the  Q.C.

Circle  movement. Perhaps, Sir, we should  take  a

closer look at this concept of co-operation to see

if it will work in our own industrial situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another machinery of industrial cooperation is

the  Works  Council.  I understand  that  a  Works

Council   is   intended  to  bring  about   direct

communication  between workers and management  for

the  purpose of promoting understanding and better

industrial  relaxations between the  two  parties.

Every support and encouragement should be given to

such   consultative  bodies  aimed  at   promoting

harmonious    relations   between   workers    and

management,   as  such  a  relationship   conduces

towards  industrial efficiency, and is yet another

integrative feature in our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area in which we can, and indeed must,

generate  attention to the factors which  bind  us

together  is the area of urban living.  Very  soon

half  our people will be living in flats and high-rise   dwellings   built  by   the   Housing   and

Development Board. In such dwellings multitudes of

our  people  live  in  dense  proximity,  not  the

average 8,000 to a square mile, but 20,000 or even

30,00()  to a square mile. We have to arrange  for

these people to feel happy where they live, to own

a  sense  of  belonging to their particular  local

community, to adjust to this way of living and  to

adapt themselves to one another. Our President has

said  that  the  approach of  the  Singaporean  to

problems  is generally practical and tolerant.  It

is in the circumstances of close urban living that

we have indeed to make the resort to the practical

and  tolerant  solutions to  problems,  especially

those  affecting  human relations,  ingrained  and

spontaneous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we do this? Our various campaigns to keep

Singapore clean and green, and pollution free, and

to  conserve water will have tended to make people

more  conscious of their responsibilities  one  to

another.  We should constantly remind  our  people

who live



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>



crowdedly close to one another that they  have  to

show  fraternal consideration for one  another  in

respect  of  noise,  litter,  cleanliness  and   a

general   sense   of  community  well-being,   the

understanding of one another's sensitivities,  and

so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember having occasionally watched a T.V.

programme  in Chinese which depicted  episodes  in

the lives of some who lived in H.D.B, flats. Would

that  we  had  writers of plays  who  could  aptly

portray  the  comedy  and drama  of  life  in  our

housing  estates.  Not with gauche  propaganda  or

with clumsily concealed exhortation, but with  art

and   subtlety  conveying  the  nuances  of  human

interaction. Do not the circumstances of living in

the housing estates provide material for satirical

or  for more serious presentation, so that we  may

be  moved to laugh at or ponder over the comedy or

drama  of our way of life? Our choreographers  and

artists  -  could  they  not  be  concerned   with

incorporating in their creations features that may

make  us  sensitive to our circumstances? For  our

life - life soon for one out of every two people -

will be life in a housing estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, while we are waiting for our poets

and  artists to get cracking, let us encourage the

formation of residents' associations in  order  to

facilitate   co-operation   and   adjustment    in

community   living.   Our  Citizens   Consultative

Committees   and  the  management  committees   of

community centres are rendering sterling  service.

Members  of  a  community, however,  cannot  leave

action  for  community benefit in the hands  of  a

few. It is good for as many people as possible  to

be  involved  in  looking after  their  community.

Residents'  associations will give  a  chance  for

people  to  come forward and make their  community

contributions, each in his own way. The  only  way

for  a  community to develop is through self-help.

Self-help  will generate confidence,  self-respect

and a sense of belonging to a community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the ancillary help of residents'

associations   our  community   centres   may   be

revitalised.  There are many useful services  that

can be mobilised



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>



through   the   community   centre   organisation.

Supervised study can be arranged for children  who

would  otherwise  be  distracted  by  the  crowded

conditions  in  which they live.  Such  supervised

study  may  be held at a school near the community

centre  and near the housing estate, in  the  same

circumstances   as  supervised   study   sessions,

opportunities may be provided for children to have

oral practice in their second language. One of the

reasons   why  second-language  studies   are   so

retarded  today is the dearth of opportunities  to

have oral practice in the second language. For the

purpose of both supervised study as well as second-language  practice, the resources of a  particular

community  may  well  be sufficient  for  its  own

needs.  Office workers, older students,  teachers,

retired people - all sorts of people living  in  a

community  may  be persuaded to volunteer  a  very

modest bit of their time. But a sense of community

must be developed to sustain these contributions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to develop a sense of identity with a

locality,  perhaps a judicious  sense  of  rivalry

with  other  localities could  also  be  generated

through  games, friendly matches, debates, raising

of  scholarships to send children or residents for

special  or higher education, and so on.  Anything

that can give a distinctness to a community should

be   fostered.  But  never  a  sense  of   jarring

competition!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the possibilities are adequately exploited,

residents'  associations could well  be  a  social

institution  of  some significance  in  Singapore.

Already   we   have  had  examples  of  residents'

associations organising for security in precincts,

or to protest against an increase in property tax,

to help the consumers' movement, to arrange events

for the children of residents, and so on. What  is

needed is a sustained life of such associations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allied with close living is the problem of

recreation,  in our society there is a  grave  and

necessary emphasis on work orientation. There  has

not  been, in my view, adequate realisation of the

importance  also of leisure. Ours has  been  to  a

fair extent a Spartan emphasis. It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



useful  to note that as long as the Spartans  were

geared for strife they flourished, but as soon  as

they   experienced  prosperity   they   began   to

degenerate. I think it was Aristotle who said that

the  Spartans were secure as long as they were  at

war.  But  they  collapsed when they  acquired  an

empire. Sebastian de Grazia, author of a, I think,

definitive  work  on leisure, has  stated  that  a

citizenry  unprepared for leisure will  degenerate

in prosperous times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defining leisure very simply (I hope this is not

an  over-simplification), I would  equate  leisure

with the time for healthy recreation. I think  the

need  for  recreation  is basic  to  man's  nature

inasmuch as he needs to relax from the effort  and

tension  of  work  and thus preserve  a  physical,

psychological  and  spiritual harmony.  There  are

certain   aspects  of  compulsion  in   our   work

situation.  Recreational activities and  interests

are  chosen  freely and thus they meet more  fully

people's  needs and predispositions. Work  is  not

always  compatible with temperament and the hidden

cravings  of  the worker. Recreation as  a  safety

valve is thus essential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally important is the fact that recreation

provides all sorts of opportunities for our people

to  come  together in the social  and  integrative

atmosphere of recreational activities. When people

are  living  in close proximity, their  collective

instincts   seek   expression.   A   desire    for

association      is     enhanced.     Recreational

opportunities    are    therefore,     in     such

circumstances, not merely desirable but essential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another argument for greater urgency to be given

to  the  provision of recreational  facilities  is

that    cultural   interaction,   tolerance    and

broadmindedness  all  result from  the  influences

that people exert on one another. I have heard  of

plans  to  organise recreation on  a  constituency

basis. It is important that such plans are brought

to  early  fruition. I am sure  various  Citizens'

Consultative    Committees,    community    centre

organisation's and associations of residents and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



house-owners  in  Housing  and  Development  Board

estates  could  be  got  to  co-operate  in   such

enterprises  yielding yet another opportunity  for

collaboration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what we must have are more areas set aside

for  recreation - for basketball courts, badminton

halls,  swimming pools and the like.  1  think  we

should  look a little more closely at our  current

provision  of golf courses to see if  this  is  an

economic use of land for recreational facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the provision of possibly more

optimally  used  facilities,  and  with   specific

reference to my own constituency. I wonder if  the

space  enclosed  by the bend of  Mountbatten  Road

opposite Fort Road may be looked into as  a  venue

for  recreation  for  the  people  living  in  the

crowded  Tanjong Rhu Housing Estate. When I  think

of the swimming pools in Queenstown, the badminton

hall  in Mountbatten and other amenities in  other

constituencies,  I feel extremely  envious  and  I

feel  impelled  also  to make  representation  for

added facilities for those in my constituency  who

need  these provisions. At the same time, I  would

hope  that the pedestrian bridge that I have asked

to  be  erected  in the vicinity of  the  Tun  Sri

Lanang  School be erected with greater  expedition

than  seems  to be demonstrated at present.  Other

less crowded vicinities have had this facility.  I

wonder  why  there  should  be  a  delay  in   the

provision of this facility in this instance.  This

bridge  is  necessary also in order to get  people

across to recreational facilities which 1 hope may

be provided soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another sphere in the organisation of the

life   of   our   community,  important   to   its

integration,  is  the sphere of  adult  education.

When  people attend adult education classes,  they

are  united  in  their purpose of improving  their

life's  situation.  They experience  an  encounter

with   different  views.  They  acquire  a  deeper

respect for democratic exchange. They become  more

disposed to resort to rationality; yet they imbibe

a pro-founder cultural awareness



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More emphasis must be given to adult education,

especially    through   our    community    centre

organisation.  Of  course, the atmosphere  in  the

adult  education  situations  that  the  community

centre  may  provide will be less  formal  than  a

classroom  situation, but the  provision  will  be

valuable  all  the  same. I suggest  that  regular

programmes   of  community  education   talks   be

scheduled  at  community centres.  I  have  myself

helped  to  get speakers (in Hokkien and  Mandarin

and  a  coming  one' in Malay) for  talks  at  one

community   centre.  I  think  these  talks   have

resulted  in  a worthwhile social and  educational

experience for those who attended them,  including

the  speakers. The situation that prevails, so far

as  I  have  noticed up to the present,  is  quite

unlike that in a classroom, where these talks  are

concerned. For one thing, the mothers have brought

their children along. For another, other- children

have come along, for the fun of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speakers have to be provided with

microphones and loudspeakers, and have to  be  the

best  available for the topics concerned. We  must

expose  the  community to experts. Those  who  are

academically disposed are given a chance  to  come

to grips with Singapore at grass-roots level. I do

not  think it beyond the ingenuity of the People's

Association  to  get speakers  for  its  community

centres,  if  this  idea  of  community  education

strikes it as worthwhile pursuing. One thing about

such  talks  as  1  have described,  they  do  not

possess  a "campaign" atmosphere. They are  not  a

vehicle for propaganda. They are educational.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with these talks and in view of

the  growing  necessity  to  get  our  people   to

understand   better   the   operations   of    our

bureaucracy, I suggest getting the co-operation of

senior  civil  servants for  occasional  talks  at

community  centres,  in  the  situations  I   have

described, on the work, policy and aims of various

departments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another possible use of adult education for

community  development is the organisation  of  TV

viewing  groups. This would, of course, depend  on

TV



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>







Singapore  being  able to provide programmes  that

would    lend    themselves   appropriately    for

discussion. At the community centre level, a group

is organised to watch the programme and to discuss

the programme topic further, or even the programme

itself  if  it  happens  to  be,  for  example,  a

dramatic presentation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another area in which a sense of a united

people  is  generated is in the area  of  national

service.  Not only does the establishment  of  our

defence  credibility ensure internal security  and

offer  a  force that will co-operate readily  with

others  to  ensure stability in  our  region,  but

national  service also gives opportunity  for  our

people  to  be trained together, to work together,

to  eat  together, and to live together.  In  this

way,  our young people who are called up learn  to

rub  off,  the  rough  edges of  their  ethnic  or

cultural   affiliation   and   adjust   themselves

smoothly  to the ways and behaviour of  others.  I

agree with what has been stated in the addendum to

the Presidential speech related to the Ministry of

Foreign  Affairs,  that  a prerequisites  for  our

survival  as  a  distinctive  people  is  national

cohesiveness, and this cohesiveness  is  certainly

developing in national service and finds  national

service a most appropriate arena to develop in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I come to that humble

area   of   community   service   in   which   the

parliamentary  backbencher  operates.  This   very

address  which  we are debating  and  the  various

addenda contain an indication of how backbenchers.

while  conscious  of  their  obligations  to   the

Government,  have  adequately  represented   their

constituents  and  the  people  generally.  Higher

rates  of  compensation to tenants and  squatters,

rural  electrification,  anti-pollution  measures,

incentives for quality control, recommendation for

better bonuses for workers, industrial health  and

safety, amendments to the Workmen's  Compensation

Act,  emphasis  on  language  teaching,  plans  to

strengthen  the existing system of social  welfare

services- all these measures have at one time or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



another been agitated for by backbenchers who have

thus  contrived their own balance to the  cohesive

development of our community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I associate myself with my other colleagues in

thanking   the   President  for  his   speech   to

Parliament.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in the last few days  Backbenchers

and  certain Members sitting opposite have  spoken

at  length on the policy speech delivered  on  the

21st  of last month in this House. The debate  has

been  lively  and thought-provoking. Although  the

Members  in  this  House all belong  to  the  same

party,  however,  we,  the Backbenchers,  are  not

forgetting our role as such. We have been able  to

make  certain frank and constructive criticism  of

the  implementation  of policies  and  of  certain

aspects of the policies. As the Member for  Katong

has  just  said,  many of the  original  views  of

Backbenchers have been incorporated in the  policy

speech. This shows that our Government is able  to

accept   and  follow  the  views  of  Members   of

Parliament,  namely,  those  of  the  people.  Our

Government is elected by the people and its policy

has  to be based on the wishes of the people. This

goes without saying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy speech has inspired and enlightened

us  and has given us a lot of food for thought. It

has  filled us with confidence for the  future  of

our country, which is the most important aspect of

it.  It is gratifying to note that after six years

of independence we have been able to make progress

on  all fronts. However, we must avoid a sense  of

complacency permeating our society. We are just at

the initial stage of nation-building. Although  we

have  been able to surmount many difficulties  and

problems, the tasks ahead and the problems  facing

us  are still enormous and thorny. They await  our

resolute  solution,  especially  so  when  we  are

living in this region of super-power politics.  As

a  small  island-state, we should he cautious  and

prudent in our policy and in our actions in  order

to ensure our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>



survival.  Hence, national interest  should  take

priority   over   everything  else.   Any   force

threatening our survival, whether from inside  or

outside,  should be countered vigorously  by  all

our people in unison.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the inadequacies of our natural

resources  is  the  limited land  we  have.  This

cannot be overcome in a short time. Although  our

reclamation schemes are being carried out day and

night,  they take years to complete. In order  to

keep  on  progressing and developing, we have  to

acquire more land to development. On these lands,

properties and the means of livelihood, etc, will

have  to be resettled elsewhere. It is gratifying

to  note that the Government could appreciate the

difficulties and hardships of the people affected

by  resettlement.  Recently, the  Government  has

announced that higher rates of compensation  will

be  awarded to those affected by resettlement. As

there  will be financial losses and inconvenience

resulting  from  resettlement,  those   who   are

carrying  out  the  resettlement  scheme  should,

where possible, see that the settlers should  not

suffer  any unnecessary hardship. They should  be

helped  to  tide over their difficulties  in  the

transitional  period to resume their  livelihood.

They  should  abide  by these principles  of  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in the last ten years the resettlement

scheme   has  been  smoothly  carried  out,   the

Resettlement Department, which can boast  of  its

efficiency,  has  assumed a very  burdensome  and

onerous  task because of rapid development.  This

seems to be difficult for the department to  cope

with, thus affecting the settlers adversely.  For

example,  in  Jurong,  when  a  certain  area  is

earmarked  for development, the farmers  in  that

area  would  like  to move out  to  a  new  place

quickly,  because  if the period  of  waiting  is

long,  they would not be able to carry out  their

normal  activities, thus resulting in a reduction

in  their  income, Also, because  of  reclamation

work  around  the  area, some of  the  roads  are

blocked  out  causing  difficulties  in  traffic.

Because of the fleet of lorries conveying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



earth  from one place to another, even the  wells

from  where the farmers get their drinking  water

are polluted. However, these are not the worst of

their  problems.  The  most  distressing  problem

which  is causing the deepest anxiety among  them

is  that  the ditches and drains are  silted  and

choked, causing floods whenever there is a  heavy

downpour.  Their  chicken-pens and  pigsties  and

even  their  dwellings would then  be  soaked  in

water,  and  their  crops destroyed.  The  losses

could be quite considerable. I have been to  such

areas and I personally have seen that the ditches

and  the  drains have been silted and  choked  to

such  an extent that dredging them is impossible.

The  only\ solution to their problems is to  help

these farmers resettle in a resettlement area  as

quickly as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a few months ago, when making an

adjournment  speech in this House. I  touched  on

certain   problems   relating  to   resettlement.

However,  these problems have not  been  entirely

solved  up to now. The authorities have not  been

able  to  give  speedy and adequate  compensation

once  and for all to the ground squatters in  new

resettlement  areas.  This  has  given  rise   to

disputes   and  confusion  between   the   ground

squatters  and  the  new settlers  and  has  thus

slowed down the resettlement scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my understanding, the Resettlement

Department  is  very shorthanded. Unless  it  can

recruit enough personnel, it would not be able to

cope  with  our  rapid development.  I  hope  the

Minister will take note of this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Member for Jalan Kayu said that

the   Government  should  pay  attention  to  the

rehabilitation  and welfare of resettled  people.

At  the very least, they should be provided  with

such  social amenities and services as they  used

to  get before they were resettled. I fully agree

with what the Member said. However, what puts  me

in  a  daze most is that whenever the authorities

intend to carry out certain resettlement schemes,

no  provision is given to the building of schools

as  part of the resettlement blue-print. Thus the

farmers who are affected by resettlement are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>







worried by the prospect that their children  would

not  be able to get places in the schools. Sir,  I

think  there  is  no need for  me  to  stress  the

importance of education here. To the poor  farmers

in  particular, it is very important  that  their

children  should get a good education. This  is  a

means  to improve their economic position  whereby

they can bridge the gap between the haves and  the

have-nots.  It  is  regrettable  to  say  that  no

provision  or  consideration  is  given   by   the

authorities concerned for the building of  schools

in   resettlement  areas.  For  example,   in   my

constituency, Loke Yang School was asked  to  make

way  for  development. After so many appeals,  the

school   could   only   get   about   $30,000   as

compensation and a piece of land in  the  Lim  Chu

Kang  resettlement area from the authorities. That

is  the  end  of it. The farmers are  expected  to

build  the  school  by themselves.  Although  many

farmers  are very keen on donating to the building

of  a  school, however, as settlers, they are  not

economically  strong enough, though  their  hearts

are  willing.  Even  with the donations  they  get

added to the compensation given by the Government,

they  still would not be able to build a standard-type  school.  If a substandard school  is  built,

with  lack  of equipment and facilities,  how  are

they  going to raise the standard of education  of

the  pupils?  In  the addendum to the  President's

speech,  mention  is made of the  raising  of  the

quality  of education. How are we going to achieve

this?  I hope the Minister will remember that  the

Government   labels  itself   as   a   socialistic

government.  When the farmers have been  resettled

elsewhere, the educational needs of their children

should  be well looked after. I hope the  Minister

will  personally take the initiative to see to  it

that in the resettlement areas, enough schools are

built,  for which he will be amply thanked by  the

resettled people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, talking about building schools, let me deal

with  certain  questions of  education.  From  the

policy  speech, we  know that  there  will  be  a

greater  flexibility in the field of education  so

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



every  child will be given an opportunity to learn

two  languages.  Thus, in the  coming  years,  our

publicised multilingual system with four  official

languages  will be given a true meaning  and  will

have  a  bright  future. Sir,  in  the  past,  the

problem  of  bilingualism  centred  on  the   time

available  for  the  teaching  of  the  languages.

However, the number of subjects remains the  same.

Although  we  are now stressing the importance  of

learning   a  second  language,  the  total   time

available for teaching is the same. We have  rigid

lesson plans which cannot be changed. We know that

certain  subjects, whether  in  primary  schools,

secondary  schools or pre-university classes,  are

repetitious  in  nature.  No  doubt  the   subject

contents  have been progressively graded. However,

I  think  it  is not necessary to go  deeper  into

these  subjects repetitiously, and we  should  not

spend so much time on the same subjects. I hope in

the  new  curricula for the primary  schools,  the

Ministry will give recognition to this. We realise

that  we  have  educational  experts  engaged   in

research  into the new curricula, and the  success

or  failure  of [his reform will affect  both  our

present  and  future generations and our  national

future.  So  1  hope  the Government  will  invite

educationists from the various educational  bodies

in  the communities to participate In more of such

research  and  to give their views. I  agree  that

more  time  should  be spent on  the  teaching  of

second languages in the primary schools. Bilingual

education should commence when children are in the

primary  schools. No doubt, this will  be  at  the

expense  of  certain  other  subjects.  But  these

subjects  could be taught later on to  allow  more

time  for teaching second languages. However,  the

curriculum should be properly planned and balanced

by our experts. Otherwise, our pupils will acquire

only a superficial knowledge of languages, lacking

in  certain important information. This  will  not

help  meet our social requirements. More  flexible

subjects  such  as  physical education,  the  fine

arts, handicraft and music might he taught in  the

second language to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>



provide  more  scope  for our pupils  to  practise

their second languages. This will help raise their

proficiency in the second language. However,  when

implementing   this  policy,   the   Ministry   of

Education should not be too hasty. It must  ensure

that  the status and position of teachers are  not

affected  and  changed.  The  characteristics  and

traditions of the various language-stream  schools

should be preserved. It is important to have  more

language periods. On the other hand, we must  also

ensure  that essential information, necessary  for

children growing up, is imparted to them. One good

feature  about Chinese education is that character

training  and  ethics are taught  right  from  the

beginning in the primary schools. This feature  is

worth preserving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, education is a long-term

process. The effectiveness of our education policy

will  largely affect the future of our nation.  We

should  therefore be cautious in implementing  any

new  policy. We should not be too hasty if we want

to get good results. Experiments and pilot schemes

should  be  carried out to test  whether  the  new

theory is workable before implementation. Thus  it

would involve many facets of education. Whether or

not our education policy will be successful mainly

depends   on  the  Teachers'  Training   College's

efforts in producing efficient teachers. There  is

a  saying that if you want to do a thing well, you

must sharpen the tool first. The effectiveness  of

the T.T.C, will have very far-reaching effects  on

whether our education policy will he successful or

not.  I  believe that in our educational  reforms,

the  T.1'.C, should  play a  more  effective  and

important role. In fact, it should become a centre

for theoretical studies and research. The findings

of  the  centre could then be implemented  by  the

Ministry  of Education with full participation  by

all  the  schools.  In this way,  the  effects  of

educational reforms will be more beneficial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judging from the enrolment of Primary T pupils in

the last few days we can see



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



that  it  is  a  very good sign. This  shows  that

parents   are   deeply   concerned   about   their

children's future. They were pre, pared  to  queue

up  day  and night am! even went without  food  in

order  to  get  a  place for their children.  This

deserve  our commendation. On the other  hand, we

have  to  ask ourselves this question: why  should

parents queue up to get places for their children?

This is not desirable. If foreign tourists were to

pass  by  these schools, they would be  under  the

impression  that there was an influx  of  refugees

from other countries. What is more serious is that

certain  unscrupulous  characters  exploited   the

situation  by occupying some places in  the  queue

and  selling them at exorbitant prices to  waiting

parents.  I feel the Ministry of Education  should

not  shirk its responsibility any more. It  should

make  an overall review of the registration system

for Primary I classes to stop similar occurrences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I associate myself with the Member for Ulu

Pandan in thanking the President for his speech to

this House.



<br><br>4.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> I rise to speak

in   support  of  the  motion  of  thanks  to  the

President's speech to this Parliament.  The  first

point which I wish to comment upon represents  one

aspect  of  the rapid rate of development  of  the

building  industry in Singapore. We are all  proud

of  the  fact that the success of the Housing  and

Development  Board  can be  clearly  seen  in  the

towering  blocks of flats which,  in  some  cases,

stand  on  formerly  swampy ground  or  wasteland.

Statistical  evidence of such  success  is  to  be

found in the fact that approximately one-third  of

the population of Singapore is accommodated in the

various  housing units put up by the  Housing  and

Development  Board.  It  is  also  a   matter   of

congratulation  that,  with  the  policy  of   the

Singapore Government to allow C.P.F, contributions

to  be  used  for  the purchase of  Housing  Board

flats, a substantial portion of residents in  such

flats  are  owner-occupier.  The  desirability  of

residing in or owning a Housing Board flat is one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



thing,  but the ability to do so is another thing.

Such  is  the demand for Housing Board flats  that

the  procedure  governing the allocation  of  such

fiats  has to be strictly adhered to, in order  to

ensure fair play for everyone concerned, not least

the applicants themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a well-known fact that only persons who

are  victims  of  a  fire  or  any  other  natural

catastrophe, or persons who are affected by  urban

renewal   schemes   involving  the   Housing   and

Development Board or the Government, may be  given

priority in the allocation of these flats. In  all

other  cases,  the applicants have to  take  their

turn in accordance with the order of registration.

There  is, however, a substantial group of persons

who  are not fortunate enough to be classified  as

fire   victims,  or  persons  displaced   by   the

Government's urban renewal scheme, but who are  in

the same and equally desperate position in respect

of  housing as that of other persons. I  refer  to

those  persons  who  have been  staying,  in  some

cases, for two or three decades in areas which are

now   acquired  by  private  developers  with  the

intention of putting up blocks of luxury flats  or

shopping  complexes. It is true that some  private

developers pay out fairly liberal sums of monetary

compensation to those persons who have been served

with  quit notices. There are developers  who  pay

only   a  token  sum  in  order  to  obtain  early

possession of the site. I have been approached  by

a number of such persons who seek my assistance in

obtaining Housing Board flats. It appears that  by

far the greater majority of such persons prefer to

utilise  the  monetary  compensation  to  purchase

Housing Board flats. Such persons are confused and

puzzled  by  the  predicament in which  they  have

found  themselves through no initiative  of  their

own.  The  alternative  housing  which  they   can

afford,  and  for which there is  a  long  waiting

queue, seems to be the monopoly of the Housing and

Development Board. On the other hand, their  homes

have been demolished by the private developers  to

make  way  for luxury blocks of flats or  shopping

complexes which are beyond



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



their means, even with the monetary compensation

provided by the private developers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the authorities to do something for these

unfortunate people. Granted that a certain  amount

of  suffering and inconvenience cannot be  avoided

in  the process of economic development, but it is

also  equally  true that it is the policy  of  our

Government   to   minimise  such   suffering   and

inconvenience  as far as is practicable.  This  is

evidenced by the recent decision of the Government

to  increase  the  rate  of compensation  paid  to

persons  affected by resettlement. In the  present

case,  perhaps  some  arrangements  can  be   made

between  the Government and private developers  to

provide  persons rendered homeless as a result  of

private   development  with  alternative  housing,

whether  put  up  by the Housing  and  Development

Board or otherwise, which is within their means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question of labour, I

wish  to support the sentiments expressed  by  the

Member  for Bukit Ho Swee. An early review of  the

wage   restraint  imposed  on  labour  should   be

considered.  It  is heartening to  note  that  the

Government  is conscious of the fact  that  labour

has,  in  no small way, contributed to  the  rapid

economic growth of Singapore. Unfortunately, there

are  still  some  employers who prefer,  for  some

reason  or  other, to ignore this. The payment  of

additional  bonus is one example.  Although  there

are  indications  that they have made  substantial

profits,  these  employers  are  not  prepared  to

consider any additional payment of bonus to  their

employees.  The  quantum of  bonus  negotiable  is

restricted  to one month's salary. Any payment  in

excess   of  this  amount  is  governed   by   the

provisions  of the Employment Act. Therefore,  the

unions  are not in a position to make any  further

claims on the employers even though they are quite

certain  that such employers have made substantial

profits.  In  this  respect,  I  would  urge   the

Government to consider providing some avenues  for

the   unions   to   bring  up   such   cases   for

determination.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with the accelerated rate of

withdrawal by the British Armed Forces,  thousands

of  our  citizens will be left without jobs.  From

experience, we find that not all of these  workers

can  be re-trained for alternative technical jobs.

Because of age and educational qualifications,  it

is  also  difficult for them to  find  alternative

employment in the private sector. I would ask  the

Government  to consider whether these workers  can

be  absorbed  in Government departments,  the  Car

Park  Division, the Postal or Hawkers' Department,

or   as  lift  attendants  in  public  or  private

buildings. It is a common sight to see many of our

able-bodied young men and women working in the Car

Parks Division and as lift attendants in public or

private  buildings.  Surely these  youths  can  be

discouraged from taking up such employment and  be

encouraged  to work in the industries where  their

youth and energy can be better utilised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the addendum to the

President's speech, it is mentioned that there are

plans  to restructure the existing w e if  a  r  e

institutions  and  that  new  facilities  will  be

provided. Here, I would like to seek f u r t h e r

clarification f r o m the Government whether  such

plans  include the extension of these  facilities,

such as homes for the aged and infirm, to our non-destitute  senior citizens. There are in Singapore

a  number of such senior citizens who could not be

admitted to the existing institutions because they

do  not  meet the qualifications imposed by  these

institutions.  Due  to family  considerations  and

other  problems,  many of these people  cannot  be

taken  care  of  by their children  or  relatives.

Members of their families are prepared to pay  for

the  services provided if such facilities are made

available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the Government will look

into the problems raised.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the second session of  the  Second

Parliament was solemnly opened by the President of

Singapore on the 21st of last month. That was  the

first time President Sheares performed the opening

ceremony of Parliament, which represents  the  two

million people of Singapore. On this occasion,  he

addressed   Parliament  on  the  policy   of   the

Government  for the coming session. We  thank  him

for  his speech and the policy directives for  the

Parliament to follow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been independent for six years. During

this  period, we have weathered many a  storm  and

pulled  through many difficult situations in  this

turbulent  corner of South-east Asia. The  capable

leadership  of the Government, together  with  the

concerted effort' and co-operation of the  people,

has enabled us to steer successfully through these

six  eventful years. Thus we are now able to march

confidently  into the l970s and to  meet  the  new

challenges facing us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President in his speech has also commended

the   Housing  and  Development  Board   for   its

achievements.  It  has  a  target  plan  to  build

100,000  units, at the rate of one flat  every  26

minutes  for the period 1971 to 1975, thus solving

the housing problem of our people.
