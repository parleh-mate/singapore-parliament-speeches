<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ETHNIC INTEGRATION POLICY</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr

Zainudin Nordin -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To ask the Minister for National development (a)

how  effective is the Ethnic Integration Policy; (b)  how

many  appeals  have  been received  by  the  Housing  and

Development Board for waiver of the policy on the grounds

of  (i)  sales  due to divorce, (ii) acquisition  of  new

flats  and (iii) financial difficulties; (c) how many  of

such appeals have been successful; (d) whether there  has

been  an  increase  of  such appeals;  (e)  what  is  the

assistance  that  HDB  renders to these  cases;  and  (f)

whether  there will be a further review or refinement  of

the policy in the near future.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Jalan Besar):</b> Question No. 1, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2859</b></font><br><br>



Ethnic  Integration Policy (EIP) was implemented in  1989

to  promote racial harmony in public housing estates. The

policy  maintains  the proportion of  each  ethnic  group

within certain neighbourhood and block limits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EIP has improved the ethnic balance in HDB

estates.   In 1989, 28% out of the 125 neighbourhoods had

at  least one ethnic group which reached or exceeded  the

neighbourhood  limit.   Now,  there  are  25%   of   such

neighbourhoods, although the number of neighbourhoods has

grown from 125 to 165.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between January and July this year, HDB received 181

appeals  for waiver of EIP for resale of flat.  The  flat

sellers appealed for waiver of EIP to widen their base of

potential buyers in order to secure higher selling prices

for their flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of them were selling their flats to buy another

HDB   flat  or  private  property  while  some  indicated

financial difficulty as the reason for the sale.  Only 7%

appealed to waive the EIP for resale of their flat due to

divorce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the EIP is very important in maintaining racial

harmony in Singapore, we have to apply it consistently.

Waiver is granted on a very exceptional basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EIP has worked well in forging ethnic

integration and harmony among HDB residents.  We will

regularly review and refine the policy if necessary.

<div align="center"><b>RETUNING THE CPF</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Resumption of Debate on the Prime

Minister's Statement [28th August, 2003].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Thank

you,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to join  in  this

discussion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few points to make on the recent

announcements on the CPF and I hope I will not repeat too

many points here.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2860</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I am of the opinion that the cut is not

deep enough if we are really trying to meet our objective

as  spelt out in the Prime Minister's speech and that  of

the NTUC's chief, Mr Lim Boon Heng.  If our reason is  to

make  our workforce a more competitive lot from a  wages'

point of view, then I personally think that the cut could

be  deeper.   A  three  percentage  point  cut  can  save

employers  about $1.3 billion a year.  The bulk  of  this

saving  will be appreciated by the biggest employer,  the

Government  and  the  Government-owned  companies.    The

Government, as the Deputy Prime Minister has  said,  will

save $175 million through this cut.  Employers are mostly

grateful   but   also  cynical  that  these   cuts   will

significantly  reduce  job losses  or  bring  in  foreign

investments or stop the outflow of investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the reality then, is this only a half

measure?   It would be a sorry day if employers bite  the

bullet only to make sacrifices for a short-term breather,

a  glitch on the globalisation radar screen.  If  we  are

seriously  trying  to lure MNCs back  and  be  a  serious

contender against China and India, this CPF cut will only

buy   us   a  bit  of  time  and  slower  the   pace   on

retrenchments.   But whether it will make  us  attractive

enough is a moot point which I hope there will be further

clarification on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the issue of land costs, DPM has

already  reassured that prices have fallen since 1994  by

as  much as 41%.  But are we still cost competitive  with

other  countries  around us?  We have  already  lost  big

clients  to  Malaysia  and  the  very  example  cited  by

Minister  Lim  Boon  Heng  of Philips  having  moved  its

manufacturing  plant  to Batam is also  another  case  in

point  -  cheaper land and labour costs in  Batam.   Land

costs,  I  think,  need  to be buffered  differently  for

different industries here.  As our retrenchments are most

deep  in  the  manufacturing sector then  it  is  equally

important to see how land costs can be reduced  for  such

industries  to  carry  on their  work  in  Singapore  and

provide jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is that if we aim to be the fashion

centre of the east, then the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2861</b></font><br><br>



retail sector needs a helping hand too.  A Straits  Times

article last March showed that land costs for SMEs soaked

up  between 5% and 10% for the manufacturing sector while

the  bill for the retail sector was between 40% and  50%.

Yes,  land costs are coming down but we need to  do  more

and  be more creative too.  We cannot afford to have  any

more  white  elephants if we can help it.  An example  in

point  would be to help small businessmen who are looking

for  cheaper rentals.  Might it not be a better  idea  to

rent  out the old HDB HQ at Bukit Merah at a much reduced

price   or   to  also  help  the  49  aspiring   business

enthusiasts from the NTU's Technopreneurship Centre  that

Mr   Raymond  Lim  spoke  about  last  week?   These  are

individuals  who need a start-up hand or a  helping  hand

with cheaper rentals.  This Centre in Bukit Merah - right

now I am not sure whether it is white or cream-coloured - can  become  a bustling centre, perhaps even  called  the

Creative Business Centre, and who knows, in time to come,

we  might  have a Sim Wong Hoo emerging with  all  credit

going to HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to comment on the $1 billion

relief  package.  It brought on a great  sigh  of  relief

that  we do know that in spite of the cut, the people  in

different sectors will be taken care of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cut Waste Panel is an excellent idea and I hope

the  terms  of  reference here will  include  looking  at

processes  and  schemes and not just the  smaller  items,

though  they are equally important.  Competition  between

health clusters and among hospitals has driven costs  up,

especially  sometimes  in terms of  salary  packages  for

clinicians.   Competition among schools has also  led  to

much out-doing of each other in terms of event management

or  brochure-ware  to  `sell' the  schools.   Competition

among  departments and across Ministries has also  driven

small launches into mini-stellar events.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument then that they are sponsored, in my

opinion,  by corporate sponsors' money, does ring  hollow

at  this point in time when this valuable money should go

into the coffers of Community

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2862</b></font><br><br>



Chest or any other charity that is crying out to help the

less privileged in our country.  I am heartened that  the

civil service salaries will be reviewed as it is hard  to

know  right now which market is driving up whose salaries

- the private driving up the public or the public driving

up  the  private.   A  clear example has  been  given  by

Minister  Lim  Boon  Heng last week on  the  benchmarking

across different work groups in that international  table

that he shared with us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On training, while we inject money to give more

training  for  the vulnerable and the unemployed,  may  I

also  suggest  that we redesign the job scope  for  Human

Resource   Departments.   HRM  and  HRD  (human  resource

development) in many companies are sometimes  functioning

as  separate entities or entities with very loose  links.

HRMs need to be agile, imaginative and visionary.  Often,

they are still functioning quite primarily as hirers  and

firers when globalisation demands a new order that  ought

to   include  personalised  career  planning  portfolios,

constant job-redesigning and training.  They need  to  be

ahead of the curve like UPS and Hewlett Packard who  have

constantly redesigned jobs and offered the right kind  of

training  so that retrenchment becomes hardly,  if  ever,

necessary.   It  is  an  irony  that  our  only   natural

resources - the human being, the worker - are led by HRMs

that are sometimes not fast enough on the move and do not

themselves  have  a  clear job description  on  personnel

enhancement,  processes and outcomes and to remain  ahead

of the curve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the aid schemes that were spelt out, I share Mr

Iswaran's  deep  concern on attitudes towards  people  in

need.   He has expressed his views so eloquently  that  I

will  just add this to the discussion - that as we render

aid to people in need we need to suspend our own judgment

or sense of values.  None of us will ever know what it is

like  unless we walk in the other person's shoes, as what

Atticus  said  in  the book "To Kill a  Mockingbird".   I

think  that is a lesson we can all remember when, through

our  frustration, we start passing on some of  our  value

judgments to the person in need.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2863</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it is vital to implement aid schemes well,

with consistency and with expertise.  Mr Ahmad Magad  has

already   spoken   on   this  need  to   have   financial

counselling.  I would just push it a bit further  to  ask

that  it be a one-stop financial planning and counselling

service  to families in need such that what needs  to  be

done  can be mapped out against a time-line and  all  the

aid  schemes  that are being offered and  pegged  to  the

training  that  they should be getting, plus  what  I  am

calling unofficially a "de-tox programme" to get  rid  of

the  problems that are stifling them or making them  more

dysfunctional  year  by year.  With  this  time-line  and

constant monitoring, I think we will be able to get quite

a number of our various aid schemes under a proper system

of implementation which eventually should have an outcome

that the family must move on and be better off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, a query on the help schemes. The HOPE and

the  Small Families Interim Assistance Schemes have  left

the  single  parents in the cold.  Then we ask  why  many

among  the single mothers do remarry and sometimes go  on

to  have  more children with their new spouses.  Most  of

them,  as  data would show, are in the low income  group.

Many  are also home-makers.  Empowering such women  takes

time,  training them for jobs will take longer when there

is  a conflicting demand on their time to look after  the

children.   They  also have a strong patriarchal  mindset

that  men are the ones who should look after them.  Given

all  these, it would be timely as social workers and VWOs

work and get on with the educational programmes for these

single  parents.  We should also back this with political

will  to help them to understand that people do come from

different circumstances and not just review such cases on

a  case-by-case basis.  In short, to me, the HOPE  scheme

and  the rental policy do lack the vision in helping such

families to get on and break out of the poverty cycle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the two most vulnerable groups, in my

opinion, who are in our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2864</b></font><br><br>



midst.  We need to think more long-term for them so  that

they  do not become a social cost to the nation and their

self-esteem is not compromised.   I thank the Ministry of

Manpower for giving me a very comprehensive reply  to  my

Question  on active and inactive CPF holders.  From  that

data, there are 1.1 million inactive CPF account holders,

of  whom  almost two-thirds are women.  Among the  active

account holders of 1.3 million male members, there  is  a

gross  balance of about $110,000 while women  have  about

$80,000.  Women tend to live longer than the men and they

have  much  less  in their CPF.  Many  have  dormant  CPF

accounts as a result of unemployment or being employed in

the  informal sector or being home-makers.   We  need  to

look  into  the CPF scheme to prop this up  with  various

schemes  that have been mentioned by Dr Jennifer  Lee  so

that  we  can help these women and help them through  the

later years of their life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask if the CPF Board would like

to  consider perhaps an acknowledgment for this group  of

women  who  hold  inactive  CPF  accounts  that  they  be

notified that their husbands are about to retrieve  their

retirement  package so that at least they are  aware  how

much  money their husbands have accumulated and also plan

with  them,  such that Batam becomes a figment  of  their

imagination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other group of people that I think we need to

pay  a little bit more attention to are the men and women

in  their  late  40s to 50s - the sandwich generation  is

what  we sometimes call them.  They have been responsible

family  members  taking care of their  children,  parents

and,  in  some  cases, grandparents.  The data  from  the

Manpower Ministry shows that men and women above 55  have

an  average  net  balance of about  $30,000  and  $23,000

respectively.  I wonder what is going to be left for them

to  see  through  their retirement and old  age.   Inter-generational transfer of CPF savings has led to  its  own

erosion  for this group of account holders.  The  savings

of  this group of people too need some kind of shoring up

so that they can tend to their health concerns as well as

retirement.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2865</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would just like to say that in this whole

CPF phenomenon, there is a whole group of people who have

upgraded  themselves constantly and may be  caught  in  a

jam.   There have been reports in the papers of  some  of

them earning about $2,000 vying for or living in a 5-room

flat, and wondering how they are going to cope.  While we

try and put in these packages, etc, for the current group

who  is  coming in, I think the financial counselling  at

the HDB end and at other various ends needs to be propped

up  so  that  people  are very  much  in  the  know.   As

Singaporeans, we too have to realise what  is  the  value

system that we are holding on to that has just led us  to

upgrade  and  upgrade, and now we are caught  in  not  so

wonderful a position, in some cases.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Thank you, Mr

Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I would like to address the issue of whether

we have a real plan to address our economic woes and also

how  radical  have  we  been in  trying  to  address  our

economic  problems  that we are seeing  right  now.   The

Prime  Minister  mentioned that the CPF changes  are  the

most radical ever made for a long time, but, with all due

respect,  Sir,  I  do  not see the radical  part  of  the

changes.   The  lowering of the CPF rate by 3  percentage

points is but a minor adjustment, in my opinion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the real issue is one of total cost. I would

like  to  take  up the analogy used by the  Deputy  Prime

Minister, and that is, of the frog in the boiling  water.

What  we  have done with the CPF reduction by 3% is  just

like  reducing  the heating device a little,  but  it  is

hardly  the  cutting  of  all energy  sources  which  are

boiling  the  water.  What we need are bold  moves  which

will  allow the frog to be energised to jump out  of  the

pot  of  water.  Or what we need is to cut  off  all  the

energy  sources that are boiling the water  so  that  the

water  never gets hot, and the frog will never die.   The

changes announced will just prolong our problems,  in  my

opinion, because along with the CPF changes we need to do

many  other things.  The much needed radical changes  are

nothing new and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2866</b></font><br><br>



have  been brought up by many Members before and also  in

the House over the last few days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are: (1) the various Government charges and

fees;  (2)  the  cost of restructuring and retrenchments,

which  can  discourage companies from wanting to  set  up

base  down  here.   And this is relevant  because  before

companies come down here, they want to look at the  whole

life  cycle and the day that they have to leave  if  they

have  to  put  up  24 months of retrenchments,  it  could

discourage them from coming into Singapore; (3)  rentals,

utility charges, and many hidden taxes that I have talked

about   many  times;  and  (4)  the  cost  of  regulatory

compliance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the way back from USA yesterday, I read

about  DPM's  comments  that the Government  has  already

adequately  addressed these cost issues.  While  I  agree

that something has been done, the changes are however not

radical  enough.  What signals are we giving to employers

and potential investors about the Government's resolve to

address the total cost issues in Singapore when we do not

go  far  enough  in  reducing the costs  related  to  the

factors that I mentioned earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just take the cost of government as an

example.   The  cost of government directly  affects  the

Government charges and fees and also sets the  stage  for

cost  of doing business in Singapore.  The Government  is

only  now  realising that there needs to be a  cut  waste

system  to  cut  waste  in Government.   In  my  opinion,

cutting  waste  is  not good enough.  Waste,  of  course,

should  have been cut long time ago.  We also  need  real

cost  reductions across the Government and its  agencies,

and  not  just in the area of waste.  Even if it is  just

waste  reduction, it shows that cost can be brought  down

some  more.  I am confident that if we look at the  other

factors, we probably can find opportunities for more cost

reductions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to relate my personal experience so

that  everyone  would  know that I am  not  just  talking

theory  down here.  I have started a number of companies.

The first major one was a semiconductor

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2867</b></font><br><br>



company  which  I started in 1998.  It is a manufacturing

plant  that employs about 1,000 people in Singapore right

now.   When  I  started  it  in  1998,  I  believed  that

Singapore  could still be competitive in  that  industry.

That  company  which  I  left,  because  it  was  already

successful  in its own right, is still around with  about

1,000  employees but it is struggling to  be  competitive

right now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 2001, I started another semiconductor

company.   It now employs 1,500 employees but  of  these,

only  11 are in Singapore right now; 350 in the USA,  and

more  than  1,000  in the Philippines where  we  run  our

production, and about 60 in India where we do our  design

work.   I  tried my best to justify the setting up  of  a

production   facility  in  Singapore,   but   the   other

alternatives like Thailand, the Philippines and  Malaysia

were  more  compelling.  I still hope to  create  another

1,000 jobs in Singapore, but it must make sense and it is

not about National Service for us, because we have to  be

alive  for a long time and the competition is fierce  and

the cost can be a killer in Singapore.  Had my management

team made the wrong decision of forcing ourselves to  set

up  a  site  in  Singapore, we may not have  been  around

today.   So, if the Government can address all  the  cost

and  regulatory issues, I am confident that  operating  a

large manufacturing site in Singapore for quite some time

to  come  is  possible.  I know we  can  do  it,  if  the

Government  gets the right formula implemented  for  cost

reduction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second issue is one of CPF, whether it

should  be  compulsory  or  voluntary.   If  we  look  at

countries  which have gone through the same situation  as

Singapore  before,  particularly the developed  countries

that  made their transition from not developed  to  being

developed, I am sure we can get some good ideas, and  one

of  them  is  a  real  radical  move  to  make  CPF  less

compulsory.   Perhaps  we  can take  the  first  step  of

breaking  the  CPF  into  two  components  -  the  first,

compulsory;  and  the second, voluntary  -  supported  by

Government   incentives   to  encourage   employers   and

employees to voluntarily

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2868</b></font><br><br>



save  for  their retirement.  At a 40% compulsory  saving

rate,  employers have the flexibility to adjust only  80%

of  wages, which is what the employees take home.   Also,

about  one-third  of an employee's wage  is  compulsorily

saved,  thus reducing the amount available to  drive  the

consumption part of our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore suggest that we should move away from

forcing   Singaporeans  and  their  employers  with   the

statutory and compulsory saving regime.  By all means, we

should   encourage  savings  for  the  future   and   for

retirement, but let us make this a market-driven practice

and the Government can play its part, not by forcing, but

by incentivising.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth of the matter is that while the 3% CPF cut

is  welcomed  by companies, but when the companies  faced

the  crunch  over  the last few years, they  had  already

taken  more aggressive moves like reducing wages by  10%,

20% or some, even 30%, depending on what it took them  to

survive in Singapore.  This is the flexible part  of  the

wages,  while the CPF is the most inflexible part of  the

wage system because it is dictated by the Government.  My

opinion is that this issue of high forced saving rate  is

what  is deterring companies from investing in Singapore.

We  have  to  change  and  follow  what  other  developed

countries  do,  and that is, to get away from  this  high

forced   saving   rate   and,   therefore,   reduce   the

Government's dominant role in determining the wage levels

here.   The market should be driving the decisions.   Let

us really cut the apron strings.  Let us do away with the

Government  determining wages.  Let us do away  with  the

National   Wages  Council,  which  is  another   way   of

Government playing a dominant role in determining  wages.

Let  it be market driven.  It worked in the past, but  it

is  not  going to work in the future, in my opinion,  for

the  changes that we are trying to make.  The  sooner  we

learn this new paradigm, the more successful we will be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next issue is whether there is a plan for

us  to  solve  all  our economic problems.   Why  is  the

Government   pulling  its  punches?    Half-hearted   and

piecemeal

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2869</b></font><br><br>



changes will prove counter-productive.  We need the right

mixture  of  ingredients to produce  the  right  medicine

which  can be administered in the right dosages  to  cure

our  unemployment and economic problems.  In my  opinion,

the  CPF  changes  are  but just  one  of  the  component

ingredients  and are not the final medicine which  is  so

greatly  needed  right now.  And if  we  think  that  CPF

changes are going to solve all our problems, we are going

to be mistaken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fear one thing - two years down the road,

after  we have implemented the CPF changes, we will still

be in the same position as today, because we did not make

the  other  necessary changes.  If we do not progress  by

then, Singaporeans will feel betrayed that the Government

gave away their wages with no significant gain in return.

Can we risk this happening in Singapore?  The answer must

surely be no.  I hope that the Government is right.  Time

will tell if I am wrong about my assessment, and I hope I

am wrong in this case.  I urge the Government to reassess

the  situation  with  a  much open  mind.   Please  start

believing the people and the private sector more,  and  I

hope  that  we will find all the answers when  they  give

their feedback.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People ask me: does the Government really have a

plan to get Singapore out of the current set of problems?

Many  feel that there is no real plan because CPF changes

alone will not fix our problems.  This is the feedback  I

have been getting from the ground.  In this respect,  can

I  ask  the  Prime Minister to share with the  House  the

reasons   why  companies  are  packing  up  and   leaving

Singapore?  Surely, it is not because the CPF is just  3%

too  high.   I  am sure that there are many more  factors

which  are forcing companies to pack up and leave.   What

are  these factors and what are we doing about  them?   I

know  of  a few multi-national companies which are  still

planning  to exit Singapore today.  They are still  here,

but  they  are  planning  their exit.   The  momentum  of

companies  leaving  Singapore has  not  slowed  down  and

unless  and until we address the cost factors adequately,

we will continue to shed jobs and lose companies.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2870</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government can share with all of us what

these  exiting companies are saying, perhaps  we  can  be

convinced that there is a good plan in place and that  we

can solve all of our problems.  Currently, there are many

sceptics - they are not yet convinced that we have a plan

that will work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to urge the leaders

to  come  up with a convincing plan which can assure  and

also inspire the people of Singapore to rally around  the

Government  to solve all our economic woes.   It  is  not

just  about  waiting and seeing the outcome a  few  years

from now, but to give confidence to everyone that we  can

do  it.  I am convinced that if we take all the necessary

radical steps, we can do it.  But I have not seen all the

necessary steps personally.  We need the Government to be

bold  and  more entrepreneurial than what they have  done

before.  I hope that we will not be disappointed and that

the  economy recovers fast enough so that jobs remain  in

Singapore  and  the unemployment situation gets  resolved

quickly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Defence (Mr Cedric Foo

Chee  Keng)  :   Mr  Speaker, Sir,  thank  you  for  this

opportunity to join in the debate.  I would like to share

my  views,  especially from my perspective  as  Chairman,

SPRING Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members of this House have pointed out that the

broader challenge confronting Singapore is not just about

the  retuning  of  the  Central Provident  Fund  but  how

Singapore  can continue to be competitive in  the  global

marketplace.  It is about our ability to create good jobs

so that Singaporeans can chase their Singapore dreams.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me briefly discuss the CPF changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 3% CPF cut and the lowering of the CPF

contribution ceiling are significant to tackle  our  wage

rigidity  to respond to our immediate challenges  but  of

greater  significance are the changes that we are  making

to  the  withdrawal rules and Minimum Sums.  The benefits

of  these  CPF changes we are making now will largely  be

felt 10 years from now.  For the first

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2871</b></font><br><br>



time,  the CPF and Medisave Minimum Sums will be adjusted

for  inflation.   They  will provide  a  basic  level  of

financial security for retired Singaporeans.  Mr Inderjit

Singh   suggested  that  perhaps  a  part  of   the   CPF

contribution  should  be  made  voluntary.   However,  in

reality,   it  is  not  so  simple.   Singapore's   Total

Fertility Rate (TFR) is at a 26-year low of 1.38.   Soon,

a  small base of young Singaporeans will be supporting  a

very  large  group  of retirees.  This "inverse  pyramid"

will  be  very  unstable  unless we  require  that  every

Singaporean  put  aside  sufficient  funds  for  his  own

healthcare  and retirement needs.  Otherwise, the  burden

on our future generations will be untenable.  And at that

time,  taxes  will  have to increase.  Singapore  can  no

longer  be an attractive place to work or live in.   Many

of  our  more  capable youths will be drawn to  countries

offering lower taxes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes to withdrawal rules and Minimum Sums

will  underpin Singapore's competitiveness for  the  long

haul and it is more significant than many have thought.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to discuss what else may be needed

for  Singapore to enhance its competitiveness.   Lowering

wage  cost  with  a  new  CPF rate  is  a  necessary  but

insufficient    condition   to   regain    our    overall

competitiveness.   From the perspective  of  labour  cost

competitiveness  alone,  the  odds  are  stacked  against

Singapore.  The Prime Minister and Minister Lim Boon Heng

have  cited  the  wages  of  a  manufacturing  worker  in

Singapore   compared  to  other  emerging  and  competing

economies.   To  top  it  all, the number  of  registered

unemployed  in China's cities alone is 8 million  people.

The  US  State Department estimates that the total number

of  unemployed  and under-employed in China  is  a  mind-boggling  350 million people!  These unemployed will  act

as  a  buffer against any future wage increases in China.

So  China  will remain wage competitive for a long,  long

time.  There is no way we can match our wage cost "dollar

for  dollar" and "cent for cent" against these developing

countries.  And as DPM Lee has said, neither do we want

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2872</b></font><br><br>



to  regress to such wage levels.  In fact, our  long-term

objective   should  be  to  raise  the   real   wage   of

Singaporeans  and  to keep the Singapore  dollar  strong.

These are ultimately the drivers that would determine the

quality of life in Singapore.  But we cannot blindly push

up  wages  unless it is supported by higher  productivity

relative   to   competing  economies.    Without   which,

Singapore cannot retain or attract enough investments  to

sustain our wage premium and to achieve full employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Productivity improvement is the key to a nation's

competitiveness.  And it is a marathon without  a  finish

line.   Yet, we cannot let up.  Some have suggested  that

we  use  our foreign reserves to prop up the economy  and

support our high living standard.  But for how long?  Our

reserves are finite and can be depleted.  The way  I  see

it,  productivity improvement is the only sustainable way

for us to support a higher quality of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of recent retrenchments in Singapore,

most   notably   SIA  and  PSA,  many  Singaporeans   are

understandably  concerned about loss of jobs.   There  is

widespread  belief  that  productivity  improvements  and

employment  creation runs counter to each other.   It  is

argued that higher productivity leads to job destruction.

On  the  one  hand,  it is true that one  of  the  direct

effects  of  productivity improvements in an industry  is

that  fewer workers are needed to produce the same amount

of output.  But this view is too simplistic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, in a competitive environment, lower cost

of  production, as a result of higher productivity,  will

lead  to lower prices for the products and will stimulate

higher  demand  and  therefore more  products  are  sold.

Soon,  higher  capacity  is  needed  and  more  jobs  are

created.    Even   if  the  productivity   surplus   were

distributed  to  shareholders,  such  surplus   will   be

invested  in other sectors of the economy or  end  up  as

higher  consumption.  All these lead to higher employment

overall.   The economic development in the US bears  this

out.   In  the  1990s, productivity and total  employment

were both growing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2873</b></font><br><br>



in  tandem  at  high rates.  For Singapore,  productivity

growth  rates  averaged  3.5% per  annum  throughout  the

1990s.   During  this period, total employment  increased

from 1.54 million in 1990 to 2.09 million in 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore companies have performed commendably in

their productivity quest.  Let me just cite two examples,

one  in  the  70s and a more recent one.   In  1975,  SBS

introduced  computerisation of the ticketing  system  and

did   away  with  bus  conductors.   They  went  One-Man-Operation  (OMO).  Productivity doubled.  You  need  only

the  driver.   Then they went on to operate double-decked

buses  with  twice  the capacity but with  the  same  one

driver.   Productivity doubled again.  Trans-Island  also

operates  the "bendy" - a stretched ultra-long  bus  with

higher   labour   productivity.    If   not   for   their

productivity efforts, the recent transport fare increases

would be much heftier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other example concerns our cinemas. In cinemas

of  the  past,  at least one usher was used for  checking

tickets  at each entry point.  All employees were single-tasked.  One is either the cashier, or the usher, or  the

snack  bar  attendant.   In new  multiplex  cinemas,  the

layout is designed for only one ticket checkpoint for all

cinemas  and it is located near the snack bar.   So  that

the jobs of ticketing, ushering and snack bar tending can

be  combined into a single category.  These changes  have

enabled Golden Village to save about 40% in labour cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Productivity can be achieved in two basic ways.

Firstly,  companies can reduce input for a given  output,

which means consolidating to leverage on scale or improve

operational   performance.    Secondly,   companies   can

increase  output  with a given input;  which  is  a  less

travelled  path.   This means selling  higher-valued  and

more  innovative goods or selling more goods to  increase

capacity utilisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When manufacturing cost index is adjusted for

productivity,  Singapore  companies  fared  rather  well.

Singapore   compares   very  well  with   the   competing

economies.  The World Competitiveness

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2874</b></font><br><br>



Yearbook 2003 puts Singapore (with index of 100) as  more

competitive than China (with a manufacturing  cost  index

adjusted  for  productivity  of  113),  India  (122)  and

Malaysia  (156).   However, Singapore still  lags  behind

Thailand (which has an index of 70.4).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the measures announced by DPM Lee, SPRING

Singapore  will  administer  the  $45  million   Domestic

Cluster Development Fund.  The primary objective  of  the

fund is to raise the productivity of our domestic sector.

The  fund  will  provide assistance for the  engaging  of

consultants    for   Business   Process   Re-engineering,

training,  the  purchase  of equipment  and  intellectual

property rights costs.  It will help innovation diffusion

within   cluster,   thereby  raising   overall   industry

productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of SPRING's current priorities is to see how we

can  create jobs for Singaporeans through work re-design,

which Ms Braema Mathi talked about.  As Minister Lim Boon

Heng  said, Singaporeans may need to take up some of  the

jobs  currently  performed by  foreign  workers.   If  we

merely  replace  a foreign worker with a Singaporean,  we

are  unlikely  to  succeed.  The  job  content  currently

performed  by  the foreign worker is low and  these  jobs

typically   pay   low  wages.   I  can  understand   that

Singaporeans will not take up such jobs as  they  do  not

pay  enough even for meals and transport.  Well, why  not

just pay the Singaporean more for the same job?  If we do

so,  we  will  be paying more for exactly  the  same  job

content,  which  means  that the productivity  level  has

fallen.   Someone has to pay for it; either in  terms  of

higher prices by consumers or higher taxes by taxpayers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A better solution would be to redesign the jobs,

possibly with the application of technology.  If  we  can

enlarge  and  value-add to the job, these jobs  can  then

command  higher wages and be attractive to  Singaporeans.

One  good  example is the cleaner's job at  the  upgraded

Zion  Riverside  Food  Centre.  Our National  Environment

Agency  (NEA)  has redesigned these jobs.   The  cleaners

there now draw

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2875</b></font><br><br>



between  $1,000 and $1,400 a month (with overtime)  which

is  much higher than the $800 that cleaners usually earn.

These cleaners had been trained under the National Skills

Recognition  System.   They  wear  smart  uniforms,   use

specially  designed trolleys and the plates and  utensils

are  washed at a centralised location.  We could also use

dish  washing machines to enhance the efficiency further.

Although each stall now contributes $200 a month, instead

of  $150 a month, towards cleaning, the centre now serves

about  500  customers  a day compared  to  150  customers

previously.  Stallholders appreciate the faster  cleaning

cycle and customers enjoy cleaner tables and plates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that there is scope to redesign work in

other  domestic sectors, like food and beverage,  retail,

healthcare,     domestic/commercial     cleaning      and

construction.  The Domestic Cluster Development Fund will

be used to seek out such opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPRING also administers the LETAS (Local Enterprise

Technical  Assistance Scheme) and LEFS (Local  Enterprise

Finance  Scheme) to help small and medium enterprises  in

Singapore   improve   their  productivity.    Since   the

programmes'  inception  in 1986 and  1976,  respectively,

SPRING has given out $481 million in LETAS grants and has

helped  local  companies  raise  $8.6  billion  of  loans

through LEFS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPRING conducted a survey of Singapore SMEs recently

on  their views towards the announced changes in the CPF.

An  SME, Aceford (a vegetable oil manufacturer) indicated

that they are prepared to channel the CPF savings back to

employees.   Many SMEs, like "The Lighting Centre",  said

that  they  were prepared to help their employees  should

they  face financial difficulties as a result of the  CPF

changes.   These  companies see the need to  continue  to

reward talent.  They understood that successful companies

pay   attention   to   all  stakeholders   (shareholders,

suppliers, managers, employees and the community

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2876</b></font><br><br>



at  large)  rather than narrowly focusing  on  short-term

shareholder value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the SMEs remarked that their staff should

not  be overly concerned with the CPF changes.  In  fact,

they  said  that  the impact of the CPF  cut  is  minimal

because  they  already have in place reward systems  that

are  linked  to  performance.   Thus,  when  the  company

performs  well, contributing employees will end  up  with

significantly higher income, despite the CPF  cut.   Such

performance-linked reward systems are to be encouraged as

they  ensure  that wage growth lags productivity  growth.

On  the other hand, companies with seniority-based  wages

are at risk of becoming marginalised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A prominent Singapore businessman recently visited a

DVD  factory  in  China and recounted  his  observations.

This  factory produces 8% of the world's DVD output.   To

his  surprise,  the factory is fully automated  with  the

latest  technology  comparable  even  to  those  in   the

developed  world,  like the United States.   The  factory

produces  a  small number of good jobs but  have  avoided

employing a large number of production line workers, even

though  labour is cheap and in abundance in  China.   The

factory owners did not merely resort to cheap labour  but

have  set their sights much further, for much bigger  and

more  sustainable  growth.   The  jobs  created  by  this

factory will pay well and will continue to be around  for

much  longer than traditional labour intensive production

lines.   The  productivity level is  very  high  and  the

consistency  of  high  quality DVDs assured  through  the

application of modern technology.  And this is  happening

even in China!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We live in a harsh economic world made harsher

through  globalisation  and as we speak,  insurgents  are

drawing  out plans to out-do the established players  and

unless  companies  in  Singapore, including  our  leading

companies,   continue   to   innovate   and   up    their

productivity, more Singaporeans may lose their jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call on employers to work with SPRING to improve

the  industry's productivity.  And, if retrenchments  are

inevitable, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2877</b></font><br><br>



Government,  as DPM Lee has assured, will  re-double  its

efforts  to  help place retrenched workers in  new  jobs.

Workers,  on  their part, must adjust their  expectations

and be prepared to help themselves.  Some jobs will never

return,  so  continuous lifelong  learning  is  the  only

guarantee of continued employability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already heard a frog story from DPM Lee on

Friday.   I  have  another story  about  frogs  which  is

adapted from a movie, "Catch me if you can".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two frogs fell into a deep cream bowl. One was an

optimistic soul, but the other took the gloomy view.  "We

will  drown," he lamented without much ado,  and  with  a

last  despairing  cry, he flung up  his  legs  and  said,

"Goodbye."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quote the other frog with a steadfast grin:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I cannot get out but I would not give in. I will

just  swim around till my strength is spent, then I  will

die  the  more content."  Bravely, he swam  to  work  his

scheme, and his struggles began to churn the cream.   The

more  he  swam,  his legs a flutter, the more  the  cream

turned  into solid butter.  On top of the butter at  last

he stopped, and out of the bowl he gaily hopped.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The going will be tough and it is difficult to

predict  how  long we would have to keep  swimming.  But,

Singaporeans must have the same indomitable spirit as the

second  frog.   Our fortitude and strength  in  adversity

will  see  us  through these trying times.  We  will  not

drown  like the first frog.  Some may need help to  swim.

The   Government  will  provide  the  life  jackets,  but

Singaporeans must continue to churn the cream.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite our competitive lifestyle, Singapore is

still  held up as a compassionate society.  In Singapore,

no   one   will  go  homeless,  no  one  will  be  denied

healthcare,  and no child goes without an education.   If

we  press  on  with  the  CPF  changes  and  productivity

improvements, we will soon hop out.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister

has spelt out how the CPF

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2878</b></font><br><br>



system  will  be  restructured for Singapore's  long-term

economic competitiveness.  Last Friday, the Deputy  Prime

Minister announced the package of assistance measures  to

help individual Singaporeans cope with those changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I shall be elaborating on the details of the

measures under the purview of my Ministry, namely,  those

on  public  housing and the construction industry.   But,

first,  let me give an overview of the impact of the  CPF

changes  on  HDB flat owners and buyers.   This  was  the

result  of  a  study which HDB did after the CPF  changes

were announced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the impact on existing mortgagors.

There  are roughly 800,000 HDB households - to be  exact,

about  795,000.   Out of these, 530,000 have  outstanding

mortgage  loans  with HDB.  Of these, 82%  service  their

loans  using  CPF  funds.  Before  the  cut  in  the  CPF

contribution  rates, there were about 200,000  households

with  shortfalls.   In  other words,  their  monthly  CPF

Ordinary  Account (OA) contributions were not  enough  to

meet  their  monthly housing instalments.  With  the  CPF

cut,  this  number  will increase by  45,000  to  roughly

245,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large majority will be able to cope using their

accumulated CPF savings.  However, about 35,000  or  4.5%

or  thereabouts of all HDB households may not have enough

CPF   OA  and  Special  Account  (SA)  contributions  and

balances  to  completely service their HDB housing  loans

beyond  a  year.  So, these households, ie,  about  4.5%,

will   have  to  top  up  a  small  percentage  of  their

repayments using other savings or cash.  That is for  the

existing mortgagors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about new flat buyers? The cuts in CPF

contribution rates will have a minimal impact on new  HDB

flat  buyers,  especially  the younger  households.   HDB

estimates  that the time required for new flat buyers  to

accumulate  the 20% down payment using their CPF  savings

will  increase  by six to eight months, after  the  cuts.

The  total  time required to accumulate the down  payment

remains at about four years.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2879</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will also be minimal impact on the ability of

new  flat buyers to service their mortgage loans.   Those

below  50 will need to use about 19-23% of their  monthly

household  income to service their mortgage loans.   This

is  quite close to the revised OA contribution of between

18-22%  for this age group.  So, 19-23% of their  monthly

income,  after the cuts, compared to the CPF contribution

of around 18-22%, ie, roughly about the same.



<br><br><i>Short-term assistance and downgrading measures</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while these numbers show quite clearly that the

impact  on  both existing HDB owners and new flat  buyers

will be minimal, I can understand the sense of unease and

anxiety  among them.  After all, the HDB flat  is,  to  a

large  extent, probably the single largest  purchase  and

asset of many Singaporeans.  So, their concerns have been

voiced  by many MPs in this House - Mr Zainul Abidin,  Mr

Nithiah Nandan, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, Mdm Ho Geok Choo, among

others - who have all asked how HDB can help them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, HDB lessees having trouble servicing

their  monthly loan instalments due to the CPF  cuts  can

apply for several existing financial assistance measures.

These include:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) extending the mortgage loan repayment up to a

maximum of 30 years, subject to the age limit of  65;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) conversion to a Reduce Repayment Scheme, ie,

mortgagors  can apply to temporarily pay a lower  monthly

sum  ranging from 50-75% of their normal instalments, and

this will help their cash flow;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) they can opt for short-term deferment of the

payment of the loan instalments;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) they can apply to pay their loan arrears by

instalments; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) they can apply to include other family members

as co-owners, so that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2880</b></font><br><br>



these  family  members  can  help  them  to  service  the

mortgage loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, apart from the financial assistance

measures  that I have outlined, HDB lessees  affected  by

the CPF cut can also draw on their SA savings to meet the

shortfall in repayment after their savings in the OA have

been  depleted.  Since 1999, when these schemes were  put

in  place,  HDB has assisted a total of 83,000 households

under  its  various financial assistance measures.   Over

the  same period, 92,000 individual HDB flat owners  used

their SA savings to finance their housing loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the issue of downgrading. Many

MPs  have  argued in this House that this is  a  sensible

option  for lessees who are in financial hardship.   They

can sell their existing flat and they can downgrade to  a

smaller  flat.   I agree.  However, they have  to  occupy

their  flat for a minimum occupation period (MOP)  before

they can do so.  Several MPs have asked HDB to waive  the

MOP period for resale.  I want to assure Members that HDB

will do so for deserving cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members like Mr Yeo Guat Kwang have also asked

HDB  to  facilitate  downgrading for those  in  financial

hardship.  Today, the policy is not to grant a second HDB

concessionary  loan  to those who are  downgrading  to  a

smaller flat.  The purpose behind this policy is to limit

the  amount  of  subsidised loans  given  out,  as  these

downgraders  would  usually  have  sufficient  funds   to

finance  the  purchase  of  the  smaller  flat.   I   say

"usually", and this is generally true.  And HDB does  not

intend to change this policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the HDB will exercise flexibility and grant

a  second  concessionary loan to downgraders who  are  in

severe    financial   hardship   arising   from   certain

circumstances.  These include retrenchments,  severe  pay

cuts,  business failures, prolonged illness or  death  of

the  sole  breadwinner and so on.   The  quantum  of  the

concessionary loan will be capped at the outstanding loan

for  the  existing flat.  So, if they currently  have  an

outstanding loan, that quantum will be the quantum

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2881</b></font><br><br>



of  the  new  loan, or it will be 80%  of  the  value  or

purchase price of the next flat, whichever is the lowest.

This  temporary measure will help lessees cope  with  the

CPF changes and the economic downturn during this period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the subject of flexibility, please allow me

to  take a little detour at this stage and comment  on  a

case  which  seems  to have attracted  a  little  bit  of

attention  recently.  I refer of course to  the  case  of

this  car wash company whose application to set up a  car

washing  business in HDB high-rise carparks was initially

rejected.  And last week in this House, Ms Indranee Rajah

cited  this case, arguing for the use of common sense  by

Government departments.  She noted that HDB rejected  the

idea  because "It had not been done before".   She  added

that if we use that kind of reason, we will never be able

to do anything new.  I agree with her.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought this was quite out of character for HDB,

so  I  checked.   Now, I am pleased  to  set  the  record

straight  and inform Ms Indranee that HDB did not  reject

the  idea because "it had not been done before";  rather,

it  had  valid  environmental and safety  concerns.   For

example,  there were concerns over the improper discharge

of   chemicals  and  washing  detergents  which,  if  not

properly  handled, would have ended up in our reservoirs.

As  Members  know, there are certain bays in  HDB  multi-storey  carparks where the discharge goes into the sewage

system instead of into the open drains.  So, this was one

concern.   There  were also concerns that  the  prolonged

washing  in  the  HDB carparks may affect  the  flooring,

which  is  not properly waterproofed, and may affect  the

structure  of  the carparks.  But once HDB was  satisfied

that  these concerns could be properly addressed  through

certain  measures, it issued the licence for the car-wash

company  very  expeditiously.  So, it had a happy  ending

and  I thought, far from illustrating a tardy, inflexible

HDB,  the  episode  did  show a  careful,  practical  and

flexible approach to administration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us come back to mortgage loans. There have been

other suggestions by members of the public on how we can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2882</b></font><br><br>



help  homeowners with their mortgage loans, and I thought

I  should also take this opportunity to address  some  of

them.    One  suggestion  was  for  HDB  to  reduce   its

concessionary  interest rate of 2.6%.  As  Members  know,

HDB  gets the funds for its concessionary loans from  the

Government  at  the CPF Ordinary Account  interest  rate,

which is currently at the statutory minimum of 2.5%.  The

additional  0.1% is to defray HDB's cost of administering

the  loans.   So, if we want to cut the HDB concessionary

loan  interest rate, we would, first of all, have to  cut

the  CPF Ordinary Account interest rate.  This would mean

lower  retirement savings for all members, regardless  of

whether  they have outstanding HDB loans.   And  I  think

Members will agree that this is not a good idea.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another suggestion was for homeowners to stretch the

tenure  of  their  mortgages.   Under  current  financial

assistance  schemes, HDB mortgagors  can  already  extend

their mortgage loan to a maximum of 30 years, subject  to

a  65-year  age  limit.  So, the question is  whether  we

should  allow mortgagors to extend their loans beyond  30

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think this is either necessary or

helpful  because, in the first place, there  are  already

many  ways  to assist HDB mortgagors who are in financial

difficulty.   As I have explained earlier, we  can  allow

them  to pay a reduced loan instalment, we can even allow

them  to temporarily defer their loan payments, which  is

really tantamount to stretching the mortgage payments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, of course, if we were to really give them

a   longer   loan  repayment  period,  this  would   mean

additional interest cost for them and, in some cases,  it

would actually mean a higher mortgage instalment payment.

I  would  like  to reassure the House that  HDB  will  do

whatever it can to help existing mortgagors who  will  be

affected by the CPF cuts.  No HDB flat lessee who  is  in

genuine  financial  difficulty will lose  his  flat  just

because  of the cut in CPF rates.  HDB will work  closely

with  them to advise them on the appropriate measures  to

help them service their mortgage loans.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2883</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Long-term measures</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I have outlined are the short-term HDB assistance measures. I would now like to talk

about  the  long-term measures in the HDB policies  which

have been announced by DPM last Friday.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main social objectives of the CPF scheme

is  home  ownership.   Our public housing  programme  has

given  Singaporeans a good home, and a  strong  sense  of

community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, in our National Day goody-bag, we

received  a  little book entitled, "Things that  make  us

Singaporean".   It  is  an  inspiring  little  book.   It

captures the feelings of Singaporeans about Singapore and

what  they feel connects them to this place.  Let me read

to  you two of my favourites.  On page 16, Mr Andrew  Bok

said, "Being Singaporean is when I say, 'Let's apply  for

a  flat'  and  my  girlfriend knows straightaway  what  I

mean".   I  do  not think you can say that in  any  other

place in the world.  On page 21, below a picture of an NS

man   sitting  in  a  3-tonner,  Mr  Lau  Wai  Leong,   a

pharmacist,  said: "Looking out from a  3-tonner  at  the

night  lights of a HDB estate, and thinking:  it's  worth

doing  this  for  my country and my fellow Singaporeans."

The  HDB flat and National Service - these are two of the

most  enduring experiences of being a Singaporean - aptly

captured in one sentiment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Members have suggested that the Government

re-look its public housing policies, like universal  home

ownership   and  upgrading.   I  agree  that  we   should

regularly  review our policies.  Indeed, I have explained

many  times  in  this  House that my  Ministry  has  been

reviewing various HDB policies to ensure that our  public

housing  programmes remain relevant to meet the needs  of

Singaporeans.  At the same time, it must be in line  with

the  Government's  overall direction to  restructure  the

economy and remake our society.  But, even as we  do  so,

we  should  be mindful of the powerful role that  it  has

played in nation-building, and giving

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2884</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans,  like Mr Lau, a stake in our  progress  and

prosperity,  and something worth fighting for.   I  shall

now  outline  some  of  the changes  arising  from  these

reviews.



<br><br><i>Subletting of whole HDB flat</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we are relaxing the subletting rules for HDB

flats.  Let me explain the rationale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economy and society are changing. In the new

economy, there will be more workers who are on short-term

employment, entrepreneurs without a steady income  stream

and  young  couples  who are not ready  to  commit  to  a

property  purchase.  As our people become more  educated,

they  want to take greater responsibility, to make  their

own   choices  and  be  self-reliant.   This  is  to   be

encouraged.   And with greater individual responsibility,

rules and regulations can also be relaxed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many Singaporeans, their HDB flat is their

single  most  valuable asset.  However, we  know  of  the

often-quoted  syndrome of being "asset  rich"  but  "cash

poor".   Some  flat  owners really feel  this.   As  flat

owners  grow  old, they want to have more flexibility  to

convert  their  housing assets into cash to  provide  for

retirement.   Others may want to seek to generate  income

from the flats because they are in financial difficulties

as  the  economy  restructures.   My  Ministry  has  been

studying  how  we  can help Singaporeans better  monetise

cash out on their flats, while ensuring that there is  no

abuse  of Government subsidies - do not forget HDB  flats

are  very  heavily subsidised - in order to promote  home

ownership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January, we introduced bank origination of HDB

market  rate loans, another way to give HDB lessees  more

choice.  And, at the same time, we relaxed the subletting

rules for HDB flat buyers who took these bank loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have decided to further free up the subletting

rules.  From 1st October 2003, lessees of all HDB  flats,

who have occupied their flats for 15 years or more,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2885</b></font><br><br>



will be able to sublet them, irrespective of whether they

are  resale  flats or subsidised flats  with  or  without

outstanding loans from HDB.  In addition, those who  have

occupied  their flat for 10 years can sublet  their  flat

immediately if they do not have any outstanding HDB loan.

This  move  will make about 250,000 flats, or about  one-third or 30% of all flats, eligible to be rented out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may ask why this restriction of 10 or 15 years?

Why   not   5  years?  Why  not  remove  the  restriction

altogether?   We  must bear in mind that  the  Government

sells  subsidised HDB flats for owner occupation.  It  is

not  for  speculation.  It is not, in the first instance,

for  income generation.  So the minimum occupation period

of  10 or 15 years serves to maintain the long-term owner

occupation principle of our home ownership policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the relaxation, lessees will be able to

generate income from their flats, without having to  sell

them.   Retirees will be able to rent their HDB flats  to

generate  cash  to supplement their monthly  income  from

CPF.  If you look at the current rental rates, even if we

allow for some reduction in the rental rates, the rentals

can  form  a  very  significant part of their  retirement

income.   We  are  talking about anything  from  $800  to

$1,500 to rent an HDB flat.  Then again, those who are in

financial  difficulties can also generate some income  to

tide them over their problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the assistance to HDB lessees, this move

will  also  enlarge the rental market for HDB  flats  and

keep rentals reasonable.  It will open up another housing

option  for those who are either not ready to buy or  who

are  not able to afford a flat or who do not wish  to  be

tied  down  by  a  mortgage at a certain point  in  their

lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To preserve the good environment of our housing

estates  and  to minimise nuisances that may  arise  from

subletting,   HDB  will  apply  certain  guidelines   and

conditions  for  subletting.  It will also  work  closely

with  grassroots  organisations and residents  to  ensure

that  subletting does not impact negatively on the living

ambience of our HDB estates.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2886</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Extending the Public Rental Scheme</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has always encouraged near universal

home  ownership and it has been successful.  85%  of  our

people  live  in HDB flats, 95% of them own their  homes.

However, as our economy restructures, there will be  some

low-income  households who may have difficulty sustaining

home  ownership. For them, subsidised rental housing  may

be  a  better option until such time that they are  ready

and  can  afford to buy an HDB flat.  Today, the  monthly

household income ceiling to rent subsidised HDB flats  is

$800.  Many Members, including Dr Maliki and Ms Irene Ng,

have asked for the eligibility criteria to be expanded so

that more can benefit from subsidised rental housing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As DPM announced last Friday, from 1st October 2003,

the  monthly income cut-off for the Public Rental  Scheme

will  be  raised to $1,500.  The rents charged  for  this

second tier of households earning $801 to $1,500 will  be

higher  than  those earning $800 or less, but  they  will

still  be  very  heavily subsidised and very  affordable.

For  this second tier, the rents are between $90 and $110

for  a 1-room flat and between $120 and $150 for a 2-room

flat.   This roughly works out to around 10%, or  between

9%  and 12% of the average household income of those  who

are eligible for these flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this move will make subsidised rental housing

available to more people, we must be careful that  rental

subsidies are given to those who need them most.  Tenants

whose  financial  situations  have  improved  should   be

encouraged  to  take  up a home ownership  flat  instead.

This  will  then free up more rental flats for the  truly

needy   and  will  also  prevent  tenants  from  becoming

entrenched in subsidised rental housing. This is  a  real

problem.   If  you  go to Hong Kong, you  will  see  many

tenants  who have lived in their subsidised rental  flats

for  many, many years, and inside their flats you can see

plasma TVs, and we are told they own Mercedes Benzes, and

so  on.   They  have simply got so used to rental  flats,

because they are so cheap, and they just stay on and on.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2887</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to guard against this entrenchment problem.

HDB  therefore intends to convert all existing  tenancies

to  term tenancies and to implement income-based rentals.

HDB will take into account the economic conditions before

deciding when to do so, and any adjustment will  be  done

in  phases  to  allow people to gradually acclimatise  to

this.

<br><br><i>Mortgage financing policies for low-income families</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the option of subsidised rental

flats,  HDB has the Special Housing Assistance  Programme

(SHAP)  to assist low-income families to buy their flats.

Today,  households  with monthly incomes  of  $2,000  and

below are exempted from credit assessment and are granted

loans  of  up to 100% of the flat purchase price.   While

the  intention  is well-meaning, this  has  led  to  some

lessees  buying flats beyond their means.  I  agree  with

the   sentiments   expressed   by   many   Members   that

Singaporeans  should  be  careful  and  not   over-extend

themselves  when buying property, whether HDB or  private

housing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, to encourage greater financial prudence,

HDB  will extend credit assessment to this group of  flat

buyers  from 1st October 2003, just as it does today  for

all other flat buyers.  HDB will also cap the quantum  of

mortgage  loans according to the flat type purchased.   I

hope that these prudential measures will ensure that low-income families buy flats when they are financially ready

and  not  over-commit themselves.  I also want to  assure

that  HDB will continue to assist this group to own their

flats  by  selling flats at subsidised prices and  before

they do so, to give them financial counselling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will announce more details on the various policy

changes to be introduced later.



<br><br><i>New flats will continue to be affordable</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to assure Members that the Government

remains  committed to providing affordable public housing

to Singaporeans, especially to first-timers.  HDB

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2888</b></font><br><br>



flats are priced below their market values to enable many

Singaporeans to own a flat.  In fact, we peg  the  prices

such  that 90% of Singaporeans can afford to own at least

a 3-room flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members, like Mr Iswaran and Mr Ang Mong Seng,

have  asked  many  times whether HDB  will  build  3-room

flats,  either  as entry-level housing  or  to  meet  the

demand from downgraders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, first-timers earning $2,000 or less can walk

in  to  HDB  and buy a 3-room buy-back flat at subsidised

prices.   They  can  literally, if they  are  not  fussy,

actually  walk in and get their keys.   There  are  about

150  units  of such 3-room flats offered for  sale  every

month.   The demand is about 90 per month on the average.

There  are sufficient flats available for those who  wish

to  buy a 3-room buy-back flat if they are earning  below

$2,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For second-timers, those who are downgrading, they

can  buy  a 3-room flat from the open market.  There  are

roughly  220,000  3-room  flats  available  in  the  open

market.  I can assure the Members that there is currently

no shortage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, HDB will monitor the trends closely and

review  the need to build new 3-room flats, if necessary.

For  a  start, we can consider building some 3-room flats

in  our  SERS  (Selective En-bloc  Redevelopment  Scheme)

replacement precincts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for new 4-room flats, we will be offering such

flats for sale.  There is a build-to-order (BTO) exercise

coming  up  this month.  These flats will be in  Punggol,

Sengkang   and  Sembawang,  and  they  will   be   priced

affordably.  We have worked the numbers, we have done the

sums  and,  roughly, households with an  average  monthly

income  will probably need to use about 20-22%  of  their

monthly  income  to  finance the purchase  of  these  new

flats.  Again, just to remind Members, this is below  the

revised CPF OA contribution rate of 22%, and well  within

the   40%   guideline  which  HDB  and   most   financial

institutions use as a basis for credit assessment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2889</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to private property owners.

Many have expressed concerns about the impact of the  CPF

changes on their mortgage payments.  When we cut the  CPF

by  10  percentage points in 1999, we implemented various

measures  to  help  people to cope  with  these  changes.

Firstly,  CPF members could use their Special Account  to

top  up any shortfall in the mortgage payments after they

have  made use of their OA balances.  And then those  who

still  had  a shortfall could apply for a bridging  loan.

Very few people actually needed this extra help, but  the

schemes  gave  comfort and reassurance  to  many.   These

schemes will still be made available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on our experience in 1999, the mortgage

repayments should not be a major problem, as the  cut  is

smaller,   3   percentage   points   instead    of    10.

Nevertheless, we will make sure that help is available to

everyone who needs it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also pleased to read that private banks have

expressed  that  they will also exercise flexibility  and

restructure their mortgage loans to help borrowers  cope.

So,  these  schemes will further minimise difficulty  for

borrowers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now turn to measures to help

the construction industry.  The construction industry  is

currently under a lot of stress.  It has borne the  brunt

of the economic downturn.  Annual construction demand has

fallen  from a peak of $24 billion in 1997 to $14 billion

in  the  last two years.  We expect that demand is likely

to  fall  further this year to about $11.5  billion.   As

demand  drops, competition becomes keener, more  intense.

Many  contractors  are cash strapped.  Some  have  become

insolvent.  Sub-contractors are now complaining that they

do  not get paid or payments get delayed.  Several public

projects  have  been affected by work  stoppages  because

contractors run into financial difficulty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the average, about 60% of total annual demand in

the construction industry is from the public sector.  The

Deputy Prime Minister has announced that Government  will

bring forward about

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2890</b></font><br><br>



60 public sector projects worth more than $600 million in

FY  2003  and  FY 2004.  This will help to boost  demand,

safeguard  jobs  and revive business  confidence  in  the

industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our records show that 92% of public sector project

contracts valued between $10-$30 million were awarded  to

local  contractors.   As  most  of  the  projects  to  be

advanced  will  be  less than $30 million  in  value,  we

expect  that  local  contractors will  stand  to  benefit

directly  from this move, and it will help them  to  tide

over this difficult period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also be fine-tuning some of the Government

procurement policies in order to help to further  improve

the situation for contractors.  In the last three months,

the  Building Construction Authority (BCA)  has  been  in

serious  discussion with public agencies as well  as  the

industry  on how we can fine-tune the system in order  to

help the contractors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we will tighten the Contractors'

Registry  System  (CRS) to better reflect  the  financial

standing  of  contractors  tendering  for  public  sector

projects.   What  we  try to achieve with  this  is  more

timely  financial health reporting which will then assist

public  sector  agencies to select  contractors  who  are

capable  of  undertaking projects within their  financial

capacity.   And,  hopefully,  this  will  minimise   work

stoppages and also the downstream problems of payment  to

sub-contractors and to suppliers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, BCA will relax the track record

requirements for construction firms to renew  and  retain

their  CRS grades.  I remember that some Members in  this

House  brought up the issue of suicide bids  and  we  had

this  very  lively  exchange as  to  whether  contractors

actually  do go in for suicide bids.   Nevertheless,  the

point  is  that  in order to minimise the possibility  of

them  being pressured to make such suicide bids, BCA will

extend  the  qualifying period from three years  to  five

years,  as well as include some ongoing projects,  rather

than  just  the completed projects.  Hopefully,  in  this

way,  construction  firms will be able  to  secure  their

place in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2891</b></font><br><br>



CRS  system, and not bid at any price just to secure jobs

and to satisfy their track record.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measures under consideration to improve the payment

system  are also being considered.  In consultation  with

Government and industry stakeholders, BCA will see how we

can  improve  the payment system right across  the  value

chain, and the aim is to improve the cash flow which,  we

all  know, is the life-line of the industry.  One measure

being  studied  is  to  legislate a security  of  payment

system,  and the intention is to provide a fast and  low-cost  system  of resolving progress payment  disputes  by

adjudication.  This is a complicated matter.  It  is  not

something  that  we will rush into.  We have  to  consult

closely  with  the  various parties in  the  industry  to

ensure that all relevant factors and views are taken into

account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A multi-agency task force is also reviewing the

Public  Sector Standard Conditions of Contracts (PSSCOC).

And  for  those  contractors who are involved  in  public

sector projects, I think they will know exactly what this

is  all about.  Under this contract, all payments to main

contractors   are  governed  by  certain  clauses.    The

proposal is for payments to main contractors to  be  made

known to sub-contractors, so that main contractors cannot

then  say that they are not being paid in order to  avoid

or  delay  paying the sub-contractors.  This is a  common

complaint of sub-contractors.  We are seeing how  we  can

address this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also looking to speeding up the valuation of

variation  works  for faster progress  payments  and  for

settlement  of  final  accounts.  Again,  another  common

complaint is that the Government agencies take  too  long

to  settle  the  variation orders and therefore  progress

payments  are  delayed.  So, we will see whether  we  can

expedite this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the current clause which provides for

withholding payments to contractors in order  to  recover

liquidated damages and debts is also being

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2892</b></font><br><br>



reviewed.  In other words, we will see whether  we  still

need  to  consider a set-off clause whereby we hold  back

some  monies  that  are owing to the contractors  because

they  owe  the agencies some money.  This set-off  clause

currently is causing some difficulties to contractors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will announce details of these measures in

October.   But let me stress that while we can  take  all

possible  measures to assist the viable industry  players

cope  with the present difficulties, I must caution that,

in  themselves,  they will not be sufficient.   Companies

must  continue to improve their skills, consolidate their

resources  and upgrade their competitiveness.  Those  who

are  ready  must seek opportunities overseas,  and  I  am

pleased that some of them are already doing so with  some

success.    Hopefully,  we  can  multiply  this   success

further.   We will help our companies break into  markets

overseas,  like  India and China.   And  as  our  economy

recovers, so will the construction industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say, in conclusion, that the

CPF  changes that the Government is making are  necessary

to  save jobs in the immediate future.  And in the longer

term,  they  will  enable  our  businesses  to  be   more

competitive and to position our economy for a  period  of

renewed  growth  when  the external  economic  conditions

improve.  The measures, which I have outlined, will  help

Singaporeans and businesses, in particular, HDB residents

and the construction industry, adapt to the changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, thank you for letting me join in this debate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, may I seek a

clarification from the Minister?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, earlier on, the Minister

said  that  there are some 35,000 households who  do  not

have  enough funds either in the CPF Ordinary Account  or

the Special Account to service their mortgage loans after

the CPF changes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2893</b></font><br><br>



Can I know what is the profile of these 35,000 households

and what is their room type?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I am afraid I do not have the

profile at this point in time.  I will be able to get  it

for him if he files a Question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, first of all, I

would  like to thank the Minister to allow the  residents

---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ang, are you speaking?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng:</b> I just want to check about the

deferment period.  Usually, the HDB allows for six months

or  one year.  But if a resident, within one year, is not

able  to  secure a job, can the HDB extend the  period  a

second time or even a third time?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I think it was the Deputy Prime

Minister on Friday who said that "HDB is forbearing to  a

fault."   I think those were his exact words.  I am  sure

that  if  a case like that comes up and if the lessee  is

genuinely unable to service his mortgage loan,  HDB  will

bend over backwards to see how it can help him.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, nobody likes to

take  bitter medicine.  But then if you have been to  one

great and long party, a strong dose is probably what  you

need  to  sober up.  As far as I am concerned, the  party

for Singapore ended in 1998 when we first felt the impact

of  the Asian financial crisis.  Years of strong economic

growth  came  to an end, and that was the day  the  music

died.   Then, two years of economic growth - in 1999  and

2000  -  masked  the  fact  that  fundamental  weaknesses

remained unresolved, and that all was still not well and,

for  a while, many of us thought that the good times were

back.  Many companies thought it was all right to go on a

hiring  binge.   I read, for example, that  SPH  Holdings

recruited  as many as 1,000 new staff in the  year  2000,

only  to find that it had to inflict painful job cuts  in

less  than  two years.  Likewise for Singapore  Airlines,

whose  handling of its retrenchment exercise  this  year,

exemplifies how a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2894</b></font><br><br>



company ought not to handle industrial relations.   Sure,

it  may  have  lost  $200 million in  April,  but  nobody

pointed  out that this was a company that also made  near

to  $5  billion  in  the past five  years,  and,  in  all

probability, might still make money this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no quarrel with a company getting rid of

workers  if it is going to be financially crippled,  only

that  in  the  modern  day  parlance  of  human  resource

managers, they cleverly called it a "pre-emptive lay-off"

or they now use the term "rightsizing".  They do not even

call   it  downsizing  because  rightsizing  allows   the

employer to lay off older and more expensive workers even

when  they are still doing all right, and then hire  new,

younger, and obviously cheaper workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the bitter lessons workers have, therefore,

learned  in recent times is that loyalty to their company

no  longer counts.  Even as we tell them that in this era

of   globalisation,  no  job  is  guaranteed  for   life,

companies then must also come to realise that the workers

of  the  future  would no longer have the  same  kind  of

commitment, dedication and emotional attachment they used

to have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the bitter pill the Singapore worker has to

swallow  is the cut in the CPF.  Two questions linger  in

this  debate: is the cut itself enough to save jobs, and,

if  not,  then what?  Secondly, many Members have  asked,

how  about  doing  more  to make life  more  bearable  in

Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first concern is understandable. We have

seen   how  companies,  after  cutting  wages  and   even

compelling their workers to take no-pay leave, still  end

up  firing  people.  So if we make this cut now,  can  we

still  save jobs, not to mention create new ones?   I  do

not  think  even the Government can give  us  a  definite

answer  on  this  one.  To be certain, no investor  comes

here  purely with the aim of giving us jobs.   They  come

because  they believe that we can provide them  with  the

means  to enable them to make profits, and only  then  do

they  give us the jobs.  So this cut in the CPF,  as  has

been put up by the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2895</b></font><br><br>



Government,  is a signal of the Government's  recognition

of  the  competitive environment that we are now  in  and

that  we are prepared to be flexible and nimble.  But  is

this  a  strong  enough  signal?   Many  businessmen   do

appreciate  the savings that they would derive  but  they

ask,  why settle now for a range that will fluctuate with

the  economic cycle.  In fact, this would be no different

from  what we had been doing in the past, where  the  CPF

rate  was  adjusted along with the ups and downs  of  the

business  cycle, and what was missing was  the  certainty

that   businesses   needed  to   base   their   long-term

calculations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another view to this question has also been

raised by some economists.  The Government has said  that

the CPF cut would save employers $1.3 billion a year.   I

read  that  some  economists have pointed  out  that  the

biggest  beneficiary of this cut will, in  fact,  be  the

Government.  This is because the Government and its  GLCs

form  the single largest employer in Singapore, employing

what  they  estimate  to be 40% of our  workforce.   This

means  that  the  Government is,  in  fact,  saving  $520

million.   With  the  increase  in  GST  next  year,  the

Government will rake in - it has been estimated, I do not

know how correct it is - another $400 million.  So if you

add  this  $400 million to the $520 million,  you  get  a

total  of  $920 million that will actually be transferred

out of the system back to the Government, and that leaves

many  of  the  economists to express the  concern  as  to

whether  what  is  left in the private  sector  would  be

meaningful  enough to create the new jobs that  we  badly

want.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if past cuts in the CPF rate have still

not solved our dilemma, then it must beg the question  of

what else.  Like many other Members, I too share the view

that  Government  can do much more to bring  down  costs.

Sometimes,  I  believe that the problem with  this  whole

issue  of  Government costs may lie in the way Government

does  its  costings.  How else can you  explain  why  the

Government charges 2% of the value of a car when you want

to transfer ownership?  And this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2896</b></font><br><br>



value  of your car is not its market value, not the price

you  sell and someone buys it, but a value determined  by

the LTA, which then, of course, turns out to be much more

and,  as a result, if you buy a second-hand car, you  end

up  paying  hundreds, and sometimes  even  thousands,  of

dollars  to the Government just to register  it.   Now  I

bring  this up because many SMEs buy second-hand vehicles

for  their operations as they cannot afford new ones, but

they  do  not know why they have to pay so much  just  to

have  someone  at  the LTA press a  few  buttons  on  the

computer and register them as the new owner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, last year, during the debate on the Medical

Registration  (Amendment) Bill, the House heard  that  it

costs between $170,000 and $250,000 to train a doctor  in

a  university in Sydney, Oxford or Cambridge - I think it

was  Dr Lily Neo who pointed this out - but educating one

medical student at our own NUS costs about $400,000.  Now

this again begs the question of how Government arrives at

such a cost, and how do we end up being double that of  a

world class institution like Oxford?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what about the point of making life more

bearable  in  Singapore?  Many of us do  appreciate  that

Government  has done a lot to lower various  charges  and

given us rebates and Economic Restructuring Shares.   But

judging  from what I have heard in the past few days,  it

seems  we  have not done enough.  To make deep cuts  that

will make a meaningful difference to costs will mean  re-examining  the philosophies behind some of our  policies.

Sir,  many  of  our policies were formulated  to  achieve

certain social needs and while some may have succeeded in

achieving the social needs, they have also turned out  to

be valuable cash cows for the Government.  But if it is a

cash  cow  for the Government, it translates to a  burden

for the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take for example the foreign maid levy which was

introduced  to moderate our reliance on foreign  domestic

workers.  But each increase in the levy has added to  the

burden of many tens of thousands of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2897</b></font><br><br>



households - and we still have not been able to curb  the

rising demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example - transportation policies. They

have  always  been controversial ones.   We  took  fiscal

measures  to  prevent our tiny island from being  clogged

with vehicles enmeshed in gridlock.  But, in the process,

we  gained the dubious honour of being the most expensive

place  in  the  world to own and drive  a  car.   In  our

desire, Sir, to have a world-class transportation system,

we  may  have  overlooked  the fact  that  all  that  the

Singaporean wanted was a system that could get  him  from

point  A to point B, without any of the frills that  have

actually resulted in higher fares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, quite often it is this pre-occupation with

wanting  to be world-class in many things that  sometimes

has  me  worried.   Sure, we do not want  to  be  in  the

backwaters of nations but we also do not want to  end  up

with  a  world-class cost of living, as a writer  to  the

Forum  page  said  last week, that is comparable  to  New

York, Stockholm or Frankfurt.  He was quoting from a cost

of   living  index  survey  conducted  by  The  Economist

Intelligence Unit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone - I cannot remember who, but someone in this

House  -  said that if you want the quality of a  Jaguar,

then  do not expect to pay Toyota prices.  Well, I  think

under  the  present day circumstances, Singaporeans  will

not  mind being a bit more humble, and if we really  want

to  be  nimble and travel light, perhaps a ride  on  that

nifty  little Toyota will do just as well.  Maybe  it  is

not  so  classy, but if it does the same job, I think  we

can be quite happy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us - Government and people - have to have

less  expectations of one another.  But were we  all,  in

fact,  everyone  of us here, not responsible  for  asking

Singaporeans  to pursue the ownership of properties  like

there  was  no tomorrow?  3-room flat not enough?   Well,

upgrade to 4- or 5-room.  HDB flat not good enough?   Buy

private property.  One home not enough?  Well, buy  2  or

more, if you can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2898</b></font><br><br>



afford  it.   And now we are even asking the Minister  to

release more flats for rental!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is going to be a rough ride ahead, but I

think the people will accept the cuts even if it is  with

reluctance.  They are prepared to take this journey  with

the  Government,  out  of  the valley  of  gloom  to  the

promised sunny highland.  Nobody likes to have his  wages

cut,  particularly  when  we  cannot  even  promise   any

restoration.   So, I must say that while the announcement

that   a   further  cut  in  salaries  of  the  political

leadership and of top civil servants recently  does  show

that  we are prepared to lead the way, perhaps we  should

not  be  too hasty to say that this cut is only  for  one

year.  Why only for one year?  Why not just leave the cut

alone?  I think at a time when we are asking everyone  to

tighten his belt, we should not be too fast in talking of

restoring  our own pay until we really reach  that  sunny

highland.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that when the chips are down, the

Singaporean  is  willing to face up to the  difficulties.

The  party may be over, but we have not switched off  the

lights  in  Singapore yet, and someday, I hope,  not  too

long, the music will start to play again.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

do  not  want to lament the past, like my good friend  Mr

Tan Soo Khoon.  I want to see the future.  I want to make

sure that Singapore succeeds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a survey by the Feedback Unit, 70% of

Singaporeans have accepted the need for the CPF cut.  Now

this  figure  of  70% was before DPM announced  the  help

package.  So the figure could have been higher.  And I do

not  intend  to bore this House with the reasons  why  we

need to cut CPF any further.  PM, DPM and Members of this

House have given reasons why this cut is necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate is about the livelihood of Singaporeans

today   and  the  future.   It  is  about  labour  market

flexibility.  Are we prepared to change to meet  the  new

challenges of doing businesses in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2899</b></font><br><br>



world?   It  is also about capability and cost.   Are  we

competitive?   But above all, this debate is  about  jobs

and  job  creation.  To the Singaporeans watching  us  on

television  every evening, what they are looking  for  is

whether  we  are able to provide them with jobs,  and  if

they  have got no jobs, they want to know what help lines

are  we  giving them.  And this is where I will  approach

this  whole  issue.  These are very serious  thoughts  in

their minds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House is very familiar with the movement of

white-collar  jobs, from the US to India,  especially  in

the   area   of  IT  outsourcing  and  business   process

outsourcing.  These are very modern terms but  these  are

very, very important terms for the business world.  Other

countries are having a slice of this business because  of

this  outsourcing.  And, therefore, we see countries like

the Philippines and India having a slice of this business

cake.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell you, in the Philippines, Proctor &

Gamble has already processed its payroll, travel, invoice

processing and other work at offices in Manila.  While it

would  be  best if such works have been assigned  to  the

Singapore office, like what Citigroup is doing with their

cash, securities, and credit cards, Singaporeans may have

to  go  and  work  in offices away from home.   In  other

words,  our share of the service business pie is  getting

smaller,  and  moreover competition from China  has  also

affected  our  manufacturing side.  Now what  do  we  do?

Surely we must do something to prevent this loss of jobs.

We  have  never  sat  idly by.  We  have  faced  problems

before,  and only recently we fought SARS extremely  well

and  gained  worldwide recognition  for  our  efforts  to

contain  SARS.  This debate would send clear  signals  to

investors  that  the  Singapore Government  is  seriously

urging its people to stand up and face the new realities.

The  Government has got practically everybody involved  - grassroots  organisations, unions, employers, politicians

like  us,  all together.  And judging from the  feedback,

this wave of change in mindset, in attitudes, and even in

our ego, is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2900</b></font><br><br>



beginning  to sink into the population.  And  this  would

bear  well for our country.  The pain that many will face

is  cushioned by the help package that DPM announced last

Friday.   It may not please all.  But it must be  managed

well   at   the  ground  level,  by  our  own  grassroots

organisations  and  by our CDCs.  So everyone  who  needs

help will be helped.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans want to know where the jobs are

created.  So looking at the help package of $1 billion, a

substantial sum of $600 million comes from some 60 public

sector  infrastructure projects.  These are mostly  small

projects,  like  development and  improvement  works  for

roads,  schools, community clubs.  These would definitely

benefit  the local contractors.  But will the  jobs  find

Singaporean takers?  I hope so, especially in  these  bad

times.   We will have to wait and see because this sector

of  the  economy  has  been primarily  taken  by  foreign

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relaxing of the subletting rules will help some

families,  as  this will provide some older  Singaporeans

another   source  of  income.   The  $40   million   Work

Assistance  Programme will help and encourage low  income

unemployed Singaporeans back to work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tourism forms an important source of revenue for our

country.   And  tourists bring a lot of  income  for  the

retail  sector,  the hotels and the tour agencies.   This

sector  suffered tremendous loss during the SARS  period.

I  was  part  of the "Cool" team that tried to  help  the

tourism industry.  I can tell you my first meeting at the

"Cool" team was so depressing.  The hotels were reporting

10%-20%  occupancy  rate.  The retail  sector  was  down.

Tourist companies, tour agencies, were closing down.   So

I  think  the present $100 million Tourism Fund that  has

been allocated to them will definitely help the industry,

at  least  to bring back the tourists and the  jobs  that

have been lost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no choice. If we cannot find jobs in

Singapore, we must go out to find them.  With  our  brand

name "Singapore"

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2901</b></font><br><br>



and  an  internationally  recognised  disciplined  labour

force, we have to chase for the dollar outside Singapore.

So  an understanding of world business practices by young

Singaporeans  is  very important.  Being educated,  young

and mobile is helpful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MNCs now work differently. They are outsourcing

IT, and world business practices have changed a lot.  And

this  would  require a lot of mindset  change  among  our

young  Singaporeans  to understand how  they  work.   Big

companies,  as  you  know,  are  outsourcing  to   India,

Thailand and the Philippines.  And even our local  banks,

like  DBS,  also  do  a  lot  of  outsourcing.   So  this

International  Enterprise  Incentive  scheme,  which  was

proposed  last  Friday  by DPM, will  go  to  help  local

companies  build the capabilities to venture  abroad  and

thus provide more jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I read very carefully one interview

that  was  given,  and  there was  an  exchange  actually

between  our Minister Lim Swee Say and the IBM boss.   It

appeared  in  the  Straits Times and, in  that  page,  it

included  a column on the warning by IBM.  There  were  a

few tell-tale words that kept cropping up and I know they

were meaningfully and carefully crafted words.  The first

word is "reconstruct", meaning simply change.  The second

is  "deconstruct", meaning remove the old ways  of  doing

business.   And  the third is "re-deploying"  the  supply

chain.    But  two words captured my attention  and  also

captured the headlines of the Business Times - capability

and costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis given to costs, especially in this

economic   climate,  is  very  telling.   This  interview

encapsulated the essence of how and what the MNC business

strategy  would  be like and young Singaporeans  entering

the job market must fully understand this and be prepared

to do overseas assignment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must have faith and confidence in the

Government.  The way we handled SARS was admired by many.

It  revealed a disciplined people with a strong  will  to

overcome the odds.  But we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2902</b></font><br><br>



are  in  a better position today than in 1965.  This  was

pointed  out to us by the Senior Minister.  This time  we

have  assets  in the form of our reserves.  The  reserves

reveal   our  high  standing  internationally  and   that

capability to tide over, if the worst happens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, two, our FTAs. The FTAs would generate and

guarantee  us  tax-  free access to  the  United  States,

Australia  and  those countries who have  FTAs  with  us.

Many  countries, in the earlier times, criticised us  for

all  these FTAs.  But I think they realise the importance

of  the FTAs and we must make full use of the FTAs.  They

are  already beginning to negotiate for FTAs, but we have

a headstart.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Singapore companies, especially our SMEs, must

take  advantage  and leverage on the FTAs  to  help  them

better understand this very important premium.  We should

organise  seminars  and  even set  up  a  special  bureau

accessible to our SMEs and local companies to exploit our

FTAs to enhance our business and to create jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is one area which I share

concern   with  Minister  Cedric  Foo.   He  spoke   this

afternoon about productivity, and I fully agree with him.

I  think our productivity has got to be looked at  again.

Minister  Lim Boon Heng's chart on productivity  revealed

that  we  are  not  that productive,  especially  in  our

services side.  Two things that MNCs are looking for,  as

I  said earlier, are capability and cost.  How capable is

our  workforce?  I know we have a disciplined  workforce,

as  I  said, but this is not enough.  We must  have  high

productive  workers,  or what is so different  between  a

Chinese worker, a Malaysian worker, or a Thai worker.  We

must  have  that  premium.  Our workers  must  be  really

productive  because we cannot compete with their  workers

on cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Productivity in services, as shown by Mr Lim Boon

Heng  in  his  chart given to the House, is significantly

lower  than in many countries with a population  of  less

than  20  million.  We are ranked 20th.  I  remember  the

strong emphasis by Senior

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2903</b></font><br><br>



Minister  Lee  Kuan  Yew many years ago  in  one  of  his

National  Day  speeches.   It  was,  I  would  recall,  a

landmark speech.  Because he emphasised the importance of

productivity  for Singapore's future.  I  think  we  must

revisit  that speech because it lays out the reasons  why

we  must  have a very productive workforce  to  meet  the

challenges.  That was many, many years ago and yet to see

the  chart  that  we are ranked No. 20,  I  think,  is  a

disappointment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that we have not done enough about

productivity.   Minister Cedric Foo had highlighted  what

SPRING has done and all the productive work that they had

put into getting Singaporeans to be more productive in so

many sectors.  But I still think much could be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example that we are all very

familiar  with.  Look at our construction  site.   It  is

always  messy,  noisy  and  housekeeping  is  poor,  with

materials  thrown all over the places.  I  was  having  a

holiday  in  Perth, Australia, and I  was  staying  in  a

relative's house.  The first day, I noticed a vacant plot

of land adjacent to this house.  The second day, three or

four  workers came and started working on it,  and  there

were only three to four workers.  But by the seventh day,

I  could  see that at least the bottom half of the  house

was  already constructed.  No noise, yes, I could  hardly

hear any noise.  The materials were well-stacked and  put

neatly  away.   Of  course, they used  a  great  deal  of

prefabricated items, and there was hardly any mess.   The

few  workers seemed to know exactly what to do and no one

seemed to get into each other's way.  Later, I discovered

that  each  of  the  workers is actually  a  professional

builder and he reads the house plan.  I think if you  are

able  to read the house plan, you will not get into  each

other's   way  because  you  know  what  to   do.    But,

unfortunately, for our workers, I do not think they  even

know  how to read the plans.  And that is why we get such

shoddy work in our homes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if Singaporeans want the jobs back in the

construction industry, they must be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2904</b></font><br><br>



more  productive for the construction company's  boss  to

hire  them.   They  are  no  match  against  the  foreign

workers,  in terms of pay.  They must be more  than  just

simple workers.  They must work smart.  They must be able

to read the house plan.  They must be multi-tasked people

and can be paid higher for their job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was renovating my house, it took the local

contractor  four times to fix my wash basin.   I  thought

his  workers were all foreign workers.  But when I  heard

that  they  were  all  Singaporeans,  I  was  very,  very

disappointed.   They are not even Malaysians.   They  are

all  Singaporeans.  After the second time,  I  asked  his

worker  whether he was proud of the job.  His reply  was,

"Every  one also does like that."  But I said, "I am  not

every  one.   You do it again."  And I told them,  "Don't

blame  the Government if we approve more foreign  workers

because  you  are only as good, but more expensive.   And

that  is  not enough."  After the fourth attempt,  I  was

satisfied. So I asked them what they thought of the final

result.   They  liked it.  They agreed they  should  have

done it at the first attempt, if they took the trouble to

read  and  understand the instructions, and  not  assumed

that they knew how to fix a wash basin, because some wash

basins can be a little different.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point, Mr Speaker, Sir, is so much time was

wasted  and productivity was zero.  Similarly,  you  walk

into a restaurant and you try to get information from the

menu.  The waiter will be probably walking three to  four

times  to  the Captain about the items you have asked  or

enquired.   This  is bad, unproductive service.   Can  we

blame  the  waiter?  I think the manager is  also  to  be

blamed.   Singaporeans shun such  jobs.   But  if  proper

upgrading  is  done  in  this  services  industry,   more

Singaporeans will work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How? DPM Lee again has announced the Domestic

Sector Productivity Fund last Friday.  We have got to use

this  fund  to develop systems, guidelines and workflows,

because  no one, no matter how good he is, if we  have  a

lousy system, he can never perform.  So, productivity is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2905</b></font><br><br>



linked  with  the way we do things, the way  the  company

plans  the  job work.  We have to empower that individual

with  knowledge to be able to be productive.  So, let  us

get  this  fund  to  improve the image  of  our  services

sector,  so  that  the jobs now taken by foreign  workers

will eventually go back to Singaporeans.  Of course, this

is  only one sector I have highlighted.  I am sure  there

are  many, many sectors which were also highlighted  just

now  by the Minister of State for Defence, Mr Cedric Foo,

and we should all look into them in more detail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, this time round, the

expectations of many Singaporeans have been dented.  Egos

have been hurt, but there is no shame in enjoying a lower

cost  of  living,  a lower level job  with  a  less  than

expected salary, a different lifestyle.  But all  is  not

lost.  We will bounce back.  We must use this rough patch

in  our  economy to consolidate our position,  internally

and  externally, so that we can weather the  future  with

even  more  confidence.   We  have  done  it  with  SARS.

Surely, the team that fought SARS well will also bring us

out  of this jam.  We must have confidence in them.   But

we must also have confidence in ourselves, so that we can

try  to put everything into shape and move on.  I believe

this team can make it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Prime Minister's

retuning of the CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central) (In Mandarin): Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   ever   since   the   Prime   Minister's

announcement of an impending CPF cut in his National  Day

Rally speech, the NTUC has spared no time in meeting with

its affiliated unions to discuss this problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The union leaders are very rational and they are

bold  enough to face the facts.  They have agreed to  the

cut  in  the  employer's CPF contribution rate  to  lower

business   cost,   so  that  workers'   jobs   could   be

safeguarded.  It is hoped that the savings as a result of

the   CPF  cuts  could  be  used  to  augment  production

facilities to expand their business and to safeguard

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2906</b></font><br><br>



the  jobs  of the workers, and even to create  new  jobs.

They  also  appeal to the employers to have a conscience,

and  not to put all the savings in their pockets and have

a  fling  in life.  They should share these savings  with

the workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade union leaders are worried about members not

being  able  to cope with mortgage payments,  healthcare,

transport,  utilities and conservancy charges,  and  they

hope  that the Government can empathise with their plight

and  lend them a helping hand.  The $1 billion assistance

package  has  brought  a sigh of relief  to  the  workers

although  these measures cannot satisfy everybody.   This

is  understandable.  Why do I say this?  In my  chit-chat

with  the  constituents in the coffee shops,  they  would

invariably  tell me, "Heh, do not be too  depressed.   In

this  age, it is difficult to be a God.  It is even  more

difficult to be the Government."  They also said that, if

it  rains  every day, housewives will grumble that  their

clothes will not get dried.  If it does not rain, workers

who  are  working under the hot sun, find that the  wages

they  earn  are  not enough to buy the drinks  needed  to

quench  their  thirst.  Clerical staff who  work  in  the

office  complain that the air-conditioner is blowing  hot

air  and  not  cool  air.   It is  not  easy  to  be  the

Government.  No matter what the Government has done,  the

people  will find some fault with it.  I asked them  what

they thought of the assistance package.  They said, "Very

good, what more can we ask for?  Unless someone can bless

me with a winning number so that I can strike the 4-digit

lottery."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, an old friend, a transport union

official in Taiwan, told me over the phone: "Mr Ong, your

workers  are wonderful.  They are very adaptable, whether

in  good fortune or adversity.  They are even prepared to

suffer  wage  cuts  and  CPF  cuts.  Your  Government  is

remarkable - so much subsidies (assistance measures)!"  I

asked him how was the situation over in Taiwan.  He said,

"Over  here, who cares?  The government is busy with  the

presidential elections next year."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2907</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not easy to be a good

government, because the better the government, the higher

would  be the expectations of the people, and more people

will  complain.  A bad government finds it easy to run  a

country  because the people would have got  used  to  it.

What can you ask for?  Consider yourself lucky if you  do

not starve to death.  If you ask him why he does not look

for  a job and earn a living for himself, he would reply,

"Do you think it is so easy to find a job?  You must have

money to get a job."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, Singaporeans are very fortunate. If

they work, they can get money.  There is no need for them

to  use money to buy jobs.  The Government has worked out

a  Work  Assistance  Programme  to  help  the  retrenched

workers and to help them find new jobs.  Older people  do

not  have to worry, because the Government has set  up  a

"job  matching and training scheme" for them.  As a trade

union leader, I am proud to have a Government that is  so

concerned about the welfare of the workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM Lee also stressed the need to cut waste in the

Government.  The Acting Minister for Health has also said

that  hospital charges will not be raised.  However,  the

Singapore  Sports  Council (SSC)  has  decided  to  raise

admission  charges to public swimming pools. With  effect

from  October 2003, charges for those under 18  years  of

age  will be raised from $0.50 to $0.80 and by July  next

year,  they  will  be further raised to  $1.10.   As  for

adults, the present fee of $1.00 would be raised to $1.50

with  effect  from October 2003, and then to  $2.00  from

July  2004. For senior citizens, the admission fees  will

be  raised  from  $0.50 to $1.00.  During  weekends,  the

$0.70  for under-18 will be raised to $1.10 and  by  July

2004, to $1.50.  Adult fees will be raised from $1.30  to

$2.00, and then to $2.70. As for the senior citizens, the

fees will rise from $0.60 to $1.10, and then to $1.50.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, those who live in condominiums are

already having swimming pools at their door-steps.  Those

who are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2908</b></font><br><br>



well-off  can  go to their clubs to swim.  The  Singapore

Sports  Council  has  more than  20  swimming  complexes,

spread  over the various housing estates. These  are  for

the  middle and lower income groups to use.  At  present,

if  a  grandfather  takes his two  grandchildren  to  the

swimming  pool on a week-day, he pays $1.50.  By October,

he  has  to pay $2.40, an increase of $0.90.  During  the

weekends, he will have to pay $1.30 more.  Those who live

in  the  vicinity of the swimming pools told me that  the

swimming  pools are idle during weekdays.   According  to

SSC,  the increase in fees is aimed at balancing the cost

and  revenue.   What I worry is that when  the  fees  are

increased, the swimming pools will be idle and they  will

become breeding grounds for mosquitoes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To balance cost and revenue, I have a novel idea.

There  are  two swimming pools in each complex.   We  can

rent  out  one pool to Qianhu Fish Farm, a tropical  fish

company,  to  breed  their fish.   Therefore,  with  this

rental  income, there is no need to raise  the  admission

fees.   Is this not good for the people?  While swimming,

we  can  also  watch  the tropical  fish!   Is  this  not

wonderful?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while the people are supporting the

Government's  reform programme, what  has  the  SSC  been

doing?  Reforming the CPF is a painful decision.   It  is

also  painful  to  the  people.  However,  what  is  most

important  is that we should change our mindset  to  face

reality, to be pragmatic and to face life honestly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote from my bus captain. The bus captain

told me that we were lucky that we had the CPF to be cut.

If we do not have any CPF to cut, then it would be pretty

bad  for us, because it would mean that we do not have  a

job.   Therefore,  we  should face the  CPF  cut  calmly.

Though poor, we should be contented and happy.  When  one

is  wealthy,  one should be compassionate towards  others

who   are   less   fortunate.   If  the   Government   is

compassionate, and we are united, our future  is  bright,

and Singapore will be a place where people would like  to

live  and  work in.  When winter comes to an end,  spring

will be around.

<div align="center"><b>RETUNING THE CPF</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Acting Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</b> First of all, let me thank Members for supporting these

changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In crafting these new policies, many civil servants

who  helped formulate these changes not only used  common

sense,  but  more  importantly,  compassion.   They  were

mindful  of the pervasive and painful effects that  would

result.  Varied scenarios and computations were examined.

Staff  pored  through reams of printed data  and  tables.

They   tried  their  best  to  minimise  the   pain   and

recommended spacing out or phasing in changes while still

achieving  our political, economic and social objectives.

Ms  Indranee  Rajah will be pleased to know  that  common

sense   indeed  was  used  in  plentiful  dollops.    The

reactions from Members and Singaporeans have reassured me

that they have succeeded in some measure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as many Members in this House who rose to speak

on  these CPF changes have realised and expressed, larger

and  more  fundamental issues underlie these CPF changes.

For  while  the reasons for and pace of CPF changes  have

been  accepted  by  the  majority,  this  moment  at  the

crossroads  has  occasioned all  Singaporeans  to  wonder

about our future, our needs and our fates.  There is even

fear  among some Singaporeans.  They are asking if  these

changes  signal  an  end  to  the  Singaporean  dream;  a

relegation  from our first world status; an end  to  some

aspirations and hopes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to address these concerns as well as

specific queries from Members

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2910</b></font><br><br>



of  Parliament.  To me, there is the greater significance

of  character and nation-building in this exercise.   Our

responses to these changes should be seen in this context

as  it signals a people's - a nation's - resolve, to want

to chart and better their destiny.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some who believe these measures would not

work.   They say cutting CPF will dampen the recovery  as

consumer  expenditure  falls  and  the  property   market

softens  due to reduced purchasing power.  A deflationary

cycle will follow.  Other similar pessimists say that  it

is  too little - it would not make a difference.  We  are

so  uncompetitive  that whatever we  do,  companies  will

continue  to pull out or bypass Singapore.  The avalanche

of cheaper manpower has overtaken us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans need not be despondent or insecure or

believe  these  futilitarians.  Mr Tan Soo  Khoon  quoted

some  reports about these measures.  I did not  read  the

reports  but  it occurred to me, while he  was  speaking,

that they are conjectured that this was a convoluted  way

for  the  Government to make money.  They  give  us  more

credit  than what it is due.  He said, and he can correct

me  if  I  misheard  him, that the CPF  cuts  would  save

Government and GLCs $500 million, that the GST would give

Government $400 million.  I am not sure why, if  you  are

the  major employer, you save $500 million; when the  GST

increases, you also make money.  Perhaps someone else can

explain   the  mathematics  to  me.   On  top  of   that,

Government  now  gives  a  $1  billion  package  to  help

citizens  and  end up with a budget deficit.   If  indeed

this is a convoluted way of Government making money, then

Government  has immense capacity, more than  what  people

think.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that the future is uncertain and success is

never  guaranteed.   But  that is  quite  different  from

saying  that we are beaten as a nation, and we  had  best

just lie back and play the vanquished.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must have greater mettle and be fully

confident.   To  me, accepting these  CPF  changes  is  a

decisive response

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2911</b></font><br><br>



that shows the resolve to do what is needed; to be nimble

and  to adjust, as Dr Tan Cheng Bock said.  It signals  a

nation  on  the  move,  willing  to  make  sacrifices  to

survive. It is not only about what needs to be done,  but

that we can do it at all.  As Mrs Fang Ai Lian said,  the

key significance is that we can execute.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if some other calamity befalls us tomorrow and

sets these efforts back, this nation will bounce back and

do  more, if that is what is needed to improve our lot in

life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members have asked for a clear economic plan.

The  Prime Minister will elaborate on this tomorrow.  But

as  many Members also know, where it comes to matters  of

business, as it does affairs of the heart, it is  not  so

simple.  It is not so completely deterministic.  There is

no  magic formula.  But we can learn from others.   There

are some general ingredients for success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History is replete with examples of countries that

were content to lie in the present, resisting change  and

landed  on the slippery slope because they chose  not  to

confront  their problems and new realities  head-on.   On

this,  I  agree with Mr Inderjit Singh that  we  have  to

tackle our problems head-on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China has a particularly venerable history. It

boasted  inventions such as printing  and  paper  in  the

ninth  century,  gunpowder  in  the  11th  century,   the

compass,  porcelain.   The Chinese invented  machines  to

spin hemp in the 12th century, some 500 years before  the

Industrial  Revolution began in England.  China  had  the

knowledge  capital  and advantage  over  many  countries.

With  its  inventions, it could have been  the  first  to

print  books  for the masses to accelerate learning.   It

could  have  experienced  its own industrial  revolution.

With  gunpowder, it could have revolutionised the science

of propulsion for industry or military gains.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could have but then China - the self-absorbed

Celestial empire - closed its

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2912</b></font><br><br>



minds to progress and its own strengths and opportunities

and became insular.  From the 15th century, other nations

pulled  ahead.  So for the last 500 years, China lumbered

along,  living on past glory.  But the dragon has stirred

and  all in its wake felt the pounding of its steps  when

it  threw  open its doors and chose to engage the  modern

world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan's income rose from 20% of the United States'

in  1950  to  75% by 1998.  It is a rise unparalleled  in

recorded  history.   This phoenix rose miraculously  from

its   atomic  ashes  and  dazzled  the  world  with   its

manufacturing prowess.  But in the last two decades, when

faced  with much lesser challenges, it lacked  that  same

resolve to pull itself out of its quagmire.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 750 to 1100 AD, Islamic science and technology

far surpassed that of Europe.  In their golden years, the

world's  greatest  scientists wrote  in  Arabic.   Indeed

during  that  period,  many  Muslims  taught  science  to

Europeans,  especially at the frontiers like Spain  where

intermixing   occurred.   Then  something   went   wrong.

Religious  zealots denounced Islamic science  as  heresy.

These   nations  regressed  as  they  chose  a  parochial

emphasis on religious conformity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any group or nation - no matter how mighty - that

discards   knowledge,   prefers  form   over   substance,

sacrifices  future  needs for present  comforts,  resists

change,  erects barriers to progress, is doomed to  fail.

Ultimately, these barriers are self-destructive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic historians, such as Stephen Parente and

Edward  Prescott in their book "Barriers to Riches"  tell

us  that the differences in living standards have  little

to  do  with natural resources - or levels of investment.

Rather,  they  see the differences in the intensity  that

various  countries make of the world's existing stock  of

know-how.  Countries that are open to the flow of ideas - and whose laws, customs and institutions encourage wealth

creation   -   can  catch  up  with  the  old-established

"industrial" economies.  Japan, Korea and recently  China

are outstanding examples of this catch-up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, while all countries will walk

through  hills and valleys, some walk right into  ravines

or get mired in swamps.  Others stay still and get hemmed

in  and  suffocated by the overgrowth.  Those that  erect

barriers,  both physical and mental, will  be  overtaken.

Only  those who choose to engage progress wholeheartedly,

expand  their  minds  and  economic  space,  survive  and

thrive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the million dollar question that many MPs

have asked?  Even if Singapore is willing to change, will

these changes be enough?  Who does fortune favour?  While

history  teaches us that nations that do not  change  are

often  overtaken, it also shows us that "fortune  favours

the well prepared."  Tenacity, diligence, boldness and  a

cohesive  spirit  have  helped  nations,  in  more   dire

circumstances  than Singapore is today,  pull  themselves

out  of the rut.  I will give two examples and use  city-states for comparability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take Ireland as the first example. In 1840, the

Irish population was nine million but, a decade later, it

was  halved:  over  a  million died of  starvation;  most

emigrated;  a quarter of those who boarded the  ill-fated

coffin  ships to America died in transit.  After emerging

as the Irish Free State, it promptly plunged into a civil

war that lasted until 1923.  At that time, the population

included  fewer than three million people and  was  still

dwindling.  In other words, they lost six million  people

in 80 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To demonstrate economic "self-sufficiency" as well

as   political  independence,  Ireland  adopted   inward-looking, protectionist policies - high tariffs,  bans  on

majority foreign ownership in industry, the establishment

of   state-owned  enterprises  in  areas  such  as  power

generation,  shipping,  banking  and  insurance.    These

policies   were  pursued  well  into  the   1950s,   with

increasingly  perverse results.  The  economy  stagnated,

emigration  soared  even further, as  more  than  400,000

people  left Ireland between 1951 and 1961.  In the  mid-80s,  the unemployment rate reached 17%, the government's

finances were in shambles, and submission to a draconian

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2914</b></font><br><br>



International   Monetary   Fund   (IMF)   programme   was

considered  as  a  means of getting the economy  back  on

track.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But something happened. At the end of the year

2000,   Ireland   could  look  back  on   14   years   of

uninterrupted  economic growth, which had accelerated  to

nearly  10%  annually.   With this growth  came  markedly

lower inflation, one of the lowest unemployment rates  in

the  European  Union,  and  a  growing  government-budget

surplus.   Most  dramatic, however,  was  the  return  to

Ireland,  a  country which had seen emigration  over  100

years, of young workers in increasing numbers to fill new

jobs awaiting them at home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did they reverse their terrible plight? It was

not just due to the luck of the Irish.  In the 1960s that

tenacious  Irish  spirit  rallied.   The  government  and

people  decided  to  adopt low  corporate  tax  rates  to

encourage foreign investments.  At a time when they could

least  afford, they spent more on educating their  people

better and establish high-tech industries, especially  in

info-technology and telecommunications.   Ireland  joined

the  European Union.  In the 1990s, true to the  aphorism

that "fortune favours the well prepared", a technological

discontinuity,  which brought about plummeting  costs  in

telecommunication services, was the chance  element  that

helped start an economic boom in Ireland.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second example is Finland. Finland is another

example  of a tenacious people that refused to be  beaten

down.  Tucked away in the northern-most corner of Europe,

five million dedicated Finns continue to demonstrate  the

fierce  nationalism that has enabled them to  survive  an

unforgiving  climate as well as a turbulent history.   It

is  a  land repeatedly fought over through the centuries.

Finland  underwent  a  transition from  frozen  isolation

along the Arctic Circle into a centre of high technology,

with  a  population  both  technologically  literate  and

politically sophisticated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice in the 20th century, Finland had been written

off  as lost: first, in the "Winter War" in 1939 when the

Finns were

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2915</b></font><br><br>



left  alone to face invasion by a Russian army  50  times

its  size,  and  again at the end of World  War  II  when

Finland was given over to the Soviet sphere of influence.

In  the early 1990s, the Soviet empire fragmented and the

Rouble  collapsed.  Finland's economy, which was  closely

tied to that of the Soviet Union, also shrank sharply and

unemployment rose.  Yet, it has managed to  come  out  of

its troubles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How? Government and industry made dramatic efforts

to  surge  into  the world's new information  technology,

supported by one of the most highly skilled labour forces

in  the  world.   Finland, today, is rightly  called  the

telecommunications laboratory of the European Union, with

an  exceptional hi-tech infrastructure.  Many of us  know

as  we  use  their Nokia phones.  This,  in  addition  to

industrial     production    ranging     from     complex

instrumentation  for  meteorological  and   environmental

sciences,  to medical diagnostic equipment, to  automated

wood-harvesting machinery, to innovative icebreakers  and

luxurious  cruise  ships.  In the late  1990s,  Finland's

economic  growth  rate  was one of  the  highest  of  the

industrialised countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will Ireland and Finland expect to prosper

indefinitely?  No one knows, and no guarantees exist  for

any state.  All economies are subject to the vicissitudes

of  cycles  and  providence.  Ireland  and  Finland  face

similar  problems like Singapore, as a result of slowdown

in  global  economic demand.  As do many other countries.

We  are not alone.  We need not be narcissistic.  We  can

commiserate.  Who will emerge to prosper depends  on  how

each nation's people respond.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans' response to these CPF changes has

renewed my confidence.  Members of this House should  not

under-estimate  the disasters that await  us  if  we  had

chosen  to  stay on our previous course.  Neither  should

they under-estimate the impact and the signals that these

CPF  changes have achieved.  We should not downplay.   It

is not a simple

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2916</b></font><br><br>



exercise.   These  CPF changes herald a critical  turning

point for the better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirement adequacy will wreak economic and social

havoc on those that will not, cannot or have not provided

enough.  Minister of State Cedric Foo commented on  this,

and I agree with him.  I will elaborate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The International Herald Tribune on 22nd August this

year  carried  this  article under the sub-heading,  "The

looming clash of generations".   I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four issues are coming together to create a

"perfect  storm":  birth rates below  replacement  level,

longer  life  spans, holes in private pension  funds  and

massive government fiscal deficits.  The aging generation

has been promised much more than can be delivered without

dramatically   damaging   the   prospects    of    future

generations.  This will be a political battle, a new form

of  class  warfare  over  scarce resources.   Demographic

decline  is  especially apparent in Europe [and  I  would

add, Singapore]. In most countries fertility is far below

replacement levels.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the state nor the private sector is in a

position   to  meet  the  promises  made  to  the   aging

generation.  Tax and deficit levels are already high  and

would  have  to  rise  by huge amounts  to  fund  pension

promises.   Tough  political decisions will  have  to  be

taken to change expectations.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet such measures are essential to avoid crippling

taxes  on  the  declining percentage of people  in  work.

Ideally the state should be reducing tax burdens on young

families   and   taxing  pensions  for  the  able-bodied.

Whether  the  long-spoiled baby boomers  are  willing  to

concede  that  such  measures are  necessary  is  another

matter.   They  have the votes to defeat  any  government

that would introduce them."



In  other  words, unrealistic expectations,  longer  life

expectancies, medical advances, demographic  trends  have

set  up  a  perfect storm that threatens to  disrupt  the

social   fabric  as  one  generation  is  pitted  against

another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me illustrate this with an anecdote which

occurred  in  Germany.  In August  this  year,  a  furore

erupted  when  a  young  23-year old  German  politician,

Philipp  Missfelder, head of the Conservative  opposition

youth outfit, criticised politicians from all parties for

"betrayal",  saying Germany's social system favoured  the

elderly  at  the  expense of the younger generation.   He

suggested,  among other solutions, that  those  above  85

years - you heard me right, 85 years - should not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2917</b></font><br><br>



expect the national system to pay for their hip implants.

He being 23, I assume he said, "Well, 62 years more, if I

don't break my hip within that period, and if I break  it

after that, then I should pay for it."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Older Germans, even those within his own party,

threatened  to  "spank  the  youngster."   The   humorous

response did not mask the resolve of the older generation

to  protect  their perceived sacrosanct  rights,  despite

this being an untenable situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This road has led Germany to the `gloomy valley'.

They  are  stuck!   It explains why Chancellor  Schroeder

chose  to  wade into the political minefield  of  pension

reform  and  proposed  the  biggest  shake-up  since  the

current system was set up in 1957.   We should not under-estimate these changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF changes we are making now will ensure that

this  Singaporean generation and future generations  will

remain  nimble,  still able to respond  quickly  to  fast

changing  circumstances.   We  would  have  averted   the

perilous situation where one generation's needs can  only

be  met by another's unwilling sacrifice.  We would  have

behaved  responsibly by not expecting the next generation

to shoulder our burdens by providing for our needs now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address specific queries from Members

during this debate.  Some Members have asked why not  fix

the  rate  at  a  lower level, instead  of  a  range.   I

acknowledge that a variable rate creates uncertainty,  as

expressed  by Dr Chong, Mr Iswaran, Ms Irene and  Mr  Tan

Soo Khoon, and it disrupts long-term planning.  We accept

that.   But  global economic shifts have accelerated  and

impacted Singapore almost instantaneously.  In this fluid

environment, we need flexibility, even for the  statutory

component.   It will come under pressure the  moment  you

fix  it.   And  when you are compelled to lower  it,  the

psychological effect is greater.  Remember also that even

when  we had fixed it at 40%, it also caused uncertainty.

While  we were at 36%, investors and employers calculated

decisions  based  on  that higher target  rate.   Workers

based aspirations and lifestyles

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2918</b></font><br><br>



also on that number, assuming it would be restored.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this exercise and what this debate have done

very   successfully  is  to  reset,  retune  and  refocus

mindsets  to the floor rate.  We have shifted focus  from

the  ceiling  rate to the floor rate  of  30%.   So,  now

investors  and  employers know that there is  potentially

some  refuge in reduction.  We read over the weekend  how

Singaporeans  now plan their homes and spending  patterns

on  30%.   Very  quickly,  the  message  has  sunk  home.

Anything above that is an added bonus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reiterate that we will give as long a lead time as

possible if future CPF rate changes are required.  It  is

not  envisaged that rates will be changed  from  year  to

year.  There is a range but the CPF rate is a blunt tool.

We agree.  It will be reset when a systemic adjustment is

required.   It does not have the sensitivity to calibrate

according to performances of different companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, many Members of Parliament have called on

companies doing well to pass on profits to workers in the

form  of  bonuses or other variable components of  wages,

and  help avoid retrenchments, mentioned by Mr Leong Horn

Kee,  Dr  Ong  Seh  Hong, Mr Heng Chee  How,  Mr  Nithiah

Nandan,  Mr  Andy Gan, Dr Ong Chit Chung and  Mr  Ng  Ser

Miang.   I  endorse this sentiment, although I would  not

push for rigid formulas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do want to emphasise the point made by Dr Ong,

Dr  Gan See Khem, Ms Irene Ng and Mr Arthur Fong that our

overall   wage  structure  needs  to  be  more  flexible,

allowing   individual  companies  to  vary  their   wages

according  to  business circumstances.   Companies'  wage

structures  should differentiate performance  and  reward

individuals  accordingly,  and  address  the   structural

rigidities  created  by  seniority-based  systems.    The

Government has initiated a Tripartite Task Force on  wage

reform  chaired  by  my  Permanent  Secretary  to  assist

companies  in  implementing flexible wage structures.   I

will  ask  this  Task Force to study the  suggestions  by

Members - Mrs Yu-Foo, Mr Chew

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2919</b></font><br><br>



Heng  Ching and Mr Ng Ser Miang - of using tax incentives

to encourage companies to reform.  The Task Force will be

presenting  its recommendations at the end of  the  year,

and will consider other proposals which Mr Inderjit Singh

brought up this afternoon on retrenchment cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to adequacy for retirement and the

Minimum  Sum.  These issues were raised by Mr  Chew,  Mrs

Lim Hwee Hua, Mr Andy Gan and Mr Ahmad Magad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having adjusted expectations to 30%, can we still

meet  the  aspirations  of Singaporeans?   It  is  a  key

question.  Can Singaporeans still own homes and take care

of  their medical and retirement expenses?  Why  not,  as

some  Members suggested, give flexibility in how much  we

force  Singaporeans  to  save?  In  other  words,  tailor

savings  according to income level.  Dr Ong Seh Hong  and

Ms Irene Ng said we should calibrate savings based on pre-retirement income and income groups.  Mr Chew Heng  Ching

said  the  increases are too fast and should  instead  be

pegged  to  Consumer Price Index inflation.  Dr  Gan  See

Khem and Dr Jennifer Lee, though disagree, said it is not

enough as costs are rising.  Mr Inderjit Singh also  said

not to make it compulsory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implication in all these points is that perhaps

we  should  give up some dreams, even home ownership  for

some Singaporeans.  The Minister for National Development

has  eloquently defended the policy and  I  will  add  by

saying  we  need not.  The vast majority of  Singaporeans

can, and should, still hold on to their dreams and homes.

I  will  ask the Clerk of Parliament to now distribute  a

table (Cols. 2981-2).



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030901/20030901-HA-0762981.htm">Adequacy of CPF  at  30% CPF Contribution Rate (2981 - 2982)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a useful table as it gives a helicopter view

of how our current CPF system provides for various needs.

I  have  kept it simple and I want to focus  on  it.   It

gives  a  helicopter view of how our current  CPF  system

helps meet various social needs.  I would like us to  pay

attention

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2920</b></font><br><br>

also  to the quantities in the various accounts, in other

words,  the Ordinary, Special and Medisave Accounts.   In

these  two  columns  I have put the  25th  and  the  50th

percentile worker to illustrate, but we should just focus

on  the  25th percentile worker.  The 50th percentile  is

for  Members' reference.  As the table shows, for a  25th

percentile  worker with a starting pay of $1,100  and  an

ending  pay  of  $1,000,  we  factored  in  a  number  of

assumptions,  including wage deflation plus some  periods

of  disruptive  unemployment -  this  is  not  continuous

employment  -  that  25th percentile  worker  would  have

accrued   $109,000  in  his  Ordinary  Account,  Medisave

Account of $41,000 and a Special Account of $55,000.   So

as  this  table  shows, even at the 25th percentile,  the

wage  earner can own a 4-room flat if he chooses.  I have

put  the price range for the 4-room flat in the footnote.

On  top  of  that, he would have accrued  enough  in  his

lifetime  and set aside adequately for his basic  medical

and retirement expenses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Members of Parliament that we should

set  our  CPF scheme to cater to basic needs, not frills.

The Minimum Sum must be linked to anticipated consumption

and  life expectancy.  So even at the new Minimum Sum  of

$60,000  cash component, the annuity payout per month  to

last for 18 years is $433.  It is not a princely sum  and

we are not over-providing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But note, as some Members pointed out, that if

consumption  for  medical  expenses  from  the   Medisave

Account  is reduced or if a member chooses to live  in  a

smaller  flat, even if he could afford to  buy  a  bigger

one,  substantial spillover can result into  the  Special

Account.   The  key  column is to look  at  the  Medisave

Account  and  the Special Account.  In other words,  even

with  our rules changed, if he does not consume from  the

Medisave Account, the 25th percentile worker could  still

withdraw  $11,000 at age 55, having put aside enough  for

his   Medisave  and  Special  Accounts.   He  would  have

enhanced his Special Account, so more can be withdrawn at

age 55 if the Minimum Sum and the Medisave

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2921</b></font><br><br>



Minimum  Sum  are met.  This is a sensible  system  which

caters  to  the  majority  of Singaporeans  with  varying

consumption  patterns.  There is rigidity  for  the  base

requirements  but  there  is flexibility  for  those  who

choose  to be prudent in housing and medical expenditure.

I  disagree  with  Mr  Tan Soo Khoon  that  we  encourage

blatantly people to choose bigger houses.  People did  it

because  they knew that if there was some asset inflation

they  would  reap benefits.  And, in case  we  are  being

misunderstood,  we  have  all  said,  "live  within  your

means".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we help Singaporeans meet these Minimum

Sums,   a   point   which  Mr  Heng   Chee   How   asked.

Structurally,  the  new changes, the  reductions  in  the

Ordinary  Account  and  corresponding  increase  in   the

Special  Account  facilitate this, which  means  that  if

members are sensible in their housing commitments, it  is

likely  that some 80% of future CPF members can meet  the

$120,000  Minimum Sum requirement at a contribution  rate

of  30%.  Let me emphasise that this is not 33%.  This is

at 30%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows then that when we retune the use of the

CPF   towards   the  three  objectives   of   retirement,

healthcare and housing, we should not further expand  the

role  of the CPF to be used for unemployment as suggested

by  Dr  Wang,  or  other  purposes  such  as  starting  a

business,   as   suggested  by   Mr   Chiam   See   Tong.

Nevertheless,  we  can  explore  the  idea  of  voluntary

unemployment savings scheme, as suggested by  Dr  Mohamad

Maliki.

<br><br><i>Providing better for retirement</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have asked for greater returns from

the  accumulated  sums  or  to  obtain  different  income

streams  - points raised by Mr Chew Heng Ching,  Mrs  Lim

Hwee  Hua, Mr Low Thia Khiang, Dr Ong Seh Hong and Mr  Ng

Ser  Miang  - I agree.  Housing is the biggest asset  for

most   Singaporeans  and  the  Minister   has   announced

relaxation on rental rules and it should help.   We  have

explored   reverse  mortgages  before,  but   the   major

roadblock  has  been that insurers are only  prepared  to

offer "fixed term" reverse mortgage.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2922</b></font><br><br>



This  runs the risk of the elderly lessees being  evicted

from  their flats should they outlive the tenure of their

reverse   mortgages,  which  is  a  likely   possibility.

Nevertheless, we can always revisit the issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other option is for Singaporeans to sell their

properties.   It is an option that is available  to  them

today and it will be made easier with alternative housing

available  in  the increase in rental  flats.   In  other

words,  people  say, "Well, they have more  than  200,000

rental  flats  available.  Why do I  not  sell  and  then

rent?"   They  could.  But do we want  to  actively  push

this?  I am not so sure.  We should be cautious as it may

result  in some being homeless as they sell their  homes.

All  of  us, who have meet-the-people-sessions, know  the

individual  stories  of some parents being  abandoned  by

children whom they have been persuaded to part with their

money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members talked about interest rates. Can CPF

increase interest rates?  The Ordinary Account (OA)  rate

is  currently determined quarterly based on the  weighted

average   of  the  one-year  fixed  deposit   rate   (80%

weightage)  and the savings account rate (20%  weightage)

of  the  three  major local banks.  It  is  a  basket  of

weights.  But we have protected members under the CPF Act

by  subjecting this to a floor at 2.5%.  Let me quote one

example.   DBS  Bank pays only 0.8% for a one-year  fixed

deposit  of  more  than  $50,000 and  0.25%  for  savings

account  deposits.  So, if we use this formula, I  should

be paying OA rate of less than 1%.  Hence, the OA rate of

2.5% gives a better return to CPF members at present.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the Special Account (SA) rate? In this

regard,  CPF  members are getting more than a  fair  deal

because the Special Account guarantees risk-free  at  4%.

One year Singapore Government Treasury bills are yielding

0.9%  whereas 15-year Government bonds have been yielding

less  than  4% for the last 12 months and only  begin  to

yield  more than 4% recently.  So for a person who  makes

SA  contributions  over  a 30-year  period,  the  15-year

Government  bonds are a good benchmark as 15 years  would

represent the average tenure of his savings.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2923</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, the CPF Board is studying two

initiatives.   Firstly, the Government has  already  said

that  in the long term, the interest rates on CPF savings

will have to be pegged to market rates.  We need to study

this  carefully.  What benchmarks to adopt will also have

implications  for HDB housing loans, which are  currently

pegged  at  0.1% above the OA rate.  Whatever  benchmarks

that are adopted must lead to a sustainable interest rate

paid  on CPF savings.  But I agree though that new models

will  have  to be adopted to maximise retirement  returns

for  Singaporeans  so  that we  can  better  provide  for

retirement needs - points raised by Mr Andy Gan, Mr Ahmad

Magad  and  Mr Chew Heng Ching.  In line with  the  ERC's

recommendations, the CPF Board has begun to  explore  the

role of private fund managers to get better efficiencies.

This  was suggested by Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, Ms Irene Ng  and

Mr  Ng  Ser  Miang.  The intention is to pool savings  to

achieve  economies  of scales so  as  to  lower  cost  of

investments  for  members,  achieve  higher  returns  and

greater  certainty of income.  The CPF Board is currently

working  to implement low-cost privately-managed  pension

plans  (PPPs)  as  an  additional option  under  the  CPF

Investment  Scheme.   This would give  members  a  better

chance of higher long-term returns by investing in a well-diversified  portfolio.  These PPPs  should  not  require

members  to make complicated decisions.  In other  words,

we do not envisage a buffet menu.  We will keep it simple

and understandable.  This is to cater to the majority  of

CPF members who are not investment-savvy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with Dr Chong, Mr Ahmad Magad and Ms

Indranee   Rajah   that  the  CPF  Board   must   educate

Singaporeans  as part of its mandate.  The Board  intends

to start a process of investor education for its members,

structured according to a member's life events.  In other

words,  instead of waiting for you to log on to  the  CPF

Board,  we  will  track and push you information  roughly

before your marrying age or before the age that you  will

buy a property or start work, and tell you that these are

the sums that you need to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2924</b></font><br><br>



calculate.   It  flags up.  It causes you to  focus  your

mind  on  a  particular financial aspect.  These  modules

will  be  made available to members through the web.   In

addition,  the  CPF  Board is working with  the  Monetary

Authority  of Singapore as part of an overall  effort  to

educate  investors because our surveys  have  shown  that

while awareness is there, the majority of CPF members are

still  not  taking concrete steps to plan for retirement.

With  the  ageing  population, longer life-span  and  the

retuning  of  the CPF, it is now even more important  for

Singaporeans to take retirement planning seriously.  This

includes  the  promotion of the use of the  Supplementary

Retirement Scheme, as suggested by Mr Ahmad Magad and  Dr

Mohamad Maliki.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For specific groups, women and homemakers, suggested

by  Ms Irene Ng, Dr Jennifer Lee and Ms Braema Mathi,  we

will explore ways to improve their retirement adequacy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For part-time and casual workers, the point brought

up  by  Dr  Gan  See  Khem, the  CPF  Board  has  already

implemented the ERC's recommendation to raise  the  floor

for CPF contribution from the earlier threshold range  of

$200-$363 to a new threshold range of $500-$750.   But  I

agree  with  Mr Zainudin Nordin that we should facilitate

collection of CPF dues.  The late payments form less than

1%   of  all  accounts,  but  we  can  still  improve  by

collecting  CPF  through  electronic  means.    We   will

expedite this.



<br><br><i>Retaining Jobs, Job Redesign, Placements and Training</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Nithiah Nandan, Dr

Wang Kai Yuen, Mr Heng Chee How, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Mr

Ang  Mong  Seng that we should use these sacrifices  that

workers  have  made to translate to more jobs.   The  CPF

changes will position us well for job creation.   At  the

margins,  it already has positive signals and, again,  we

should  not  diminish our efforts.  For example,  Venture

Corporations  and  Philips  Electronics  Singapore   both

welcome the changes.  Venture Corporations told our staff

that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2925</b></font><br><br>



together  with their efforts to improve their  employees'

capabilities  and  skills, these CPF cuts  will  "give  a

boost  to  migrating more businesses and  investments  to

Singapore".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the meantime, we must redouble our efforts to

place  Singaporeans in jobs.  We have to work  faster  to

develop sectors that Singapore can be competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, all of us must do more to place

Singaporeans  in jobs that are available today  -  points

brought  up by Dr Warren Lee and Mr Ang Mong Seng.   They

said  that we should raise again the importance of  local

workers  being  willing to take menial tasks.   I  agree.

But  we  have also seen good evidence of worker  attitude

changing  in  the past half year.  And I  agree  with  Mr

Nithiah Nandan that not all workers are choosy.  We  must

not  tar  all workers with the same brush.  For instance,

many  cleaning companies have told us that they  can  now

hire locals for cleaning jobs and they do not need to ask

for so many foreign workers.  This is good news.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is much more that we can do. We have come

to a point where MOM goes down to the ground - you should

allow  your  policy  instruments to  do  that  -  but  we

recognise this is a transitionary period and we  want  to

get  a  better  feel of the ground.  During  one  of  our

dialogues, a unionist told me that some Singaporeans dare

not work in hotel kitchens because they feel isolated, as

they  are  the  only  Singaporeans  there,  or  that  the

supervisor is a foreigner and is perceived to be  partial

to  hiring more foreigners.  It is unlikely to  be  true,

but  it  is  a perception.  We must and will break  these

psychological  barriers  down.   My  Ministry  has   been

working   closely  with  the  hotel  sector   to   better

understand  how  to successfully place Singaporeans  into

jobs  in  this  sector which has so many vacancies.   The

hotel  management assures us that they are  committed  to

help  make this happen.  In parallel, I have asked  union

leaders of NTUC unions to get their members to mentor new

workers.   In  other words, let us accept the  insecurity

and the uncertainty.  So, from the over 400,000

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2926</b></font><br><br>



members  that NUTC has, members can perhaps find  mentors

that  stay  in  the  same estate with  the  new  workers,

travel,  eat together in the same company so that  during

the earlier adjustment period, it will tide them over and

help them to stay in the job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, yes, we should improve the efficiency of job

matching   and  information  provision.   The   Workforce

Development  Agency (WDA) will be launched soon  to  give

this  greater focus.  As suggested by Mr Seng Han  Thong,

we   will  have  to  make  sure  that  training  is  more

effective.   And I agree with Dr Tan Cheng Bock  that  we

have  to  upgrade our skills in our construction,  retail

and restaurants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have asked that we look for solutions,

in  terms of social safety net in force.  But when we are

in  a  situation where there are large numbers of foreign

workers and jobs available that Singaporeans do not  want

to take, I believe that we should focus on the message of

getting people into jobs, not subsidising people for  not

working.  And the measures that DPM announced on  Friday,

such  as  the Training for Employment scheme, the People-for-Jobs   Traineeship  Programme,  the  Work  Assistance

Programme, hold to this philosophy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree also that employers must play their part.

And  I  am  glad  that the Singapore National  Employers'

Federation  and  the Singapore Business  Federation  have

come  out  in  strong  support for these  cuts.   We  all

understand that the business climate is competitive.  But

there  are  many employers that we have come across  that

are  competitive and, yet, treat their workers well.   As

Mr  Ahmad  Khalis says, retrenchment should be minimised.

There   should  be  less  discrimination  against   older

workers,  a point raised by Mr Nithiah Nandan.  The  cost

of  hiring mature workers would be less because of  these

CPF  changes, and older workers bring value through their

experience and networking.  They are also likely to  stay

longer on their jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have good employers in Singapore. You may have

read  about  Murata Singapore.  It has been in  Singapore

for over 30

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2927</b></font><br><br>



years.   I  visited them at the National  Day  Observance

Ceremony  and  they  told me they had  not  retrenched  a

single worker for the last 30 years.  I thought they  got

it  wrong.  I asked, "Are you sure?"  They said, "Yah, we

don't.  We have not retrenched a single worker."  So,  in

good  times,  a  company rewards the  workers  well  with

additional  bonuses.   But  in  bad  times,  they  adjust

various flexible schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema Mathi brought up a point about United

Parcel  Services (UPS).  And she is right.  It is a  good

company with enlightened human resource practices.   UPS,

led  by  Singaporean  Managing Director,  Mary  Yeo,  has

encouraged    multi-tasking   and    emphasised    career

development for their van drivers.  During SARS,  workers

willingly worked flexible hours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon has highlighted that we should

tailor  our solutions for older workers to upgrade  their

skills  and  find jobs.  We agree.  Companies  must  play

their  part to accommodate older workers who may be  able

to do the job very well.  One HR manager told us that her

company  had  problems with production  in  some  of  the

plants.   This  is  on a productivity  issue.   But  this

observant  HR  manager noted that workers  were  standing

because  of the height of the production line,  and  that

shorter workers had difficulty doing the work because the

line  was  too high for them.  Minor adjustment  was  all

that  was  needed  to  raise productivity.   This  sounds

simple,  but simple things are often not done.   So  this

story  should  cheer  Mr Seng Han  Thong  who  called  on

companies to help local workers through job redesign.  We

all agree, and more can be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But apart from wages and jobs, at the end of this

debate, the question that will still remain in our  minds

is:  will Singapore prosper again?  Mr Tan Soo Khoon said

that  the music had died for him in 1998.  Will Singapore

prosper  again?   It  depends.   It  depends  on  whether

Singaporeans  think our way of life is worth  preserving.

It depends if Singaporeans think this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2928</b></font><br><br>



place  is  worth fighting for, not with bullets of  steel

but   with  steely  resolve,  an  innovative  spirit   to

capitalise on our strengths, diligence and determination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Singapore Dream dead? As Mark Twain said,

the news of the demise has been grossly exaggerated.  Far

from  it. This doctor has examined the patient and  found

it  well.   The patient is not sick.  She only  needs  to

shed  a  few  pounds.   Too many  good  years  and  over-indulgence  have  added girth.  Some weight  trimming  is

necessary and may not be bad for overall health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the contribution rate at 30%, the majority

of  Singaporeans can own homes and retire adequately with

their medical and retirement needs taken care of, if they

are   prudent.   As  I  earlier  showed,  even  the  25th

percentile  worker  can still afford a  4-room  flat  and

would have provided enough for his medical and retirement

needs till 80.  How many countries can achieve that?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every child born in Singapore today can be

certain  of 12 years of solid education.  Mr Ong Ah  Heng

joked that perhaps the Government should just kelong  and

give 4-D tickets to Singaporeans.  In fact, we have.  Let

me  tell  you  why.   Every student is  subsidised  about

$4,000  for  each  year  in  primary  school,  $6,000  in

secondary  school,  $8,000  in  ITE,  Junior  College  or

polytechnic, and $11,000 in university.  This means  that

every  child born in Singapore receives at least  $60,000

in  education  subsidies.   This  is  not  including  the

housing  subsidy.  70% will obtain higher education  that

is  the  passport anywhere in the world  to  further  his

study.  Access to good medical care will continue  to  be

available  to  the masses, not only to the privileged  or

the  rich.   Here,  in Singapore, you  walk  the  streets

feeling   much  safer  than  in  many  other   countries.

Children  grow up well here.  We, the adults, spend  half

the  time debating why we spoil them, and the other  half

asking  why  we  stress them.  The same  debate  will  be

continued by our children when they become adults.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I believe so emphatically that Singapore will

not only overcome but

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2929</b></font><br><br>



that we will prosper further?  The music has not stopped.

Because  Singaporeans will not falter.  Years  of  nation

building    have    bonded   a   people    with    unique

characteristics.  Shared pains and gains have  created  a

uniquely Singaporean way, that is, a way of life that  is

worth   preserving   -   with   all   its   quirks    and

eccentricities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Dr Tan Cheng Bock that Singaporean can

do.    His  ingrained  beliefs  in  hard  work,  justice,

integrity  are  universal premiums.  I travel  frequently

and I meet many Presidents of Ivy League universities  in

USA.   They  tell me that there is only one  thing  wrong

with Singaporean students - that there are not enough  of

them.  They say this even though Singapore students  form

the  largest  contingent from any  state,  including  the

states of the United States.  They want more of us.  They

wax  lyrical about how they wish every freshman performed

like  our  Singaporeans.   Of course,  in  typical  Asian

humility,  I  respond  by saying,  "Well,  we  have  some

strengths, but many weaknesses too."  But, inwardly, when

they tell me this, I swell with pride.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CEOs of multi-national corporations here in the

biopharmaceutical and process industry sectors tell  that

we  have  among the best technical workers in the  world.

They  have  one  wish - that Singaporeans would  be  less

driven,  because  many  of them leave  to  further  their

education,  not content to stay still.  But I  like  this

drive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore companies tell us that two positions, when

they  go overseas, must be occupied by Singaporeans,  ie,

the  manager  and  the  financial controller.   Why?   No

prizes  for  those who guess the reason  -  because  they

trust   Singaporeans.   Despite  the  catch-up  of  other

countries,  like China and India, we can still  hold  our

own in technical and engineering skills.  Our efforts  in

educating Singaporeans still stand us in good stead.   Do

not  under-estimate these strengths nor  our  ability  to

read these changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I overly optimistic? Do I not fear the tiger of

globalisation, the challenges that Members paint and  the

companies  tell us?  Well, when a tiger is  chasing  you,

you

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2930</b></font><br><br>



need not be the fastest to survive.  Just run fast enough

so  that  there  is  one other person for  the  tiger  to

satisfy  his  hunger.  We have built up our strengths  in

these  past years to run well.  With these CPF  and  wage

reforms,  we would have further lightened our loads.   We

are well positioned to avoid hazards and pitfalls.  If we

continue  on  this  new road, expand  our  minds  to  see

possibilities   and  capitalise  on  our  strengths   and

opportunities, we will prosper.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> May I seek a

clarification from the Acting Minister?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I refer to the table

distributed  by the Acting Minister.  It shows  that  the

25th percentile of workers should have no problem meeting

their housing, Medisave and retirement needs, at the  CPF

contribution  rate  of  30%.  I  wonder  why  the  Acting

Minister has chosen the 25th percentile of workers, as  I

understand  the  CPF  covers  from  the  20th   to   80th

percentile of workers.  So what is the situation  at  the

lowest  20th  percentile?  Are they able  to  meet  their

needs?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> These calculations hold, which means

that  even at 30%, 85% to 90% of Singaporeans can own  at

least a 3-room flat.  I have just used the 25th and  50th

percentile.   If  I  have  put the  10th,  20th  to  80th

percentile, it will confuse us.  But if the Member  wants

the  details, we can distribute it from every  percentile

at 10 points.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak on  this

topic   of  retuning  the  CPF  pursuant  to  the   Prime

Minister's Ministerial Statement on 28th August.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislative history of the Central Provident Act

dates  back  to the Central Provident Fund  Ordinance  of

1953  (Ordinance 34 of 1953) and it commenced on 1st July

1955.   "Provident" means seeing beforehand and providing

for the future;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2931</b></font><br><br>



being  prudent, thrifty and frugal.  Our CPF Act and  its

predecessor  legislation, during and  prior  to  the  PAP

coming  into  power, have, in some way,  made  compulsory

saving  of citizen's moneys to form the Central Provident

Fund  and out of which authorised payments are made.   On

the  whole, it has brought a great deal of advantages  to

our citizens and working population in Singapore.  It has

also  brought  a large amount of money to our  Government

and,  hopefully, it has been used to invest and reap some

good  returns.  It would be ideal if these,  or  some  of

these  returns,  could be ploughed back  to  CPF  account

holders as a whole.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The website of CPF Board provides that the mission

of  CPF  is "to enable Singaporeans to save for a  secure

retirement".   And its vision is that of  "a  world-class

social  security organisation providing the best national

savings  scheme  for  Singaporeans  to  enjoy  a   secure

retirement".   The emphasis has always been  savings  for

our retirement.  Our Government must guide our people  to

ensure that, as far as possible, the retirement needs  of

the  majority of our citizens would be met.  It would  be

in  the Government's interest to ensure this because,  if

there  is  a  great  shortfall in this  CPF  scheme,  the

Government, being a responsible one, would have  to  lean

towards a more "welfare-oriented" and socialist political

system  which the PAP Government tries to avoid  directly

as far as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corporate philosophy of CPF is, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"a social security savings scheme jointly supported

by  employees, employers and the Government.  CPF members

are employees and self-employed persons in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic purpose of the CPF is to help members meet

primary  needs  like shelter, food, clothing  and  health

services in their old age or when they are no longer able

to  work.  Benefits offered are to help meet one or  more

needs  of the CPF member in his retirement.  They include

withdrawals  by  the  member  for  retirement,  permanent

disablement,  home  ownership  and  medical  care.    The

amounts available depend on how much the member has saved

in the CPF.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Board is the trustee of members' CPF

savings.  They seek to protect and preserve the value

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2932</b></font><br><br>



of  the  savings.   They provide fair market  returns  at

minimal  risk, while opening avenues for members to  seek

higher  returns on their own after carefully  considering

the  risks  involved.  The guiding principle is prudence.

Any  return should contribute towards the member's  well-being in his retirement."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would appear that the above stated

philosophy may need to be modified in difficult  economic

times.   The Prime Minister touched on globalisation  and

how  it  has continued to affect our economy.  There  are

advantages and disadvantages in globalisation.   The  two

giant  nations,  China and India,  with  over  2  billion

people,  are  and will be, population-wise and  business-wise, forces to be reckoned with in the premier league of

nations in the global economic arena.  Singapore can  try

but  realistically would find it very difficult to be  in

the  premier league because, in terms of population  base

and  business  base,  production of goods  and  services,

invention  and  information technology, manufacturing  of

high-end technological products, production of university

scholars,  scientists,  inventors,  engineers,   doctors,

architects  or  any  professional  groupings,   political

leaders  and  tertiary  professors  and,  in  many  other

respects,  touching on economic and other considerations,

it is realistically impossible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Singapore must and will no doubt do its

level  best  to survive comfortably and progress  in  the

face of all the competition from near and far.  And since

we   have   reached  first-world  standard,  economically

speaking,  our  citizenry would expect that  standard  of

living  in the years to come.  Singaporeans would have  a

tough  time trying to aspire to reach this target as  the

years  go  by.   We  have a disciplined  and  hardworking

population that will fight hard to advance as  the  years

go  by.   We  have  a  good  Government,  civil  service,

judiciary, rule of law, caring nation with many voluntary

and  Government-sponsored community of  volunteers.   All

these good institutions have served us well the last  few

decades and will continue to do so.  But is it sufficient

in the future?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should have and must have known all

this was coming many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2933</b></font><br><br>



years  ago.  The citizens knew and constantly talked  and

complained  about the high cost of business in Singapore.

This  is  not  new  at  all.  On hindsight,  perhaps  the

Government  should have acted earlier,  even  before  the

General  Elections in 2001.  At least, we are now  trying

to  make amends.  It is never too late.  Let us all  work

together  as  Singaporeans.  I believe our Government  is

trying hard, but more needs to be done by one and all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary measures require us to be cost-effective.

This means we have to cut down on CPF and all other forms

of cost-cutting measures.  We have to be lean and fit for

a  race that is going to be very competitive for the next

few  years.  CPF cuts alone would not be a great help  in

bringing in more investments from abroad and locally and,

therefore,  more employment for our people.  However,  it

is  a strong signal to the world looking at Singapore, as

a  country to invest in, that our Government is trying to

cut  down  on business costs.  More cost-cutting measures

must  be  put  in place sooner than later.  And  this  is

essential  and  is an emergency, as a lot  of  businesses

from   Singapore  and  the  ASEAN  countries  are   going

especially  to China and India.  And it is well  possible

that there would be even more competition in the business

world,  as  Malaysia and other ASEAN  countries  move  on

progressively to catch up with the rest of the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a race between premier league nations,

Divisions 1, 2 and 3 and amateur teams, with the same set

of  rules  and  there  are no handicaps  given  to  small

nations.   Singapore must find innovative ways to  be  in

the  top league.  How do top premier league players  stay

on  top?  They devise various means, including looking at

the  world's  best  players and managers,  training  them

professionally  and paying them well.  We  also  need  to

look  at  not  just  the  best  companies  and  top-notch

entrepreneurs, but also the potential nations as business

and  economic  partners.  Our Cabinet Ministers  and  top

Government  officials  have to be  much  more  innovative

henceforth and come up with revolutionary ideas, which is

possible  only if they are willing to think  out  of  the

ordinary

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2934</b></font><br><br>



and  long-practised ways of dealing with the business  of

governing  Singapore.   I trust  they  are  looking  into

various  possibilities, as we have a Government  that  is

pragmatic  and  is  a long-term planner.   Citizens  must

assist  in this regard by giving innovative ideas,  which

may  be  idealistic and/or practical.  It is our duty  as

citizens  to help our Government to lead it to the  right

path of progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our mindset and tactics must, if found necessary and

essential,  change  in  order  to  survive  well,  to  be

competitive and to create jobs in Singapore.   We  are  a

small  nation geographically and population-wise.  We  do

not   have  natural  resources.   There  are  a  lot   of

disadvantages in that sense, compared to many nations  in

ASEAN, Asia and the world.  What can we do really?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us think out of the box. Theoretically

speaking,  one  could  therefore  ask  whether  being   a

sovereign  nation called the "Republic of  Singapore"  is

the  ideal state of affairs in, say, 20 or 30 years.  Can

we  survive  as a small nation when ASEAN countries  like

Indonesia,   Malaysia,  the  Philippines,   Vietnam   and

Thailand  are  forging  ahead  at  a  different  pace  of

economic   progress?   They  are  hungry   for   economic

progress,  just  as we were hungry in the  1960s  to  the

1990s,  and  we progressed at a faster pace  during  this

period,  as  we had to survive, which definitely  was  an

added and essential impetus to survive as a young nation.

I am sure we can and will survive as a nation for another

decade  or  two comfortably.  However, would we  want  to

consider,  and do we have a new vision of joining  forces

politically,  geographically and economically  with  some

ASEAN  countries?    Is it possible to work  together  as

ASEAN  neighbours and let us share the  pie  as  a  joint

venture company of nations?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were once part of Malaysia from 1963 to 1965. We

became  a  sovereign republic on 9th August  1965.   What

would  we  have been if we had remained in Malaysia?   We

can only speculate.  Historians should write about it and

explain  to  the  citizenry.  Let us  now  speculate  and

perhaps give deep analytical thought on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2935</b></font><br><br>



having  Singapore, Malaysia and perhaps even  some  other

ASEAN  countries  merge in some form to create  a  United

States  of  South East Asia, if not absolutely,  then  at

least  economically, and all of us in ASEAN work together

and   share  part  of  our  assets,  manpower,  time  and

expertise.   It  is like forming a holding  company,  and

each  participating country being a subsidiary,  and  all

working  together in harmony and all reaping the benefits

of our collective efforts to benefit all as a family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Team effort is what is required to match the premier

league players.  Additionally or alternatively, we should

all put on our thinking caps and consider the possibility

of  joining,  in  an economic sense, the  premier  league

players  like  China and India.  Our closest relationship

as  a  nation to nation is of course Malaysia,  and  then

comes  perhaps  Indonesia.  At first thought,  everything

might seem impossible, what with the history of political

leadership having had their problems, especially  in  the

1960s.   However, today's generation of political leaders

must  bury  the  old differences, even  if  some  of  the

current  leaders  in  Malaysia, Indonesia  and  Singapore

might be related to the older leaders of these countries.

The   business   community  and  citizens  of   Malaysia,

Indonesia and Singapore would, I suspect, want as close a

relationship  as  possible, both in terms  of  political,

economic  and  family ties.  Would it not  be  important,

therefore,  for  the political leaders,  especially  from

these  three countries in ASEAN, to work harder and  more

productively  towards this goal of merger  as  ASEAN  has

existed for more than three decades.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take advantage of the common factors like

race,  language and way of life amongst our peoples.   We

have Malays, Chinese, Indians and Eurasians, just like in

Malaysia  and Indonesia, and also in China and India,  as

far   as   the  Chinese  and  Indians  respectively   are

concerned.   I  know  it  may  be  idealistic  and   even

unrealistic to think of such a possibility today, but  we

sow  the seeds of such thoughts in our young leaders  and

they  have  to  explore all avenues to survive,  and  who

knows

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2936</b></font><br><br>



what  may come out of this way of thinking for our future

generations  of  citizens, who would be  more  global  in

outlook  in the years to come.  Mind you, this  does  not

mean  people who think this way are disloyal but, rather,

I  believe  it  is the citizens who dare to think  boldly

that  would  make  the difference for the  betterment  of

Singapore in 20 or 30 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to survive for the next few decades, we

need  to  open up space - have dual or multi-citizenship,

and  have  multi-national partners  in  business  and  as

nations  doing  business,  and  not  just  companies  and

Government-linked companies.  Politicians need to be more

innovative, just like company directors have for the last

30 years or so.  Companies are going global.  Governments

should consider at least going regional politically.  The

political  system needs to be relooked and a  new  system

adopted for discussion at least.  Our Government has done

well  for  our citizens and the nation for  the  last  40

years.   We need to do much more, and it is going  to  be

more  difficult, because the competition is much  keener.

It is getting more difficult to grow since we are a first-world  nation, and to maintain that in the midst of  keen

competition is going to be that much tougher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 6 of the Constitution of Singapore states

that  there  shall be no surrender of the sovereignty  of

Singapore as an independent nation unless it is supported

at  a national referendum by not less than two-thirds  of

the citizens who can vote.  Academically speaking, for  a

start,  we  may  wish to consider this in  the  long-term

remaking of Singapore.  If the Government has not thought

about it, or has done so but it is of the view that it is

definitely not possible to have such thoughts to come  to

reality,  I would urge that we get the reasoned paper  on

why  it is not possible in the long term.  I know the CPF

issue  is in the spotlight, but what I have mentioned  is

food  for  thought  to  try and, hopefully,  resolve  our

larger  problem of survival economically as a nation.   I

suppose  these must, for the time being, be  left  aside,

but  I  do sincerely hope that our Government and leaders

in the business and academic community would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2937</b></font><br><br>



address these issues at some stage in the near future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now, let us all unite and come up with cost-effective measures to ensure creation of more jobs and

secure reasonable remuneration and contribution into  our

citizens'  CPF,  so that all retirement  needs,  payments

like housing and medical care, can be met.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally important, sacrifices must be made by the

State,   Government   and  civil   service   expenditure,

cooperation from banks and financial institutions, to  be

more compassionate and not to exercise their legal rights

without some care and concern for the plight of citizens.

The lifelines to be given by the Government to the poorer

sectors  of our society who may be most hard-hit  by  the

CPF  cuts  are  to be welcome.  This is the usual  "Robin

Hood" approach of taking - some might call it "robbing" - from  the  rich and distributing it to the poor.   It  is

noble and should be palatable to Singapore society  as  a

whole.   However, the Government should, once in a while,

take note of and be caring and compassionate, even if  it

is  to  be  lip service, to the lower-middle  and  middle

class  of  citizens who may be complaining that they  are

often left out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land costs, rentals, utilities charges, GST,

licensing charges, income tax, property tax, etc, must be

reviewed and lowered.  Let the State suffer together with

citizens.  Let us all share in the financial burden.   My

colleagues  in  Parliament have  addressed  these  issues

several times during the last two sittings last week.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Board should also consider investing CPF

monies  wisely  and grant members better interest  rates.

Mr Lee Han Shih, a freelance journalist, had mentioned in

his article in Today on 28th August 2003 that the CPF Act

should  be  amended  so  that members  can  enjoy  higher

interest rates by allowing computation of interest  on  a

daily,  rather than on a monthly basis.  The  CPF  should

look into this and explain why it has not done so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, I am of the view that cost cutting must

cover  a  wider  ambit than CPF cost  cutting  alone.   A

holistic approach

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2938</b></font><br><br>



must  be  taken to reduce business costs.  However,  this

move  to  cut CPF rates at this stage is a good  sign  to

investors to have added confidence to remain here and for

fresh investors to come to invest in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do support the Prime Minister's

call  to  cut  the  CPF  rate in  order  to  create  more

investments in Singapore and more jobs for our citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br>5.12 pm



<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you for the opportunity to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should be applauded for coming out

with  a comprehensive and directed dosage of measures  to

help  those  who  are affected by the adjustment  in  CPF

contributions,  and  also for the additional  package  to

assist businesses, particularly the construction, tourism

and  SMEs.  DPM Lee's announcement, in fact, does address

many of the concerns of the people and businesses.  It is

a reflection of our commitment to look after the interest

of the country and the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures introduced will have very long-term

benefits  for  our workers.  Yes, they  have  to  tighten

their  belts  now, relook their financial  planning,  but

their  future will be better secured.  The measures  will

help  the  workers to stand up and proudly move  forward.

It  is  our policy to teach and equip a man to catch  his

own  fish, rather than to give him fish every day and  he

does not know how to fish.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are a few concerns on the Work

Assistance Programme for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2939</b></font><br><br>



the   unemployed,  and  the  People-for-Jobs  Traineeship

Programme  for  older  workers.   Many  do  have   family

problems  that come along with unemployment for a  period

of time, eg, family violence, potential legal proceedings

for  traffic  and parking fines, credit cards,  utilities

bills,  or  even bankruptcy suits.  We need more  than  a

case  manager  to  assist the unemployed  and  the  older

workers.   We  need  a comprehensive  network  of  social

services  to  deal  with  these family  matters.   And  I

suggest  that the localised Family Service Centres,  with

the  support  of the CDCs, work together  with  the  case

manager   to  extend  professional  guidance   to   these

families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, these schemes should also look into

providing additional financial schemes during the  period

of  training.   For  example, get them  involved  in  the

child/student  care  financial assistance  scheme,  where

they  can  put  their children in the child/student  care

centres,  and  parents would be more willing  to  go  for

skills  upgrading knowing that their children  are  taken

care of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the setting up of the Public Transport Funds

for   the   lower-income  families,  I  would  urge   the

Government  and NTUC to extend this help to the  marginal

groups of families which hover between the low and middle

income.   I  have in mind especially the cases where  the

breadwinners  are  in the older age group  and  they  are

hardest  hit by the CPF adjustment.  These families  tend

to  have  children in the teenage group, where  they  are

socially active and need public transport to move around,

and  many  of  these  families have  also  supported  the

Government's  call to have more than  two  children.   We

sincerely  hope that the qualifying family  income  level

eligible   for   the   transport   fund   assistance   be

realistically  set to readily help those who  need  help,

rather than by an exception to the prescribed guidelines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Government's help for businesses by extending

the statutory lifespan of omnibuses and taxis, may I also

ask the DPM to consider extending the 10-year

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2940</b></font><br><br>



cap  for  motorcars to 12 years so that  the  man-in-the-street  need not scrap his car within a short  period  of

time.   Often, Singaporeans take good care of their  cars

and   with  improved  technology,  the  cars  are   still

roadworthy  after 10 years.  It is an argument  that  DPM

has  used for the extension of the lifespan of buses  and

taxis.   It  is  a waste to have to scrap  the  cars.   A

change  in  this 10-year cap will help many  people,  who

need  a car for their businesses and work.  This has also

been thoroughly argued by Mr Tan Soo Khoon earlier on the

high cost of owning a car.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly pleased to note that the

Government  is setting up a Cut Waste Panel.   A  lot  of

Members  have said why not a No Waste Panel.   I  believe

that  the  coverage  extends to  the  civil  service  and

statutory  boards.  Government Ministries  and  statutory

boards  should  not lose sight of their basic  objective,

that is, what is their mission.  Their task is to provide

a very noble service, ie, to provide public service at an

effective cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One arena is the development cost of public offices,

which  includes the buildings, fixtures and  fittings  to

house  the  Government  offices  and  the  other  is  the

operating  and  running  costs.  "The  Seven  Wonders  of

Singapore" were stated by Mr Tan Soo Khoon in this  House

before  and  we  have  to ask:  can an  efficient  public

service be delivered without spending millions of dollars

on  buildings,  fixtures  and fittings  in  the  offices?

Looking at our Government offices now, many are in first-class  buildings,  with extensive glass curtain  walling,

granites  and  marbles,  with  high-grade  fixtures   and

fittings.  They cost millions of dollars  to  build,  and

they  have  to  spend  just as  much  to  maintain  these

dazzling glasses, marbles and granites.  It is not to say

that  Government and its related agencies must always  be

housed  in  run-down looking buildings.   By  all  means,

progress   and   advance  by  having  modern   Government

buildings, but this should not be extravagant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Thursday, while waiting for DPM Lee to arrive

at Dhoby Ghaut station in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2941</b></font><br><br>



the  NEL  train,  I was marvelling at a five-storey  high

glass  atrium  and was wondering if the atrium  had  been

lowered, would it help lower the charges of the NEL fare?

We  can have brilliantly sculptured stations, but if they

cause  transport cost to go up, it would leave  commuters

with  a painful souvenir.  Remember also there is a  high

depreciation cost for all this infrastructure  which  has

to be paid annually.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important thing to remember is practicability.

Does  it  make  sense?   Look at  the  Corrupt  Practices

Investigation  Bureau. It is doing  an  effective  public

service  but  it  is humbly housed in a  recycled  school

building in Cantonment Road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can these development costs be made more transparent

for the public?  I was searching through the HDB's annual

reports for the current construction cost of HDB flats to

ascertain  a  feedback given to me that the  construction

cost  of a HDB flat has risen from about $40,000  in  the

1990s  to  about $80,000 now.  But I could not  ascertain

the  cost from the annual reports. These are cost figures

that  the Cut Waste Panel should regularly monitor.   HDB

should also go back to the drawing board and ask what  is

its  basic  function.  If its role is  to  provide  good,

quality public housing, then do so. Do not try to compete

with the public sector and incorporate luxury into public

housing.  We have just recently debated in this House and

spent  time  asking why the tempered glass shower  screen

cracks  but we still have no answer. We cannot  beat  the

private sector, because the prices are different  and  it

is  also  for a different target market.  Worse, we  give

luxury  that  is not luxurious, and the new  flat  owners

hack out what we give and replace them. It is a waste  of

public funds.  It only raises the cost of housing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Government department must look into how it has

to  manage its budget by cutting wastage, job enlargement

or   simplifying  procedures.    Do  not  look  for  easy

solutions,  for example, like closing down  the  swimming

pool  because  you  cannot  cover  overheads,  especially

during the SARS epidemic, or argue on the basis

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2942</b></font><br><br>



that  there  was  no  crowd, or intending  to  raise  the

entrance  fees  for use of sports facilities  because  of

smaller  Government grants.  This intention to raise  the

entrance fees has been passionately argued by Mr  Ong  Ah

Heng  just now. The questions are:  have you given enough

publicity before you act?  Did you carry out sufficiently

good programmes to attract the crowd?  Maybe, MCDS should

adopt  Mr Ong Ah Heng's suggestion to co-use the pool  by

fish and man.  There may be no need for the change of use

because  it  is  a co-location.  It does  not  mean  that

because  the  swimming pool has been in existence  for  a

long  time  and the people are aware of the existence  of

the  programmes that they are running.  Passing on  costs

or  making up for the shortfall in income by reducing the

service  and  squeezing the public  is  not  the  way  to

deliver  public service.  I sincerely hope that  the  end

result  would not also be the ultimate Cut Waste  Panel's

review  result  too.   Please  do  not  give  our  people

additional pills to swallow for the provision  of  public

service, especially in this hard adjustment period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition is good in business and society. We all

know that. It is meant to encourage efficiency and keep a

check on prices.  But sometimes competition can also have

its  bitter  pill.   Take  the  case  of  the  healthcare

services  in  Singapore. We have competing  groups,  each

jealously guiding its own turf.  The result is that  each

group  has  to  invest  heavily  on  infrastructure   and

equipment  when, in fact, it would have been  more  cost-effective if these expensive high-tech equipment could be

commonly  shared.   Take,  for example,  if  SGH  has  an

expensive specialist equipment, patients who are  in  NUH

cannot  benefit from it because of the cluster.  So,  NUH

has to duplicate SGH and buy its own equipment.  This  is

another  area where the Cut Waste Panel could look  into.

Service  in public health must not be allowed  to  suffer

because  of competition.  This feedback is given  by  the

medical profession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second example is the running of the NEL line.

Yes,  we wanted competition for the operation of the  MRT

lines.  Has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2943</b></font><br><br>



the   competition  brought  in  lower  cost  and   better

transport  service for the people?  Where is the  benefit

of the integration of the bus and MRT lines?  Is there no

such  thing  as affordable fare after we have  privatised

our  transport  services?   Do  we  need  more  transport

companies  for  competition or should we  revert  to  one

company for the train and another company for the buses?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this review is not under the Cut Waste Panel,

maybe  another committee should be set up to review  this

basic  infrastructure on competitiveness  of  our  public

services   that  are  no  longer  considered   as   state

provisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud the Government on the early release of

infrastructure projects to boost the construction sector.

However,  on  productivity, the construction sector  must

seriously  look  into  how  their  productivity  can   be

improved.  Where are they lacking compared with developed

countries?   Why?   How can these be improved?   We  have

also  seen  some local construction companies going  bust

doing  Government infrastructure projects.  Why?  Are  we

administering the contract effectively?  Have  our  civil

servants been too kiasu and added to the latent cost?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad that Minister Mah had informed the

House  that  BCA  is  looking at  improving  the  payment

procedures to the contractors doing public sector  works,

including the progress payments, the variation orders and

reviewing   the   withholding  payments  for   liquidated

damages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been told of this by two contractors

consecutively.  A contractor is required to  prepare  for

at  least  three to four, and sometimes five, inspections

in the course of handing over a completed HDB project.  I

understand  that the cost to prepare each  inspection  is

about  $10,000  and  hence  five  inspections  would   be

$50,000.  It was argued by one of the grassroots  leaders

that  this is the latent cost which is not even  an  open

Government administrative cost.  Another example is  that

one minute scratch, which is not a crack, would require a

change of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2944</b></font><br><br>



whole  piece of glass, regardless of the size.   This  is

how costs have escalated!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to examine all these issues and address

them.  The success of our future lies in our hands today.

The  seeds  we plant will germinate and grow, for  us  to

harvest on a sunny day.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>5.27 pm

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, thank

you for allowing me to join in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> will be pleased to note that after so

many  of them have spoken and covered so many points,  my

speech  is  now  reduced to a single  point.   Indeed,  I

cannot  even  claim credit for such a  point  for  it  is

phased   in   a   discussion  with  some  young   working

Singaporeans about the CPF changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Inderjit Singh earlier spoke on the need to

make  the CPF more voluntary, both from the point of view

of business and employees.  I also want to echo this call

but  for  the purpose of encouraging Singaporeans  to  be

more independent and responsible for their own future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several of the young people I spoke to were, in

fact, dismayed at the increase in the Minimum Sum and  at

the  abolition of the right to withdraw 50% at 55.   Many

in  fact  said that they have no interest in what happens

when  they are over 70 or 80.  They see the new rules  as

Government's  kiasuism  and some even  suspect  that  the

Government  wants to keep their money longer for  reasons

unknown to them. They argued that if the Government wants

to  cultivate  an  attitude  of  financial  independence,

prudence and entrepreneurship amongst young Singaporeans,

this is not the way to do it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very simply, Sir, these young Singaporeans want a

more flexible CPF system after the Minimum Sums have been

accumulated.  No one objects to the principle behind  the

CPF.  As the Prime Minister

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2945</b></font><br><br>



says, it is our only social safety net. Everyone welcomes

the  DPM's speech on measures to help needy families tide

over the problems caused by the cuts.  But what the young

Singaporean  wants to see is whether he  or  she  can  be

responsible  for  the use of his or her money  after  the

Minimum Sums have been accumulated.  It is suggested that

once the Minimum Sums have been reached, an option should

be  given to the member to either reduce his contribution

rate,  withdraw the sums in excess of the  Minimum  Sums,

whatever  his age, or to choose not to continue with  the

CPF contributions altogether.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some already think that the current rule of

withdrawing 50% at 55 is too restrictive.  They  see  the

current uses allowed as far too restrictive. For example,

it  cannot  be  used  for  starting  a  business  or  for

retraining themselves or educating their children.  As Mr

Inderjit Singh said, they want more discretion on how  to

use their earnings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many young professionals feel this way and I

think they deserve an explanation as to why the rules are

the  way they are.  Otherwise, as one of them said to me,

"Why  stay in Singapore to work where nearly 40% of  your

salary  is not within your control?"  I hope that  as  we

retune   the  CPF  to  be  more  responsive  to  business

conditions  worldwide, we will also tune in  to  be  more

responsive to members' concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the measures introduced to retune the

CPF.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Thank you, Sir, for

allowing me to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Straits Times of 30th August carried an article

by investment guru  Dr Marc Faber, also known as Dr Doom.

The gist of his views is as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Singapore Government should allow firms to

fail and set up new sectors;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A more effective move to reduce cost and

increase competitiveness would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2946</b></font><br><br>



be  to  move  all manufacturing operations  to  low  cost

countries, even at the expense of job losses here;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That it is desirable that wages decline and

that  the price levels in Singapore decline, but he feels

that the Government should not interfere in the market to

cut wages;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That Government intervention in wage levels may

lead  to  unhappiness  and create  an  unfriendly  social

climate  to  the extent that it creates a  bigger  divide

between the have and have nots.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to comment on the longer-term

application of his views.  I am concerned on  his  short-term  do-nothing prescription which may  send  the  wrong

signals to Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is responsible for Singaporeans'

well-being  and  the  country's  progress  and  has  been

proactive  in  charting  Singapore's  path  to  recovery,

cutting   costs   of   doing  business   and   sustaining

Singapore's competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the custodian of a country, if the Government did

nothing  and allow companies to move away at the  expense

of  more  and  more job losses and let  nature  take  its

course,  Singaporeans  are  bound  to  doom.   That   the

Government   should  do  nothing  at  all  is  untenable.

Singapore is a small nation and our cohesiveness  is  our

strength.   The Government is right in setting  the  tone

and  form  for  the longer term perspective  of  our  CPF

system  which  will allow wages and prices to  move  down

and,  ultimately,  to  allow market forces  to  determine

future wage and price levels.  All these are in line with

Government's  effort to re-make Singapore and  to  lessen

direct Government's involvement in the marketplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am more concerned with Dr Faber's observation

that  Government's  intervention in the  wage  debate  is

causing unhappiness and social divide.  While this  is  a

reality not to be taken lightly, I am also happy to  note

that Government has always shown compassion and care to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2947</b></font><br><br>



help  the  weak  and  those who  are  badly  affected  by

economic circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that wage cuts alone are not enough, but the

move  to  retune our CPF is to give the lower income  and

above  40 Singaporeans time to sharpen their capabilities

to ride the global economic landscape.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being in the first world, Singapore and Singaporeans

will  have to increasingly contend with the challenge  of

investments  going  into  cheaper operating  environment,

jobs  being  lost  to another individual  who  is  better

equipped  and  can offer value add contributions  at  the

same or cheaper wage cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in such a flux that the Government has to put

in  place  the path finding process that will  ultimately

give  us the right strategies and formula to continue  to

compete and sustain our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Dr Faber's recommendation that Government

should stay out and not interfere with the wage situation

reminds  me  of  an  article that  I  came  across.   The

article,  written by Adam Cohen, is entitled  "When  life

offers  a  choice between the White Wall  and  the  Brick

Wall".  The story goes this way:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Bartleby, the scrivener, is asked by his boss

to  help with some law-office drudgery, Bartleby says, "I

would prefer not to."  Despite his employer's attempts to

change  his  mind, and to learn his reasons  for  turning

down assignments, Bartleby never says much more.  "Why do

you  refuse?"  his boss asks.  "I would prefer  not  to,"

Bartleby replies placidly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melville wrote Bartleby, the Scrivener 150 years

ago.   This  novel  has  what all great  literature  has:

timelessness, and a depth that allows readers to find new

things when they come back to it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Adam Cohen first read Bartleby, with the 1960's

faintly  lingering  in  the  air,  it  struck  him  as  a

meditation   on   freedom,  against   oppressive   social

structures.  But

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2948</b></font><br><br>



re-reading  it  now, in a world full of bad  options,  it

feels like a cautionary tale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bartleby's approach to life is pure, but untenable:

simply because, even when our choices are bleak, we  have

a duty to make the best ones we can.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grim options offered by Bartleby's office begin

with the views: a white wall "deficient in what landscape

painters  call 'life'", and "a brick wall that offers  at

least, a contrast, if nothing more."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His job of scrivener, since made obsolete by the

Xerox  machine, involves copying legal documents by hand.

When  he is not duplicating other people's words, he  and

his  fellow scriveners are reading their copies  back  to

one another to check for errors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even Bartleby's stodgy boss concedes that it is

"very dull, wearisome, and lethargic" work that to people

with   "sanguine   temperaments"  might  be   "altogether

intolerable."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, Bartleby completes his assignments

energetically.  But before long, when his boss  asks  for

help  with a small legal document, Bartleby responds with

the  phrase that will become his mantra,  "I would prefer

not  to." Before long, he refuses to leave the office  at

all,  and  starts to make it his home.  Rather than  fire

his  recalcitrant  employee, the  boss  keeps  trying  to

persuade him to get to work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In time, the boss moves his law firm out of the

offices that Bartleby haunts day and night.  When  a  new

lawyer moves in, Bartleby is taken away to the Tombs, New

York's aptly named prison.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bartleby continues his calm resistance there by

refusing the food.  "I prefer not to dine," he tells  the

cook.  His passivity eventually kills him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the story of Bartleby truly reflects the

essence  of our times.  In this globalised economy  where

change  is  the  only  certainty,  Singaporeans  must  be

responsive and be flexible, as that is the only  path  to

survival.  To remain apathetic and do

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2949</b></font><br><br>



nothing, as Bartleby did and as Dr Doom prescribed, would

be  like  the  contented  frog  who  dozed  off  and  was

eventually boiled to death, that DPM Lee spoke about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this impending change and high unemployment

situation,  Singaporeans  and Singaporean  companies  can

either do nothing or make good of the opportunities  that

the Government is offering on a platter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's world of bleak alternatives, Bartleby's

story  is a sobering reminder that what life requires  is

remaining  engaged, ie, preferring and  acting  on  those

preferences.  Contemplating Bartleby's sad end  may  give

us  some strength, as we continue to stand up for painful

policy  options  and settle for long-term  victories  and

vote for the lesser of the two, or more, pains.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this light that proactive organisations

took upon themselves to engage in the developments around

us.   Therefore, the likes of SIA and many others carried

out  a review of their operations to better sharpen their

competitiveness,   and  the  review   was   premised   on

restructuring  for  relevance and  performance.   In  the

process,  redundancy arose.  However,  every  effort  was

made to compensate and reskill the excess employees to be

employable again.  This, I know, was well managed by  SIA

and the likes of HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to share that, generally, the state of

human  resource  and  industrial  relation  practices  in

Singapore  is above global average index.  If IR  and  HR

practices are deemed responsible for the stories we hear,

it  is because the story is often told half truth, or  is

half told.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I ask to be excused for my impertinence to cite

this example as an illustration.  If I were to say that I

saw  Mayor  Heng Chee How at Desker Road last  night,  it

tells  one story.  But if I were to go on to say that  he

was  at  Desker Road last night carrying out his duty  as

Mayor  of Central CDC where Jalan Besar happens  to  fall

under, and he was there to check out on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2950</b></font><br><br>



certain  complaints, it tells another story.  So,  it  is

important to tell the whole truth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our vision is to create a future where

Singapore,  embedding the physical, intellectual,  social

and spiritual spheres, continues to remain attractive  to

stakeholders.  These stakeholders include the  investors,

talents, both local and foreign, as well as the  old  and

the   young  in  this  multi-religious  and  multi-racial

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's tenacious job is the ability to

balance  the  Chinese weighing scale.  Pull it  one  side

higher  and tip down the other side, you upset  those  on

the bottom of the scale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this whole debate of making it affordable for

businesses    and    possible   for    the    Singaporean

competitiveness,  the  Government has  shown  its  astute

capability  of striking a balance and, more  importantly,

its compassion and humane touch.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The announcement by DPM Lee of the other cost saving

measures   that  the  Government  will  embark   on,   in

particular,  cost of doing business with the  Government,

has   reinforced  the  gotong-royong  spirit   that   all

stakeholders must possess.  He has also driven  home  the

message that it is through thick and thin that we will go

through  together as a team.  And I agree  here  that  we

should  extend beyond pre-emptive lay-off to  pre-emptive

motivation that DPM Tony Tan spoke about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Sir, I would like to make some

observations  with  regard to the CPF  retuning  and  the

relief  package and urge the Government to  do  more  for

Singaporeans, especially the PMETs.  Sir,  I  have  asked

for  permission  to distribute a table to  illustrate  my

point.  [Copies of Table distributed to hon. Members.]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Goh spoke of the PMETs who constitute

43%  of  the retrenched employees.  They seem to  be  the

more  vulnerable group and, for the above 40s, they  also

take a longer time to be re-employed.  By and large,  the

above  40s  PMETs are the ones who would  be  financially

squeezed  with prospect of no or lesser CPF contributions

to service their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2951</b></font><br><br>



mortgages  and other mid-life commitments.  The  retuning

exercise  will hit this group most drastically and  hence

they are deserving of help.  The illustration that ensues

explains clearly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a person aged above 50 but below 55 now, the

effective  CPF  cut is 3% per year over  the  next  three

years.  However, a person who is 48 years old now and  on

reaching  the  age of 51, will see a 6%  cut  in  CPF  on

reaching  51  years of age.  Sir, this group  at  48  and

below will face a double whammy when they reach age 51.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has put in place various relief

packages  and  assistance schemes for  the  lower  income

groups.   It demonstrates PM Goh's and DPM Lee's promises

to  assist every Singaporean affected by this major  wage

restructuring process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about Singaporeans from the professionals,

managers,  executives and technical  group  (PMETs)  with

salary  ranging from $3,000 to $6,000?  This  cohort  has

been  growing since the shift in our economy  to  a  more

knowledge-based  one.  The feedback  from  many  in  this

group  is,  "Why  are we always left out?   Many  of  the

schemes are targeted at the lower income groups.  We  are

the new poor Singaporeans."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From experience, we know that this group is capable

of  making short-term lifestyle adjustments according  to

their  individual  financial  circumstances.   They  have

managed  and weathered well in the past financial  crisis

without  much  help, living largely from  their  savings.

This   time  the  circumstances  surrounding   them   are

different.  Like all other major economies in the  world,

jobs are lost to comparatively lower cost countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree that professionals, managers, executives,

even  businessmen and the self-employed  should  be  more

capable  of  taking care of themselves.  Nonetheless,  we

have  to take cognisance of this difference from previous

downturns   this   time   round.    What   recourse    do

professionals,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2952</b></font><br><br>



managers, executives, businessmen and self-employed  have

besides seeing their MPs to pour out their predicament?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the relief package is clear on schemes such as

WAP  to  assist the lower income group but silent on  its

eligibility  for  PMETs in similar plight  as  the  lower

income  group. The PMETs, mostly in their  40s  and  50s,

constitute  a  substantial segment of the workforce,  and

the  remote chance of reemployment in the next  6  to  12

months  spell anxiety and despair for many  of  them.   I

urge  the  Government to spare them  a  second  look  and

specify  how  they  can be helped and consider  extending

assistance schemes to the more deserving ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also urge for more assistance to be extended to

not-for-profit outfits, like SPEC, that was the first  to

champion  the  cause of PMEBS when it  first  encountered

symptoms  of  their  challenges and plights.   SPEC  had,

since   1997,   been   engaged   in   facilitating    the

employability  and  addressing  the  concerns  of  PMEBS,

together with MOM.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the several schemes announced by DPM Lee, there

is only one that has direct bearing on PMETs, and that is

the   People-for-Jobs  Traineeship  Programme.   For  the

others, it is unclear how PMETs can benefit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another scheme that throws hope for the PMEBS

is  the  $90  million International Enterprise  Incentive

Scheme  to  help  Singaporean businesses venture  abroad.

These  businesses  would need expertise  and  experienced

PMEBS.   I would like to urge the SMEs, together with  IE

Singapore and the SWDA, to explore jointly setting  up  a

scheme to encourage and facilitate the employment of  the

unemployed PMEBS in these operations overseas or locally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the SMEs, I understand that many of our GLCs

are  also  considering investments in overseas operations

and  I  urge  that they too would draw  on  the  pool  of

unemployed PMETs for their overseas operations.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2953</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this scheme could be like the Training for

Employment Scheme (TFES).  As it stands, TFES  is  silent

on  its  applicability  to convert unemployed  PMEBS  for

expert contribution and gainful employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been told that CareerLink at SPEC has a

database of some 5,000 PMETs registered, looking for  job

opportunities, and this could be the starting  point  for

SMEs  and  GLCs to offer jobs and tap on their  expertise

and   experience.    An   important   consideration    is

streamlining and integrating job creation and  employment

opportunities with the relief package and  needs  of  the

SMEs respectively, as well as that of the GLCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the impact of a double-whammy CPF cut for

those  who  reach  51,  gainfully  employed  PMETs,  with

outstanding  mortgage  loans, could  be  sitting  on  two

potentially possible financial time-bombs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first potential financial time-bomb is their job

security  and  pay  package.  If ever  retrenched,  these

PMETs  face the prospect of being unemployed with no  pay

or  re-employed at a lower pay. When that happens,  their

ability  to  service  their  mortgage  and  other  family

commitments  would  be further eroded.   No  doubt,  Sir,

Minister Mah Bow Tan has assured that assistance  schemes

are  available from HDB for mortgagors, but the  fact  is

that the financial ability of these PMETs is eroded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second financial time-bomb is the prospect of

future increase in mortgage rates.  Interest rates are at

their  all-time low and the prospect of increase is real.

Those vulnerable to an increase in mortgage rate would be

those who have maximum financial commitment to a mortgage

loan  based on the current low mortgage rate and  are  at

their best ability to service the loan.  The illustration

that follows clarifies this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, for every 1% increase in mortgage rate,

the home owners who take a 25-year $360,000 mortgage loan

would have to incur an additional monthly cash payment of

about $200 in interest payment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2954</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there may be nothing much that HDB could do

here  except  again  to  further  extend  its  assistance

scheme.   Sir, from these two illustrations, we recognise

that  the financial plight of the PMETs cannot be glossed

over.   Their financial burden would require a bit  of  a

lifting  by extending the scope of some of the assistance

schemes to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government's relief package on accelerating

the  infrastructure projects to the tune of $600  million

is  the  largest  item of the $1 billion package.   Would

this  translate into jobs and more business opportunities

for   Singaporeans?   How  can  the  Government  and  the

relevant agencies ensure that unemployed Singaporeans are

targeted at?  I am encouraged by Minister Mah's assurance

that  many  of  the projects would be eligible  to  local

contractors based on the scale of the projects.  I  would

also  urge  that  for  the bigger  scale  projects  where

foreign  contractors'  expertise is  necessary,  then  we

should  facilitate  a  local partnership  so  that  local

partners will continue to have a place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would be beneficial to put in place a

tracking of the numbers and types of jobs created and  of

the numbers of unemployed Singaporeans taking up the jobs

and  the issues encountered in the process.  This  should

similarly  be  done  for the tourism industry  where  the

Government will be pumping in $100 million in the Tourism

Recovery Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are indeed encouraged by PM's compassion and

understanding  of  the need to restore  the  cut  CPF  to

Singaporeans  during better times.  This is important  as

we must never look at this round's CPF cut as a permanent

cut.   Singaporeans have already accepted the  fact  that

going  back  to  the  40% contribution  rate,  which  the

Government  had  supported in the  past,  is  a  foregone

conclusion.    We   have,   in   our   midst,   realistic

Singaporeans  who are flexible and prepared to  sacrifice

for   the  long  term  good  of  the  country  and   cost

competitiveness of the economy.  Giving up  the  40%  CPF

contribution is a gesture of sacrifice on the part of the

employees.  Keeping to its promise to restore CPF

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2955</b></font><br><br>



to 36%, when in prosperous times, is a commitment that we

must not fail our Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been much talk that there is no longer

trust  and loyalty in organisations today with the  shift

to bottom-line driven objectives.  I would argue that the

pursuit of such commercial objectives does not mean doing

away with loyalty and trust.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am heartened by what DPM Tony Tan has said,

as  reported  in  the newspapers, that  we  should  start

looking at companies like Walmart whose corporate culture

has  bred  trust  and  loyalty.  As MOS  Cedric  Foo  has

reinforced, productivity and preparedness of employers to

review  their  operations  through  work  redesign   will

facilitate  value-add  contributions  of  employees,  and

convince employers to look at their employees as an asset

and not as a cost of doing business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, man sacrifices for his belief when he can see

and   experience  the  trust  and  loyalty.    On   these

fundamentals,  in  the  last  38  years,  our   political

leadership has nurtured a nation that is imbued with  the

motivation to overcome challenges and set ourselves ahead

in every competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore spirit has pulled us through

several  crises in the last 38 years and  we  have  found

that  the formula was going through thick and thin  as  a

team.   I  believe Singaporeans will have the resolve  to

support    the   Government's   move   to   regain    our

competitiveness  through  this  same  formula  of   going

through thick and thin as a team.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trimming the CPF waistline down from 36% is a

healthy  exercise.   And, on this  note,  I  support  the

motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, last week, my

honourable  colleague, Mr Nithiah Nandan,  spoke  of  his

meeting with union members to discuss proposed changes to

CPF.   I  too was at that meeting.  There was  a  general

consensus at the meeting that we need to retune  our  CPF

in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2956</b></font><br><br>



order  to  enhance our competitiveness and to ensure  the

continuing survival of our country.  I need not say  that

the  prospect  of further cuts in our CPF was  no  morale

booster  for the workers and, in fact, after a string  of

bad  news  over the last six months relating to corporate

restructuring, the weak economy, SARS and Iraqi war,  the

proposed changes to the CPF have been seen as yet another

blow in the stomach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, like all good citizens, the workers

understood  the  need  for  these  changes  in  order  to

preserve jobs and to keep the economy going.  I can  feel

the  concerns of the workers at a time like this.   There

is  much uncertainty which hangs around them as there  is

no  guarantee  that reducing CPF contribution  by  3%  is

going to assure them their jobs and future employment.  I

am glad, however, to learn of last week's announcement by

DPM  Lee  of  the  package of measures  to  mitigate  the

harshness  of the proposed reduction to the rate  of  CPF

contribution.  Any form of relief will always be welcomed

at this time and will certainly be appreciated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have always spoken of the need to bond with

the  workers  in  order  to ensure their  commitment  and

loyalty.   This need to bond with the workers is perhaps,

in  part, a reflection of a broader need on our desire to

want to bond the people to the country.  Whether you like

it or not, a reduction in the salary, a restructuring, or

a   retrenchment   exercise  is  always  an   emotionally

traumatic experience for the workers.  If you believe, as

some companies do, in the principle that the employees of

any  organisation are the most important assets, then how

you manage the process of bonding with the people will be

critical to the outcome of the organisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the truth of the matter is that even in this

economic  climate, not all companies are equally affected

by weak economic conditions.  Some have been able to ride

through  this tough time better than others and have,  in

fact,  out-performed themselves in the past.   For  these

companies, I hope that they would not use the  excuse  of

the present CPF restructuring exercise

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2957</b></font><br><br>



to increase their profitability further at the expense of

the  workers.  Such measures are opportunistic and  I  am

sure will be made obvious to the employees in no time.  I

certainly  hope that the employers in this category  will

find a way of ploughing back the savings from the CPF  to

the employees for their benefit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there is another category of

employers  who  are  genuinely suffering.   Although  the

reduction  in CPF contribution cuts across the board  for

all  employees who are CPF account holders, the  question

which  we  have to address is whether or not  more  could

have  been  done by way of cost reduction to ensure  that

that pain is fairly borne by all.  Let me explain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the very high income earners, cutting the CPF by

6% does not matter very much as compared to one who, say,

earns  $1,000 a month.  Our present rule does not require

anyone  to  contribute  that part of  the  salary  beyond

$6,000  into the CPF account.  So if your pay is $30,000,

your  CPF  take-home will be $960 from your employer  and

with a cut of 10%, it will be just $600.  What difference

is  this  $360 to someone who is looking at about $28,000

cash flow a month.  But for a worker who earns  $1,000, a

6%  cut will be quite substantial indeed in terms of cash

flow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I do not expect any regulatory intervention to

lower the salary of these high income earners, it will be

good if companies and managers can take a serious view of

their own salaries and are prepared to voluntarily take a

deeper  cut in order to sustain viability of the  company

and  also the employment of others.  At a time like this,

if  the  workers  can  perceive that their  managers  are

prepared  to bite the bullet with them, and to  take  the

tough  journey  together, then I am very sure  the  bonds

between the managers, the owners and the workers will  be

better  established  and this will  augur  well  for  the

company in the longer term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has spoken of the need to

restructure to face the demands

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2958</b></font><br><br>



of  the changing times.  While I can understand the  need

to   reorganise   to   help   companies   improve   their

profitability, there is a question which  remains  as  to

whether  or not this is a good time to reorganise  public

agencies  that are not similarly motivated  by  the  same

concerns of profitability.  The workers can understand if

Motorola  and Seagate have to lay-off workers  to  remain

competitive  and profitable.  But, at a time  like  this,

when jobs are so scarce, one questions whether or not  it

is appropriate now to trim the size of public agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one hand, we hear the cry of Government for more

jobs to be created in Singapore for the workers, yet,  on

the other hand, I am given to understand that many public

sector   jobs  are  being  made  redundant   because   of

outsourcing.   We have a contradiction on  hand  here,  a

situation of the Government calling for more jobs  to  be

created  and yet, at the same time, have many  Government

agencies outsourcing many of the job functions to others.

This  is  not a problem if these outsourced  jobs  go  to

Singaporeans but, unfortunately, many of these outsourced

jobs go to foreigners in the process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in case you get me wrong, I am not against the

principle of hiring foreigners who can contribute to this

country.   What  I  am saying is the timing  judgment  by

these non-profit oriented public sector organisations  to

undertake restructuring exercise presently, knowing  full

well  how  scarce jobs can be particularly for those  who

are in the middle age group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that these middle-age workers are

the ones who carried the economy on their backs at a time

when  we were industrialising and trying to build up this

country.   It  is to them that we owe our  gratitude  and

these  are  the people whom we must not abandon  in  this

hour of need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, urge the Government that, if

they   are   thinking  of  further  downsizing  involving

redundancies or outsourcing, such plans be  put  on  hold

until such time when the economy and employment situation

have significantly improved.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2959</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Prime Minister's

statement  enunciating  the Government's  policy  on  CPF

changes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  many  Singaporeans are indeed relieved  by  the

light  touch the Prime Minister has applied  to  the  CPF

retuning and also generally pleased with the good dose of

pain  reliever prescribed by DPM Lee.  It seems that  the

Cabinet  has  taken note of the anxieties at  the  ground

when  the subject of CPF retuning was first broached  and

offered  a  finely balanced policy package.   While  some

analysts  have expressed disappointment that the  changes

do  not  go far enough to cut costs and bring in  or,  at

least, retain investments and jobs, the social dimensions

of the CPF retuning must not be forgotten.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before commenting on the details of the CPF changes

and the aid package, I would like to comment more broadly

on  our  wage  cost.   After all, an  uncompetitive  wage

structure  has been identified by the Government  as  the

key reason for the current changes to the CPF system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, complaints by local and

foreign  businesses of our high cost  of  doing  business

have  been bandied around for some time now.  As DPM  Lee

reminded us, back in 1985, CPF rates were seen as one  of

the  main  culprits  for our economic  predicament  then.

Eighteen years on, the Government has again named it as a

major source of our economic woes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM Tan recently brought to attention a PERC report

dated  2nd  July  2003 on "Comparing  Business  Costs  in

Asia".   In  this report, Singapore is not only perceived

to  rank as the fourth highest labour cost country  among

the  expatriates surveyed, its labour cost is also  rated

higher  than  those of Australia and  US,  which  is  the

largest and strongest economy in the world.  To quote DPM

Tan, ". When according to PERC's calculations, it is more

expensive  to hire a worker in Singapore as  compared  to

hiring a similar

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2960</b></font><br><br>



worker  in the US, or Australia, we have a major economic

problem."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given PERC's high standing in international circles,

I  have  no reason to doubt that their conclusions  would

likely  bear  up to MOM's scrutiny.  But, for  this  very

reason,  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am deeply troubled  by

this  latest revelation.  This is so even though Minister

Lim  Boon Heng has clarified in his speech on 29th August

that,   according  to  the  IMD's  World  Competitiveness

Yearbook  2003,  it is in specific managerial,  executive

and  professional jobs in engineering and human resource,

etc,  and  not manufacturing itself where the Singaporean

worker's wages are comparable to first world levels,  but

without the corresponding levels of productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question troubling me, and I am sure many

others,  is: does the Government not keep close track  of

our   labour  costs  in  comparison  with  those  of  our

international competitors in order to ensure that  we  do

not price ourselves out of the market?  To reiterate, was

not  high  labour  cost one of the chief  causes  of  our

recession in 1985/1986?  To quote Prime Minister  Goh  in

1986,  when  he was then First Deputy Prime Minister,  he

had  said  during the debate on the Presidential  Address

regarding  a  cut in the CPF contribution  that  ".  When

confronted with the sobering thought that our wage  costs

are  so  high that we are going to lose our international

competitiveness,  we  have no  choice  but  to  thaw  our

position."   The position then DPM Goh was referring  was

the  sacred cow of our high CPF contribution rates.  Sir,

history seems to have come one full circle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it that we have now, 18 years later, come to

this  belated  conclusion that CPF is  the  same  culprit

causing  mischief, so much so that we need again to  take

such  drastic  measures  as to cut  CPF  rates?   Sir,  I

appreciate  DPM  Lee's  explanation  as  to  how   events

unfolded  so quickly and unexpectedly that the Government

had  to agonise over the decision for two months, and led

to  a  major  rethink.  Nonetheless, Sir, I believe  that

wages  and  wage levels do not change overnight  and  the

levels

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2961</b></font><br><br>



we  are  at  today  not only reflect  the  good  economic

conditions  of  the  past but also  the  consequences  of

previous actions and policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I and, no doubt, many other Singaporeans would

like to know how the Government keeps track or intends to

keep  track  of Singapore's labour costs to  ensure  that

these are not out of sync with our competitors.  Does not

the  National  Wages Council also have such  information?

How else would it make recommendations about wages if the

Council  does not have access to such information?   This

is  especially important in Singapore as, over the years,

the  pervasive  civil service and statutory  boards'  pay

structure has become the barometer of wage levels for the

private  sector.  The private sector has to compete  with

the  public sector for employees and can only attract the

best talent, all else being equal, if they pay comparable

salaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, Sir, I urge the Government to keep a

close  watch  on our wage and other costs to ensure  that

Singapore  remains competitive, if this  is  not  already

being   done.    Better  still,  MOM  can  publish   this

information  for our workers at different levels  and  in

key  sectors (as some HR and recruitment agencies do  and

as  what  MOH plans to do for health costs) so that  they

are  aware  of  how we fare against the competition.   In

supplying  such information periodically,  MOM  would  be

able   to  moderate  the  unions'  and  workers'   salary

expectations.  We can then avoid having to jam our brakes

suddenly  again  in  future and throw everyone  else  off

balance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I will comment briefly on three points related

to  implications  and  concerns of CPF  changes  and  the

relief  package.  Firstly, the floating CPF rate.   Using

the CPF as a macro-economic cost cutting tool is not new,

as  this  was  first done in the 1985/1986 recession  and

then,  again,  in 1999.  What is different this  time  is

that  the Government has decided that the CPF rate  would

be a range, instead of a single target rate.  Although it

gives rise to uncertainties, I concur that this is a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2962</b></font><br><br>



good strategy as it gives more flexibility to our overall

wage  system.  After all, the mantra for success in  this

era   of   shifting  global  competition,  fraught   with

uncertainties, must be "Flexibility, Flexibility and more

Flexibility"  -  agility and deftness to  adjust  to  the

rapidly changing circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, analysts, economists and businessmen

have  commented that the CPF rate cuts lagged behind  the

broader  economy.  For instance, by the time the CPF  cut

was  implemented in 1986, the US economy was  already  in

recovery  mode.   This again happened in 1999.   Analysts

noted  that  the market recovery had already started  way

before  the CPF cut was announced in 1998.  Of course,  I

believe  that the Government should never rush into  such

changes, given the many and complex linkages between  CPF

and  the  major  social  needs of  the  population,  like

housing,  healthcare and retirement.  Any tinkering  will

have  ramifications on all of these, in ways  we  may  be

unable to foresee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But notwithstanding this, it is vital that future

adjustments, which PM has noted, will only be  made  when

necessary, should be made as timely as possible,  and  in

this  regard,  inputs from the private  sector,  who  are

closer  to  the  ground,  would  be  helpful.   Like   my

parliamentary colleague, Mr Inderjit Singh,  I  urge  the

Government to pay heed to private sector feedback and not

do so only when a crisis occurs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, in view of this, I would propose that the

Government  look  at  having a  panel  comprising  mostly

private  sector businessmen and economists to review  the

CPF  rates  on  a  periodic basis so  that  it  can  more

accurately  and  in a more timely fashion  determine  the

need  for any rate change.  The CPF Advisory Council  can

then   make  the  appropriate  recommendations   to   the

Government  for  consideration, much like  what  the  NWC

does.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point relates to the aggrieved middle

aged,  middle  income workers.  Sir, as my  parliamentary

colleagues  before me, Mdm Ho and Mr Sin Boon  Ann,  have

noted, the aid package announced by DPM

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2963</b></font><br><br>



Lee,  in  terms  of  utilities rebate,  public  transport

funds,  etc,  would soothe the pain of the  lower  income

earners  and unemployed.  Businesses, particularly  those

in  the  construction, tourism and transport sectors  and

SMEs,  in  general, will also welcome the reprieve.   But

the  group  that will have to bear the brunt of  the  CPF

cuts   are   the  middle  aged,  middle  income  earners,

particularly those aged 50 years and above.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the baby boomer generation who have lived

through the tumultuous 50s and 60s, and who perhaps  have

contributed  the  most to the economic progress  we  have

enjoyed.   But this is also the group who will see  their

CPF  contribution rates fall from 33% to 27% in 2006 with

the possibility of falling even further to 24%.  They are

also  likely  to be the ones with the heaviest  financial

commitments  -  school-going children, some  in  tertiary

institutions, housing mortgage commitments, car loans and

ageing parents taking a bigger and bigger chunk of  their

monthly  budgets,  and  eating into  their  own  Medisave

accounts.  Many could be living in 5-room HDB or  private

properties  and are thus unlikely to have  benefited,  if

any,  from  the  utilities  rebate,  GST  top-up  or  New

Singapore Shares.  Many of them are probably white collar

workers  who  are  also subjected to increasingly  higher

risk  of  retrenchment  if they  have  not  already  been

retrenched.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is small wonder why a recent Straits Times

survey  found that the older Singaporeans aged  45  years

and  above  are  least  confident  about  the  future  of

Singapore.    In  fact,  of  late,  they  are   quite   a

disillusioned  lot,  judging from the  feedback  from  my

residents  and  friends who are in  this  age  group  and

income  level.  As a recent feedback session  participant

lamented,  "Becoming old is becoming a sin in Singapore!"

Thoughts  of migrating also seem to be most acutely  felt

by  this  group of Singaporeans.  With the proceeds  from

selling  their  assets,  they  are  able  to  migrate  to

countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, which  have

a lower cost of living.  In fact, I personally know of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2964</b></font><br><br>



two  of my grassroots volunteers whose wives and children

are  living  in Australia with no thoughts of  returning,

and at least three friends who have recently migrated  to

New  Zealand.   All of them are in the age 45  years  and

above category and are professionals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am pleased that DPM Lee has announced that

older  workers  will get extra when the Government  gives

back surpluses to the people in the future.  This is what

I raised in my Budget speech regarding the ERC's proposed

CPF  changes  in  July 2002 that older workers  be  given

special treatment in the next wealth sharing exercise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this would go some way to mitigate their

anguish  and sense of betrayal many middle-aged,  middle-income  earners are feeling, more tangible and  immediate

measures  should be considered to address their concerns,

help  them cope and lift their spirits.  After  all,  the

proportion  of workers in the 50 to 59 years  age  group,

which  has  been increasing over the years from  9.3%  in

1991 to 14.5% in 2002, is set to increase further as  our

population ages.  This, coupled with the fact that, as at

the end of 2002, professionals, managerial, executive and

technical  staff comprise approximately 42% of the  total

workforce, implies that there is a sizeable middle  aged,

middle class workers category who is bearing the brunt of

the recent wage cut, retrenchment and CPF cut regime.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older worker phenomenon is here to stay, both as

a  demographic reality, and as more and more Singaporeans

are  compelled  to  work beyond 55 to support  their  own

retirement.  As analysts have rightly pointed out,  while

CPF  cuts  hurt  every Singaporean directly,  the  relief

package is targeted, comes with strings attached and  may

not benefit all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to my next and final point, that is,

lowering  costs.   For  the middle  aged,  middle  income

workers,  what  would  be a more concrete  and  effective

relief  would be to try and lower the cost of  living  to

offset the fall in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2965</b></font><br><br>



income  they are currently facing.  Reducing the cost  of

living   is  a  point  which  many  of  my  parliamentary

colleagues  before me have urged the Government  to  look

into.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the latest EIU report, Singapore

remains one of the 15th most expensive cities to live in.

We  are ahead of many highly-regarded cities, like Sydney

and  Melbourne and even several American cities, like  LA

and  San  Francisco as well as Stockholm.    Furthermore,

there  are genuine worries that the Government's plan  to

proceed with the increase in the GST by a further  1%  in

2004  may  raise the cost of living, and  could  even  be

contractionary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am comforted that DPM Lee has announced that the

Ministry  of  Finance has launched a  civil  service-wide

Economy  Drive  to review all discretionary  expenditure.

Furthermore,  the  civil service  strives  to  cut  waste

through  a  Cut  Waste Panel.  While these  are  laudable

efforts in response to calls for the Government to do its

part  to  cut fees and charges, to make a real,  tangible

difference  to  the people on the ground,  these  efforts

must  translate to actual reduction of costs  to  workers

and businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the Government should, in tandem, also review

its fees and charges, such as ERP charges, taxes on cars,

licences  and  even maid levy with a view  to  realigning

them  to  what  would now be tantamount to a  lower  wage

regime.   This would go some way to lowering our cost  of

living and doing business, which would benefit all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate, the current maid levy was set during

a  period of strong wage growth.  Since the CPF cut is de

facto  a  wage cut, the maid levy could be cut in tandem,

even though we all understand the aim of the levy was  to

employ  a  market mechanism to regulate the foreign  maid

population with its attendant social problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example would be for the Government to

further   review  its  vehicle  ownership  policy.    For

instance, one of my

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2966</b></font><br><br>



grassroots recently told me that now only businesses  are

allowed  to buy panel vans.  He says that this is against

the  move to encourage entrepreneurship.  This is because

whilst  registering a company is relatively  inexpensive,

it  is  all  the  attendant  additional  regulations  and

compliance  costs  that come with registering  a  company

that pose a hindrance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I realise that there are major fiscal

implications  if  many statutory charges,  such  as  maid

levy,  etc,  are reduced, and this could well worsen  the

budget  deficit,  but following the  principle  of  equal

misery,  this might well be the price the Government  has

to pay in order to signal its empathy with the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of the measures announced go even beyond

the ERC recommendations which were only released about  a

year  ago.   The mantra then was "re-focusing"  the  CPF.

Now,  it  is "retuning".  What is evident though is  that

the   CPF  is  destined  to  remain  a  major  plank   of

Singapore's social as well as economic policy,  a  sacred

cow  slaughtered,  but  also resurrected  in  a  slightly

modified form.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That some austerity is called for now will inflict

pain  on  the population and even a sense of betrayal  on

the  part  of  workers, especially the  middle  aged  and

middle  income workers, although I must add, a  sense  of

relief  as well that the cut in the CPF rate was  not  as

much as feared.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I fully support these changes which the

Prime  Minister  has announced in order  to  restore  our

competitiveness, I urge the Government to exercise  great

compassion and understanding, and to be sensitive to  the

people's  concern  and feedback.  I  note  that  this  is

precisely   what   has  been  attempted   both   by   the

announcement itself as well as the help package  DPM  Lee

has put to this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore support the changes.

<br>6.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

I  would like this House to revisit the policy set out in

1994 on "asset

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2967</b></font><br><br>



worth"   and   "asset   enhancement"   with   regard   to

"encouragement  of home ownership for Singaporeans".   At

that  time, the emphasis was on enhancing the  assets  of

Singaporeans, increasing their commitment as Singaporeans

and seeking their support for the political, economic and

social  systems which make owning these assets  possible.

Today,  however,  it  would seem that  Singaporeans  will

support  policies on the basis of security of their  jobs

and  on  whether the Government that they have voted  for

will give them peace of mind concerning their present and

future  livelihood,  not on whether they  can  own  their

homes  quickly  or  whether they can  upgrade  to  bigger

homes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, 92% of Singaporeans already own their HDB

flats,  and  Singapore is tops in the world in  terms  of

home   ownership   percentage.   In  the   early   1990s,

Singapore's growth rates were often more than  9%.   This

phenomenon has passed and the expected growth  rates  for

Singapore  will be much lower in the years to  come.   It

would  therefore seem that the 1994 policy  needs  to  be

moderated, especially for young couples.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding DPM Lee's announcement last week

that  encouraging  home ownership remains  a  fundamental

objective of the Government's Public Housing Policy and a

key  purpose of the CPF, I feel that retuning this policy

will  be  timely under our present circumstances.   I  am

suggesting  that  Singaporeans  give  up  this  dream  of

ownership  mentioned earlier by the Acting  Minister  for

Manpower, but I am saying that there is no hurry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is timely for us to look at the following issues

as  examples  where  we should adjust  according  to  our

present  needs  in  addition to what had  been  announced

earlier today by the Minister for National Development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young couples should be able to have the choice of

rental   flats  rather  than  buying  new  flats.    Less

commitment  in  the early days of joining  the  workforce

means greater flexibility in the ability to adapt to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2968</b></font><br><br>



the working environment, which can be very fluid in these

times  of a globalised economy.  They are also less bound

by  commitments  and, therefore, are able  to  take  more

risks,  should  they want to venture out  on  their  own.

This  augurs well, especially amongst our young, for  our

strive  towards being a more entrepreneurial nation.   It

has  been  argued that HDB rental flats are very  heavily

subsidised, and are meant only for those who are in  dire

need.    Those  in  difficulty  should  continue  to   be

subsidised heavily through means testing.  Flats catering

to  the  needs of young families should be made available

for  rental, so that they have that choice of renting HDB

flats until such time when they are more sure-footed with

their  commitments.   Presently,  there  are  only  about

60,000  rental  flats  available, and  there  is  a  long

waiting  period for an allocation.  It would be  good  if

more HDB flats are built to cater to the rental needs  of

young couples.  Moreover, the choice of starting a family

should be encouraged, and this priority for young couples

should be assisted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Singaporeans may have to downgrade now because

they are unable to meet the monthly instalments resulting

from  a reduction in CPF, pay cuts or uncertainty of  job

prospects.   More  than 5,000 families moved  to  smaller

flats  in  2002,  a 23% jump from 2001.   This  trend  is

unlikely  to ease soon when the economic growth  forecast

for this year has been slashed to between 0% and 1%.  The

granting  of  HDB loans to downgraders is not permissible

presently, although the Minister for National Development

said  earlier that his Ministry would consider on a case-by-case  basis  for those in great difficulty.   I  would

like to urge for a change in this HDB policy.  Those  who

want  to  downgrade are being prudent here and should  be

helped.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I feel that it is now time

to  relook and revamp another of our "sacred cows".  Sir,

I  mean  our  Medisave accounts.  In  our  heavily  human

resource-dependent economy, our economic health has to go

hand in hand with good health of our people.  The present

Medisave system, where we save and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2969</b></font><br><br>



pay  as we go, financing for healthcare, is becoming less

adequate to serve our needs, especially when our  society

is   fast  aging  and  people  are  living  longer.    By

retirement  age,  healthcare costs  are  expected  to  be

higher.  Medisave has a low rate of return within the CPF

mechanism   and  has  inadequate  real   growth   to   be

sufficiently available when needed in old age.   We  need

to  make  drastic  changes here  and  now  for  a  better

tomorrow.  Risk pooling in health care finance is a  good

consideration.   Currently, we  have  individual  medical

savings accounts (Medisave) with no risk pooling,  and  a

national    catastrophic   illness    insurance    scheme

(MediShield)   which  covers  prolonged   and   expensive

treatment  which  does  pool  risks  but  minimally.   In

addition,  there  is a complex system of co-payments  and

deductibles, which involves direct out-of-pocket  private

payments.   It  is  timely  to  convert  savings  in  the

Medisave into more risk pooling insurance schemes with co-payments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Japan has achieved the

lowest  infant  mortality  rate  and  the  highest   life

expectancy  in  the world.  Long-term  observers  of  the

Japanese  healthcare  system have  concluded  that  Japan

achieved  these  healthcare outcomes at  a  comparatively

small  price:  "Japan's healthcare system helps  to  keep

its  population  healthy  at an exceptionally  low  cost.

They  rate  the  Japanese system  as  excellent  in  cost

control   and   access,  and  very  good  in   equality."

Universal  health  insurance coverage  has  been  key  in

bringing  about these results.  Japan started its  health

insurance  expansion in 1961.  Today, Japan's  healthcare

system  has  universal  health  insurance  coverage  that

covers the entire population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Health Organisation defines risk pooling

as  "the practice of bringing several risks together  for

insurance  purposes in order to balance the  consequences

of  the realisation of each individual."  Risk pooling is

the  health  system  function, whereby  collected  health

revenues  are  transferred  to purchasing  organisations.

Pooling ensures that the risk related to financing health

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2970</b></font><br><br>



interventions is borne by all the members  of  the  pool,

and  not  by  each  contributor individually.   Its  main

purpose  is to share the financial risks associated  with

health interventions, for which there is uncertain  need.

Risk pooling is required because of the large uncertainty

in the magnitude and timing of an individual's healthcare

expenditure   needs.    It  implies  the   redistributive

functions  from  the healthy to the sick,  and  from  the

productive  to the unproductive stage of the life  cycle.

The  arguments  in favour of risk pooling  in  healthcare

reflect equity and efficiency considerations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Health Report 2000 puts emphasis on the

role  of  government  in terms of  "stewardship"  of  the

health sector.  According to this report, this attractive

vision  of  a far-sighted and public-spirited  regulatory

capacity  is hard to envisage in the absence of a  strong

risk-pooling  function, which is a necessary  one  for  a

wider range of health service functions that we associate

with  developed  health systems, such  as  rising  health

expenditure, demographic change and technical innovation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the role of preventive care and keeping healthy

cannot  be over emphasised in any healthcare issues.   In

our  health  insurance expansion planning therefore  some

incentives  should be incorporated to rally  Singaporeans

towards keeping fit and healthy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue in health insurance expansion is to

also  ensure coverage for Singaporeans when they  are  in

dire  need,  such as when they are without  jobs  and  in

between jobs, in view of our present and future trends of

unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two key features of Japanese healthcare

financing are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, universal coverage that is achieved through

a  multi-tiered insurance system with varying degrees  of

subsidisation   according  to  the   perceived   economic

vulnerability on the part of the population insured; and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2971</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the provider payment side, healthcare

financing  in  Japan  is characterised  by  reimbursement

according to a nationally uniform fee schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the combination of universal coverage with

strict   enforcement  of  the  uniform  fee  schedule   - preventing balance billing, etc - that has been  critical

in  avoiding  some  of  the problems  of  cost  inflation

observed  in  other  countries.  The Japanese  experience

thus   indicates  that  the  main  risks  in   healthcare

insurance,  "incomplete coverage of  the  population  and

rising costs", may be manageable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to conclude that good health

insurance  expansion  encompasses  a  national   coverage

involving the entire population with dependable  coverage

year  after  year, and stable premiums and benefits.   We

should,   therefore,  explore  ways  to   achieve   these

objectives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beseech Prime Minister Goh and Deputy Prime

Minister  Lee to set on this path of embarking on  health

insurance expansion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for

allowing me to speak on the "Retuning of CPF Rates".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Government has decided to lower the

employer's  CPF contribution rate by 3%.  I believe  many

Singaporeans would feel a sense of relief because this is

lower  than the expected 6% cut.  However, some employers

may be disappointed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is whether the 3% reduction is sufficient.

This is like taking antibiotics.  If you need a dosage of

6  ml,  but you take only 3 ml, it is not going to  work.

Whether   the  3%  reduction  is  sufficient  is   really

dependent on what the objective of the adjustment is.  If

it  is just to ease the burden of the businesses so  that

they  can  stay afloat, then the 3% is certainly helpful.

However,  if  the adjustment is to fundamentally  enhance

our national competitiveness, then the answer may not be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2972</b></font><br><br>



that  obvious.   In fact, this may not be a  question  of

numbers after all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate. First, even with the CPF

adjustment,  our wage system remains rigid.  Perhaps,  we

can  take this opportunity to push ahead with fundamental

changes  in  our  wage structure.  Since our  people  are

psychologically  prepared for the 6% adjustment  and  the

actual  reduction is only 3%, is it possible  for  us  to

transfer  the other 3% to the Monthly Variable  Component

(MVC)?  In that way, we can give MVC a headstart.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Prime Minister announced that the long-term target for our CPF contribution rates should be

between 30% and 36%.  By giving it a range rather than  a

fixed  rate  will  undoubtedly give the  Government  more

flexibility.   However, this will  lead  to  uncertainty.

People  will be concerned that the Government may  adjust

the  CPF rates from time to time.  It would therefore  be

difficult  for  the  people and the businessmen  to  make

financial planning.  For example, when the economy  picks

up,  some  employers might not be willing  to  raise  the

salaries  of their employees for fear that the Government

may  raise the CPF contribution rate later.  I  think  it

may be better if we can set a more definite CPF rate, and

allow  the  businesses and the people to make  their  own

adjustments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, some employers are concerned that this 3%

cut  may not be effective. Compared to labour cost in the

developing  countries, this 3% seems to be insignificant.

Obviously, we cannot compare our wage cost with  that  of

China  and  India.  In fact, be it 3% or 6%,  it  is  not

going  to bring our wage cost anywhere near that of these

countries.   The  issue is not about the quantum  of  the

adjustment.   In  fact,  we  should  not  look  at  these

countries  as our competitors but as strategic  partners.

While  they  compete  with us, they  also  offer  us  new

opportunities.  Therefore, I feel that we should  have  a

comprehensive  strategy, not just to lower  our  business

cost, but also to enhance our macro-economic environment.

We must build a strategic network with these economies

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2973</b></font><br><br>



so  that we can play a significant role in their economic

growth.  I believe it is necessary for the Government  to

explain  this strategy to the public, so that the  people

will have more confidence in the Government and will  not

lose heart.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me move on to the relief package. The $1

billion relief package announced by DPM Lee last week was

most reassuring.  It is an indication that the Government

is  aware  of  the difficulties faced by the people,  and

that  it  is  willing to extend a helping  hand  whenever

necessary.  I would like to highlight three areas for the

Government to look into.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, education. Many low-income families may have

difficulties   meeting  the  cost  of  their   children's

education.   Other than the school fees,  other  expenses

such  as books, miscellaneous fees, school bus, uniforms,

etc, can be quite costly too.  I hope that the Government

would  consider providing schools with more bursaries  or

welfare  funds,  and make appropriate adjustment  to  the

qualifying criteria for such subsidies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I believe that the adjustment to the CPF

contribution rate will also result in some savings to the

Government. I hope that the Government can pass  on  some

of  these savings to the people through reduction in  tax

rates and fees.  DPM Lee has confirmed that the GST  will

go  up  as  scheduled next year. Although we are somewhat

disappointed,   we   can  understand   the   Government's

position.   However,  we hope that  the  Government  will

consider  lowering  some  of its  charges,  such  as  the

conservancy and service charges for the HDB flats, so  as

to  send  a  signal to the people that the Government  is

willing  and  prepared to share weal and  woe,  joys  and

sorrows, with the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I am glad to see that the Government has

proposed  a  $600  million  package  to  pump-prime   the

domestic    economy,   specifically   for   smaller-scale

projects,  so that our local contractors would  have  the

opportunity  to participate.  What I am worried  is  that

many local contractors

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2974</b></font><br><br>



are  already financially stretched.  They may  need  more

time to prepare the tender documents and raise financing.

Some may even have to be restructured first.  I hope that

the  relevant  departments will take these problems  into

consideration, when they call for tender.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with the lowering of our wage cost, we have no

choice  but to bring down our standard of living and  our

expectations.   As  we adjust, we must be  prepared  that

there will not be without pain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude my speech with 3Cs. First of all, we

must  have  "Confidence".  Our battle  against  SARS  has

strengthened  the  confidence  and  bonding  between  the

people  and  the Government.  I believe that Singaporeans

now have greater confidence in the Government's judgement

and decision-making.  Only when we have confidence in the

future,  will we have the courage to face the  challenges

ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second C is "Commitment". We must be committed

to  implementing strategic measures.  To endure  a  short

pain  is far better than to suffer a long agony.  We must

act  fast  to reform our wage structure and to  turn  our

economy around.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third C is "Common goal". In order to

effectively  resolve our economic crisis,  we  must  stay

united  as  one people and one nation with a common  goal

and  move  towards a common direction.  If  we  have  the

confidence, commitment and a common goal, we will be able

to bring our economy back on the road to recovery, create

more  job opportunities and bring back prosperity.  Then,

we can all truly feel relieved.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, I support the CPF changes as  proposed  by

the Prime Minister. These changes are indeed drastic, but

are   necessary  to  prepare  Singapore  for  its  future

challenges. Faced with increased competition and  a  fast

ageing  population, the proposed CPF changes will provide

an impetus to sustain economic growth in Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2975</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF changes and relief measures sent out three

clear  signals  to boost the confidence of our  potential

investors, our existing businesses and our people. To the

potential  investors,  it shows that  our  Government  is

always  prepared  to  take tough  measures  to  keep  our

business  costs  competitive.  This  will  attract   more

investments, thus creating more jobs for Singaporeans. To

the  existing  businesses, the three-point CPF  cut  will

provide  an essential lifeline for businesses to  improve

their  capabilities  to sustain their  businesses.   This

will  save jobs and allow businesses to source  for  more

business opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Singaporeans, the changes will boost their

confidence in terms of better job security and  more  job

opportunities.  At the same time, it sends a clear signal

to  all  Singaporeans  that we must  save  more  for  our

retirement,   and  be  more  prudent  in  our   financial

planning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans understand and support these CPF

changes,  although  it  means a reduction  of  their  CPF

savings.   These are painful measures which affect  their

quality of life.  But Singaporeans are confident that the

Government will lead them out of the present unemployment

situation.    With  lesser  CPF  savings,  I   hope   the

Government can do more to help Singaporeans "stretch  the

dollar  value of their CPF savings".  In this  regard,  I

would  like  to suggest three areas where the  Government

can help Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, CPF for housing. Sir, to overcome the

situation  of  Singaporeans being "asset  rich  but  cash

poor"  upon retirement, we need to review the HDB housing

policies.   These  include  the  development  policy  for

different  flat  types, pricing formula  for  new  flats,

debarment  periods for those who sold  their  flats,  and

also  the  rental  flat  policy.  We  must  provide  more

housing  options for retirees to liquidate  their  assets

and  cash out their savings for retirement. We must  give

retirees  more  options to either own a smaller  flat  or

rent a flat at affordable prices upon retirement.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2976</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relaxation of HDB rental policy to allow those

who own their flats for 15 years to rent their flats is a

welcome   move.    But   with  the  present   string   of

restrictions  by HDB, it may not be easy for  these  flat

owners to find cheaper alternative accommodation if  they

were  to rent their flats. As such, only a small fraction

of  the 250,000 flat owners will be able to benefit  from

this relief measure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must also review the affordability criteria

and  pricing  formula of HDB flats.  The pricing  of  HDB

flats should not be on the basis that 90% of Singaporeans

could  afford a 3-room flat. HDB has stopped building  3-room  flats since the 1980s.  As such, I do not know what

is  the  price of a 3-room flat, which the formula adopts

to work out the affordability index.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since HDB flats are liberalised, we should adopt a

market pricing mechanism whereby HDB flats are priced not

according  to  affordability, but on market  prices  with

Government subsidy.  For example, a new 100 square  metre

4-room HDB flat with a 99-year lease can be priced  close

to  a private apartment without condominium facilities of

the  same  size based on its location, design  and  floor

height.    Thereafter,  the  net  sale  price  shall   be

determined  after  deducting  the  market  price  with  a

prescribed  Government subsidy for  4-room  flats.   This

would  better  reflect  the Government  subsidy  and  the

market value of new HDB flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a growing ageing population, it is crucial for

the  Government to plan and provide more housing  options

for  the elderly.  Elderly couples with grown-up children

prefer  to live near their children, but may not be  able

to  purchase a 4- or 5-room flat based on market  prices.

Today,  the 4- and 5-room housing mix, especially in  our

new  towns, does not facilitate elderly couples  to  stay

near  their children.   Thus, I would urge the Government

to  consider developing a better housing mix of different

flat  types  (1,  2  or 3 bedroom flats)  as  in  private

condominiums   to   offer  more   housing   options   for

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help retirees to liquidate their assets, HDB

should explore reverse mortgage

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2977</b></font><br><br>



schemes.   It  should  also provide more  rental  housing

flats for the elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With lesser CPF savings, young couples may take a

longer  time  to save for their HDB flats, especially  if

they  face certain periods of unemployment.  In order  to

encourage  more  young  Singaporeans  to  form   families

earlier, HDB should reduce the downpayment for new  flats

for first-time applicants.  This is especially so for  4-room  flats  which are within the means  of  the  working

class Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, CPF for healthcare. Sir, I fully support

the  efforts by the Health Minister to lower health costs

in   Singapore.    Many  Singaporeans,   especially   the

heartlanders,  are  indeed  concerned  about   healthcare

costs.    The  risk  of  individuals  or  family  members

depleting their Medisave accounts is high if one of their

family members falls critically ill.  The safety net  for

medical expenses is presently inadequate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to keep medical costs affordable and

encourage  more  Singaporeans to save for  their  medical

needs, as they grow older.  Sir, I support the adjustment

of  the Medisave Minimum Sum of $25,000 to cope with  the

inflation  of  health costs.  I would  suggest  that  the

Government  should develop an inflation index to  measure

and  monitor health costs and healthcare expenditures  of

Singaporeans closely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Health Ministry should also adopt a holistic

approach  to promote healthy lifestyle among Singaporeans

more aggressively.  We should provide more facilities  or

avenues for Singaporeans to keep fit.  In this regard,  I

hope  the Government would accelerate the development  of

park  connectors,  upgrading  of  sports  complexes   and

provide    more    support   to   encourage    grassroots

organisations to organise more keep fit activities,  such

as   brisk   walking,  tai-chi,  qigong  or   silat   for

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, CPF for retirement. To many working class

Singaporeans, the CPF

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2978</b></font><br><br>



saving  is  probably  their only saving  for  retirement.

Singaporeans earning less than $2,000 will not be able to

save  much if they need to pay for their housing, medical

care and support their children.  As such, the Government

should help Singaporeans to increase the returns of their

CPF   savings.    The  CPF  Board  should   adopt   clear

performance benchmarks and invest in a wider portfolio of

investments  to maximise the returns of its  funds.   The

returns to CPF savings should also be based on a formula,

which  is  regularly  updated, so that  CPF  members  can

benefit more from their savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, based on the CDC's experience in helping

Singaporeans to find jobs, we find that three  groups  of

job-seekers  have much difficulty in finding  jobs.  They

are:  (1) Singaporeans who are medically unfit or require

regular   medical  treatment,  such  as  kidney  dialysis

treatment;  (2) those suffering from mental illness;  and

(3)  those  with  criminal records.   I  would  urge  the

Government  to  do more to help these people  to  make  a

decent  living.   The Work Assistance Programme  may  not

help  these Singaporeans to secure jobs as employers  are

not  keen  to  employ  them.  I hope the  Government  can

consider creating some jobs to help these Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area which the Government can create jobs, and

at  the  same time improve its customer services,  is  to

remove  the  automated telephone system  for  all  public

agencies  and  the Ministries. These automated  telephone

systems  are often inaccessible or engaged at all  times.

To  promote excellence in public services, the Government

should  consider  training Singaporeans  to  be  customer

service officers, manning these frontline operations,  at

least  during office hours.  This would not  only  create

jobs  but  also improve the image of Government agencies.

It will also enable many people to make enquiries through

the  phone  instead of wasting time to come down  to  the

various Government agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the CPF changes.
