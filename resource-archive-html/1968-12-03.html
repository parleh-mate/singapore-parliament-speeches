<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>INDEPENDENT ASIAN COUNTRIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b> asked the Minister for Foreign

Affairs and Minister for Labour if he will take steps

to  establish  diplomatic  relations  with  all  inde

pendent   Asian  countries  irrespective   of   their

political  ideologies provided that he  is  satisfied

that  these  countries  will  not  interfere  in  the

internal affairs of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

Singapore's policy - it has been repeatedly said  -is

to  be friends with all countries regardless of their

political ideologies or their system of government so

long  as they respect our sovereignty and territorial

integrity  and  refrain  from  interfering   in   our

internal affairs. Singapore is therefore prepared  to

establish diplomatic relations with all countries who

want  to  be  friends  in  Asia  and  elsewhere  too.

However,  the  establishment of Singapore  diplomatic

missions abroad is a different matter. This  will  be

governed  by  financial considerations, personnel  re

sources and the degree of our interest in the various

countries.  So  friendly contacts with  countries  in

Asia  will  be maintained and consolidated,  in  some

cases,   by   the  establishment  of  our  diplomatic

missions and, in other cases, by official visits  and

by  working together with them in the United  Nations

and other organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in speaking about the establishment of

diplomatic  ties,  one  feature  which  is   somewhat

unusual  in  the  world today  is  the  existence  of

divided  countries. In the case of divided countries,

diplomatic  relations  with one  part  of  a  divided

country  to the exclusion of the other can only  mean

lending  support to one against the other.  For  this

reason, we have since independence maintained, in the

case  of  divided countries, that we  would  be  most

happy to have trade and consular



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



relations  with either of them on an equal basis  and

that we would do nothing that would give an advantage

to one side over the other.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can

the Minister for Foreign Affairs inform the House how

many   independent  Asian  countries   have   already

established diplomatic relations with Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I cannot recollect the precise

number. It is neither too big nor too small.  But  if

the Member is interested, he can ask the Ministry  of

Culture  which  has a consular list of the  countries

which have diplomatic relations here.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>ASEAN</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Benefits to Singapore and future plans)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Foreign  Affairs  and Minister for  Labour  (a)  what

economic  or  other  benefits has  ASEAN  brought  to

Singapore  since its formation; and  (b)  whether  he

will  inform the House briefly about the future plans

of ASEAN.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, ASEAN has as yet

brought  no direct economic benefits to its  members.

However,    this   should   occasion    no    special

disappointment because ASEAN was formed only a little

over  a  year ago. However, during this year, it  has

been   able  to  clarify  for  itself  the   possible

approaches  to  greater  economic  cooperation  among

member  states.  At the ministerial meeting  held  in

Jakarta  last  August,  reports  by  ASEAN   ad   hoc

committees  on food production and supply,  including

fisheries,       shipping,       transport        and

telecommunications, civil aviation and  tourism  were

approved  and adopted. The Ministers further  decided

that  these  recommendations should  be  examined  in

greater  detail by the ASEAN National Secretariat  to

decide  which  could be implemented  immediately  and

which would require further study.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has already given effect to some of the

recommendations made at the last ministerial meeting,

though all these related to tourism. Firstly, we have

introduced seven-day visa free facilities to  persons

arriving  in  Singapore provided they  possess  valid

passports,  firm  bookings and  entry  facilities  to

their  destinations and continue their journey within

seven days of arrival in Singapore. Secondly, we have

agreed  to  accept  collective passports  and  travel

documents  issued to parties of between five  and  25

persons, all of whom should be nationals of a country

and  travelling  on  package or  chartered  tours  to

countries within the ASEAN region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, together with Indonesia, has also been

pursuing the possibility of joint development of Bali

as an international tourist resort. Last April, a ten-

man  technical  fact-finding mission  from  Singapore

visited  Indonesia  to  make recommendations  on  the

project to the two Governments. The mission's  report

has  been presented and accepted in principle by  the

Government  of  Indonesia  pending  a  more  detailed

assessment to be undertaken by the Stamford  Research

Institute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the future plans of ASEAN, the hon. Member's

guess  will  be  as  good as mine.  Like  many  other

efforts  at  regional  co-operation,  ASEAN  too   is

running into a spot of bother at the moment. I do not

want  to minimise these difficulties, but all  I  can

say  is  that  the present difficulties would  appear

trivial and irrelevant to what ASEAN countries  would

face were they to abandon altogether their belief  in

the  need  for  regional  co-operation.  As  far   as

Singapore  is  concerned, its attitude towards  ASEAN

has  never been one of starry-eyed optimism. Progress

towards  regional co-operation will be,  particularly

in the early stages, slow, painful and interrupted by

setbacks.  But  we  are equally convinced  that  hard

economic   and  political  facts  will   push   ASEAN

countries  in the direction of regional co-operation.

However  much we the members may drag our feet,  each

passing  year  will make clearer to  ASEAN  countries

that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



choice for them ultimately is one of hanging together

or hanging separately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, to put it succinctly, at the

moment as of today, I will describe ASEAN as a  state

of mind rather than a fulfilment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Can the Minister

state  whether  the  present  deadlock  between  the

Philippines and Malaysia over the Sabah  claim  will

lead  to  the  dissolution of ASEAN,  or,  at  best,

adversely affect the future of ASEAN?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I think the hon. Member should read the newspapers because I cannot

read them for him!

I have been asked by the Minister to reply.

received during the period 1st January, 1967, to 30th

June,  1968,  from  trained  teachers  in  the   four

from the English language stream, 24 from the Chinese

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of applications received from Divisions I

the  same  period was 55. The number  on  the  racial

basis comprises 39 Chinese, two Malays, nine Indians,

four Ceylonese and one British.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of applicants interviewed during

the  period  was 161. Thirty-eight applications  were

approved  up  to the end of November  1968.  Of  this

number, 10 were teachers and 28 were Divisions I  and

II civil servants. One application from a Division  I

civil  servant who did not qualify residentially  was

rejected. One hundred and twenty-two applications are

still under consideration.

scope of training as well as increasing the intake of

trainees to meet the expected increase in the  demand

for hotel and catering personnel. In this connection,

we  have sought assistance from the Colombo Plan  and

the  International  Labour  Organisation  for  expert

staff, equipment and fellowships for local people. It

is  proposed  to  build  a teaching  hotel  for  this

purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there are about 1,800 hotel rooms in

Singapore  suitable  for tourists  and  the  industry

employs  about 2,700 workers. There are 15 hotel  pro

jects with a combined room capacity of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



slightly more than 4,500 rooms under way. The  number

of workers required to man the hotels is estimated on

the  basis  of one and a half workers per room.  With

the  completion  of these 15 hotels,  there  will  be

employment opportunities for nearly 7,000 persons  in

the  industry.  It  is estimated that  by  1970  this

industry will employ a total of 9,500 workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Will the Parliamentary Secretary

to  the Minister for Labour state whether there  will

be  facilities for training the top and middle  hotel

management  staff  and, if not, whether  arrangements

will be made to send these trainees abroad?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> At present, there are no facilities

available.  But when the new hotel school  is  built,

there  may  be a possibility of training the  middle-

rung  hotel management staff, but not the top-ranking

ones.  At  the  moment, there are a few  who  are  on

training courses abroad for management staff.

<div align="center"><b>STRIKES AND WORK STOPPAGES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FROM 1-1-68 TO 31-10-68</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour the number of

(i)  strikes,  and  (ii) work stoppages,  during  the

period 1st January to 31st October, 1968.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

during the period 1st January to 31st October,  1968,

there were only four strikes involving a total of 172

employees and a loss of 5,299 man-days. There were no

other work stoppages during this period.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Can the Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Labour state  what  was

the reason for the fewer strikes during this period?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> I think the hon. Member should

know. Anyway, I think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>



it  is  generally accepted that the employer/employee

relationship was and is very good.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Can the Parliamentary Secretary

to  the  Minister for Labour state how  many  strikes

have  taken  place  after  the  enforcement  of   the

Employment Act?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can you give that information now, Mr

Sia?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> I do not think I am able off-hand

to  give the number. But if the hon. Member will  put

it down as a question, it will be answered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

find  out  from  the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister  for  Labour whether it is  because  of  the

arbitrary power that the Government has given to  the

employer to dismiss workers, or whether it is  really

due  to  the  Employment  Act that  the  relationship

between the employer and the employee has improved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> I think the conciliatory machinery

in  the  Ministry of Labour does its work  well  and,

therefore,  there is no need for any strike  to  take

place.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> If that is the case, does the

Parliamentary  Secretary  presume  that   this   good

relationship will continue in the future? If it does,

is  there  any  possibility  of  abolishing  the  two

Industrial Arbitration Courts so that a lot of  money

will be saved for the Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, human nature is

such that there will be cases where the Ministry of

Labour cannot -

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Carry on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> No, I would not use those words. I

think  there  will  be cases where  the  Ministry  of

Labour  cannot get both sides to agree.  And  dealing

with  such  cases  is  surely  the  purpose  of   the

Industrial Arbitration Courts.

<div align="center"><b>EMPLOYMENT EXCHANGE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Number of registrants as at 31-10-68 and number placed in employment between 1-1-68 and 31-10-68)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour (a) what  was

the  total  number  of  persons registered  with  the

Employment Exchange for employment assistance  as  at

31st October, 1968; and (b) how many registrants  had

been placed in employment by the Exchange between 1st

January  and  31st October, 1968, and  whether  their

registration  cards  have  been  taken  back  by  the

Exchange.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the   total  number  of  persons  registered  in  the

Employment Exchange for employment assistance  as  at

31st  October,  1968,  was 62,095.  From  January  to

October 1968 the Employment Exchange had placed 3,880

registrants in employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the practice of the Employment Exchange to

take back registration cards from registrants.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Take, for

example, a person who has been employed. Does not the

Parliamentary Secretary agree that if you do not take

away his registration card, he will go from one place

of work to another to seek employment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that will not be

possible  because once we have sent a registrant  out

to a prospective employer, his card in the Employment

Exchange  is  automatically  endorsed.  His  name  is

therefore taken out of the register.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): My question is

whether the card can be taken back or not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> I do not understand. I do not know

what card can be taken back.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> I wish to know whether the

registration  card will be taken back, that  is,  the

employment  card.  Once a person is employed,  should

not  his  registration card be taken back?  Otherwise

can  he  not continue to seek a better job at another

place?  That is the question I am asking and  I  hope

the Parliamentary Secretary will answer it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said

earlier,  it  is not possible for that registrant  to

move  from  job to job. Once he is sent  out  by  the

Employment  Exchange,  he  brings  with  him  a  card

addressed to the prospective employer and there is  a

return  card.  If he is taken on, then  the  card  in

which  the particulars are properly entered  will  be

sent back to the Employment Exchange by the employer.

The  registrant's name will then be removed from  the

register.  In other words, he is already an  employed

person  and his name does not remain in the register.

The card that he originally had will serve no purpose

whatsoever.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Certificate is in order. Are typed

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill distributed to hon.

Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Board (E.D.B.) which was

established  in  1961  has  done  valuable  work   in

promoting  industrial  growth, developing  industrial

estates,   financing   industrial   enterprises   and

providing  technical training and consultant  service

to  manufacturing industries. The scale of operations

of  the  E.D.B, has expanded greatly since 1961,  and

this  has magnified the basic conflict of the various

functions which the E.D.B, was originally called upon

to    perform.   Investment   promotion, industrial

financing  and  development  and  management  of  the

industrial  estates are functions  each  incompatible

with  the  other and are best performed  by  separate

organisations.  Accordingly, on 1st June,  1968,  the

Jurong Town Corporation was Set up under an Act



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



of   Parliament   and   commenced   operations.   The

Corporation  has  taken over  the  ownership  of  the

industrial  lands  and development functions  of  the E.D.B.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further separation of the functions of the E.D.B.

took   place  on  1st  September,  1968,   when   the

Development Bank of Singapore (the Bank, for  short),

a  private limited company, commenced operations. The

Bank   has   taken  over  the  industrial   financing

functions of the E.D.B.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the E.D.B, is not now concerned with

industrial financing but is concentrating on its main

function of industrial promotion, clauses 2 and 3  of

the  Bill provide respectively for the transfer  back

to  the Government of loans and debentures made,  and

stocks  and  shares  subscribed,  by  the  E.D.B, in

industrial enterprises. Clause 4 provides for  moneys

invested in securities or deposited by E.D.B, to  be

transferred back to the Government according  to  the

directions of the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The E.D.B, loan portfolio, when returned to the

Government, will be assigned by the Government to the

Bank.  The  equity investments and all  other  assets

will  be retained by the Government. The transfer  to

the Bank of the E.D.B, loan portfolio is made via the

Government,  so  that the total value  of  this  loan

portfolio  can  be  treated  as  a  loan   from   the

Government to the Bank on which a reasonable rate  of

interest will be charged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer of the assets of the E.D.B, to the

Government  is made in the name of the  Minister  for

Finance,  who  is a corporation sole, a legal  entity

established  by  law  to  hold  investments  of   the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be noted from clause I of the Bill that the

operation of the Bill is with retrospective effect as

from  1st  September.  1968, which  is  the  date  of

commencement of operations of the Bank.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the establishment of the Jurong Town

Corporation  and the Development Bank  of  Singapore,

the rationalisation of the structure of the E.D.B, is

now  complete. The E.D.B, will henceforth concentrate

on  its  major  functions of industrial promotion  as

well  as  of  assistance in overcoming technical  and

managerial problems of individual firms. Funds to run

the  E.D.B, will be provided annually as a subvention

from the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir,

will  the  Parliamentary Secretary  please  give  the

reasons  for the urgency to bulldoze the Bill through

the House?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, I appreciate the hon.

Member's  anxiety on this score. As he  will  notice,

the  Bank  is now in operation and to facilitate  its

running,  this Bill should become law as  quickly  as

possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.- [Mr Tang See Chim].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion deals with two areas of nature reserves -

one  at  MacRitchie Reservoir and the  other  in  the

Pandan nature reserve. Part of the nature reserve  at

MacRitchie Reservoir has already been converted  into

a  park,  and  it  is now necessary to  regulate  the

position by amending paragraph 1 of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>



Schedule to the Nature Reserves Ordinance as proposed

in my motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the Pandan nature reserve was reclaimed many

years  ago to provide land for the industrial  estate

at  Jurong. Consequent upon the rapid growth  of  the

Jurong  Industrial Estate, more land  is  needed  for

industrial  expansion. It is proposed, therefore,  to

allow  the  Jurong Town Corporation  to  reclaim  the

remaining lot of the Pandan nature reserve comprising

some  356  acres  of  swamp land.  Thus,  it  becomes

necessary to delete this lot from the Schedule of the

Nature Reserves Ordinance.

<div align="center"><b>(PULAU AYER CHAWAN)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  beg  to  move  the  second  motion

standing in my name as it appears on the Order  Paper

and which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4

of  the  Foreshores Ordinance (Chapter 246), approves

the  reclamation by Government of that portion of the

foreshore and sea-bed at Pulau Ayer Chawan containing

an  area of approximately 332 acres as shown coloured

yellow  on  the plan marked "LAND OFFICE  RECLAMATION

PLAN NO. 1/68" which is deposited in the Land Office,

Singapore.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in March this year the Government acquired

under  the  provisions of the Land  Acquisition  Act,

1965,  the only two pieces of private land  at  Pulau

Ayer  Chawan,  thus bringing the whole  island  under

state  ownership  so  as to facilitate  comprehensive

development for industrial purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jurong Town Corporation, which has now taken

over  the  industrial development  functions  of  the

Economic  Development Board, has  recently  completed

negotiations with Esso (Singapore) Private Limited to

lease  the  island to the company for the development

of  a  $200  million oil refinery.  This  development

necessitates the reclamation of certain areas in  the

island.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the area of Pulau Ayer Chawan is about 511

acres, only 179 acres are above the high-water  mark.

The  remaining  332  acres are technically  foreshore

requiring  to be reclaimed by filling. The 332  acres

of  foreshore and sea-bed at Pulau Ayer Chawan  which

are  to be reclaimed are shown coloured yellow on the

plan  marked "Land Office Reclamation Plan No. 1/68",

a  copy of which is displayed in the Library of  this

House for the information of hon. Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reclamation is to be done in two phases. The

initial  works  will cover an area of  141  acres  as

indicated  by the line of black crosses on  the  said

plan. The company will undertake, at its own expense,

the work of reclamation as agents for the Government.

The  whole island, including the reclaimed foreshore,

will  subsequently be alienated to  the  Jurong  Town

Corporation   on   a  99-year  lease   allowing   the

Corporation to sub-lease the land to Esso (Singapore)

Private  Limited.  The  company  also  requires   the

exclusive  use of the foreshore shown coloured  green

on  the said plan for siting its wharves and jetties,

and  it is proposed to issue foreshore leases to  the

Jurong Town Corporation to cover these areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4

of  the  Foreshores Ordinance (Chapter 246), approves

the  reclamation by Government of that portion of the

foreshore and sea-bed at Pulau Ayer Chawan containing

an  area of approximately 332 acres as shown coloured

yellow  on  the plan marked "LAND OFFICE  RECLAMATION

PLAN NO. 1/68" which is deposited in the Land Office,

Singapore.

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>



<br><br>3.22 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of the

Government  for the financial year 1st January,  1969

to 31st March, 1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in last year's Budget, Defence Expenditure did

not   occupy  a  prominent  position.  Although   the

Republic  had been building its Defence forces  since

1965,  the  first announcement of British  withdrawal

plan  called for no change in the Republic's  Defence

Programme  as  the assumptions on which  these  plans

were based took into account the probability of total

withdrawal  of the British presence by 1975.  It  was

then  proposed  to expand our Army to seven  Infantry

Battalions.  These  with their  supporting  arms  and

services  will provide the elements of  two  Infantry

Brigades.  Last year I was able to make the following

statement in my Budget address:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Provided there are no further changes of mind on

the  part  of Her Majesty's Government, the build-up

of  our  Defence  Forces on land  will  continue  as

planned.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reservations contained in the proviso struck an

ominous  note at that time and unhappily for  us  the

fears  on  which  they rested were realised.  The  ac

celerated  withdrawal  plan  had  totally  upset  the

assumptions  on  which the first Defence  plans  were

made  and  it was therefore necessary to  revise  and

draw  up  an  entirely new plan. From time  to  time,

Ministers   of   the  Government  had   made   public

statements about the buildup of this or that  element

of  the armed services. I myself made a forecast last

September  that  there would be  a  very  substantial

increase  in  the Defence Budget for the  forthcoming

year.  I  mentioned  a figure of Defence  expenditure

reaching  some  10  per cent of  our  gross  national

product,  as  a  result of which tax  increases  were

hardly avoidable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that this very large and rapid increase

in our Defence expenditure sets the dominant theme in

this  Budget. In a closed totalitarian system, it  is

possible to incur expenditure of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>



this  size  in secret without any need for  a  public

explanation as to how the money is being spent. In an

open  Parliamentary system such as ours,  it  is  not

possible to conceal increases of expenditure of  this

magnitude.  Nor is it desirable to do so.  Our  young

men  are being conscripted by the thousands into  the

Defence forces. Soon taxpayers will be asked  to  pay

more.  Obviously the public has a right to know  what

we are spending the money on, what they can expect to

get  in  return for it and whether they  are  getting

value for their money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will therefore deal with the Defence build-up over

the  next few years taking each of the three services

in  turn.  I  will start with the Navy. Our  original

plans  made no provisions for naval expansion  (until

the early 1970's) nor was there any provision for the

establishment  of  an  Air  Force  this   year.   But

obviously with the end of British protection in three

years'  time,  we  should waste no time  in  creating

these services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Navy, the first phase of

development  is  envisaged  to  take  the   form   of

establishing a force of six patrol craft. Orders  for

these  craft  have been placed in June of  this  year

with Vosper's. Two will be constructed in Britain and

four  in  Singapore. Delivery will  commence  in  the

middle  of 1970 and will be completed before the  end

of 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pending the arrival of these craft the present naval

effort  is  confined to training of  personnel.  Four

naval  officers  are now undergoing training  in  the

United  Kingdom with the Royal Navy and another  four

are  in  Australia training with the Royal Australian

Navy.  A school of naval training was established  on

the  15th November this year and the first intake  of

recruits  will  commence training  in  February  next

year. This will be concerned purely with training  of

seamen,  navigation, care of ships and so  on.  Naval

crew  who  will  take charge of radar, or  mechanical

equipment, will receive their basic training in other

training  institutions of the  Armed  Forces  dealing

with these subjects.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the Air Force the establishment of

which is proceeding apace. Fifteen young men selected

by  a rigorous procedure out of several hundred,  are

now  undergoing training with the Royal Air Force  in

Britain.  Another four are doing helicopter  training

in  France. This month another five pilots are  going

for  training in the United Kingdom and more will  be

sent  there next year. On their return they  will  be

attached  to the Flying Training School in  Singapore

which will turn out the additional pilots required by

our Air Force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Air Force requires not only pilots but also

ground crew to service the aircraft and technical and

operational  teams to operate radar and  air  defence

systems.   A  Technical  Training  School   will   be

established to train such personnel and the staff  of

this   school  is  now  being  trained  overseas   in

mechanical, electrical, electronic and other trades.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Republic's Air Force will be operational before

the  end of 1971 and it will consist of squadrons  of

Cessnas. Jet Provosts, Aloutte Helicopters and Hawker

Hunters.  The Cessna serves as a primary trainer.  It

can  also  perform the role of spotter aircraft.  The

Jet  Provost is the basic jet trainer. It can double-

up  for  counter-insurgency operations and for ground

attack. Aloutte Helicopters are capable of performing

a  variety of useful duties. The Hawker Hunter is  an

interceptor aircraft which can be used also in ground

attack   operations.  It  is  a  fine  and  versatile

aircraft.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orders for these aircraft together with the

electronic gear and weapons systems have been  placed

and delivery will be effected over the next two-and-a-

half  years. The task of building an Air  Force  from

scratch  is an exacting one. We are indeed  fortunate

to have the whole-hearted assistance of the Royal Air

Force. The Singapore Government is also fortunath  to

be able to secure after his retirement from the Royal

Air  Force in February next year the services of  Air

Marshal  Sir  Rochford Hughes. Sir  Rochford  Hughes,

currently  the  Air Commander of  the  Far  East  Air

Force,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



has  a  long and distinguished career as an Air Force

Officer  and we can have every confidence  that  with

his advice and guidance the Republic's Air Force will

be one of high quality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the expansion of the Army. This was

the  first  arm  of the service to be expanded  after

independence.   The  build-up  is  proceeding   satis

factorily.  The  present state  of  the  Army  is  as

follows.  We  have increased the number  of  Infantry

Battalions  from two in 1965 to five  today.  Two  of

these  Battalions are fully operational. Another  two

are  in  an  advanced stage of training and  will  be

fully  operational by the middle of  next  year.  The

fifth Battalion will be operational in December  next

year. Next March the sixth Battalion of the Singapore

Infantry Regiment will be formed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to say here that the two Battalions we

inherited in 1965 are not just being retained in  the

condition  that  we  found  them.  The  1st  and  2nd

Battalions  of  the Singapore Infantry  Regiment  are

being  reconverted  into the new battalion  structure

using  new weapons and manned by National Servicemen.

Regular  soldiers  of  the two Battalions  have  been

distributed to other units of the Armed Forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The control and command of the Battalions are vested

in a Brigade Headquarters established in October this

year.  It  is  now  fully operational  and  a  second

Brigade  Headquarters  will  be  established  in  the

middle of next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infantry Battalions have to be served and supported

by  other  combat and technical units.  An  Artillery

Battalion  has  been established and has  reached  an

advanced  stage  of training. It is  expected  to  be

fully  operational by the middle of  1969.  A  second

Artillery  Battalion  will  then  be  raised.   These

Battalions use the 120 mm mortars which provide close

fire support for front line troops.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Battalion of Combat Field Engineers raised this

year  will be fully operational by the middle of next

year.  The  Engineers will perform  the  conventional

roles expected of such units, that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>



is,  to  help  in infantry assault by  breaching  all

types of obstacles, including mine-fields. They  will

also  have other capabilities, such as providing  for

river  crossing, carrying out all types of demolition

missions, constructing fortifications, and so on. The

Signals  Battalion has been formed and is functioning

to   provide   communications  between   the   higher

formations  and  headquarters.  All  units   of   the

Singapore  Armed Forces are equipped  with  the  most

modern signals equipment available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Battalions which are performing

full-time  military  duties, we  have  units  of  the

People's  Defence Force. The P.D.F., as hon.  Members

know, consists of civilians who give up part of their

time  after  work  or  during periods  of  leave  for

military   training.  At  present,  the   P.D.F, is

organised  into  three  Infantry  Battalions  with  a

fourth  to  be raised early next year. Their  present

functions are confined to internal security duties. A

P.D.F.  Engineer Battalion also exists and is trained

in  the running of essential civilian services during

an emergency. The command and control of P.D.F, units

is  vested in the Brigade Headquarters which has been

set up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The units which I have described have been raised in

accordance with the original expansion plan  for  the

Army  and  according to the same time-table. However,

as a result of the accelerated British withdrawal, it

has  been  found  necessary  to  increase  the  force

strength of the Army in 1971. In addition to the  two

Infantry  Brigades,  it  is  proposed  to  raise   an

Armoured unit consisting of tanks and armoured  cars.

The  preparations for raising this Armoured unit  are

at  an  advanced stage. Orders for the vehicles  have

been  placed and a nucleus of officers and  technical

crew for the unit is now being trained in the Israeli

School of Armour. The main strength of the unit  will

be  drawn from officers and men to be trained in  the

School   of  Armour  which  we  shall  establish   in

Singapore. The Armoured unit is expected to be  fully

operational by 1971.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One noteworthy feature of the expansion of the Army

which has not drawn public comment is that the entire

body  of  Officers and Non-Commissioned Officers  are

staffed by our own citizens. It may look to us  as  a

natural  occurrence. But if we compare our Army  with

those  recently raised in many developing  countries,

we  will notice that many of their defence units  are

staffed by a substantial force of expatriate officers

and  technicians. In our case, apart from 23  members

of   the   Israeli   Defence  Mission,   serving   as

instructors  and advisers, and, at the  end  of  next

year,   Sir  Rochford  Hughes,  the  entire   Defence

establishment is staffed by our own officers  at  all

levels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This satisfactory outcome is the result of a sound

system  of  training  institutions  which  has   been

established  and  which  is even  now  being  rapidly

expanded.   The   Singapore  Armed  Forces   Training

Institute,  or  SAFTI, provides  the  major  training

effort.  In  addition  to  infantry  training  up  to

platoon level, it is now giving advanced training  to

officers at company and battalion levels as  well  as

specialised training in support weapons and  military

medicine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to SAFTI, a School of Artillery has been

established  as well as a School of Field  Engineers.

These  are  attached  to  the respective  battalions.

Training  activities are also carried out to  provide

various  technical  personnel required  in  an  armed

force.  A  School of Electronics will  be  formed  in

1969.  Already in existence are a School of Catering,

a School of Drivers, a School of Provost and, believe

it  or  not,  a  School of Military  Accounting.  The

P.D.F, training centre has been established  and  it

runs  courses  throughout the year to upgrade  P.D.F.

officers and N.C.O, cadres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above account outlines the expansion of our

defence  forces  up  to 1971. It  will  be  a  costly

undertaking,  the annual cost in cash terms  reaching

some  10  per  cent  of  our current  gross  national

product,  that  is, rather more than $300  million  a

year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have come across two kinds of reaction to our

defence  build-up programme. As they seem  widespread

and  further  appear to me to rest on  an  incomplete

understanding of our defence effort, it may be  worth

while  to  dwell  at some length on them.  The  first

takes  the  position that Singapore, being  small  in

population   and  in  land  area,  is  incapable   of

defending  herself against armed attack by  countries

bigger in size. The other point of view accuses us of

arming  ourselves in a precipitate manner and  to  an

extravagant degree. I believe neither of these  views

is correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first view regards the building of defence

forces  principally  in terms of its  nation-building

value.  Young men are conscripted into  the  army  by

national  service  and  are  brought  together  in  a

collective  life.  They  have  instilled  into   them

certain values of discipline, loyalty, leadership and

other  useful qualities. While in no way denying  the

real  worth of the nation-building functions  of  the

defence  build-up,  I would like to  say  that  these

people  overlook two important points. The  first  is

that we are not creating a large body of enthusiastic

amateurs. On the contrary, we expect our soldiers  in

all  units  and at all levels to attain  the  highest

professional standards. The rigorous training systems

created with the advice of the Israeli Defence  Force

Mission  ensure  that  they  get  the  best  training

possible.  Further, members of the armed  forces  are

equipped with the best weapons money can buy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same holds true of communications equipment,

transport and other logistic requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these preparations will ensure that we have

adequate fire-power, mobility and professional skill.

The  second  point which the pessimist  overlooks  is

that  the  full-time units of the army in this  case,

two   infantry   brigades  and  one   armoured   unit

operational as from 1971 do not represent  the  total

potential  of our army force strength, or  "Order  of

Battle" as the professionals call it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the result of National Service which allows

us to have a comparatively small full-time army while

building up a reserve army of increasing size in  the

course  of time. It works out this way. The  national

serviceman,  after  serving two years  in  the  army,

leaves  the  full-time army and takes on  a  civilian

occupation.  He  is,  however,  liable  for   reserve

service  for  ten years. During this period  of  ten-

years' reserve service, he will be called up for full-

time training one whole month each year. This enables

us   to  build  up  reserve  battalions  as  national

servicemen  leave the active battalions on completion

of their two years' service. All that is necessary to

establish  these reserve battalions is  to  store  up

weapons,  ammunition,  equipment  and  transport  for

these battalions, as well as to maintain a nucleus of

regular   officers  and  men.  The  bulk  of  trained

personnel  is  provided  by reservists.  An  infantry

battalion in full-time service would reproduce itself

every  two years into a reserve battalion. Similarly,

elements  from the armoured unit, artillery, engineer

battalions and other units will also be released into

the  reserves,  thereby creating  a  complete  infra-

structure of fighting units in the reserves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complete cycle is 12 years, with national

servicemen doing full-time service for two years  and

ten  years as reservists. At the end of 12 years from

the beginning of national service, that is to say, in

1979,  30  to 35 infantry battalions would have  been

formed  as  reserves. In other words, by 1979,  under

the   present  rate  of  enlistment,  we  would  have

available  on  immediate mobilisation,  45,000  well-

trained troops.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a substantial force by any standard. It

should  be adequate to protect Singapore against  any

foreseeable military threat. To give some idea of the

scale  of  operations which our army  can  eventually

undertake,  let us consider the Japanese  assault  of

Singapore  during the Pacific War.  The  assault  was

carried out by three Japanese Divisions. The 5th  and

18th Divisions landed at Pasir Laba and Lim Chu Kang,

whilst the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>



Imperial Guard Division landed to the left of the 5th

Division,   the  front  extending  to  the  causeway.

Unfortunately  for  us,  the  troops  then  defending

Singapore,   consisting  mostly  of  conscripts   and

regulars  of  other  countries,  did  not  put  up  a

distinguished performance for reasons which need  not

detain  us  here. But if at that time, we  had  forty

battalions  of our own men, I have little doubt  that

the  Japanese army would have found the going a great

deal harder. Of course, the sensible thing to do,  if

there  is today a repetition of an offensive of  this

nature against Malaysia and Singapore, is to send our

troops  to fight on the beaches of Kota Bahru and  by

the Slim River alongside Malaysian forces rather than

wait for the invading army to reach the causeway This

rather fanciful illustration from past history serves

to   underline  what  has  often  been  said  of  the

indivisibility  of the defence of the  Peninsula  and

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the other criticism, namely, that we

are  arming ourselves at too rapid a rate. This point

of  view can be quite easily disposed of. At present,

only  20 per cent of national servicemen are selected

to  do  full-time service in the Armed  Forces.  Even

with  the  expanded Defence programme it is  unlikely

that  the percentage of intake into full-time service

will substantially increase. Further, the build-up of

the  army  strength takes the form  of  increases  in

reserve  battalions. These increases  take  place  in

gradual measured steps, and are quite the reverse  of

the hasty action we are alleged to be taking, it will

not  be  until  1979, that is, the end  of  the  next

decade, that we would reach the full potential of the

order  of  battle. This assumes, of course,  that  we

will   continue   to  provide  weapons, ammunition,

equipment  and  transport for each and every  reserve

battalion.  We shall certainly do this for  the  next

few years, but whether we should accumulate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>



vast  stores of military hardware right up till  1979

is  a  matter  that can be decided in  the  light  of

circumstances prevailing. By the same token,  we  are

also  keeping our options open for a faster  build-up

should this prove necessary. With the training  units

and  the know-how that is being rapidly acquired,  we

would  have  the capacity before the end of  1971  to

vary  the rate of expansion to such levels as may  be

judged    appropriate,    taking    all    prevailing

circumstances into consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned a short while ago the kind of attack

which  our  Armed  Forces in  co-operation  with  the

Malaysian  Forces  would be in a position  to  repel.

This  would  be  approximately  the  kind  of  effort

mounted  against us by the Japanese  in  the  Pacific

War, that is an invasion force consisting of three to

four  divisions which in itself required a tremendous

logistical effort. However, if a really major  threat

develops, say an invasion by 50 divisions or a threat

to  deliver a nuclear attack, then a situation arises

which  concerns not only ourselves but all the  major

world powers. An assault by 50 divisions or a nuclear

threat  can  only  be mounted by a superpower  or  by

countries acting with the connivance and support of a

superpower. As such, other super-powers will be drawn

in  and  the  resolution of a conflict of this  scale

will rest with the giants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now wish to turn our thoughts away from the

horrendous  possibilities of super-power conflict  to

more mundane



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



matters, and that is the second consequence which  we

have  to face as the result of the withdrawal of  the

British military presence. This is the decline in our

gross national product and the loss of employment  of

large  numbers of people. I want to go at some length

into  the  number of locally employed  civilians  and

enlisted  personnel  who  will  be  laid  off  as   a

consequence of the closing down of the British bases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have circulated a Table* for the information of

hon.  Members as the facts are best set out  in  this

form.  I  would like to say at the outset that  while

some of the figures are very accurate, others are not

so. For instance, the number of civilians employed in

the Armed services and the number of locally enlisted

personnel are derived from accurate records.  On  the

other  hand, the number of domestic servants employed

by  British service families is very approximate,  as

no  central  registers are maintained in  respect  of

them.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April last year, there were some 42,000 persons

employed,  and  by the end of this year  we  estimate

that  10,000  would  have lost their  jobs.  Of  this

10,000,  3.000 have been re-engaged by the  Sembawang

Shipyard  on  the  transfer of assets  of  the  Naval

Dockyard  to  this enterprise. Therefore,  the  total

number retrenched so far is only 7,000. Next year  we

shall   see  a  further  retrenchment,  but  not   in

substantial  numbers some 5,000. The  following  year

will see a larger decline in employment another 8,000

or  so.  But the real crunch will come in  1971  when

19,500  persons  of all categories  would  have  been

declared



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



redundant    on   the   closure   of   all    Service

establishments. The annual redundancies, as  recorded

here,  differ  from the figures I gave  earlier  this

year  when,  in the absence of accurate data,  I  had

assumed a constant rate of rundown. The British time-

table  is  now made up, and the rundown begins  at  a

slow  pace until the very last year. Accordingly  the

counter-recession programme outlined earlier needs to

be revised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the year 1971 from all accounts will be a

difficult one, and it is well that we lay up a  store

of fat to meet that lean year. We have taken a number

of measures which are intended to help redundant base

workers.  They  include  the Central  Provident  Fund

scheme  into  which all gratuities are deposited  and

from which regular amounts can be drawn, so that  the

redundant  worker  can  have a longer  period  during

which  to  find work and adjust to the new situation.

We have also introduced a training scheme to fit them

for  new occupations in industry. It is obviously not

possible  to  ensure  that each and  every  redundant

worker  finds  a  job congenial to  him.  Nor  is  it

possible to deal with redundant workers individually.

The  problem  is  too large for an approach  of  this

kind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best guarantee that adjustment to new conditions

will be relatively prompt and painless is to ensure a

sufficiently fast growth of the economy.  With  rapid

economic  growth, there will be a rising  demand  for

all  categories  of workers, and within  this  rising

demand there will be more opportunities for redundant

workers  to  find new jobs. This leads me to  discuss

the general economic conditions now facing us and the

immediate prospects ahead.



<br><br><i>State of the economy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year the economy has had another good year.

Trade continues to expand. Port activities remain  at

a  high level. Manufacturing output and sales are  up

because the productive capacity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



of   the   industrial  sector  has   been   enlarged.

Construction, too, shows good progress  and,  all  in

all, there has been satisfactory all-round growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary estimates of the gross domestic

expenditure  for  1968  indicate  that  despite   the

British military rundown the economy has grown by 7.7

per  cent since last year. Gross domestic expenditure

is  estimated  at  $3,850  million.  With  population

growth  now  at less than two per cent  a  year,  per

capita  gross, domestic expenditure has increased  by

nearly six per cent to a level of $1,940.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic growth is associated with the rate of

investment in fixed assets undertaken by the economy.

It  is  particularly gratifying, therefore,  to  note

that this year, gross domestic capital formation  or,

to  use  a  more familiar term, total investment  has

increased  by 17 per cent over 1967. Total investment

this  year  is  estimated  to  be  $606  million,  as

compared  with $518 million last year. The  share  of

investment   in   gross  domestic   expenditure   has

increased  to  15.7 per cent from 14.5  per  cent  in

1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good performance of the economy is reflected in

no  small measure in the upward surge of trade. Total

trade  for  the  first nine months of this  year  was

valued  at $6,720 million, up 14.5 per cent from  the

corresponding  period  last  year.  Exports  totalled

$2,880  million  and  imports $3,840  million.  Cargo

handled  at  the harbours reflected this increase  in

trade  activities.  From January  to  September  this

year,  a  total  of  26.5 million freight  tons  were

discharged  and loaded at the ports as compared  with

22.6  million freight tons for the same  period  last

year.  This represents an increase of 17.4 per  cent.

Reflecting this, increase, more ships called  at  our

ports.  Up  to  September this year, 11,600  vessels.

with a total tonnage of 47 million tons had called at

Singapore, an increase of 15.0 per cent and 11.5  per

cent respectively over 1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion in trade is partly the result of

continued growth in the manufacturing sector. As  the

manufacturing sector grows, it requires more raw



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



materials,  plant  and  machinery  to  be   imported.

Similarly, as industries go into production, they too

export more and more of their products. The quarterly

index  of industrial production for the first quarter

of  this  year stood at 121.3; for the second quarter

at  129.4;  for  the  third quarter,  at  131.4.  The

average  for  the whole of 1967 was 111.1;  the  base

year  for  the index is 1966. As at the end  of  June

this   year,   there  were  174  pioneer   firms   in

production, an increase of 47 firms over  last  year.

These  have a total fixed investment of $436  million

and a combined output of $472 million. Investment and

output  increased by no less than 19.0 per  cent  and

64.0  per  cent respectively from the previous  year.

Pioneer  industries  now employ  18,780  workers,  an

increase of 5,380 over last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another indicator of increased commercial and

manufacturing activities is the volume of electricity

consumed  by  industrial and commercial  enterprises.

This has gone up from 521 million kilowatt hours  for

the first nine months of 1967 to 659 million kilowatt

hours up to September this year, an increase of  26.5

per   cent.   To  meet  this  increased  demand   for

electricity, a new power station is being constructed

in Jurong with an eventual capacity of 480 megawatts,

or  slightly larger than the present total  installed

capacity  of 464 megawatts. The first phase  will  be

completed  in  June  next year when  a  120  megawatt

generator will be commissioned. A second 120 megawatt

generator will go on stream in April 1971.  By  1974,

the total installed capacity in Singapore will be 944

megawatts, more than four times the 202 megawatts  we

had in 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building and construction, too, are making good

progress. Commencement of new buildings, however, has

slowed down somewhat. In the first half of this year,

6,140 units were commenced as against 8,320 units for

the same period last year. The decline was mostly  in

the  public sector. In terms of floor area,  however,

there  was  only  a  3.0 per cent decline,  from  6.7

million  square feet to 6.5 million square feet.  But

in terms of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



value, which is really what counts, there has been an

actual  increase of 8.8 per cent. The  value  of  the

buildings commenced in the first six months  of  1967

was $72 million as against $78.3 million for the same

period this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tourism, too, is having its day though the rate of

increase  in arrivals is only a shade of the previous

year's  spectacular increase of 70.5 per cent.  Never

theless, total arrivals of passengers by air and  sea

to  Singapore  numbered 181,570  up  to  the  end  of

September  this year, an increase of  25.3  per  cent

from  the  corresponding period last  year.  This  is

likely  to  be  the normal rate of growth  in  future

years rather than the spectacular figure achieved  in

1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now 58 tourist hotels with 2,570 rooms.

The occupancy rate is 83 per cent. Eighteen new first-

class  hotels are being built. These, when completed,

will  add some 6,000 rooms to the current stock.  Six

of the hotels are expected to be completed by the end

of  1969,  increasing the number of  hotel  rooms  by

1,610. With all these facilities, accommodation  will

not  be  the  bottleneck constricting the  inflow  of

visitors to Singapore in coming years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Symptomatic of the well-being of the economy is the

rise  in  the level of bank deposits. At a time  when

the  international  economy is  beset  with  monetary

crises, when sterling, the U.S, dollar and the French

franc   are  being  attacked  by  speculators,   bank

deposits  in  Singapore continue  to  increase,  from

$1,650  million at the end of September last year  to

$2,105 million at the end of September this year,  an

increase  of  27.3 per cent. The large  increases  in

bank deposits month after month since June 1967 could

not  possibly be due to the expanding economy  alone.

Inflow  of funds from abroad is possibly an important

contributory factor. If this is so, it  is  a  cogent

reflection of the confidence that people have in  the

currency of Singapore, and, in the final analysis, it

is a vote of confidence in the stability and strength

of the Singapore economy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Future Prospects</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, our economy was considerably boosted by

panic capital from Hong Kong and a good proportion of

this  year's  crop of new industries  represents  the

fruition of this capital inflow in 1967. But  in  the

next  two  years, the main impetus to our  growth  of

industry  will come not from Hong Kong  capital,  but

from American capital. As Hong Kong recovers from its

political troubles of last year, the number of  panic

enquiries has tailed off. However, Hong Kong interest

in  Singapore remains at a gratifying level. Projects

in  the  pipeline  represent  genuine  investment  in

search  of profit opportunities. Investment  of  this

kind  is  likely  to  be  more  productive  and  more

enduring.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our investment promotion programme in the

United  States  and Europe is still  in  its  initial

stages  of development, the results achieved  so  far

are   encouraging.  Large  international   companies,

mostly  American, are increasingly becoming aware  of

the  advantages that Singapore offers  to  investors.

Amongst the factors that they find attractive are our

political  stability, the national  determination  to

work  and  overcome  problems as  manifested  in  the

general  acceptance  of the new Employment  Act,  our

price  and  wage  stability,  a  sound  currency,   a

strategic  location,  an  honest  administration,  an

abundance of hardworking and adaptable workers,  high

labour    productivity   and   excellent    transport

facilities. No less important are the investment  and

export  incentives provided in the Economic Expansion

Act.  Also capital is available in abundance  and  on

good  terms. These ingredients for success have  been

confirmed  by  the  well-known  American  independent

business consultants, Business International, who  in

their  "Report to Managers of World Wide  Operations"

in February this year rated Singapore as an excellent

place to do business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The American companies are particularly interested

in  two  fields  of  activities in Singapore.  First,

there is a group of companies like Caterpillar, Allis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



Chalmers,   and  International  Minerals  Corporation

which  are  keen on using Singapore as a distribution

centre  and  an assembling base for South-East  Asia.

Other   American  companies  like  Santa  Fe-Pomeroy,

Dillingham Corporation, McDermott and Procon are also

interested  in  using  Singapore  as  a  supply   and

fabrication  base  for  oil  and  mineral   resources

development  projects in this region.  Singapore  can

provide  all the necessary engineering and supporting

services efficiently. This would not only benefit the

large   international   companies   but   also    the

neighbouring  countries,  as  the  provision  of   an

efficient  supporting  base  could  accelerate  their

development programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is a group of companies interested

in   manufacturing   a  wide  range   of   electronic

components,  electrical appliances and  other  instru

ments.     These    companies    include     National

Semiconductors  Corporation,  Texas  Instruments  and

Continental  Devices.  All  three  are  American  com

panies.  These  are very substantial investments  and

they will employ large labour forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to what has been mentioned, there are

other  projects  involving international  consortiums

for  the development of petrochemicals, steel,  paper

and pulp, fertilisers, watch-making, construction  of

fishery  vessels  and  other  specialised  ships  and

marine  structures,  prefabricated  houses,  internal

combustion  engines,  farm  implements  and   machine

tools.  Most  of these projects should  get  off  the

ground in the next two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, there are enough industrial investment

projects in the pipeline to keep the economy going at

a  brisk rate the next two years. All this will  make

it   easier  for  redundant  workers  to   find   new

employment  than would otherwise be the case.  In  my

previous Budget Statement I commented on the need  to

establish   new   institutions  to   strengthen   the

industrialisation effort. In my series  of  broadcast

talks last April, I elaborated upon the theme.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal was to set up three new institutions.

Two  grew out of the Economic Development Board;  the

third  is  an  entirely new project, an international

trading  company.  All these three institutions  have

been  launched and it seems appropriate on this  occa

sion  to report on progress achieved. The Development

Bank of Singapore, which was formed to take over  the

financing   functions  of  the  Economic  Development

Board,   has  been  successfully  launched.  It   was

formally   incorporated  on  July  16th,  1968,   and

commenced operations on the 1st September. The  staff

of the Bank was drawn initially from the E.D.B.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to financing purely manufacturing

undertakings, the Bank's financial scope  extends  to

include  tourist  and  estate  projects,  the  latter

relating  mainly  to projects established  under  the

urban  renewal  programme. The Development  Bank  has

taken  over from the Economic Development  Board  its

entire  loan portfolio. This includes loans to  small

industries advanced by the Light Industries  Services

as   well   as   special  loans   for   ship-breaking

operations.  The amount of loans transferred  to  the

Development Bank comes to $48.9 million. In addition,

some  $30 million worth of loan committed by the  Eco

nomic  Development Board has been taken over  by  the

Bank.  The transfer of loans from the E.D.B, to  the

Bank is a comparatively simple operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position in regard to equities, that is, shares

in   industrial  ventures  owned  by   the   Economic

Development  Board,  is  more  complex   because   of

problems  of valuation. Where the share is listed  in

the  Stock  Exchange, a clear-cut basis for valuation

exists, though the trouble here is that stock  prices

fluctuate  from  time to time. Where shares  are  not

listed,  it is not easy to find a mutually acceptable

price.  In the event, it was decided that the  entire

equity holding of the E.D.B, should be taken over  by

the   Government.  The  Government   will   similarly

undertake to pay up the balance of equities which had

not been fully paid up. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>



value  at  cost  of  these equities  comes  to  $25.2

million  with  a further $3.4 million equity  capital

remaining to be paid up. In addition to these,  there

are  a  number  of  equity commitments  made  by  the

E.D.B., paid-up capital of which has not been called.

Such equities will be taken over by the Bank and  the

value  of  these equities comes to $8.5  million.  In

addition, the Bank has taken over guarantees made  by

the   E.D.B, on  behalf  of  manufacturers   making

purchases  of  plant  and  equipment.  The  value  of

outstanding guarantees as on 26th November this  year

is $14.1 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bank has a total paid-up capital of $100

million.  An invitation to subscribe to this  capital

by   providing  subscription  to  local   banks   and

financial  institutions as well as by  public  invita

tion  was well received. In the allocation of  shares

to  the  public, special consideration was  given  to

small  investors and all applications  of  $2,000  or

less were accepted in full.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Bank's future operations the

Government  will extend to the bank credit  lines  of

$30  million  in the first instance and  another  $50

million  on  exhaustion of the first line of  credit.

Interest  will be at a rate of 4 per cent per  annum.

These  funds will be used by the Bank to extend loans

to  industries at a rate of interest not exceeding  7

per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bank will also raise additional funds from

local, foreign and international institutions.  These

operations  of  the Bank will be governed  purely  by

commercial  considerations. A  high  level  technical

team  from the Investment Bank of the German  Federal

Government,  Kreditanstalt fuer  Weideraufbau  (KFW),

arrived in Singapore last month to advise the Bank on

internal organisation and in the formulation  of  its

operating  policy. The KFW team stayed  in  Singapore

for  three  weeks  and  has submitted  a  preliminary

report.  The  German Investment Bank  has  also  been

asked  to  assist  our Bank in the initial  years  by

seconding  a number of senior staff. The Chairman  of

the Bank is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



Mr  Hon  Sui Sen who has rendered such distinguished service  as

Chairman  of the Economic Development Board. I have little  doubt

that under his leadership and guidance, the Bank will grow into a

powerful  institution  for  promoting  economic  development   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the second institution, the International Trading

Company, or INTRACO, to use its registered name. The Company  was

incorporated  on  the  5th  November, 1968.  With  an  authorised

capital  of  50 million shares of one dollar each,  of  which  20

million shares are being issued, only 50 cents per share is being

called up immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTRACO will be jointly owned by the Government of Singapore

with  six  million shares, the Development Bank with 3.8  million

shares  and  the  private sector with 10.2  million  shares.  The

private sector allocation has been substantially over-subscribed.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the three institutions, INTRACO, in my opinion, is the most

complex,   difficult  and  challenging  undertaking.  While   the

Development  Bank and the Jurong Town Corporation were  built  on

the  foundation of solid achievement ol the Economic  Development

Board, INTRACO has to blaze its own trail not in Singapore but in

the  outside  world.  It  has to meet  fierce  international  com

petition from all quarters in promoting the export of Singapore's

goods. This is not a task that can be accomplished over-night and

the  directors  of  INTRACO have wisely  decided  upon  a  phased

programme.  The  Company is still in its infant  stages  and  its

future progress will no doubt be watched with interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third institution, the Jurong Town Corporation, takes over

from  the  E.D.B, the ownership and management of the  industrial

estate  in  Jurong and six other places in Kallang, Tiong  Bahru,

Kampong Ampat, Tanglin Halt, Kallang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



Park  and  Tanjong Rhu. The number of factories in production  on

the  Corporation's land totals 293 at the last count  in  October

this  year. They gave employment to more than 21,000 persons  and

involved  a capital investment of $588 million. In addition,  the

Corporation  runs a number of other enterprises.  It  owns  4,450

flats and 150 shophouses in Jurong. The flats are virtually  full

up.  There is, in fact, a shortage of housing in Jurong and  some

1.384  flats are under construction, some of which will be  ready

for  occupation  in  the middle of next  year.  As  a  result  of

industrial  investment  reaching a rate which  exceeded  planning

expectations, there is currently a severe shortage  of  available

factory space. To meet this excess demand, nine blocks of flatted

factories are under construction with a total floor area of  more

than a million square feet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the major enterprises undertaken in Jurong is the

construction  of  a  new port there. More than  $25  million  was

spent, with 3,000 feet of wharves and various facilities for  the

mechanical handling of bulk cargo. The increase of cargo  handled

in Jurong since the completion of the port has been satisfactory.

In  1967 the volume of cargo handled was 342,000 tons. In the  11

months of this year the volume of cargo handled was increased  to

478,000  tons;  in addition some 121,000 heads of livestock  were

also  handled. This latter is a direct result of the construction

of the abattoir in Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some problems still remain to be resolved in Jurong in addition

to  the preparation of more factory sites and dwelling houses. It

is  necessary to improve social amenities there. The  Corporation

is   taking  action  on  this.  One  pleasing  outcome   of   the

establishment  of  the  Corporation has  been  the  comprehensive

review  undertaken of their accounting system. The new system  of

accounts  enables  a  separate assessment  to  be  made  of  each

separate operation of the Corporation to assess its profitability

as  determined  on  commercial  principles.  It  was  a  pleasant

surprise for me to discover that after allowing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



for  an adequate rate of depreciation of assets,  the

overall  return on capital invested by the Government

in  Jurong's  social  and industrial  infra-structure

comes  to  three  per cent. I had  expected  a  lower

figure and was even prepared for a loss. This outcome

reflects credit on the land and lease policy  of  the

E.D.B.  In  future years, we can expect  the  revenue

accruing  to the Jurong Town Corporation to  increase

both with the increasing number of industries as well

as  increases in lease payments. Eventually,  we  can

hope to get a return of seven or eight per cent.



<br><br><i>Estimates, 1969</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now turn to the Estimates before Parliament. Last year I promised that I would circulate a Treasury Paper each on the Ordinary and Development Estimates setting out in detail, under each Head and Subhead, changes in such expenditures and the reasons therefor. These two Treasury Papers

are  now before the House and provide all the details

required.  This arrangement will allow me to  comment

on  the Estimates in broad terms and thus to avoid  a

tedious  enumeration  of  figures.  Those  who   want

particular   details  can  refer  to   the   Treasury

memoranda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first major change in the presentation of the

Estimates is the change in the basis of the financial

year.  Since living recollection, the financial  year

in  the  Singapore Government accounts has  been  the

calendar  year.  It  is  now  proposed  to  take  the

financial year as the period 1st April of one year to

31st  March  of  the  following  year.  There  is  an

advantage in so doing. It will be possible under  the

new  arrangement  to  give a proper  account  of  the

functioning  of  the  economy  during  the  preceding

calendar year. At present Members would have  noticed

the  rather  sketchy  manner in  which  the  economic

performance  of  the Republic has  been  reported  in

annual  budget  statements.  Statistical  records  of

foreign   trade  and  calculations  .of  balance   of

payments and national income aggregates are  made  in

periods



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



of calendar years. Putting the start of the financial

year  forward  by three months should  enable  us  to

obtain  a  proper account of these useful statistical

aggregates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the effect of this change in the Estimates

of  this  year  is to complicate the presentation  of

this  and  the  next  budget.  The  figures  in   the

Estimates before Parliament relate to a period of  15

months,  whereas  the figures with which  comparisons

are made, that is for the calendar year 1968, cover a

period   of   12   months.  This  complication   will

eventually  be  eliminated  in  the  financial   year

commencing April 1971 and thereafter. For purposes of

comparison in my address, I will not take the amounts

as  entered in the Estimates, that is to say the  15-

month   totals,  but  the  annual  rate  so  that   a

meaningful comparison can be made with 1968.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substantial increase in Defence expenditure has

affected   the   entire  financial  policy   of   the

Government. In order to finance expenditure  of  this

magnitude, the Government has to adopt the  following

policy:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) As far as possible, advantage is to be taken

of  deferred  credit payments  from  suppliers  of

equipment and weapons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Full advantage is to be taken of the British

defence  aid proposal which offers a total  amount

of �50  million sterling in soft loans and grants

for  the  purchase  of  goods  and  services  from

Britain,  both for defence and for non-defence  ex-

penditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) As far as possible, non-defence expenditure

is  to  be retained at existing levels, increases

being  allowed  only  for  normal  annual  salary

increments  and  for  new  proposals  which  have

exceptional

merit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) In spite of savings produced by stringent

economy  and  by recourse to credit payments  and

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British aid, it has been proved necessary to

introduce new taxes and to increase the  rates  of

some existing taxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain Ministries and departments which provide

economic     services,     for     instance,      the

Telecommunications Department and the Civil  Aviation

Department, are not to be starved of funds and are to

be  given  normal additional expenditure required  to

meet the demands of normal growth. Similarly revenue-

producing    departments   are   allowed   reasonable

increases in staff. Apart from this, any increase  in

expenditure  will only be sanctioned if the  Ministry

concerned can offer offset reductions in other  items

of expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the total Defence budget to be incurred in the

calendar  year  1969 were to be paid  on  the  normal

Government basis, that is, on a cash basis, a sum  of

$337.5 million would need to be provided. This refers

to the expenditure of the Armed Forces alone and does

not  include  Police  and other  expenditure  of  the

Ministry  of Defence. This is a substantial  increase

on the $47.6 million provided for the Armed Forces in

the  1968 Estimates. I should, however, mention  that

the expenditure actually incurred on the Armed Forces

in 1968 is considerably larger than this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the sum of $337.5 million, a part must be paid in

cash.  For instance, the pay of soldiers and payments

of contractors' bills can hardly be settled on credit

terms. The amount of such expenditure comes to $117.3

million.  A further sum of $156.3 million relates  to

purchases of weapons and equipment for which recourse

to  credit is available. Finally there is  a  sum  of

$63.9  million  which could be  paid  out  of  United

Kingdom  Defence  Aid  funds.  These  are  the  three

components adding up lo $337.5 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial provision required in the calendar

year  1969  to meet such expenditure comes to  $205.1

million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



This  is  made up of inescapable cash expenditure  of

$117.3 million and a further sum representing advance

payment  on credit purchases that have to be made  in

the  calendar  year.  This sum includes  payments  on

credits incurred in previous years. The total  amount

of  such payments on credit purchases comes to  $87.8

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the total of $205.1 million, a cash liability,

that  is, the total cash liability, for 1969,  $157.2

million  is  incurred  in respect  of  items  in  the

Ordinary  Estimates and $47.9 million is  expenditure

on  development projects appearing in the Development

Estimates.  In addition to these cash outlays,  there

is  of course the item I referred to earlier of $63.9

million,  being  purchases of British  equipment  and

weapons paid out of the United Kingdom aid fund. This

expenditure  is  not  entered  under  the   head   of

"Ministry  of  Interior and Defence", but  under  the

"Ministry of Finance". As a contra item the same  sum

has  been  entered as a revenue item. The reason  for

putting  this  under the heading of the "Ministry  of

Finance"  is that payments for these items will  have

to   be  made  in  the  first  instance  out  of  the

Consolidated Fund and subsequently recouped from  the

U.K.  Aid  account.  To keep the accounting  of  such

transactions  under direct supervision,  the  unusual

device of entering the Defence expenditure under  the

Finance Ministry has been resorted to.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not necessary for me to discuss non-defence

expenditure at any length a~ the Treasury Papers give

all  the  numerical  details.  The  broad  policy  of

keeping  non-defence expenditure, especially that  on

education and social services, on a standstill  basis

has  enabled  most  of the substantial  increases  in

Defence cash expenditure to be met out of the  normal

growth of revenue. The revenue for the calendar



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



year  1969 is estimated at $759.2 million as compared

with  the 1968 Estimates of $646.7 million, in  other

words, there is an estimated revenue increase  of  no

less  than  $112.5  million.  This  increase  results

partly  from increased revenue yields due to economic

growth  and partly because the 1968 revenue estimates

appear to have been substantially underestimated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curbing of non-defence expenditure together with

the  increases in revenue yields has enabled us  very

nearly to secure a balance on revenue and expenditure

on  the  current cash account. Taking  the  financial

year of 15 months, that is to say, 1st January, 1969,

to  31st  March.  1970, expenditure is  estimated  at

$1,024.9  million. Total revenue almost comes  up  to

this amount, the shortfall being a mere $9.2 million.

However, this does not take into account the need  to

transfer   money   from  current   account   to   the

development  fund,  a  practice which  has  continued

without fail since my first Budget of 1959. In recent

years,  the annual transfer is $30 million, and  over

the  15-month  period this would mean $37.5  million.

Taking the shortfall of

$9.2 million and $37.5 million, there is a total  sum

of $46.7 million to be met. I propose to meet this by

raising additional taxes to yield $35 million for the

15-month period. The balance of $11.7 million can  be

met by transfers from our reserves.



<br><br><i>New Taxes</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the subject which everybody is waiting

for  -  and in most instances wrongly guessed namely,

the  new  taxes.  There  has  been  a  good  deal  of

speculation about this and it had been necessary  for

me  to  issue  a clarification to dispel  unwarranted

gloom and to reassure people that the new taxes would

not   have   any   damaging  effect   on   investment

incentives. This, of course, is a sine qua non of our

economic  strategy.  We try to get  increased  yields

mostly by fast growth of the economy. Even for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>



coming year, as I have explained, the greater cost of

Defence  expenditure will be paid  for  more  out  of

increased revenue yields due to economic growth  than

by new taxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have in mind seven new tax proposals: three of

them  involve increases or changes in existing  rates

of  taxes, four of them are completely new taxes.  By

spreading the load over seven tax measures, we reduce

the  risk of adverse effect either on the economy  or

on  the  revenue  itself which might  come  about  by

concentrating  on one or two items. These  new  taxes

will  not have the effect of impairing incentives  to

economic   development   or   of   discouraging   and

disrupting the flow of foreign investment. They  have

also been so selected that the least burden will fall

on the poorer sections of the community. The four new

taxes are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) A 10 per cent levy on monthly charges of

the Public Utilities Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) A small duty on liquid petroleum gas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) A 15 per cent levy on telephone bills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) A 15 per cent import duty on made-up

garments, excluding furs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards old taxes, there will be a change in the

basis  of  valuation  of motor  vehicles,  a  general

revision  of  stamp duties, and an  increase  in  the

transfer  fee of motor vehicles. Let me discuss  each

of these new tax measures in turn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The levy on public utility services supplied to

consumers will take effect by legislation which  will

be introduced in Parliament shortly. The levy will be

collected by the Public Utilities Board on behalf  of

the Government. The advantage of this arrangement  is

that  110  new  machinery of tax collection  need  be

established,   and  the  additional   cost   of   tax

collection is virtually nil. The rates have  been  so

calculated  that families in the lowest income  group

will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



not be affected. Large numbers of these families live

in  Housing  Board  flats  and  elsewhere  and  their

monthly bill does not exceed $10. No rate of tax will

be imposed on those whose monthly bills do not exceed

$10. No less than 58,000 consumers, or 25 per cent of

the  total,  fall in this category. For  those  whose

bills fall between $10 and $20 a month, a lower  rate

of  five  per cent is levied. The number of consumers

falling  in  this  category amounts to  approximately

73,000,  that is, 32 per cent of the total. The  full

10  per  cent  rate  will apply to  households  whose

monthly  bills  exceed $20 a month. This  means  that

only  the wealthier 43 per cent of consumers pay  the

full rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tax will apply to all consumers of public

utilities  with  two exceptions. The  first  are  the

poorer   families  I  referred  to.  The   next   are

industries  which  depend  on  power  supply   to   a

significant extent. They already qualify for  special

industrial power rates. In order not to reduce  their

competitive  position, I intend to exempt  them  from

this levy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yield of this tax is expected to amount to $11

million for the coming financial year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to protect P.U.B, gas and electric

supply  as  a  means of fuel supply for  cooking  and

therefore a compensating tax on liquid petroleum  gas

is  necessary.  A rate of three cents  a  pound  will

maintain  the comparative advantages of the different

sources  of cooking fuel at their present level,  and

this  tax  is  expected  to yield  $800,000  for  the

financial year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from 1st January, 1969, subscribers to the

Singapore  Telephone Board will pay a tax of  15  per

cent  on  their bills. This amounts to an  additional

payment of $27 a year by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



each domestic subscriber and $37.50 per line per year

for each business line. Collection will be undertaken

by the Singapore Telephone Board. The yield of tax is

estimated at $3.8 million for the financial year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Import duties are to be introduced on made-up

garments  for the first time. It is quite amazing  to

me that while we are exporting substantial quantities

of garments to the United States, Britain and Western

Europe, we continue to import vast quantities of made-

up  garments.  The value of annual imports  comes  to

more than $50 million. The receipts from these duties

are estimated at $12 million for the financial year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, of course, no reason why local consumers

cannot  buy  our locally-manufactured  garments  when

Americans,   Swiss,  Englishmen  and  Europeans   are

satisfied  with  their quality. If,  however,  people

still prefer imported clothes as against locally-made

clothes, it is not unfair to require them to  make  a

special contribution to the Defence effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose to revise the present system of assessing

the  value  of motor vehicles on which the additional

registration  fee  is levied. The  present  basis  of

assessment  for imported vehicles is a  C.I.F, value

and for locally-assembled vehicles the equivalent  of

C.I.F, value.  This  latter  figure  is  a  notional

quantity   and   is  likely  to  become  increasingly

fictitious  as an increasing proportion  of  vehicles

registered  come from our local assembly  plants.  It

is,  therefore,  necessary to revise the  system  and

adopt a more realistic basis. With effect from today,

the  additional  registration fee which  will  remain

unchanged will be based on "open market value".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the "open market value" system, the assessment

is  based  not only on the C.I.F, value but  also  on

other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>



incidental   costs,   such   as   handling   charges,

advertisement costs and agency commission. Generally,

the "open market value" will be between 10 and 15 per

cent higher than the C.I.F.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been instances of under declaration of

C.I.F, values   by  importers  in  collusion   with

suppliers,  which  has  resulted  in  an  evasion  of

revenue  collected by the Registry of  Vehicles.  The

new  basis of assessment is in line with the practice

in Malaysia and in the Customs Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of this change to a more realistic

valuation is to increase slightly the additional  tax

payable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increases are likely to range from $20 in the

case  of a cheap car to $180 in the case of the  more

expensive models.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto, locally-assembled commercial vehicles and

omnibuses  have  not been subject to  tax.  This  was

because  until  recently there  have  been  no  local

assemblies,  it is proposed, with effect from  today,

to  impose  an  ad valorem tax of five  per  cent  on

commercial  vehicles  and  omnibuses.  This  levy  is

similar to the existing levy that has been payable on

commercial  vehicles  and  omnibuses  imported   from

Commonwealth  countries. The  yield  from  these  two

measures for the financial year is estimated at  $1.6

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also propose to levy a transfer fee of two per

cent on the value of vehicles ~ transfer of ownership

subject to a minimum fee of $5 for a motor-cycle  and

$20  for a motor car. The yield is expected to be  $2

million for the financial year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will also be a revision of stamp duties At

present,  the annual yield from stamp duties  amounts

to $9 million. As hon. Members know, stamp duties are

payable   on   a  large  variety  of  documents   and

instruments - on receipts, cheques, transfer of title

deeds, and so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>



on.  The last revision was done in 1952. Previous  to

that,  the last major revision was way back in  1931.

In  fact, nearly half the rates applicable today were

levied  in  1931, and the present revision  does  not

introduce  any drastic changes in rates and  charges,

but  is  more in keeping with present-day conditions.

The  revisions  in stamp duty rates are  expected  to

yield  an  additional  $3.8  million  in  the  coming

financial year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I began my address with Defence expenditure and

I  will  conclude on the same theme.  The  new  taxes

which  I  have just announced will help  to  pay  for

rather   less  than  10  per  cent  of  our   Defence

expenditure incurred next year calculated on a, cash

basis. We are fortunate in being able to offset  part

of the expenditure with British aid while, in respect

of  another substantial amount, we can take advantage

of  credit  terms offered by suppliers.  But  in  the

main, the additional expenditure has been financed by

siphoning  off  the major part of additional  revenue

away  from  non-defence expenditure towards  Defence.

This   is   achieved   by   maintaining   non-defence

expenditure on a virtually standstill basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same pattern of expenditure is expected to

continue over the next three years, that is  to  say,

by placing a ceiling available for the development of

the  social services and on health and education.  We

allow most of the additional revenues resulting  from

economic  growth  to  be channelled  towards  Defence

expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the price that we are paying. The cost is

not  so  much the additional burdens which  taxpayers

have to meet by the new measures. The cost is in  the

limitation  of expenditure on non-defence  items.  We

get  a bigger armed force by spending that much  less

money  on  schools and on universities and on  better

health and social services.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes without saying that nobody regards this with

any  great pleasure. But there would be few who would

be  bold  enough  to say that what we  are  doing  is

unnecessary and wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the British military withdrawal is completed in

1971, a new era will dawn on us. This event is likely

to  he no less significant than our departure in 1965

from  the Federation of Malaysia. Since 1965, we have

proved  that as a separate economic entity  Singapore

has  a  far  greater  survival  potential  than  many

people,  here  and elsewhere, had believed  possible.

After  1971,  we  have  to go through  another  test,

perhaps  a more exacting and rigorous test, and  that

is  our  survival  potential as a separate  political

entity  in  a  difficult and turbulent  part  of  the

world.  If  in the intervening years we have  put  to

good account our resources in money, manpower, skills

and organisation, I believe we shall pass the test of

political  survival  as  adequately  as  we  are  now

passing the test of economic survival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, renewal of driving licences, and vehicle

licences  is  being carried out at  the  Registry  of

Vehicles, Middle Road. As there are now approximately

320,000  driving  licence holders and  254,000  motor

vehicles,  the congestion at the Registry, especially

during the first ten days of each month, is very  bad

indeed,  thus causing great inconvenience to  members

of  the public and to the over-worked staff, as well.

These  numbers are increasing steadily,  so  much  so

that the situation has become untenable and should be

rectified early.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards the end of last year, the problem was

studied  jointly  by  a team of  officials  from  the

Organisation and Methods Branch, the Electronic  Data

Processing  Unit and the Registry of  Vehicles.  They

came quickly to the conclusion that the congestion at

the  Registry  of Vehicles can only  be  relieved  if

renewal of licences is decentralised, In other words,

licences  should not be renewed at one central  place

only,  but should instead be renewed at post  offices

throughout  the island, as in the case of  television

and  radio licences. However, at the start,  only  15

selected  post offices will be used out of a possible

42.  This  team also recommended that the  scheme  be

implemented  in  two  stages. For  the  first  stage,

driving  licences are to be renewed at post  offices,

leaving  the  renewal  of  vehicle  licences  to   be

implemented  at  the second stage. The  scheme  recom

mended by them also includes the use of computers  to

record  and check the particulars on driving licences

to enable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>



the Registry of Vehicles to send reminders to licence

holders before the expiry of their licences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before the House seeks to implement

these proposals, i.e., to decentralise the renewal of

driving  licences  and for the use  of  computers  to

record and check particulars on driving licences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now. Sir, elaborate further on the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ordinance at present requires applicants for

driving licences to furnish photographs and,  in  the

case  of paid drivers, to permit fingerprints  to  be

taken.  Since photographs and fingerprints cannot  be

recorded  by  the computer, the existing requirements

are  to  be  dispensed with and this is  effected  by

amending section 13 of the Ordinance in clause  3  of

the  Bill. However, the necessary identification  can

still  be maintained by the fact that the new driving

licence  will bear the holder's identity card  number

and, in the case of foreigners, a special number will

be  allotted.  As for fingerprints, the Registrar  of

Vehicles  still has powers under section  18  of  the

Ordinance to take fingerprints, if he so desires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill also amends section 13 (8) of

the  Ordinance which provides that a driving  licence

shall  remain valid for one year or three years  from

the date on which it was granted as the applicant may

elect  at the time of application. Since the computer

is  programmed to work in monthly cycles, it will  be

necessary to provide that licences expire on the last

day  of  each  month.  For instance,  under  the  new

system, a licence taken out on 12th August, 1968, for

one  year  will expire on 31st August, 1969, (instead

of 12-8-69). Eventually, therefore, all licences will

expire  on  the last day of the month, and will  then

become  renewable on the first day of  the  following

month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 14 (1) of the existing Ordinance provides

that  a  driving licence shall not be granted  unless

the  applicant  satisfies the Registrar  of  Vehicles

that he has at some time passed the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>



prescribed tests. The operating words "at some  time"

mean  that a licence may have lapsed for an unlimited

period  and  can  still  be renewed.  Under  the  new

system,  as provided for in clauses 4 and  5  of  the

Bill,  the  computer will maintain records for  three

years  only,  so  a licence which has  lapsed  for  a

continuous   period   of   three   years   will    be

automatically  cancelled, and  the  person  concerned

will have to apply for a fresh licence and to undergo

and pass the usual tests. However, provision will  be

made  under  the  rules  for  persons  to  apply  for

deferment  of  renewal  for, various  reasons,  like

extended  illness,  travel  abroad,  etc.,  and  thus

"preserve" the licence for subsequent renewal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 21 of the Ordinance contains provisions

relating  to  endorsements on driving licences.  This

section  has  to  be  repealed  on  account  of   the

limitations  of  the  computer  system  which  cannot

record the endorsements on driving licences, and also

in  view  of the fact that such endorsements do  not,

even  at present, serve much useful purpose. Instead,

the Registrar of Vehicles will now record particulars

of   convictions  of  certain  offences  and  of  any

disqualification and will maintain such records for a

period of three years from the date of the conviction

of  expiry of such disqualification, as the case  may

be.  The amendment to section 21 of the Ordinance  is

contained in clause 7 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is taken in clause 8 of the Bill to

amend  section 41 of the Ordinance so as  to  empower

the  Registrar of Vehicles, or any officer authorised

by  him,  to  seize a vehicle found  to  be  used  in

contravention of any provision of the Ordinance or of

any rule, order or prohibition made thereunder or  of

any term of the licence for such vehicle. At present,

the  power to seize a vehicle is vested solely in the

hands of the police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to add, Sir, that as the computerised driving

licence  renewal scheme represents a  radical  change

from  the  present system, adequate  notice  will  be

given to present licence holders;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



in  particular, drivers whose driving  licences  have

lapsed  for  more  than three  years  will  be  given

sufficient  time to renew their licences  before  the

provisions  relating to automatic  cancellations  are

brought  into force. As I have said earlier, a  start

is  to be made for renewal of driving licences to  be

carried out at post offices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this has got well under way and administrative

problems have been ironed out, a further scheme  will

be  introduced so that vehicle licences may  also  be

renewed  at post offices, thus relieving the  present

congestion at the Registry of Vehicles, and  we  will

then be able to provide better service to members  of

the  public and more congenial conditions of work for

the staff as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House may remember that the Singapore

Council  of  Social Service Bill was  referred  to  a

Select Committee by a resolution of Parliament passed

on 22nd May, 1968. In response to an advertisement in

the  Press  on  28th May, 1968, and to the  publicity

over Radio and Television,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



inviting  the public to make representations  on  the

Bill,  only one written representation was  received.

In  addition,  the Select Committee also  heard  oral

evidence  from  the  person  who  had  submitted  the

written representation as well as the representatives

of  the  Singapore Council of Social Service after  a

statutory  declaration was submitted to the Committee

declaring  that  the Bill had the  agreement  of  the

members of the Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the amendments suggested by the

representors have been accepted. These amendments are

set  out on pages C3, C4, C5 and C6 of the Select Com

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move. "That the Bill  be  now

read a Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two major provisions embodied in the Bill to

control advertisements have come through unchanged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The prohibition of advertisements in clause 3

on  medicines, remedies or appliances for  the

treatment of certain medical conditions listed

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



the  schedule.  And the sale  of  medicines  is

specifically controlled under the provi

sion  of clause 7 which requires the disclosure

of  the  active ingredients of the medicine  on

the  label. The label to be written in  English

as  well as the language of the origin  of  the

medicine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The prohibition of advertisements relating to

a person's medical skills or services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prohibition of self-advertisement and

advertisements   for   the   treatment   of   certain

conditions  forms  the core of  the  Bill.  They  are

necessary for the effective control of the more  flag

rant and exaggerated claims which mislead and exploit

the  sufferings  and  anxieties  of  our  people   by

unscrupulous people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two provisions were not seriously challenged

and  have  generally been accepted in  principle.  In

fact,  there  was  one  written representation  which

stated  that the ban on advertisements should  extend

to  all  diseases or medical conditions. The purpose,

however,  of  the Bill is to control effectively  the

more  flagrant  and exaggerated advertisements  which

are  commonly  published and which purport  to  offer

cures  and  effective treatment of  conditions  which

would  probably be best left to trained  professional

persons or be undertaken in medical institutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese Physicians' Association have declared

themselves  in  support of the prohibition  of  self-

advertisements  and advertisements for  services.  In

their  case, they are handicapoed by the  lack  of  a

disciplinary  board. The amendment  will,  therefore,

reinforce  the  hand  of physicians  of  the  Chinese

school  which  will  now be able to  reinforce  their

stand by law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some reservations were expressed on the banning of

advertisements  entirely.  A  suggestion   was   that

"exaggerated" advertisements only should be  prohibit

ed,  but advertisements might be allowed if they  are

not more than 10 square



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



inches and limited to giving the practitioner's  name

and  address.  Another suggested that only  "genuine"

practitioners,  in contra-distinction  to  the  bogus

practitioners, may be allowed to advertise. These, of

course,  are unrealistic. It is impossible to  define

when  an  advertisement is exaggerated or  otherwise,

and  there is no real way of distinguishing  the  so-

called   "genuine"   from  the  "bogus"   physicians,

especially  those who claim to practise  the  various

systems  of  Eastern medicine which are  traditional,

without  set standards of training, examinations,  or

disciplinary bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two minor amendments have been made to the Bill in

the Select Committee. Clause 2 adds to the definition

of  an  advertisement  with the expression  "and  any

other form of advertising".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment was made following the representation

of the Pharmacists' Association. The Secretary of the

Pharmacists'  Association had drawn attention  to  an

ambiguity  in  the definition of "advertisement".  In

the  original Ordinance the definition of  "advertise

ment" was adequate to control advertisements for  the

listed conditions. As the amendment Bill extends  the

control   of  advertisements  to  prohibit   personal

advertisements, that is, advertisements referring  to

a person's ability or skills, or services offered, it

is    necessary   to   extend   the   definition   of

"advertisement" accordingly. However, by doing so, it

would  mean that the control of advertisements  would

extend  to prohibiting certain legitimate name-plates

used  by  medical  and dental practitioners  or  sign

boards   of   clinics  or  dispensaries  where   such

professional practitioners work. Obviously, it is not

the intention to prohibit such legitimate sign-boards

or   name-plates.  Therefore,  an  exemption   c1ause

(clause 8) has been added in order to give the  power

to the Minister to determine which advertisements may

be exempted from the provisions of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obviously impossible to define the limits of

advertisements  when they would come  under  control,

and when they do not. Rather than making



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



frequent  amendments to the law, which  will  require

the  complex  procedure of introduction  and  passage

through Parliament, the Minister is given the  discre

tion to determine the classes of advertisements which

are  exempted  from  time to time.  A  body  of  case

practice will eventually be formed which will help to

determine  the  application  of  the  law   and   its

regulations  and  define what may be  advertised  and

what may not be advertised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passage of this Bill will provide for more

effective  control  over  advertisements  on  medical

matters  which  have  not  been  possible  under  the

original Ordinance.

<div align="center"><b>DISCONTINUATION OF TOTO</b></div>



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, several month

have  elapsed  since  the Government  in  this  House

approved  the  introduction of Toto.  After  a  close

analysis  and  observation of Toto  and  the  various

reactions towards it, we have discovered one  feature

which is quite contradictory lo the purpose for which

Toto  was  introduced  by  Government.  This  was  to

provide some kind of game for the public in order  to

raise funds from them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



for  use  in the construction of the National  Sports

Complex.  Briefly,  that  was  the  original  aim  in

introducing Toto.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As everybody knows, the main aim of the construction

of  the  National  Sports Complex  is  to  provide  a

suitable  place  and  adequate  facilities  for   the

training of our youths in the field of sports,  which

is  in  line  with our national slogan of building  a

robust  society. However, from the operation of  Toto

at  the  present juncture, we can see  for  ourselves

that the trend is that we will finally end up with  a

loss  instead of a gain. This is because Toto, as  it

is  now,  has become a form of gambling open  to  the

public.  Irrespective of their age, they  indulge  in

this  game. We can see that they come from the public

service and other walks of life. Members of the civil

service are so preoccupied with Toto that they do not

pay  much attention to their work. I have come across

one case like this. A member of the civil service was

on  the  phone  and  was asking what  were  the  best

numbers  for the day. As a result of this,  he  might

have neglected his duties. This was only a chance dis

covery  on my part. There are many other cases  which

may not have been discovered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there are other more serious

problems  arising  out  of Toto.  For  instance,  our

innocent  students  are  involved.  As  Toto   is   a

legalised  and  open form of gambling, many  students

take  an interest in it with the idea of having  some

fun. So they make use of their pocket money, which is

meant  for  better purposes, to bet on Toto.  I  have

received  several  letters in which  the  parents  of

these  students complain about Toto.  They  say  that

their children take part in the game and they express

anxiety  for  their children if Toto  is  allowed  to

continue.  Mr Speaker, Sir, if the opinion  is  that

Toto  is  not  harmful  to students,  then  I  cannot

understand  why I have received such complaints  from

the  parents.  If we go further into the  problem  of

Toto,  we  find ourselves faced with these questions.

What will happen if a student strikes the first prize

in  Toto and what use will he make of the money? Does

it mean that he will discontinue his studies and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



enjoy  life on the prize money, or will he invest  it

in the Jurong Industrial Estate?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have sufficient safeguards for our

security. We know that in the past few months someone

who was said to have won the first prize was followed

closely  by  would-be  extortioners,  kidnappers   or

blackmailers.  He received several ransom  notes  and

before  he got his prize money he kicked the  bucket.

These  are  some of the problems arising out  of  the

introduction   of  Toto  to  which  we   should   pay

attention. Must we encourage our people to gain money

by  unhealthy means? Singapore is a young country. We

can  say  that it is like a three-year old child  who

needs  a great deal of nutrition and healthy thinking

to  enrich  his mind in order that he may  tread  the

path to a great future when he grows up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we feel that the National Sports Complex is so

important  in building a rugged society,  then  there

should  be adequate provision in the Budget  for  the

construction of this sports complex. But  why  is  it

that  it  is  not adequately provided in the  Budget?

This  is  rather  ridiculous.  If  our  Minister  for

Finance  is  unable  to make adequate  provision  and

calculate  the cost of construction of  the  National

Sports  Complex, then we should try  to  raise  funds

from sports enthusiasts and rich businessmen who  are

interested in sports. We can persuade them and  other

philanthropists to donate money for the  construction

of the National Sports Complex, or alternatively, our

Minister can set up a National Sports Fund Committee,

along  the same lines as the National Theatre  Trust,

to raise funds for this purpose. This National Sports

Fund  Committee will be empowered to raise funds  for

the  purpose  of  constructing  the  National  Sports

Complex.  This  will be a better way than  trying  to

obtain money through Toto.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, 85 per cent of the money comes from the

poor people who bet on Toto. This means that the  con

struction  of  the National Sports  Complex  will  be

financed by the poor people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



to  the  extent of 85 per cent. That being so, cannot

we raise funds from some other sources? Why should we

try  to'  fleece  the  poor at  the  expense  of  our

innocent youths who will be open to the temptation of

gambling,  with all its dangers and ill  effects?  We

all  know  that  gambling is a sign  of  decay  in  a

nation.  We  should  not allow our  young  people  to

indulge   in  this  most  undesirable  and   decadent

practice. We must abolish it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I feel that Toto should not be

allowed to continue in Singapore. This is because the

benefits and profits derived from Toto are not entire

ly  used for the construction of the National  Sports

Complex.   Some  of  the  benefits  are  enjoyed   by

Singapore  Pools (Private) Limited.  Why  should  the

Government  allow this organisation  to  continue  in

existence?  Finally, I submit once  again  that  Toto

should be discontinued.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for

decades  and decades, there have been many  forms  of

illegal  gambling in Singapore. Millions  of  dollars

change  hands  every month in such forms  of  illegal

gambling  as chapji-kee, chee-fah, mahjong,  pai-kow,

fan-tan,  1,000  characters,  10,000  characters,  3-

digits,  4-digits,  punting  and  illegal  off-course

bookmaking.  The monies involved in  these  forms  of

gambling  only  go  towards enriching  a  handful  of

bookmakers and operators but are of no direct benefit

to society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With due respect to moral teachings and to the

anxiety  of  religious leaders to  uphold  the  moral

standards  of  our  nation, it appears  to  me  that,

generally speaking, gambling is in the blood. Even in

legitimate businesses like trading in tin and  rubber

and on the Stock Exchange, the element of gambling is

very marked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, instead of allowing the numerous forms of

illegal   gambling  to  go  on  in   Singapore,   the

Government  has  thought of a simple game  of  chance

called "Toto" a game which the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



Member  for Delta is so very much against -  to  help

raise funds for a cause that will benefit society and

the  nation  as  a whole, namely, the building  of  a

sports  complex costing $60 million to promote sports

and  thereby help to build a rugged society in  which

there  will be less and less of what I call the sissy

type  of  citizens but more and more  of  the  virile

type.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some idealists might argue against Toto because

it  is  a  form of gambling, but let them  suggest  a

better  way  of raising the money needed for  such  a

worthy  cause as a sports complex. They might suggest

that the Government should appeal to the goodwill and

patriotism of the people to donate to the fund,  just

as  they have done so splendidly in donating  to  the

National  Defence Fund. This might be a  better  way,

but it is not a sure way or an effective way. It will

take  a  long,  long  time to raise  the  needed  $60

million, and we must have the money by 1971  or  1972

when the sports complex will be completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government, in running public business,

cannot  be  blind to reality. It has to be  pragmatic

and face realities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let it be borne in mind that without a Government-

sponsored  game of chance such as Toto, the  illegal

forms of gambling that have plagued Singapore will go

on  despite  the tightening of the law against  them.

Therefore, even if Toto is regarded as an  evil,  let

us  choose the lesser evil of the two and channel the

proceeds  of  this  non-profit  corporation  to   the

general good of society and the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the British Museum was built with the proceeds

of   lotteries.  So  was  the  National  Theatre   of

Australia. Let The sports complex of Singapore  stand

as  a  monument  to the co-ordinated efforts  of  the

Government  and the people of Singapore in  returning

to  the  people what has been received from  them  in

this  painless, effective and almost effortless  game

of chance called "Toto".

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I am in agreement with the views

expressed by the Member for Delta on Toto. I have

discussed the subject of Toto with many people and

they think that its evils outweigh its advantages.

There are four reasons why I support the Member for

Delta.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Toto will affect many families, especially

housewives, in the lower income group. They may  make

use  of their market-money and pocket-money and  even

the  savings  of their children to indulge  in  Toto.

This  will result in a lack of nutritional  food  for

the  children, and this is tantamount to  maltreating

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the workers will be affected as they will

throw  away  their money on Toto and their  take-home

pay  will  be  less. They will not be  able  to  make

proper use of their wages to help their families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, Toto is a bad influence on children and

students.   Whole   families  gather   before   their

television sets to see whether the numbers  that  are

drawn  have been correctly guessed by them. To  teach

the  people to get something for nothing is wrong and

this  is  very  damaging to the spiritual  and  moral

values of the people. Therefore, this is contrary  to

the policy of building a rugged nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, Toto will encourage the cultivation of bad

traits   in   our  society.  It  may   even   pervade

institutions of learning. I remember the Ministry  of

Education  passed a circular forbidding  teachers  to

indulge  in  Toto.  If  this  trend  is  allowed   to

continue,  more  and more people will  not  stick  to

their jobs and they will become gamblers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir,I am not in any way exaggerating what I have said, because an evil thing, starting in a small way, can grow bigger and bigger. Even cancer starts from the clotting of a tiny cell. The Minister in charge of Toto may argue that the purpose of Toto is to raise funds for the building



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



of  a  national sports complex. That, I agree, is  a

good  and  proper objective, but the necessary  funds

should not be raised by means of gambling. I am  sure

there are better ways of raising the money needed for

the  building  of  this national sports  complex.  If

donations  for  this worthy cause are allowed  to  be

deductible from income tax, I am sure wealthy people,

capitalists  and commercial firms will donate.  So  I

think  we  should rely on other means  to  raise  the

necessary  funds for the completion of  the  national

sports  complex, it is improper to rely on  Toto  for

this purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the view of the Member for

Delta that Toto should be discontinued.



<br><br>6.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): As

the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for

Social  Affairs  and as Toto is a  subject  under  my

charge, I have to say a few words on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that a person who does not want to gamble

cannot  be coerced into gambling. For instance,  even

Members of Parliament who want to gamble can  do  so.

Even prisoners gamble among themselves, although they

are prohibited from doing so. I have learnt that they

use  match-sticks to gamble, if a fly alights on  the

match-stick  belonging to a prisoner, he is  declared

the  winner. In other words, if a person is  inclined

to  gamble,  he  will do so under any conditions.  If

Toto is discontinued, the gamblers will turn to other

forms of gambling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi spoke about various forms of

gambling,  such  as  chap-ji-kee,  1,000  characters,

10,000  characters, and so on. It is  very  difficult

for  us  to  prohibit gambling. We are all  concerned

about  the welfare of the people of this country.  We

want to make sure that they can go through trials and

tribulations,  if we tell them only  about  the  good

side of things and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



do  not  tell  them  about the bad  side, they  will

collapse  when they are faced with it. This will  not

be  good  for our people. Ours is a newly independent

country  and the people should be able to endure  all

kinds  of  trials  and  tribulations.  For  instance,

donations have been made for various purposes. My con

stituents have been asked to donate towards  a  road-

building fund and they have been urged to donate more

money  to  build  better facilities and  improve  the

appearance of their constituency. They will then have

a  good  impression of us and we will be able to  win

them over again at the next elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has said earlier that the raising of certain taxes is inevitable because of an increase in the Defence expenditure. Some people are against any increase in taxes. If we do not impose additional taxes, we will not be able to meet our increased expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to introduce Toto into Singapore was

arrived   at   after   consultations   with   various

committees. Toto is not the best means to raise funds

to  build  a sports complex. But then we do not  have

enough  funds  without  recourse  to  Toto  for  that

purpose.  Members of Parliament and  all  the  people

cannot  donate enough to the fund, although they  pay

lip service to this project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not have enough funds to pay the necessary

personnel  required to run the sports  complex,  what

then is the way open to us? There is a need today for

Toto  in order to raise funds for our national sports

complex.  All  along we have been talking  about  the

building of a rugged, brave and healthy society.  But

it  is  easier said than done. Whatever we intend  to

do,  we  must  have the means to accomplish  it.  For

instance,  we  must have nourishment to  sustain  our

people. But what are we going to do if we do not have

any  funds? Every day we can see people indulging  in

many forms of gambling, not just chap-ji-kee and chee-

fah.  Why should we not divert the money being  spent

on these illegal forms of gambling



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>



to  a legal form like Toto, the proceeds of which can

be  used to build a sports complex? if there  is  any

surplus from the proceeds, we can also make use of it

to  promote  various  forms of  sports  and  athletic

activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not deny that some of the remarks made by some

Members  just  now are quite correct.  But  I  cannot

agree  when they say that Toto will cause the  people

of Singapore to have bad habits, that it will have  a

bad  effect on the family, that it will break up  the

family, with evil consequences. I think the people of

Singapore  are wise enough to be able  to  avoid  all

this. They know what they are doing.



<br><br>6.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,I

think  the  case  for  Toto has been  eloquently  put

forward  by  the Members for Changi and Jalan  Besar.

What I now intend to do is to answer the points which

have  been  raised  by  the  Members  for  Delta  and

Sembawang.  They have based their case  on  the  very

wrong  assumption that Toto is the root of all  evil;

that  there  was no gambling in Singapore  until  the

introduction  of Toto, and that Toto  is  responsible

for a host of sins that are so general and unspecific

that  it  is difficult either to substantiate  or  re

pudiate  them, it is just the feeling  of  these  two

Members.  They appeal to the emotion rather  than  to

the intellect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that gambling is as old as the hills. Ever since Singapore was founded, there has been gambling. When the immigrant population came to settle here, gambling came with them too. The Member for Changi has given us a long list of the various forms of gambling, like chap-ji-

kee,  pai-kow and all the rest of them. In fact, they

were so prevalent in Singapore that the police had  a

hard time trying to control illegal gambling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of introducing Toto is not only to channel

part  of  the  proceeds  to  a  worthy  cause,  which

otherwise would have gone to line the pockets



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



of  illegal  operators, but also to  control  illegal

gambling. Part of the reason for the introduction  of

Toto  is  therefore the very cogent one of trying  to

control illegal gambling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, Mr Speaker, may i quote from

the  Report of the Royal Commission on Gambling which

was   appointed  by  the  United  Kingdom  Government

sometime  towards  the end of the 1940's  to  inquire

into  gambling  in the United Kingdom.  This  is  the

Report  of the Royal Commission on Betting. Lotteries

and Gambling, 1949/ 5/, and the passage I am going to

quote is at page 61. The Report is dated 1951. It has

this to say about private gambling:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'So long as these [meaning gambling facilities] are

in  private hands, it would be impossible entirely to

prevent   fraud,  exploitation  and  inducements   to

gambling.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, if that is the case, so  long  as there   is  private  illegal  gambling  it  is   very difficult  to  control the exploitations,  fraud  and inducenients  to  gambling. To that  extent,  placing gambling  under  control  could  prevent  fraud   and explcitation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Toto is doing just that. If you want to

gamble, you gamble. If you do not want to gamble, the

Government cannot force you to gamble. What Toto does

is  to  legalise a form of lottery so as  to  prevent

those  who have the habit of gambling and who gambled

even  when  it was illegal ---- from being  exploited

and  defrauded by illegal gambling operators. So  the

basic  assumption  that  Toto  is  the  root  of  the

gambling habit in Singapore is wrong. Therefore, the

Members for Delta and Sembawang have not made  out  a

case  against Toto. In fact, gambling is so prevalent

that  it  is something, as the Member for Changi  has

said, which is in the blood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now proceed to answer some of the very

general  allegations  made by the  two  Members.  The

Member  for Delta said that she had received  letters

written  by  parents saying that their  children  had

acquired the habit of gambling on Toto. As I see  it,

if a parent cannot prevent his children from gambling

on Toto, there is nothing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>



that  the  Government  can  do  about  it.  In  fact,

Government  has done these children a  good  turn  by

legalising Toto, because had Toto not been legalised,

they  would  in fact be infringing the law  and  they

could, when caught in the act of gambling, be brought

to court. This is a case of loss of parental control,

and I think it does not speak well of the writers  of

those letters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the allegation by the Member for Sembawang

that  because of gambling people use their  money  on

Toto  which they would otherwise have spent on  food,

this  again is unsubstantiated. The allegation is  so

general that it is, in fact, quite difficult  for  me

to  repudiate it. I think it is equally difficult for

him to substantiate the allegation. The point is that

if a person has lost control over himself and prefers

to spend the money on Toto rather than on food, then,

from  the economic theory point of view, it could  be

said  that  he gets more satisfaction out of  playing

Toto than spending money on food, in which case, good

luck to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all these arguments against Toto, I must

repeat,  Sir, are based on the basic assumption  that

Toto  is  the  only  form  of gambling  available  in

Singapore  and  that  there  is  no  other  form   of

gambling.  What  happened before the introduction  of

Toto?  Thousands of dollars, as the Member for Changi

has said, went into other forms of gambling like chap-

ji-kee, chee-fah and all the rest of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One good thing has come out of Toto, Mr Speaker,

Sir.  At least part of the proceeds of gambling which

would  otherwise  have  gone to  enrich  the  illegal

operators  is now channelled to a very good  cause  -

the  building  of a sports complex.  The  Member  for

Delta  has  asked  why we should  use  this  form  of

collection  - why not ask the Government  to  provide

for  it in the Budget or ask for donations from well-

wishers and sports fans? The reason, and it is a very

cogent  reason, why the Government cannot  afford  to

make provision for a sports complex in the Budget has

been given by the Finance Minister in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>



this  House  this  very  afternoon.  So  I  need  not

elaborate on it. With regard to donations from  well-

wishers,  hon. Members will realise that in spite  of

the  tremendous  fervour shown towards  our  National

Defence  Fund, - mind you, contributions towards  the

National  Defence  Fund get income  tax  rebate  -yet

after  nearly a year's efforts to date, we  have  got

only  $8  million. The sports complex costs some  $60

million.  Just  the  other  day,  on  12th  November.

Singapore  Pools (Private) Limited (the operators  of

Toto)  handed over to the Minister for Social Affairs

a  cheque for $2 million towards the building of  the

sports complex.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sort of legalised lottery is very common all

over  the world - both in socialist countries and  in

capitalist  countries. I have here a  research  paper

prepared for the international Monetary Fund. (But it

is expressly stated that the opinion expressed in the

paper  need not necessarily reflect the views of  the

Fund.) This is a very authoritative paper prepared by

one Juanita D. Amatong for the international Monetary

Fund  and it is dated 16th April. 1968. The title  of

this  research  paper  is The Revenue  importance  of

Government  Lotteries.  I  would  like  to  read  the

conclusion of this research paper to the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Barring social and moral objections to lottery, it

seems  worthwhile for developing countries to explore

further this particular source of revenue. Government

operation of a lottery tends to shift gambling  gains

from  private  hands  to  the  government,  and   may

minimize its possible regressive effects by using the

proceeds for general welfare purposes.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two studies done independently -the Royal Commission

Report  which I just quoted as well as this  paper  -

come  out  in  favour  of public lotteries.  In  this

study, a  list  of 66 countries are  shown  to  have

government  lotteries and they range  from  socialist

countries  to capitalist countries both in  the  East

and  in  the West. May II just quote a few  of  these

countries  -  the  ones  in  Asia.  They  are  Burma,

Cambodia.    Ceylon,   Malaysia, the   Philippines.

Thailand. Indonesia. Japan and Nepal.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Yes, I will submit a copy if

Members  want to refer to it. All this goes  to  show

that  there  is  no rational, logical  basis  against

Toto. The argument against Toto is based on emotional

grounds  and  on  the  feelings  of  individuals.  If

individuals  feel  so  strongly  about  gambling,  my

advice  to them is not to gamble. But please  do  not

deprive others of that little pleasure.

been  misunderstood.  You cannot  introduce  any  new

matter.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Point of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



Singapore   must  follow  the  steps   of   Communist

countries in refraining from gambling. What  I  meant

was  that  as Singapore is newly independent  and  is

trying  to  build its youths into robust  and  strong

citizens, we should not encourage them to gamble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Parliamentary Secretary, gambling

was  already in existence before the introduction  of

Toto. It means that the Government has not been  able

to  control gambling activities in Singapore. Because

of this, Government is trying -~



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Madam Chan, you are developing an

argument  and  not clarifying some material  part  of

your speech on which you have been misunderstood.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, may I just explain, since

the  Member  for  Delta wants me to  clarify  on  the

question  of  a  rugged  society.  In  fact,  a  very

practical way of contributing to a rugged society  is

to  have  a  sports stadium where our youths  can  be

trained  into  spirited, robust and rugged  citizens.

The way of doing it, as I have shown
