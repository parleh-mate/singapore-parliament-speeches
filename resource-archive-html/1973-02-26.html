<div align="center"><b>BUS ACCIDENTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Measures to minimise)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b> asked the

Minister  for  Communications what measures  he  is

taking or proposes to take to minimise serious  bus

accidents.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr Ang Kok Peng) (for the Minister for Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during 1972, there was a total number

of  3,982  serious  and fatal  accidents  involving

motor  vehicles. Of this number of accidents,  only

348  or  8.74 per cent involved public buses.  This

figure  is not disproportionately high if one  were

to  consider that each public bus plies  along  the

road  continuously for almost 18 hours  a  day.  In

terms  of  percentage  of  the  total  fleet,   the

accident  rate is less than 2 per cent. Mr Speaker,

Sir, I have handed to the Clerk of Parliament,  for

circulation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



to  Members  of Parliament, Annex (See cols. 483-6) A and  B  giving

detailed  information  of  statistics  showing  the

number  of  the public buses as compared  with  all

other  motor vehicles involved in serious and fatal

accidents,  and statistics showing  the  number  of

serious and fatal accidents involving public  buses

as compared with the total bus fleet, respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Communications, however, is not

taking  a  complacent view of this matter and  will

take  steps to further reduce the number of serious

accidents involving public buses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important step is the training courses

conducted  by the Public Service Vehicles  Training

School  to  raise the standards of our drivers  and

conductors. To-date 2,106 bus drivers and 1,806 bus

conductors   had   successfully   completed   their

training  and  were issued vocational  licences.  A

refresher course for bus drivers will be introduced

in April 1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another measure undertaken was the establishment

of  an  Enforcement Squad within  the  Registry  of

Vehicles  on 1st April, 1972. The main function  of

this  Squad  is  to  ensure  that  we  get  a  more

disciplined and organised public transport  service

in the Republic.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move  the  motion* standing in my  name,  as  it appears on the Order Paper.

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The  motion,  standing in  the  name  of  the

Minister for Law and National Development, reads

as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with

section  4  of  the  Foreshores  Act  (Chapter

270),  approves the reclamation by  Government

of  that  portion of the foreshore and  seabed

at   Pasir  Panjang  containing  an  area   of

approximately  102  acres as  shown  edged  in

purple   on  the  plan  marked  "LAND   OFFICE

RECLAMATION   PLAN  NO.  3   /73"   which   is

deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the Third Phase of the reclamations

planned  for Pasir Panjang. Members will  recall

that,  at  its sitting on 30th July, 1971,  this

House approved the reclamation of about 91 acres

of  the foreshore and seabed at Pasir Panjang as

shown  edged red on the plan marked "LAND OFFICE

RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 3/73", a copy of  which  is

displayed in the Library of this House  for  the

information  of Members. Subsequently,  on  26th

October,  1972, the reclamation  of  another  25

acres of the area shown edged green on the  plan

was also approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both reclamations are being undertaken by the

Port  of  Singapore Authority as  agent  of  the

Government, using surplus earth from  the  Telok

Blangah  new  town  site. Owing  to  engineering

difficulties encountered in the area  edged  red

and  the presence of squatters in the area edged

green, the Port of Singapore Authority was  able

to complete the reclamation of only 64 acres (47

acres  within  the area edged red and  17  acres

within the area edged green) out of the total of

116  acres  so far approved under the Foreshores

Act, leaving about 52 acres yet to he reclaimed.

Meanwhile,  the  Port  of  Singapore  Authority,

faced by the need to urgently remove earth  from

the  Housing  Board's  Telok  Blangah  new  town

preparatory  site  in order  not  to  delay  the

construction of Housing Board flats  the  demand

for which considerably exceeds the supply, has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



been  forced  to dump fill in that part  of  the

foreshore  and seabed shown hatched  red  within

the   area  shown  edged  purple  on  the  plan.

Approval   of  this  House  is  now  sought   to

regularise the reclamation done so far, as  well

as   to  provide  for  the  reclamation  of   an

additional  area within the area  edged  purple.

This  will give time for the problems (squatters

and  engineering difficulties)  to  be  overcome

when  the reclamation of the remaining 52  acres

already  approved where reclamation  works  have

been held up, can be completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area edged purple, when reclaimed, will he

developed    for   recreational   purposes    in

accordance with Singapore's Concept Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with

section  4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter  270),

approves the reclamation by Government  of  that

portion  of  the foreshore and seabed  at  Pasir

Panjang containing an area of approximately  102

acres  as  shown  edged in purple  on  the  plan

marked  "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO.  3/73"

which   is   deposited  in  the   Land   Office,

Singapore.

annual allowance for staff, revised wages of daily-rated  employees and increasing cost  of  household

requisites. Also, provision has to be made for  the

purchase  of  chairs and tables,  silver  ware  and

crockery for official use at the Istana. Hiring  of

such items has proved to be unsatisfactory. It  is,

therefore,  necessary to augment the provision  for

provisions  for  Salaries to  Personal  Staff  from

$508,620 to $594,010; the provision for Expenses of

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the financial policy of the Government

cannot  be  considered except in  relation  to  its

economic  setting, both international and domestic.

It  has,  therefore, been my practice  in  previous

Budget  Statements to begin with a brief survey  of

the economic scene before proceeding to outline the

financial  policy  for the coming  financial  year.

This  year,  I  thought it might be convenient,  to

Members  as  well  as to myself,  that  the  Survey

should be presented in written form and distributed

in  advance  to Members so that they will  have  an

opportunity  to read it at leisure and  absorb  the

contained  particularly in the  tables.* (*See Appendix, Col. 487-522)  I  should like,  however, the House to consider the  `survey'

to  have  been  delivered  as  part  of  my  Budget

Statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Following is the text of the Survey (up to col.460).]



<br><br><i>Survey of the Economic Scene</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to preliminary estimates, Singapore's

Gross National Product (GNP) at current prices grew

in   1972  by  $908.9  million  to  reach  $7,917.5

million. This represents an annual growth of 13 per

cent,  a  creditable performance  by  international

standards, but disappointingly short by 2 per  cent

of our targeted 15 per cent annual growth rate. One

obvious  and simple explanation for this  shortfall

can  be  given as the loss of earnings from British

(now   ANZUK)  military  spending  which  was  $216

million or roughly 3 per cent of the GNP less  than

last  year.  We shall, however, need to analyse  in

some detail the more complex factors, both external

and  domestic, which prevented gains being made  in

other  sectors of our economy ready and  sufficient

to  offset  a loss which had, after all, long  been

anticipated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let us look at the external economic

situation in 1972. As an open economy. Singapore is

highly vulnerable to adverse external events.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1972 began with some promise. It was hoped then

that the co-operative spirit and ingenuity shown by

the world's ten leading economic powers in reaching

the   settlement   of   the  Smithsonian   Currency

Agreement   in  December  1971  could  be   brought

similarly to bear upon the problem of the reform of

the  international monetary system.  Meantime,  the

recently  concluded  Agreement,  with  its   multi-currency  realignment, ended a period  of  floating

currency  rates  and brought back a  relative  calm

into the troubled currency exchange markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This calm was short-lived. 1972 turned out to be

a  year  of  high monetary instability. Within  the

first



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



few months, funds started to flow to countries like

Japan  where  revaluation was thought not  to  have

gone  far enough, and away from countries like  the

United    Kingdom   with   currencies    considered

overvalued. In June, the Pound Sterling went into a

crisis  which  introduced  yet  another  period  of

international   monetary   instability.   It    was

eventually   forced  to  float.  Other   currencies

survived  the  monetary  storm  only  because  they

adopted  or  had  already  adopted  a  variety   of

exchange controls, including stiff restrictions  on

capital movements, or splitting the exchange market

into financial and commercial sectors. Towards  the

latter  part  of 1972, however, the  United  States

economy  appeared  to  be much  improved,  and  the

foreign  exchange markets stabilised.  However,  in

the  new year when it finally became known that the

US trade and payments deficits for 1972 were larger

than  had  been previously expected and  might  not

greatly  improve  in  1973,  the  situation   again

suddenly   deteriorated.  In  recent   weeks,   the

splitting of the Lira and the floating of the Swiss

Franc were the first signs that the US Dollar would

come  once again under severe pressure. In a flight

from the Dollar, both the Deutsche Mark and the Yen

came  under  attack, culminating in another  Dollar

devaluation and consequential adjustments in  other

currency  parities. The basic flaws in the  present

system  have not been resolved and the  spectre  of

protectionist  trade measures cannot be  altogether

exorcised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not to be expected that Singapore could

remain   totally   unaffected   by   the   monetary

instability  and the recurring crises of  the  past

year.  With  the floating of the Pound Sterling  in

June   last   year  and  restrictions  on   capital

movements   within  the  Sterling  area,  Singapore

decided  to  change its intervention currency  from

Sterling to the US Dollar. With less need  for  the

use  of Sterling, Singapore further diversified its

reserves from Sterling to other currencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What of the hope which had been kindled for

"prompt"  monetary reform? It was not  until  after

prolonged argument as to the nature and composition

of  the  forum for discussing such reform that  the

first  step was taken at the IMF meeting in October

last   year.  This  was  the  setting  up  of   the

International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  Committee  on

International  Monetary Reform and Related  Issues,

better known as the Committee of Twenty. Basically,

the  representation of countries on this  Committee

is the same as representation on the IMF (which has

20    executive    directors).   The    level    of

representation is higher, however, in the Committee

of   20  consisting  of  Ministers,  central   bank

governors or equivalent. Singapore anti other South-east  Asian countries are being represented on this

Committee,  and  on  this  Committee's   group   of

deputies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the initial deliberations of the Committee

point   to  some  convergence  of  views  on  broad

principles, the deputies of the Committee have  met

for  only  the  second time, and it  would  be  too

optimistic to expect any translation of these broad

principles  into  agreed rules and practice  before

1974.  Singapore, therefore, will have to learn  to

live  with  international monetary instability  for

quite some time yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overshadowed by the monetary problem, other

external events in 1972 have had relatively  little

economic impact as yet upon Singapore. Perhaps  the

most  significant  of these for its  likely  future

effect  upon  Singapore trade was the dc-escalation

of  the  Vietnam War which has now  resulted  in  a

cease-fire.  In  the past, Singapore's  trade  with

South   Vietnam  has  been  mainly   in   petroleum

products.  With  the  advent of  peace,  there  has

increasingly been less demand for such products and

it may be expected to decline further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1972 was also the last year for preparation by

Britain  for her entry into the Common Market.  For

her  Commonwealth partners, it meant also the  last

year  before  the  phasing out of  special  trading

relationships    which    conferred    Commonwealth

preferences to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



Britain   and   each  other.  For   the   non-Asian

Commonwealth, such phasing out could  be  eased  by

new trading arrangements in associate status in the

European  Economic Community (EEC)  or  by  special

concessions for products like sugar. For her  Asian

Commonwealth partners, including Singapore, none of

these   options  were  offered  by  the   EEC   and

negotiations  for individual trade agreements  with

the  EEC  are all that they can expect. Singapore's

share  of trade with the EEC has all along been  in

the   EEC's   favour.  The  better  to  investigate

possibilities  of improving trade  links  with  the

enlarged EEC, whether under a negotiated agreement,

the  Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) Scheme

or  in  any  other way, we have in  the  last  year

established  an Embassy in Brussels  accredited  to

both Belgium and the EEC, and shall be establishing

diplomatic  representation also in other  countries

in  the  near  future. We have  also  been  working

together with our ASEAN partners under the  Special

Co-ordinating Committee of ASEAN to seek favourable

consideration for our products. However,  the  task

ahead  for securing any trade concessions from  the

EEC  would  seem  to  be a long  and  arduous  one,

especially  as  1973 would be a year of  adjustment

and  consolidation between the old and new  members

in   the  enlarged  EEC  and  the  Community  could

therefore  be  pre-occupied with its  own  internal

problems.  However, it is possible that with  peace

in  Indo-China, the EEC will show a  more  positive

interest  in  the region and to play a more  active

role in trade and development of an area with which

they have had historical links.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, among external events relevant to

Singapore,  the admission of China into the  United

Nations   in   1972,   and   therefore   into   the

international diplomatic and political  arena,  may

see  its  involvement  increase  also  in  economic

affairs   in  South-east  Asia.  There  should   be

possibilities of much increased trade. Total  trade

between  Singapore  and China  in  the  first  nine

months of 1972



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



represented  less  than 3 per cent  of  Singapore's

total  trade,  and  the  trade  balance  has   been

overwhelmingly in favour of China. With the  better

opening  up of China to international trade,  there

is  the possibility that Singapore can serve  as  a

base  for multi-national firms for manufacture  and

exports  to  China.  Conversely,  China  may   find

Singapore a useful outlet for its products.



<br><br><i>Review of the Singapore Economy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, a close look at developments at home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As can well be imagined, international monetary

instability  had  unfavourable  effects  upon   the

performance  of  our  local economy,  its  greatest

impact being, first, on trade which grew hardly  at

all  in  the first half of the year and only picked

up  again  in  the later months of  the  year,  and

secondly, on the manufacturing sector, particularly

on   industries   highly  vulnerable   to   adverse

international  trade  factors  like  the  petroleum

industry, which grew at no more than 7 per cent  in

output  and  2.6  per  cent  in  value  added.  Our

performance  in  these two sectors  fell  short  of

those  for  1970  and  1971 and  account  in  large

measure  for the lower growth rate of the  economy,

making up as they do, its two largest sectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, as the GNP figures already quoted indicate,

and the tables will show in greater detail, overall

the  economy of Singapore continued to sustain  the

trend  of  rapid growth achieved over the past  six

years  1966-1971. With a rate of population  growth

at  1.7  per cent per year in 1972, slightly higher

than the 1.69 per cent for 1971, our per capita GNP

improved  by  11 per cent from $3,321  in  1971  to

$3,687 in 1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us examine the components of Singapore's

growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimates of the Gross Domestic Expenditure (GDE)

in  1972  representing  resource  use  indicate  an

increase  of $927.3 million to $7,643.7 million  in

1972.  Compared with the $6,716.4 million in  1971,

this represented an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



increase of 13.8 per cent. The growth rate  of  GDE

was  lower than that experienced in 1971  of  about

16.6 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in GDE was contributed by both

consumption  and gross domestic capital  formation.

Consumption expenditure increased by $507.0 million

or 10.5 per cent to reach $5,355.8 million. Capital

formation increased substantially by $420.3 million

or  22.5 per cent to reach a high level of $2,287.9

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bulk of the capital formation was in

buildings   and  other  construction  works   which

comprised about 48.3 per cent of the total  and  in

machinery  and equipment which accounted  for  39.7

per cent. A large proportion of the expenditure  in

the   latter  category  was  directed  towards  the

expanding manufacturing sector. Expenditure in  the

former category increased by $316.3 million or 40.1

per  cent  as  compared to an  increase  of  $118.1

million  or  only  15  per cent  in  machinery  and

equipment.   Expenditure  in  transport   equipment

dropped  slightly by $14.1 million or 4.9 per  cent

to $274.6 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth in gross domestic capital formation

was  markedly lower than the 35.8 per cent achieved

in  1971  and  the 44.2 per cent in  1970  and  the

average  annual growth rate of 30 per cent for  the

six-year period 1966-72. It is disquieting to  note

that  the  growth  in  1972 was  sustained  by  the

relatively higher growth rate in the expenditure on

buildings, especially on dwellings rather  than  on

machinery and equipment for manufacturing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysing the capital formation in 1972 in both

the  public  and private sectors, it  may  also  be

noted that private sector investments rose by  only

12.1  per  cent from $1,407.3 million  in  1971  to

$1,577.6  million, while public sector  investments

increased by 54.3 per cent to $710.3 million.  With

a faster rate of growth, the capital expenditure in

the public sector, accounted for a larger share  of

31  per  cent  of  the total capital  formation  as

compared  with  only 24.6 per  cent  in  1971.  The

corresponding share of the private sector was down



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



to  69 per cent. The increase in investment in  the

private   sector  was  mainly  in   machinery   and

equipment   and   construction  of  non-residential

buildings, primarily of offices, shopping complexes

and  factories.  There was a  slight  reduction  in

expenditure  in  transport  equipment   and   other

construction   works.  Expenditure   on   transport

equipment in the private sector decreased  slightly

by  $19.2  million from $283.1 million in  1971  to

$263.9 million, giving a drop of 6.8 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in capital expenditure in the public

sector  was  largely in respect of public  housing,

electricity   and  water  services   and   electric

machinery.   Expenditure   on   buildings,    other

construction and works increased by $225 million or

67.8 per cent from $332 million to $557 million.



<br><br><i>Consumption</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to consumption, the public sector

registered a faster rate of growth of 17.9 per cent

compared  with the private sector of 9.1 per  cent.

The  increase in public consumption, which has been

expanding  rapidly  since 1969, exceeded  the  rate

achieved in the previous year of 12.5 per cent.  In

the   private  sector,  the  rate  of   growth   of

consumption  was slightly below the level  of  10.3

per cent achieved in 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of these changes the share

composition of private consumption expenditure fell

from  60.8  per cent in 1971 to 58.3  per  cent  in

1972,   whilst   that  of  government   consumption

increased from 11.4 per cent to 11.8 per  cent.  It

is   interesting  to  note  that   the   share   of

consumption  expenditure to  total  expenditure  in

both  the public and private sector which has  been

falling  since 1960 continued to decline  in  1972.

The  share composition fell from 93.4 per  cent  in

1960 to 72.2 per cent in 1971 and to 70.1  per  cent  in 1972, while the  gross  capital

formation  increased sharply from 6.6 per  cent  in

1960 to 29.9 per cent in 1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every major component of private consumption

registered increases, though at varying rates.  The

fastest  rates  of  increase  were  in  respect  of

expenditure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



on   housing   and  transport  and  communications.

Expenditure  on housing increased by $92.5  million

or   25.1   per  cent  to  $461.6  million   whilst

expenditure on transport rose by $54.2  million  or

9.8  per  cent  to  $608.7  million.  Comparatively

slower   rates   of  growth  were  noted   in   the

expenditure on food, which rose by 5.3 per cent  to

$1,079.2  million,  as well as in  clothing,  which

increased  by  6.3 per cent to $643.4 million.  The

outcome  of this was the further reduction  in  the

relative share of expenditure on basic necessities,

especially food, which fell from 27.2 per  cent  in

1960  to 15.3 per cent in 1971 and to 14.1 per cent

in  1972.  This again reflected the improvement  in

the  standards of living of the population. In  the

case of public consumption, the increase was mainly

on account of defence expenditure.



<br><br><i>Gross Domestic Production by Industrial Origin</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to an examination of the performance of the

major  sectors  of  the  economy  in  1972,  it  is

pertinent  to outline the structural changes  which

have  taken  place over the past six  years.  As  a

result    of    rapid    industrialisation,     the

manufacturing  and  construction  sectors   enjoyed

rapid  growth  whilst the trade and other  services

sectors registered a lower rate of growth. This has

resulted  in  the  sharp increase in  the  relative

share  composition in Gross Domestic Product  (GDP)

of  manufacturing and construction sectors  jointly

from  18.3 per cent in 1966 to 31 per cent in 1972.

On  the other hand, the share composition of  trade

and  other services sectors declined from 63.5  per

cent in 1966 to 52.3 per cent in 1972.



<br><br><i>Manufacturing Sector</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacturing industries contributed a total

of $1,716.6 million to GDP in 1972 - an increase of

$286.9  million or 20.1 per cent compared  with  25

per  cent in 1971 and 27.5 per cent in 1970.  As  a

result of this comparatively more modest but  still

rapid   growth,  the  share  composition   of   the

manufacturing  sector to total GDP  increased  from

14.5 per cent in 1966 to 23.5 per cent in 1972.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



Manufacturing  still  continues  to  be  the   main

stimulus to growth. The increase in earnings of the

manufacturing  sector of $286.9  million  accounted

for  well  over a third of the increase  of  $857.6

million in the GDP.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our manufacturing industries have been oriented

towards   exports  and  higher  quality   products.

Overall,   some  40  per  cent  of   our   domestic

manufactures is exported. Among pioneer  companies,

exports account for just under two-thirds of  their

output. In 1972, about half of our domestic exports

went  to developed countries as compared with  less

than one-fifth six years ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year 1972, increases in output and

value  added were registered in the major  industry

groups,   such  as  manufacture  of  textiles   and

garments,   electrical  machinery,  apparatus   and

appliances, and manufacture of transport equipment.

Other  industries recording favourable growth  were

the  manufacture  of  other plastic  products,  and

precision equipment and optical goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest individual industry is still

petroleum  refining which accounted  for  30.7  per

cent  of total output for the manufacturing sector.

During  1972, however, as I have already mentioned,

the growth in output and value added slackened to 7

per   cent  and  2.6  per  cent  respectively.  The

corresponding  growth rates in 1971 were  27.2  per

cent  and  33.6  per  cent, respectively.  Although

petroleum refining is a major activity in terms  of

output, in terms of value added the contribution of

this industry to total value added is only 17.5 per

cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A marginal decrease of 6.3 per cent in output of

the food industries was noted. This was largely  on

account  of  the slight drop in the production  for

export in cooking oil and coffee processing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of value added, the electric machinery

industry ranked the highest with 20.6 per  cent  of

total   value  added,  followed  closely   by   the

petroleum   refining  (17.5  per  cent)   and   the

transport equipment industry (which included



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



shipbuilding and shiprepairing) with 14.9 per  cent

of   total   value  added.  The  more   traditional

industries,  namely  food, beverages  and  tobacco,

jointly accounted for another 9.4 per cent.



<br><br><i>Construction</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction industry has been growing

rapidly  since  1967. In 1972 the  contribution  by

this  sector to GDP increased by 36.4 per  cent  to

$551.9  million as compared with 33.8 per  cent  in

1971.  Its  percentage share  of  GDP  was  thereby

almost doubled from 3.8 per cent in 1966 to 7.5 per

cent in 1972. This rapid growth rate was the second

highest for the six-year period 1966-72-the highest

growth  rate was in 1971) when a rate of  47.2  per

cent was registered. The industry continued to face

the  shortage of labour and materials which  had  a

restraining influence on its expansion during 1971.

Despite  this, the industry managed  to  achieve  a

high growth rate which ranked as the highest of all

major sectors making up the GDP.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slight acceleration in its growth during 1972

was   primarily   in  respect  of   non-residential

buildings  in the private sector comprising  mainly

of  shopping and office complexes which  registered

an increase of $79.1 million or 25 per cent. In the

public  sector,  the  high  growth  was  mainly  on

account of the construction of public housing which

recorded an increase of $133.4 million or 109.6 per

cent.



<br><br><i>Trade</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrepot and domestic trade sector which had

been  growing  at  a  decreasing  rate  since  1968

contributed  $1,982.5 million to GDP in  1972.  The

contribution from this sector increased by only 7.3

per  cent  or  $134.1 million  in  1972  which  was

comparable to the rate in 1971 but slower than  the

average  rate  of  14.8 per cent for  1968-70.  The

causes  for  this were the pursuit of direct  trade

policies  by neighbours, the general decline  until

the  latter  part  of the year  in  produce  prices

especially rubber,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>



the  de-escalation  of  the  Vietnam  War  and  the

uncertain  trading conditions particularly  in  the

first  half  of  the year because of the  recurring

international monetary crises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the total increase in the trade sector,

entrepot  trade accounted for a mere $13.5  million

while  domestic trade accounted for $120.6 million.

The   entrepot   trade   component   registered   a

decelerating growth rate from 31.9 per cent in 1968

to a low rate of 2 per cent in 1972. Domestic trade

also   registered   a  decelerating   growth   rate

especially after 1970, from 18.1 per cent  in  1970

to  an  all time low rate of 10.3 per cent in 1972.

As a result of these decelerating growth rates, the

ratio of entrepot trade to total GDP fell from 12.1

per  cent in 1970 to 9.5 per cent in 1972 while for

domestic trade the ratio fell slightly from the  18

per cent in 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the trade sector, the shift in emphasis in

favour of domestic trade against entrepot trade may

be  noted.  In  1960 entrepot trade  constituted  a

larger share of 18.6 per cent of GDP as compared to

a  share  of  13.2  per  cent for  domestic  trade.

However, the relative share of entrepot trade  soon

decreased to 10.4 per cent in 1966 whilst that  for

domestic trade increased to 15.7 per cent. By 1972,

entrepot trade was further reduced to 9.5 per  cent

whilst domestic trade advanced to 17.6 per cent. In

value terms entrepot trade contributed $694 million

to  GDP in 1972 compared with $1,288.5 million  for

domestic trade. The opposite was, however, the case

in  1960  when  entrepot trade amounted  to  $381.1

million and domestic trade $269 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growing importance of domestic trade has been

the  result of the rising purchasing power  of  the

population  and  the increased  earnings  from  the

distribution  of  domestic export which  has  shown

substantial  growth during the past few  years.  As

the economy further expands in the future, entrepot

trade  is expected to decline further in importance

and  this  decline will be offset by the growth  in

the domestic trade sector.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Total External Trade</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total external trade expanded to $15,680

million  in 1972, an increase of $1,645 million  or

11.7  per cent over 1971. The growth rate, however,

was  lower than the 14.2 per cent achieved in 1971.

Exports  rose at a faster rate of 14.3 per cent  to

$6,139 million, imports at a relatively lower  rate

of  10.1  per cent to $9,541 million in  1972.  The

corresponding rates in 1971 were 12.9 per cent  and

15 per cent respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that for the first time

since 1966, the rate of growth of exports surpassed

that  of  imports. This slow-down in the growth  of

imports  was mainly on account of less  imports  of

fixed vegetable oil, textiles, industrial machinery

and road motor vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestic exports, which rose by 29.7 per cent to

$3,078 million in 1972, was again the primary cause

of  the  increase in total exports. The  comparable

figure  was  $2,373  million  in  1971.  With   the

continued  expansion  in  the  local  manufacturing

industries and the efforts being made to  open  new

markets overseas, this upward trend is expected  to

be  maintained.  On the other hand,  re-exports  or

entrepot exports increased only marginally  by  2.1

per  cent  from  $2,998 million in 1971  to  $3,061

million in 1972. Re-exports are expected to further

decline in the future.



<br><br><i>Trade and Payments Balance</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1972, the recorded trade deficit amounted to

$3,402  million, larger than the deficit of  $3,293

million for 1971. The widening gap particularly  in

recent  years has been aggravated by higher  prices

for  imported goods. Singapore has run a persistent

trade  deficit which has been largely  financed  by

earnings  from `invisible' items and large  capital

inflows.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst there may be some concern for the

consequences  of our growing trade deficit  on  the

balance  of payments, there is basically  no  cause

for  alarm.  Since  1966  our  overall  balance  of

payments has been registering surpluses every year.

From  1967 to 1971 the overall surpluses have  been

averaging



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>



about  $500  million  a  year.  In  1972,  our

preliminary estimates indicate a surplus  of  about

$566  million  which  compares  closely  with   the

surplus of $578 million in 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net earnings from services declined further to

$624 million in 1972 from $660 million in 1971  and

$738  million in 1970. The decline was attributable

to   the  increase  in  payments  for  freight  and

insurance   on   merchandise,  travel   and   other

transportation and other services as well as to the

reduction  in receipts from government transactions

as  a  result of the British military pullout. With

the  expansion  of  the tourist industry,  receipts

from  travel  and  other transportation  have  been

rising  steadily. It increased by $237  million  to

reach  $1,161 million in 1972. This has  more  than

compensated for the adverse effect of the reduction

of British military expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net non-monetary capital especially private long-term capital inflow has increased considerably by

$111 million to $580 million in 1972.



<br><br><i>Government Services and Public Utilities</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1972, government services contributed $482

million  to GDP, an increase of 12.8 per cent  over

$427.3  million for 1971. This rate of  growth  was

slightly  higher than the previous year's  rate  of

9.6  per  cent.  It is close to the average  annual

growth rate of 13.4 per cent for the past 12 years.

The   share  of  government  services  to  GDP  was

maintained  at  6.6 per cent for  1972,  about  the

level  maintained during the past decade. The  main

increases   were  in  respect  of  expenditure   on

defence, education and health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public Utilities had a steady growth rate of 15.2

per  cent higher than the 9.8 per cent increase for

1971.  The  contribution of this  sector  was  $175

million in 1972 and its share to GDP was maintained

at 2.4 per cent.



<br><br><i>Ownership of Dwellings</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value added by ownership of dwellings to GDP

increased substantially during the past two  years.

In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



1971 the value stood at $275.6 million, an increase

of  35  per  cent. In 1972, the value increased  to

$362.3 million, a growth rate of 31.5 per cent.  As

a result, its share composition rose to about 5 per

cent of GDP.



<br><br><i>Tourism</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tourist industry continues to enjoy rapid

growth. In 1972 an estimated total of about 780,000

tourists visited Singapore compared with 632,000 in

1971  and  522,000 in 1970. The rate of growth  for

1972  was 23.4 per cent, as compared with 21.1  per

cent in 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earnings from tourism continued to increase to S

397.7 million in 1972, an increase of 21.4 per cent

over  $327.5 million for 1971. This resulted  in  a

marginal  increase  in  the  share  composition  of

tourism to GDP from 5.1 per cent in 1971 to 5.4 per

cent  in  1972.  The  average number  of  days  the

visitors  spent in Singapore remained at about  3.9

days during 1970-72.



<br><br><i>Foreign Military Expenditure</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The withdrawal of the British military services

in  1972  resulted in a dramatic reduction by  51.4

per  cent in the preliminary estimates for  foreign

military   expenditure   to   $204   million.   The

expenditure in 1971 was $420 million, which was the

same  level as in 1970. However, owing to the rapid

growth in the other services sector, especially  in

banking   and  financial  services,  and  transport

sector, the dampening effect on domestic demand and

employment had been partly compensated.



<br><br><i>Banking and insurance</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banking and insurance services continued their

increasing trends. By 1972 its contribution to  GDP

rose  by  26.6  per  cent  to  $152.3  million,  as

compared to 22.9 per cent in 1971. This high growth

rate  was attributable mainly to the high level  of

banking activity, a feature of which was the inflow

of  funds  from  abroad. Total deposits  showed  an

unprecedented  increase  of  26.5  per  cent   from

$3,745.8  million  in 1971 to $4,736.7  million  in

1972. Bank loans



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>



and advances increased faster by 36.3 per cent from

$2,615 million to $3,565.2 million in 1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total assets and liabilities of the Asian

Currency Unit (ACU) rose steeply by 180 per cent to

reach  $8.4  billion at the end of  December  1972.

Hitherto,  funds from the Asian Dollar Market  were

used  mainly for short-term financing. A new  phase

of  development occurred in December 1971 when  the

Development Bank of Singapore Limited (DBS) floated

a 10-year Asian Dollar Bond for US$10 million. This

was  followed  by an Asian Dollar loan  of  US$27.5

million  to  the  Brunei LNG  Company  Limited.  In

October, the Singapore Government itself floated  a

15-year US$20 million Asian Dollar Bond.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Institutional framework for operations of an

active   money  market  in  Singapore  was  further

strengthened  last  year.  Three  reputable  London

money  broking firms were given approval to set  up

operations   in   Singapore.  In  November,   three

Discount  Houses were also established,  comprising

joint  ventures between local and foreign  interest

with   majority  participation  by   local   banks,

including  the  Post Office Savings Bank.  Two  new

foreign   banks   were  admitted  into   Singapore,

broadening international connections of the banking

system.  Singapore banks also organised  themselves

for  the more competitive banking environment ahead

by merging into bigger groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the external and domestic economic situation

in  1972  outlined in the Survey, what  conclusions

can we draw as to the possibilities for 1973?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of symptoms call for particular

attention.



<br><br><i>Inflation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that of increasing inflation. With

its  relatively strong currency, Singapore has  had

inflows   of  speculative  funds  which   increased

domestic   liquidity   beyond   desirable   limits.

Domestic  money supply increased by $76 million  in

the  first quarter of 1972. Another $98 million was

added to the money stock in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>



the  second quarter. The rate of monetary expansion

for  the  year  ending June 1972 was 24  per  cent,

which  was unusually high as growth in money supply

in  previous years had been less than 20 per  cent.

In  the  third  quarter, there was  again  a  large

increase of $115 million, bringing the total  money

supply to $2.1 billion in September. By the end  of

the  fourth  quarter in December 1972, total  money

supply had increased to $2.4 billion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some expansion of money supply in Singapore

must  be  expected and indeed would be required  to

meet the expanding needs of a fast growing country,

it  was necessary that measures be taken to prevent

overheating of the economy. The Monetary  Authority

of  Singapore (MAS) therefore tried in August  1972

to  curb excessive liquidity by raising the minimum

reserves requirement of banks from 3 1/2 per cent to

5 per cent. In December 1972, the MAS had to impose

a 5 per cent special deposit requirement on the net

foreign liabilities of banks. On 13th February this

year, the reserves requirement has had to be raised

again  from  5  per  cent to 9 per  cent  of  their

deposit  liabilities. The Special Deposit  -  which

banks have to place with the MAS against their  net

foreign liabilities was similarly increased from  5

per  cent to 9 per cent. These measures will freeze

about  $250  million  in the financial  system  and

increase  the  cost  of  credit;  they  will   also

circumscribe   the  banks'  capacity   for   credit

creation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have tried to organise our banking and money

sector  into  external (Asian  Currency  Unit)  and

domestic  operations, but it has not been  possible

to    isolate   Singapore   entirely    from    the

international money and price inflation  which  has

such  deleterious social and economic effects  upon

our  people. The will to work hard and  to  save  a

large  part  of one's earnings can be sapped  by  a

continual lowering of the purchasing power of hard-earned money, coupled with the belief that the ways

of  the  speculator and the spiv with his get-rich-quick gimmicks bring easy returns.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the money supply has partly

contributed to the increase towards the end of  the

year  of  food and other commodity prices. But  the

main  causes were more the vagaries of the  weather

and  the  sharp increases in costs of imports.  But

internal  liquidity certainly has been  responsible

for  the  boom in land and property prices and  the

very  unhealthy speculation in shares on our  Stock

Exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While public confidence in the performance and

progress  of the economy was an underlying  factor,

the  steep  climb in share prices in recent  months

was  fuelled  largely by strong speculative  demand

which  was  stimulated in part by the international

currency  problems. Some speculative  interest  can

contribute  to the growth of a healthy market.  But

excessive  speculation will lead to  disruption  of

the  development  of  the  Stock  Exchange  as   an

institution  for  funnelling private  savings  into

productive  investments. The Stock  Exchange  shows

all  the  signs of an overheated market. While  the

Government  has  no desire to cause  a  precipitous

fall  of  the  market, I wish  to  outline  certain

measures  which could lead to an abatement  of  the

feverish tempo. These measures are expected to have

a  speedy, effective and persistent impact  on  the

market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One measure concerns credit facilities provided

by   banks  and  other  financial  institutions  to

operators   in   the  stock  market   against   the

collateral of scrip. It is the practice of banks to

offer  credit  limited  to  a  certain  percentage,

varying  with the philosophy of each bank,  of  the

prevailing   market  price  of  scrip  offered   as

collateral.  Needless to say as the market  spirals

upwards,  shareholders enjoy the use of  additional

funds  to propel the market forward even faster.  I

am  therefore  asking  the  Monetary  Authority  of

Singapore  to  draw up guidelines  to  ensure  that

prudent lending limits are observed. There will, of

course,  be  consultations with banks  and  finance

companies  to  consider lending criteria  that  are

more  realistically  based and applied  by  prudent

bankers and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



financiers.  Obvious  risks arise  if  unrestricted

loans  are  made  on  the basis of  inflated  share

prices in an overheated market. Should this measure

be  implemented, a large volume of funds  available

to operators will be immobilized.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A feature of the current bull market, not only in

Singapore and Malaysia but in nearby territories as

well,  is  the  spate  of  take-overs  and  mergers

involving  the exchange of paper. Not surprisingly,

this  paper merry-go-round is uncritically accepted

when  the  market roars along. When the  market  is

depressed,  corn-panics practise the  old-fashioned

virtue of offering hard cash for acquisitions. I am

asking  the  Securities Industry Council  (SIC)  to

give the most careful scrutiny to all proposals for

take-overs  and mergers, particularly  those  where

settlement  is partly or wholly by an  exchange  of

scrip.  The  SIC  jurisdiction  will  cover  public

listed companies incorporated in Singapore as  well

as non-listed subsidiaries of these companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these two specific measures, as

Members  are  aware,  on  16th  February  1973,   I

introduced  a Bill in Parliament designed  to  give

the  Government  more effective  control  over  the

securities industry. The new Bill will replace  the

Securities  Industry Act passed in 1970  but  never

brought  into  force.  The  Bill  was  drafted   in

consultation  with  the  Malaysian  Government  and

contains  several improvements over the  1970  Act.

The new Act will give the Government wide powers to

investigate manipulations and other abuses  in  the

market,  which  at  present go  unchecked,  and  to

punish the offenders appropriately.



<br><br><i>Trade and Manufacturing</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further distressing symptom is the unevenness

in  development  of the economy. While  almost  all

sectors grew satisfactorily, the development in the

two  largest, trade and manufacturing, has not been

large enough for their effect upon total growth  to

have been most pronounced.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Trade</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, trade earnings now constitute 27.1 per

cent  of  our GDP. It grew by only 7.3 per cent  as

against  7.2 per cent for 1971 when world  monetary

conditions  were equally troubled. But the  average

growth under more settled conditions from 1966-1970

was  17.5 per cent. An extra 10 per cent growth  in

trade, which represents the difference between  the

1972  growth rate and the 1966-1970 average  growth

rate, would have added some 2.7 per cent to our GDP

growth  rate. Continued stagnation, if not decline,

is   likely  in  the  entrepot  trade.   But   some

improvement  in  the  prospects  for  international

trade  in  1973 should not be impossible. What  are

these prospects?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the recent currency crisis, the economic

outlook for the major industrialised countries  for

1973  appeared  bright.  A  forecast  made  by  the

Organisation   for   Economic   Co-operation    and

Development (OECD) indicated that Japan should lead

the  group of industrialised countries with a  real

growth  rate  for  1973  of  nearly  11  per  cent,

followed  by the United States with 6.25 per  cent,

France and Canada 6 per cent, Germany 5.2 per cent,

and  Italy and the United Kingdom 5 per cent. These

are  high  rates of growth compared  with  previous

years.  The  recessionary tendencies which  plagued

economic  conditions in early 1972  were  therefore

absent for 1973 and international trade seemed  due

for    a    correspondingly    vigorous    revival.

Confirmation  that  1973  would  be   unlike   1972

appeared  in the form of high commodity prices  for

sugar,  wheat,  and other cereals, and  also  in  a

smaller but more important way for South East Asia,

in rubber, rice and tropical products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the prospects have now become dimmer

because  of possible disruption from parity changes

and  floats in world trading currencies, it is  not

unlikely  that the international trading  community

has   learnt   how  to  live  with  such   monetary

disturbances. Trade will be much less affected than

with   the   first   unfamiliar   realignment    of

currencies. For example, trading firms in Japan had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



for   some  time  before  the  recent  float   been

accustomed in their trading commitments to discount

a  10  per cent revaluation of the Yen. They should

adjust without difficulty to any higher rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Singapore trade, it may be of some

interest to note the very mixed effects last year's

currency  realignment  had on Singapore's  external

trade during the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revaluation of the Yen affected the size of

Singapore's imports from Japan because these became

dearer. On the other hand, the Yen revaluation  did

not lead to any increase in Singapore's exports  to

Japan.  In fact, exports of petroleum products  and

rubber declined. The reason may be due partly to  a

dock  strike in Japan which affected trade  between

Singapore and Japan adversely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uncertainty of the Pound Sterling resulting

in its eventual floating retarded Singapore's trade

with Britain. The revaluation of the Mark led to  a

moderate  increase in trade between  Singapore  and

West Germany.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devaluation of the US Dollar resulted in an

appreciable increase in trade between Singapore and

the  USA.  Total trade for the first 11  months  of

1972   increased  by  28.3  per  cent  to  $2,069.2

million. Imports from the USA increased by 20.7 per

cent while our exports to the United States rose by

41.5  per  cent due mainly to the export  of  semi-finished  products  back to the  United  States  by

subsidiaries  of American companies  in  Singapore.

Multi-national companies with their assured markets

can   surmount  tariff  and  currency   and   other

difficulties.



<br><br><i>Manufacturing</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, earnings from manufacturing which now

constitute  some 23.5 per cent of our  economy,  as

measured by GDP figures, grew by only 20.1 per cent

as against 25 per cent in 1971 and 27.5 per cent in

1970.  The decline gives cause for some concern  as

to whether it evidences an adverse trend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturing investment commitments certainly

fell from $716 million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



in  1971  to  $252 million last year. This  is  due

partly  to  the pause in the investment commitments

of  the  petroleum refining industry which amounted

to  $285 million in 1971. Investment commitments on

shipbuilding  and  repairing  yards  also   dropped

sharply  from  $142.2  million  in  1971  to  $66.9

million   last  year.  Electrical  and   electronic

products,  however, appear to be growth  industries

of the future, accounting for nearly 40 per cent of

the  new  investment commitments  made  last  year.

Investment commitments in low technology industries

dropped because no incentives are now being offered

to   such  industries  as  a  result  of  our  more

selective policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investments obviously require to be further

stimulated but we would expect that so far  as  the

petroleum  and transport industries are  concerned,

we  can be relatively confident that the decline is

only  temporary.  Our  projections  based  on   the

industries'   own  figures  are  for  increase   in

investment  in  the  former, to  produce  1,000,000

barrels  a day by 1974 or 1975, and in the  latter,

to  produce by 1975 over $600 million in  value  of

output.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these two industries our locational advantage

will  continue  to favour maximum development.  The

future  of  Singapore is correlated  to  its  being

considered an ideal offshore manufacturing base for

multi-nationals  and  their  subsidiaries.  In  our

overseas   investment   promotion,   the   Economic

Development  Board  (EDB)  will  not  overlook  the

smaller but no less important manufacturing  firms.

To  encourage them to diversify their activities to

Singapore, my Ministry will be prepared  to  invest

equity up to 50 per cent, with the option for  them

to  buy  back  a  substantial  portion  later.  The

criterion  will largely be whether these firms  are

able  to  make  in  Singapore, technology  products

which have not been made here before. The EDB  will

identify  these firms and the Development  Bank  of

Singapore    Limited   (DBS)   will   manage    our

investments.  A  fund  of  $100  million  will   be

provided for this purpose to serve as a catalyst to

use  to  best  advantage our  vast  expenditure  on

training.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the still inadequate supply of

skilled labour slows down the setting up of  higher

technology  industries.  In  the  interim,   highly

skilled  foreign  workers  are,  therefore,   being

admitted  under our liberal immigration scheme  and

granted   permanent  residence  for  the   economic

benefit they are likely to bring to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to allocate a large

part of its resources to technical education. Since

1962,  and  more  actively  in  recent  years,  the

Government  through the Economic Development  Board

has  been  engaged in a multiple-programme approach

to    develop   industrial   training   in   modern

manufacturing   skills.  Besides   the   Industrial

Development  Scholarship Scheme, we  now  have  the

Overseas  Training  Programme, the  Joint  Training

Programme,  the Apprenticeship Training Scheme  and

the   Training  Subsidy  Scheme  for  sophisticated

industries.  The  essence of all these  schemes  is

that  the Government is prepared not only  to  meet

fully  or  partly  the training  costs  of  workers

required by industries but also to create a poo1 of

skilled   workers   available   for   future   high

technology industries setting up in Singapore. I am

glad  to  report  that at least  two  large  multi-national   firms,  which  have  recently   set   up

substantial  operations in  Singapore,  have  taken

advantage of the joint training programme to  train

over 1,000 skilled machinists and toolmakers over a

period  of five years. This number is in excess  of

their  own  immediate  requirements.  In  addition,

negotiation  is  in  progress with  several  multi-national  firms  to train jointly  an  even  larger

number  of skilled workers. The Government  on  its

part  has  earmarked  $8.7 million  for  industrial

training for the next financial year. These various

training  programmes,  where  necessary,  would  be

streamlined further and modified to take account of

changing needs from year to year. Our target is  to

reduce  our  present dependence on foreign  workers

for   growth   to   more  modest   and   manageable

proportions by 1977.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a situation of nearly full employment, a goal

of  economic policy must be to upgrade the  quality

of the work in our enterprises by modernisation and

expansion   with  higher  investment  per   worker.

Industries  which  do not carry out  investment  of

more  capital  per  worker,  change  production  to

higher   quality   products   and   improve   their

organisation, must expect to lose their workers  to

industries  which do. Such industries will  not  be

able  to meet their wage increases every year which

will  be  recommended by the National Wages Council

because  of  their low productivity.  Our  National

Wages  Council must estimate the effects  of  their

guidelines  for  last  year's  wage  increase,  and

consider  the increase appropriate this year  inter

alia,  to  achieve this objective and to  induce  a

structural  transformation in  our  industrial  and

other  sectors.  Too  high an  increase  in  wages,

taking   productivity  into  account,  will   cause

unemployment. Too low an increase will increase the

tightness of our labour market, and starve the flow

o  workers into the higher technology industries we

want  either  by  upgrading of present  firms  with

lower technology, or by new firms from abroad being

established.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though there is no need to amend existing

legislation on tax incentives because these by  and

large  are  adequate, I intend  to  apply  existing

legislation to give optimal advantage to industries

which can introduce new technology to Singapore and

are  willing  to train our workers  in  the  skills

demanded.   Training  costs  may  be  regarded   as

investment  in  the same way as  fixed  assets  for

purposes  of  tax  exemption  periods  for  pioneer

companies.  For industries with high capital  Costs

and  long  gestation periods, the Government  would

apply  the  provision  of the existing  legislation

with  some  flexibility  in  order  to  enable  the

companies to reap fully the benefit of the  pioneer

status granted to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together with the better performance I expect in

1973   from  1972's  major  growth  sectors,   i.e.

construction,  tourism, banking and port  activity,

the  measures I have outlined should be  sufficient

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>



offset   any  uncertainties  caused  by   the   new

international currency realignment, and to  restore

the  rapid growth rate of Singapore in 1973 to  its

15 per cent level.



<br><br><i>Budget</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now we come to the Budget for the financial

year  1973-74 which I shall hereafter  for  brevity

call  FY  1973.  There are certain changes  in  the

presentation of this Budget which I should like  to

explain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my last Budget Statement I emphasised that the

changing  needs of the economy in the 1970s  called

for  occasional  reappraisal of  the  policies  and

priorities  of allocation of funds, as  well  as  a

review  of  the administrative machinery  including

the  present  system of government  budgetting  and

financial  control.  To facilitate  the  appraisal,

action  has been taken to modify the format of  the

Estimates  so  that the recurrent  and  development

expenditures of various Ministries and  departments

can be examined in a coherent way. As a first step,

I  am  presenting the FY 1973 Main and  Development

Estimates  as  a unified whole in one  document.  A

common set of Heads of Expenditure is used for both

types   of  Estimates.  Further,  the  grants   and

contributions  in  the  Main Estimates  which  were

previously  grouped under one Head  of  Expenditure

such as Contributions and Charitable Allowances are

now  distributed to their respective Heads. I  hope

that  with these rearrangements Honourable  Members

will  have  a clearer and more complete picture  of

the  provisions  under each Head of Expenditure.  I

should  add  that  for the FY  1974  Estimates,  my

officials   are   exploring  the   possibility   of

restructuring subheads with the aim of streamlining

and rationalising their presentation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last sitting of this House, I made a

statement  on  revision of salaries and  terms  and

conditions  of  service in  respect  of  the  upper

echelons  of  particularly the  administrative  and

professional officers in the public service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



These  changes  are part of the overall  effort  to

keep   men   of  quality  and  integrity   in   the

administrative machine so that it will be  in  trim

and  able  to  respond to the increasingly  complex

demands  on  the  business  of  Government.  Higher

rewards, either monetary or otherwise, can only  be

justified for high performance and efficiency.  The

over-riding principle of award in the service  will

remain that of merit. I am confident that the civil

service  will continue to maintain its high  degree

of devotion and integrity and increase its level of

performance,  with  more of the  talented  officers

remaining  in  the Service. The revised  terms  and

conditions  announced  for the  administrative  and

professional officers have not been incorporated in

the Budget because they were finalised too late for

entry,  but Members should bear them in  mind  when

considering the Budget.



<br><br><i>Mechanisation and improvement in work methods</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the volume, quality and scope of

services provided by the Government sector requires

an additional 2,154 posts for FY 1973. However, the

search for manpower-saving methods of work has  not

been  in  vain. For example, the use of  mechanical

road sweepers made it possible to reduce the daily-rated work force in the Sanitation Services by 198.

Similarly,  through  a change in  work  methods  at

offstreet car parks, it was possible to abolish all

the  211 vacancies of car park attendant in the Car

Parks  Division.  In  addition, requests  involving

1,038  positions, mostly of the clerical and daily-rated  grades,  were turned down.  The  departments

which  made  those requests were  either  asked  to

redeploy   their  existing  establishment   through

improved   work  methods  or  given  provision   to

purchase labour-saving equipment.



<br><br><i>Estimates of Expenditure, FY 1973</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Memorandum* (* Paper Misc. 1 of 1973) on the Main and Development Estimates gives the detailed breakdowns of

expenditure. I would like to underline briefly  the

major areas



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



of  Government endeavour, in providing a  framework

within  which the individual provisions under  each

Head of Expenditure may be discussed later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total outlay for the FY 1973, excluding the

transfer   from  the  Consolidated  Fund   to   the

Development  Fund,  is $2,773.6  million.  Of  this

amount $820.6 million or 29.6 per cent is earmarked

as  loans  to statutory authorities and  industrial

and  commercial enterprises in which Government has

a  stake.  The  needs of economic development  have

therefore  been  fully  taken  care  of.   Of   the

remaining  $1,953.0 million, Statutory  Expenditure

takes  up  $307.4  million.  Defence  and  Internal

Security  take up another $632.1 million.  This  is

9.4  per  cent less than the provision for FY  1972

reflecting the consolidation in the Singapore Armed

Forces after the rapid build-up in recent years.



<br><br><i>Housing</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One key area of development is, of course, low-cost housing for the people. Despite the rapid rate

of  construction of low-cost apartments there is  a

long  waiting  list  for  such  accommodation.  The

Housing  and Development Board is stepping  up  its

Third  Five-Year Building Programme (1970-1975)  to

30,000  units,  a year. To finance this  programme,

substantial loan funds are required and  have  been

provided  in  the Estimates for the next  financial

year.  Of the total provision of $820.6 million  of

loan  funds to statutory bodies and commercial  and

industrial  enterprises, 5349 million or  42.5  per

cent goes to the HDB.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of low-cost housing estates also

entails  the  provision of other  basic  facilities

such  as  sewerage,  schools and  post  offices.  A

number  of sewerage schemes for which provision  is

made  in  the  FY  1973 Development  Estimates  are

specifically  to  meet the requirements  of  public

housing  estates. These include the Bedok  Sewerage

Scheme,  Telok  Blangah  Sewerage  Scheme,  Kallang

Basin  Sewerage  Scheme and the Woodlands  Sewerage

Scheme. With an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>



increasing proportion of our population residing in

large  public housing estates, it becomes necessary

to  relocate  schools so that  our  young  students

residing  in such estates will not have  to  travel

long   distances  between  home  and  school.  This

accounts  for the substantial increase in provision

for  the  building  of  new  schools  in  the  next

financial year.



<br><br><i>Education and industrial training</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of schools is only one aspect of

the Government's investment in education. Last year

I   mentioned  the  revision  of  the   terms   and

conditions   of  employment  of  various   services

including  the  Education Service.  Following  this

revision,  a  major promotion exercise  for  school

principals and teachers was launched and is nearing

completion.  It  is hoped that  this  will  give  a

welcome  boost  to  the  morale  of  the  efficient

officers  and  improve  the  quality  of  teaching.

However,  the  shortage  of  manpower  in   schools

persists. To alleviate the situation, the  Ministry

of  Education has started a scheme whereby teaching

cadets  are  recruited  to study  at  the  proposed

Institute of Education and, in between, take  on  a

teaching  load in schools as a means  of  acquiring

practical  experience.  Eventually,  it  should  be

possible  to cut down on the use of relief teachers

and  achieve  a  more uniform level  of  competence

amongst teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substantial sums are provided for the development

of new campuses for the University of Singapore and

the  Singapore Polytechnic. For works and buildings

in  FY  1973  it  is estimated that the  University

campus  at Kent Ridge will require $12 million  and

the  Polytechnic Campus at Dover Road $2.5 million.

As  I said earlier, an increasing supply of skilled

industrial  workers  is  required  to  sustain  and

accelerate   industrial  growth.   The   Industrial

Training Board will play a major role in this area.

Not  only  will training at vocational institutions

need   to  be  expanded  and  upgraded  but  proper

apprenticeship  and trade-testing  programmes  will

have to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>



planned  and  implemented. A substantial  grant  is

provided  to start the Board on a sound  basis.  At

the  same  time,  as  I  have mentioned  elsewhere,

Government   will  participate  in   joint-training

schemes with well-established industries which have

the  know-how. A total of $8.7 million is  provided

in  the  Estimates  for the recurrent  and  capital

costs of such schemes.



<br><br><i>Environment</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, industrialisation and urbanisation

can affect our environment adversely. Experience in

some  industrially-advanced  countries  shows  that

unless  parallel action is taken to  safeguard  the

quality     of    the    environment    even     as

industrialisation and urbanisation take place, anti-pollution  action will be an uphill  task.  In  the

case  of Singapore, the smallness of our land  area

makes  avoidance  of  this  problem  all  the  more

urgent.  With the establishment of the Ministry  of

the  Environment, greater attention can be directed

towards this problem and measures to combat it  can

be better co-ordinated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One major anti-pollution programme undertaken by

the Ministry of the Environment is the resiting  of

hawkers  from backlanes and side streets to  proper

markets  and hawkers centres so that proper  health

standards  and  cleanliness  of  hawkers   can   be

enforced.   This   accounts  for  the   substantial

allocation  for  the construction of  market/hawker

centres  and  the traditional number of enforcement

personnel for the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limited land area in Singapore is again

evident when we think of the great volume of refuse

that  has  to  be disposed of each day,  using  the

existing method of dumping. The construction of  an

incinerator  and a compaction plant will  no  doubt

help  alleviate  this problem.  For  these,  it  is

estimated that $1.20 million will be required in FY

1973.



<br><br><i>Health</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we may expect preventive measures against

all  sorts  of pollution to result generally  in  a

healthier people,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



we   know   that  there  will  always  be  patients

requiring  diagnostic and treatment facilities.  In

FY  1973,  additional provision has  been  made  to

strengthen  and  improve  such  facilities  on  two

fronts.  First,  the medical specialities,  namely,

Nephrology,  Plastic  and  Reconstructive  Surgery,

Neuro-Surgery  and  Cardio-Thoracic  Surgery   will

continue  to be developed. Some 130 new  posts  are

provided  for these. Secondly, hospital  facilities

will  be extended. A small hospital will be  opened

at  Changi,  whilst  the  Alexandra  and  Sembawang

Hospitals  which were taken over from  the  British

Armed Forces will be developed further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For FY 1973, the total outlay for the Ministry of

Health including the Hospitals Division is 12.4 per

cent   of  the  total  allocation  for  the  Social

Services sector.



<br><br><i>Revenue Estimates</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is the Government expenditure to be financed?

Details of the Revenue Estimates are given  in  the

supplementary Memorandum* (*Paper Misc. 1 of 1973) to the Estimates. I  need to give only a brief overall picture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For FY 1973, revenue is estimated at $1,874.9

million.  This  represents an  increase  of  $199.7

million or 11.9 per cent over the revised estimates

of $1,675.2 million for FY 1972. If the residual of

$45.8  million  from  the former  Currency  Board's

assets  is excluded from the revenue for  FY  1972,

the  revenue  estimates for FY 1973 show  a  growth

rate of 15.1 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In FY 1973, income tax and payroll tax are

expected  to  yield $554.0 million  which  is  $110

million  or  24.8  per cent more than  the  revised

estimates  of  $444.0  million  for  FY  1972.  The

healthy  performance of income  and  payroll  taxes

reflects the growth in the economy with nearly full

employment, with most individuals earning more  and

with   most  companies  maintaining  their   profit

margins.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue from property tax is expected to be $190

million  during  FY  1973 as  against  the  revised

revenue of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



$166 million. The high growth of this item reflects

the  robust  growth of the construction sector  and

higher rentals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue from indirect taxes and taxes on outlay

in  FY  1973  is  expected to yield $545.0  million

which  represents an increase of $71.0  million  or

15.0  per cent over revised estimates for FY  1972.

This  substantial increase is partly due to  normal

growth   and  partly  due  to  the  tax   revisions

introduced in October last year. The main increases

are   expected  from  customs  duties  on  liquors,

tobacco and petroleum products, other import duties

and taxes on motor vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-tax items are an important source of revenue;

collectively,  they contribute  $570.7  million  or

30.4 per cent of the total estimated revenue for FY

1973. Included under this category are the revenues

from  sales  of  goods and services  of  Government

departments,  land sales, investment of  Government

assets    and    currency   surplus    and    other

administrative  fees. The main increases  would  be

from  land sales and sales of urban renewal  sites,

which   together  are  expected  to  yield   $102.0

million,  due  to  more land being  leased  to  the

Housing  and  Development Board,  the  Jurong  Town

Corporation  and the private sector for development

purposes.  The  Special Aid of �50.0  million  from

United  Kingdom will be fully disbursed by the  end

of  1973.  The decline in revenue from Special  Aid

will,   however,  be  compensated  by   anticipated

increase  in  earnings  from  Government  financial

investments.



<br><br><i>Tax Policy and Changes</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the tax measures I propose for this

Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have stated in the past that so long as the

economy  continues its robust rate  of  growth,  it

will  be  unnecessary to impose  major  or  painful

increases  in  tax rates although changes  in  such

rates and additional taxation may from time to time

be  necessary  or  desirable to  effect  social  or

economic policies. Members, who are aware  of  this

principle and who have looked at the balance of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



revenue  and expenditure in the Main Estimates  and

noted  the modest surplus of over $20 million which

has  been planned, will no doubt have already  come

to  the conclusion that to provide sufficient funds

to  meet the current as well as part of development

needs of Government there is little or no need  for

additional taxation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to be able to confirm them in this

conclusion. In fact, the only changes I propose  to

make  are  in  connection with  the  grant  of  the

following tax exemptions or tax reliefs:



<br><br><i>(a)  Tax Relief for Taxpayers who support Dependent Parents and Grandparents</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, many Members suggested that reliefs

should be given for the maintenance of aged parents

and  handicapped children on the grounds  that  the

Eastern  concept  of filial piety  requires,  among

other things, that children should look after their

parents  in old age. I recognise that with  greater

urbanisation  and  more limited living  space,  the

Asian family unit is threatened with disintegration

and that aged parents may be left on their own when

they  most  need care and attention. I am therefore

prepared   to   give   some  tax   relief   as   an

encouragement  to  taxpayers who look  after  their

parents  and  grandparents where they  are  without

work or income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from 1-1-74 a taxpayer may claim a

tax deduction from his income of $300 per dependent

parent or grandparent. A taxpayer may claim up to a

maximum  of  two dependent parents or grandparents,

who  are over 55 years of age, are supported by the

taxpayer and are staying in the same household.  If

a   parent   is  below  55  years  but  handicapped

physically  or mentally, he will also  qualify  for

tax relief.



<br><br><i>(b)   Tax   Relief   for  Taxpayers   who   support Handicapped Children</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the deductions allowed from

assessable income in respect of children cease  for

those over 16 years old. This is so even when  they

are physically or mentally handicapped children who

do not earn any income



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



and who continue to depend on their parents. As  it

is  fair that taxpayers should get some tax  relief

for  supporting such children, I propose to provide

that  with  effect from 1-1-74 taxpayers can  claim

allowance  for  handicapped children although  they

are over 16 years.



<br><br><i>(c)   Income   Tax   Relief  for   Provident   Fund   Contributions  and  Premium  on  Life   insurance   Policies</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Income Tax Act, an individual is

allowed   to   deduct   from   assessable    income

contributions  to  approved  provident  funds   and

premiums on life insurance subject to a maximum  of

one-sixth of assessable income or $4,000, whichever

is the less.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increase in compulsory CPF

contributions, it has been found that the one-sixth

of  assessable income limit has become restrictive,

particularly  for  the lower middle  income  group.

With the compulsory CPF contribution rate at 12 per

cent,  there  would  be  left  for  deduction  from

assessable income only 4.67 per cent of his  income

from  the  amount  paid for other approved  private

provident  fund  contributions and  life  insurance

premiums.  I propose therefore to remove the  limit

of  one-sixth of assessable income with effect from

1-1-73.  The  limit  of $4,000  will  remain.  This

measure  should encourage the public to  save  more

either  in private approved provident funds  or  in

life   insurance  policies,  in   line   with   the

Government's policy of encouraging savings.



<br><br><i>(d)  Reduction  of  Stamp  Duty  on  Marine  Hull Insurance Policies</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, sea insurance policies are subject to

stamp  duty  at a flat rate of 50 cents per  policy

except  for  hull  insurance  policies  which   are

subject to ad valorem rates of 20 cents per  $1,000

insured  if  the insurance is for less  than  three

months;  30  cents  per $1,000  if  the  policy  is

between three to six months and 50 cents per $1,000

if  the  policy is between six to 12  months.  Hull

insurance on a fleet of any substance will run into

large sums and an ad valorem stamp duty can be very

substantial.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  insurance companies are  handicapped  by

the  high  rate  of stamp duty here in  competition

against  London insurance companies  which  do  not

have to pay stamp duties on sea insurance policies.

To  promote  Singapore's development as a  maritime

centre  able  to  provide essential facilities  and

services  including  sea  insurance  at  reasonable

cost,  I  propose to replace the ad  valorem  stamp

duty by a flat rate stamp duty of $1 per policy for

all  sea insurance policies. This new rate of stamp

duty will be implemented with immediate effect.



<br><br><i>(e)  Exemption from Stamp Duty of Promissory  Notes issued by Customers to Banks</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my last Budget Statement, I announced the

abolition  of stamp duty on Negotiable Certificates

of   Deposits   (NCDs),  bills  of   exchange   and

promissory  notes transacted from or through  banks

to  promote  money  market activities.  It  is  now

proposed  to extend this exemption from stamp  duty

also  to  promissory notes issued by  customers  in

favour  of  banks. This is to increase the  variety

and  availability  of  money  instruments  and   to

promote greater sophistication of our money market.

This exemption will come into effect immediately.



<br><br><i>(f) Non-collection of Withholding Tax on Negotiable  Certificates of Deposit in Local Currency</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not, strictly, represent a tax

concession,  but  I  have  included  it  here   for

completeness.  If withholding tax on interest  were

collected  at  source,  the  introduction  of   the

Negotiable Certificates of Deposit (NCDs) in  local

currency would not be possible as the marketability

of  this  instrument  would be affected.  The  NCDs

could play an important role in the development  of

the  money market and would be welcomed by both the

financial   sector  and  corporate  investors.   By

purchasing  NCDs,  investors  would  be   able   to

maintain  liquidity  and, at the  same  time,  earn

income.  The NCDs will therefore be attractive  for

discount



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



house business. The Monetary Authority of Singapore

will allow financial institutions to issue NCDs  in

the local currency, with effect from 1-4-73, on the

following conditions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The issuing banks and discount houses will

keep  records  of purchasers  and  sellers  of     NCDs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The taxable income will be taken as the

difference  between  the  sale  and   purchase

price of the NCDs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The NCDs will have to be deposited with an

authorised depository.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The issue of NCDs will be subject to Exchange Control Regulations.



<br><br><i>(g)  Exemption  of income Tax to Crew  employed  on  Singapore Registered Ships</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 1969, the Singapore Registry of Ships

was  opened to foreign vessels. In order to attract

such  vessels,  the  initial registration  fee  was

lowered to $2.50 per net ton and the annual tonnage

fee  was  reduced  to  20 cents  per  net  ton.  An

undertaking  was also given that these  fees  could

not  be increased for a period of 20 years from the

date  of  the  initial registration of  the  ships.

Further,  when  a  ship is sold to  another  person

without  a change of flag of the ship, the  initial

registration fee would be further reduced to 50 per

cent of the fee subject to a minimum of $1,250  and

a maximum of $6,000. A refund of 50 per cent of the

annual tonnage fee would be granted if at least  25

per  cent  of  the  crew  are  Singapore  citizens.

Shipowners, who wish to transfer the ships  to  the

Singapore  flag, need not have them  resurveyed  if

the ships possess valid certificates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, income tax has been exempted on the

profits derived by a Singapore registered ship with

effect  from  1-1-69.  These incentives  have  been

successful in attracting foreign ships to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



Singapore.  In January 1969, there were  357  ships

with  a total of 252,940 gross tons. Now the number

of  ships is 782 with a total gross tonnage of 1.75

million gross tons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enhance Singapore's status as one of the

busiest ports in the world, it is felt that further

impetus  must be given to the registration of  more

ships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from direct employment, the registration of

more  ships  in Singapore is likely to bring  other

benefits   such  as  from  bunkering  and  repairs.

Therefore,  it  is proposed to give exemption  from

income  tax to crew working on Singapore registered

ships  with  effect  from  1-1-74  (based  on  1973

earnings).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of revenue resulting from all these tax

exemptions   is   estimated  at  approximately   $2

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the financial policy which I

have   outlined   in  this  Budget  Statement   has

necessarily   laid   stress  upon   public   sector

programmes  and  expenditures.  But   I   am   very

conscious  that  the  success  of  any  policy   in

maintaining  and furthering progress  in  Singapore

will depend also upon the private sector, upon  not

only  the  response  but  also  the  effective  co-operation  of  both workers and employers  in  such

sector.  It  is important that we seek to  maintain

the  present  very  healthy climate  in  industrial

relations  in  Singapore. Harmony  between  unions,

employers  and  the  Government  has  been  clearly

evident in many fields of coordinated activity, for

example,  in  improving labour productivity  or  in

maintaining the highest quality in our products. In

the  National  Wages  Council  also,  it  has  been

heartening   that   despite   strongly    competing

interests,  our  unions  and  employers  could   so

readily  come to agreement last year upon how  much

of  the  growth of wealth in the Singapore  economy

should  be  distributed in the form  of  percentage

wage  increases, and how much accordingly  retained

for   further  growth  in  business.  It   is   not

unreasonable    to   expect    that    for    1973,

recommendations  for another equitable  sharing  of

rise in national income will again be agreed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an effective development plan, and assured

collaboration from management and workers, I  think

that  we  may  face  1973 with some  confidence  in

achieving a very rapid growth rate, perhaps at  our

targeted figure of 15 per cent per annum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.
