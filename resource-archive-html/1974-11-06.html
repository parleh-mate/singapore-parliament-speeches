<div align="center"><b>ELECTION OF PRESIDENT OF REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br>2.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to move the

motion standing in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with Article 1 of

the  Constitution of Singapore, elects Dr Benjamin  Henry

Sheares as President of the Republic of Singapore  for  a

further term of four years to commence immediately  after

the expiry of his present term of office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As President, Dr Sheares has undertaken his duties with

a  conscientiousness  which has characterised  his  whole

working life. Unfortunately, in December 1971, his health

suffered  a setback whilst under examination in  hospital

at  Houston, Texas. Those of us who knew how gravely  ill

he was, before and after he had his operation in December

1971,  were  deeply concerned. However, he  overcame  the

setback. Slowly and steadily, he pulled himself  up  from

the  aftermath  of  such a major operation.  Courage  and

tenacity  summed  up  the spirit in  the  man.  He  never

treated himself as an invalid and, as a consequence,  his

doctors were surprised and delighted, within less than  a

year of the operation, to report that he could resume his

normal duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firmly but surely, he adjusted life to his new

condition and settled a format for an active intellectual

life.  He resumed his regular protocol and social duties.

He also resumed his teaching and demonstration classes at

Kandang Kerbau Hospital, imparting his considerable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>



experience and expertise to young doctors aspiring to  be

gynaecologists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has carried his office with unassuming dignity,

application  and self-discipline. He has won the  respect

of  all  who came to know him. He takes his official  and

social  duties  seriously.  He  has  a  keen  and  lively

interest in his work. He reads up the background  to  all

the  papers that constitutionally have to go to him,  and

thus is abreast of what is going on in government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving his re-election, my colleagues and I have

every  confidence that he will continue to discharge  his

duties  ably. He has now gained wider experience,  and  a

greater  understanding of the ways of  men  and  nations.

Every  dignitary who has had to call on him has  received

unfailing courtesy. To everyone of them, he has paid  the

deepest compliment any Head of State can pay, namely,  to

take  a  real  interest in the man, learn about  him  and

about the country or causes he represents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion to re-elect Dr Benjamin Henry Sheares as the President of the

Republic of Singapore for a second term.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since his appointment as President, Dr Benjamin Sheares

has  demonstrated his capability and efficiency as a Head

of State. He is not only a gentle man of kind disposition

and  manners  but  also  one  who  is  far-sighted.  What

convinced us is his character and demeanour.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>



He  has  an interest in all spheres of life, not only  in

social  life but also in religious celebrations organised

by the various communities in Singapore. For instance, in

the  annual celebration of the Prophet Mohamed  organised

by  the  Muslim  Missionary in  Lorong  12,  Geylang,  to

commemorate the birth of Prophet Mohamed, leader  of  the

Muslim  faith  and the apostle of God, President  Sheares

has  never  rejected  such  an  invitation.  Instead   by

attending such meetings he contributed valuable  speeches

for   the  Muslim  people  in  the  Republic.  In  brief,

President Sheares is not only a Professor in Surgery, and

an  efficient  one at that, but he is  also  a  wise  and

efficient Statesman who has won the hearts and  minds  of

the people. A leader who possesses these qualities can be

a  symbol of unity among our multi-racial, religious  and

cultural communities in our Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the re-election of Dr

Benjamin Henry Sheares for a second term.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  wholeheartedly support the motion moved by  the  Prime

Minister  to  re-elect  Dr  Benjamin  Henry  Sheares   as

President for a further term beginning 2nd January, 1975.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our President has until today carried out his duties

efficiently,  thereby  earning our  praise  and  respect.

Moreover,  he  has  impressed  the  foreign  leaders  and

diplomats by his intelligence and simplicity. An  example

of  his qualities can be found in the Commonwealth  Heads

of  Government Conference held in our Republic.  You  may

recall  that it was just before that Conference that  our

President  first  assumed  the  responsibilities  of  the

office of Head of State. During that important and trying

period,   when  there  were  so  many  leaders   of   the

Commonwealth, our President performed his duties as  Head

of  State and received these dignitaries with accord  and

earned  a  good reputation. He has established  the  fact

that he is in every respect fit to be a President.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, sincerely support the re-election of Dr

Sheares,  who has gained experience in the  duties  of  a

Head  of  State, and I am sure all hon. Members  in  this

House will join me in support.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, allow me to second the motion moved by  the

Prime  Minister to re-elect Dr Benjamin Henry Sheares  as

the  President of the Republic of Singapore for a further

term of four years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President is the Head of a State. In external

and  internal affairs he symbolises the dignity  and  the

prestige of a country. At the same time he is the highest

and  model  representative  of  the  people.  He  has  to

shoulder onerous and important missions of state.  Hence,

it  is  very  important to choose someone  with  profound

learning,   good  character  and  quality,  and   eminent

reputation  as President. Looking for such a  person  may

not be too difficult a problem with big countries, but to

a  small country with a small population such as ours, it

really is not an easy task.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since assumption of office of the President of the

Republic  of Singapore, Dr Sheares has fully demonstrated

his  fine qualities in this appointment. His efforts over

the  past  few  years  have won for our  country  a  high

reputation  and  prestige abroad. His  contributions  are

what  we all can see and praise, with appreciation.  From

his performance in the past few years, we have reason  to

believe  that Dr Sheares will be able to continue leading

our country to march towards a better future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad to second the

motion  re-electing  Dr  Sheares  as  President  of   the

Republic  of  Singapore for a further term. We  can  also

assure  him  here that we will give him our full  support

and co-operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with Article 1 of

the  Constitution of Singapore, elects Dr Benjamin  Henry

Sheares as President of the Republic of Singapore  for  a

further term of four years to commence immediately  after

the expiry of his present term of office.

<div align="center"><b>PROVISIONAL DRIVING LICENCE HOLDERS AGED 17 TO 21</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Communications

if  he  will  give  (i)  the  number  of  applicants  for

provisional  driving licences in the 17 to  21  year  age

group  as at the latest convenient date; (ii) the  number

of   accidents,  fatal  or  otherwise,  involving   motor

vehicles  driven  by  provisional  licence  holders   and

licence holders within that age group in 1971, 1972, 1973

and  the first nine months of 1974; and (iii) the  number

of  owners of classes 2 and 3 motor vehicles who  are  in

that age group.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Mr Chai Chong Yii) (for the Minister for Communications):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  a person applying for a provisional driving licence

is  first  required to apply for a test  in  the  Highway

Code.   As  at  30th  September,  1974,  the  number   of

applicants for the Highway Code test was 69,700. There is

no  breakdown by age for this group of applicants. As the

number of Highway Code tests that can be conducted in any

one  month at present is about 10,000, there is a waiting

period of about seven months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After passing the Highway Code test, the applicant is

issued  with a Provisional Driving Licence (PDL).  As  at

30th  September, 1974, the number of PDLs issued  to  the 17/21-year age group total-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>



led 34,819. Breakdown by age is as follows: -

<pre>

        Age         PDL Holders

        16 years        387

        17            2,987

        18            6,165

        21            9,118

             Total   34,819

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Traffic Police does not maintain breakdown

statistics  of traffic accidents according to provisional

licence  holders and for the years 1971 and 1972, perhaps

the Member for Punggol licence holders, neither breakdown

figures  according  to  age groups  were  maintained  for

traffic  accidents will be satisfied with  the  following

breakdown  figures for the various categories of  traffic

accidents  by  drivers of the age group 17 -21  years  as

indicated below*.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<pre>

* Following are the figures: -



                  Serious    Slight

 Year    Fatal    Inujury    Injury    No Injury    Total

 1971      -         -         -           -        1,147

 1972      -         -         -           -          642

</pre>

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As particulars of age in respect of the ownership of a

vehicle are not required for registration purposes, it is

not  possible to give the statistics as requested by  the

Member  for Punggol as to the number of owners of Classes

2  and  3  motor  vehicles who are in the 17/21-year  age

group. However, the hon. Member may be interested to know

that  as at 30th September, 1974, there were 84,452 Class

2  motor  vehicles  (i.e, motorcycles and  scooters)  and

143,019  Class  3  motor vehicles  (i.e, motor-cars  and

station wagons).

<div align="center"><b>CONTROL OVER NEW LICENCE HOLDERS AND PROFESSIONAL DRIVERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Communications

(a)  if  he  will  consider the display  by  new  licence

holders  of  `P' plates on the front and  back  of  their

vehicles for a period of not less than twelve months from

the  date of issue of their licences, and the requirement

that  such licence holders undergo a re-test if they  are

penalised  more than six points under the Points  Demerit

System  during  that period; and (b) if he will  consider

the  requirement that professional drivers, who are  over

the age of 60 years, undergo a medical examination.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii (for the Minister for Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Transport Advisory

Board,  now defunct, did discuss the suggestion that  new

licence  holders should display `P' plates on  the  front

and  back of their vehicles for a period of time from the

date  of issue of their licences. The suggestion was  not

adopted  in  February  1970  as  the  members  were   not

convinced  that new qualified drivers were more accident-prone  than  other drivers and that introduction  of  `P'

plate  system  would  help to reduce the  accident  rate.

Information received from a motorist association  in  New

South  Wales,  Australia, where  such  a  system  was  in

existence  showed that although such schemes may  have  a

beneficial psychological effect on drivers, there was  no

satisfactory  statistical information  to  indicate  that

such  schemes did have effect in reducing accidents.  The

Registrar  of  Vehicles has sought  for  more  up-to-date

information  from the relevant authorities in  Australia,

and  this information is being awaited. If the `P'  plate

system  has been found to reduce accidents involving  new

licence  holders, my Ministry will consider its  adoption

with favour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, we shall implement the Points Demerit

System  and Traffic Ticketing System. We shall  find  out

how  effective these two new systems will be in  reducing

traffic  accidents. It is relevant to point out  that  in

the initial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>



phase  of  implementation of the Points  Demerit  System,

only  violations  of  the more serious  traffic  offences

qualifying for four points or more will be recorded.  The

intention  is to concentrate on identifying  and  weeding

out the dangerous and reckless drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the Traffic Police and the Registry of

Vehicles will review the accident statistics to determine

whether  there  is  a correlation between  the  rates  of

accidents and the number of years of driving experiences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to medical examination for professional drivers who

are over the age of 60 years, this requirement is already

in  practice under Rule 6 (2) of the Road Traffic (Public

Service  Vehicles) (Vocational Licences  and  Conduct  of

Drivers, Conductors and Passengers) Rules, 1974,  whereby

no  vocational licence for a professional driver shall be

granted  to  a person who is 60 years old or more  unless

the Registrar of Vehicles is satisfied that such a person

is medically fit to be licensed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member may be interested to know that there is

a  plan to extend this requirement for drivers of private

cars soon.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Law and

National  Development (a) whether he is aware that  there

have been several accidents, both fatal and otherwise, at

the junction of Upper Serangoon Road and Lim Ah Pin Road,

which  is  a bus terminal, since the re-routing of  buses

into  Simon  Road!  Florence Road/Lim Ah  Pin  Road/Upper

Serangoon  Road, due to the heavy traffic  especially  in

the  mornings and evenings; (b) whether he is aware  that

requests to have either a pedestrian crossing or  traffic

light  system  installed at the said junction  have  been

turned  down;  and  (c)  whether  he  will  now  consider

installing the traffic light system that will operate  in

the day and switch off automatically in the night, so  as

to  enable a smoother flow of traffic in the vicinity  in

the  mornings  and evenings and also help to  reduce  the

threat to life and injury of pedestrians.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there have been a few accidents

at  the  junction of Upper Serangoon Road and Lim Ah  Pin

Road,  namely, four in 1973, and seven in 1974, only  one

of which was serious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following a request by the hon. Member and his Citizens

Consultative  Committee in Ponggol for  a  traffic  light

system to be installed at this junction, the Public Works

Department carried out traffic counts and studies of  the

accidents at the junction and found that the volume



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>



of  traffic does not justify the installation  of  a

traffic  light  system.  The  left-hand  side  of   Upper

Serangoon Road (going towards Ponggol), between  Florence

Road  and Lim Ah Pin Road, has double yellow lines marked

thereon, restricting parking on that side. The visits  by

mobile  squad policemen have indicated that this  parking

restriction  is  generally  observed.  However,  on   the

opposite  side of the road, there is a bus  terminus  and

double  parking of buses is not unusual due  to  lack  of

parking  space. This restricts the view of motorists  and

results  in  some  impatient drivers  taking  unnecessary

risks.  The situation, however, will be kept under review

and  consideration is now being given to a proposal  that

the bus terminus be re-sited.

<br><br>2.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Special Constabulary comprises volunteers and part-time national servicemen. Its members are paid nominal

allowances  for their services during duty  hours.  Their

employers  are  under  no  obligation  to  pay  them  the

difference  between their civilian pay and the allowances

paid  by  the  Police for their services. To  assist  the

members of the Special Constabulary the Police Force has,

as  far as possible, arranged their duty hours such  that

they   suffer   minimal  disruption  in  their   civilian

occupations   or  suffer  loss  of  personal  emoluments.

However,  in  view  of  a severe manpower  shortage,  the

Police  Force intends to utilise the Special Constabulary

more  intensively.  This may result in  loss  of  pay  to

members of the Special Constabulary unless the Government

is in a position to compensate the losses through make-up

pay,  as  is  being done in the case of national  service

reservists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like the Special Constabulary, the People's

Defence Force is also composed of national servicemen and

volunteers. Recently the Force was reorganised to  enable

it to undertake additional operational duties. Members of

the  People's  Defence  Force are  only  paid  allowances

during  their training periods. Unless they are  national

service reservists, their employers are under no obligation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>



to pay them any make-up pay. As a result they  too

would lose in terms of pay if they are not compensated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is intended to remedy the situation through this

Amendment  Bill.  The Bill seeks to repeal  and  re-enact

section  24  of  the  Enlistment Act  (i.e, the  present

provision  providing for make-up pay). Apart from  making

provision  for  makeup  pay for the  categories  who  are

already eligible, the Bill requires employers to pay make-up  salary to both the volunteers and national servicemen

(i.e, those who are performing part-time service) in  the

People's Defence Force and the Special Constabulary  when

they are called up for training or reserve service and to

volunteers  in  these  Forces when  they  are  mobilized.

Employers  may deduct the amount paid from their  payroll

tax.  Those  employers who are not liable to pay  payroll

tax, and those whose payroll tax is insufficient for such

deductions, may claim reimbursement from Government. Self-employed  members of the People's Defence Force  and  the

Special  Constabulary can claim reimbursement  also  from

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides that employers of volunteers in

the  People's  Defence Force and the Special Constabulary

are   to   continue  to  make  Central   Provident   Fund

contributions to the extent that they would be liable had

the  volunteers not been mobilized for full-time  service

or called up for training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill repeals section 13 of the Vigilante Corps Act

and  with this repeal, volunteers in the Vigilante  Corps

will not be liable for full-time mobilization. There  are

two  main reasons for repealing section 13. First, it  is

unfair  to  impose  the  liability  of  mobilization   on

volunteers in the Vigilante Corps. Secondly,  it  is  not

intended to mobilize the volunteers anyway, as there  are

large  numbers  of  national servicemen  doing  part-time

service in the Vigilante Corps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other important points in the Bill relate to

reinstatement   in   employment,   prohibition    against

dismissal  and leave of absence when performing  service.

The  provisions in respect of these matters are found  in

sections 21, 22 and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>



23 of the Act. In the Bill these three sections have been

amended  so  as to extend them to the volunteers  in  the

People's Defence Force and the Special Constabulary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to seek a small point of clarification. There  does

not  seem  to be any provision with regard to daily-rated

workers.  I think there is provision for those  who  have

been employed continuously for a period of six months  or

for  those  who are self-employed. But what about  daily-rated people, such as building site workers?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I am happy to clarify that.

There  are  two types of daily-rated workers.  One  is  a

person who, although he may be daily-rated, is on regular

employment  in a firm. To that extent, he is  covered  by

the  provisions  of this Bill. The other type  are  often

casual   workers  going  from  one  place   to   another,

particularly  in the construction industry.  It  is  very

difficult   to  cover  them  here  because  they   change

employers  so  often  that you cannot  pin  them  to  any

particular  employer. In effect, such people  would  come

under  the  category of "own account" workers,  of  which

there are quite a substantial number in the reservists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Council of Social Service (Amendment)

Bill  was introduced in Parliament on 23rd October, 1974.

This Bill, now before the House, seeks to make amendments

to  the Singapore Council of Social Service Act, 1968, in

the  light  of  the experience gained by the  Council  in

administering the Act over the years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council was formally established with the following

objectives:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to co-ordinate the voluntary welfare activities in

Singapore not only between its member organisations,  but

also with other organisations;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to maintain and improve standards of voluntary

social work and to encourage voluntary welfare efforts in

fields not fully covered by Government;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to assist member organisations in their efforts to

promote welfare activities in Singapore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to initiate, assist and organise forms of relief

and schemes of social service;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) to disseminate information to members of the public

and  interest  them  in  social welfare  matters  and  to

encourage their participation in these matters; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) to make recommendations to Government regarding

legislation in the field of social welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of administering the Act to achieve these

objectives, the Council has encountered some problems and

this  is  why my Ministry has proposed the amendments  in

this Bill. I shall now elaborate on these problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past experience shows that many purely religious and

non-welfare related organisations have sought affiliation

with the Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Council's main interest and focus is on

welfare and social service. It is therefore proposed that

the Singapore Council of Social Service Act be amended to

limit    purely   religious   and   non-welfare   related

organisations  from seeking affiliation to  the  Council.

Such organisations which seek to carry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>



out  welfare  and social service activities and  wish  to

affiliate  with  the  Council must establish  a  separate

structure  for  social and welfare activities  and  could

then seek affiliation in their own right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under current legislation, any person, firm,

corporation  or  organisation which subscribes  not  less

than  $25  per  year may be an associate of the  Council.

Likewise, any organisation affiliated to the Council must

subscribe  not less than $10 to the Council. The  Council

has,  among  its  associates and member organisations,  a

wide-ranging  group of bodies, including many  well-known

firms  and corporations. The present subscription of  $25

per annum for associates can be considered negligible. My

Ministry  therefore proposes an amendment  to  allow  the

Council  to  charge any subscription it  thinks  fit  for

associates as well as for member organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many people who are interested in welfare

work but who, for some personal reason, do not wish to be

attached  to  any  particular welfare organisation.  Such

people  should be encouraged, nevertheless, to contribute

towards the work of the Council. It is proposed that  the

Council  be empowered to appoint such people as  honorary

members, in addition to the patrons-in-chief and  patrons

whom  the  Council is already authorised to  appoint.  In

this  way, more people could contribute actively  towards

the  work  of  the Council. Such honorary  members  will,

however, be restricted from holding office and voting  in

the Board of Management of the Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Board of Management, whose members are

elected   by   the   Council  from   among   its   member

organisations  and associates or are ex-officio  members,

there   is  a  provision  in  the  Amendment  Bill  which

stipulates  that  only those who are confirmed  as  still

being representatives of member organisations can be  re-elected  to office in the Board. In this way, the Council

hopes  to  ensure that only those who are still  actively

involved  in the work of its various members are  allowed

to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>



elected  or to hold office on the Board of Management  of the Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Annual General Meeting, the Council

also  holds  two  general meetings  each  year.  This  is

specified in the Singapore Council of Social Service Act.

However, administratively the Council is now able to work

much more closely with members and keep them informed  on

developments  through the various committees  set  up  to

service   members   as   well  as   other   channels   of

communication  such  as circulars,  news  bulletin,  etc.

Therefore,  there is no further need to have two  general

meetings  a  year.  This is why it is proposed  that  the

frequency of general meetings be reduced to just  once  a

year  (excluding the Annual General Meeting) in order  to

encourage  greater participation on the  committee  level

which  is  a  much more effective means of  relating  and

involving members to come together to further the objects

of the Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed that the Council be vested with the

power  to  make its own regulations concerning procedural

matters  on  application for and withdrawal of membership

in  the Council, the conduct of general meetings and  the

submission   of   reports   and   returns    by    member

organisations.  It is felt that the Council  should  have

these  powers in order to be more effective  as  the  co-ordinating  body  for  voluntary  welfare  activities  in

Singapore.  It  also  keeps  the  public  and   community

informed  on  current trends and developments  among  its

member   organisations  and  the  welfare  community   in

general.  The  regulations which the Council  intends  to

make  are  subject  to the approval of the  Minister  for

Social Affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to remove doubt as to whether the Council is

authorised to accept gifts and procure contributions  not

only to the Singapore Council of Social Service Fund  but

to  establish and administer trust funds, it is  proposed

to amend the Act to enable the Council to administer such

trusts.   From  time  to  time,  the  Council  has   been

approached by Foundations and Trusts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>



to hold monies in trust but because of the uncertainty

regarding its power in this matter, the Council has been

unable to act on these offers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the need to maintain the spirit of voluntary

social  work  among  Singaporeans,  it  is  necessary  to

provide  the Council with an effective framework for  the

achievement of its objectives. Hence, the need  to  enact

this amendment to the Singapore Council of Social Service

Act.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill now before this House seeks to make

certain amendments to the State Lands Encroachments Act

(Cap. 286) to provide, inter alia, for more speedy

removal of unlawful



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>



occupants of State land and the movable properties dumped

thereon  and  to provide that the Government's  right  to

recovery of possession of State land shall not be  barred

by  any period of limitation. It also seeks to revise the

penalties provided for certain offences prescribed  under

the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill seeks to repeal subsection (2) of

section  3 of the Act which enables an unlawful  occupant

of State land to defeat the action of the Commissioner of

Lands  to  recover  possession of State  land  by  merely

raising  a  claim of title to the land.  In  most  cases,

there  is no substance in the claim, which merely  delays

proceedings.  A  new subsection is to be enacted  in  its

place  to provide that when a claim of title is  made  by

the  occupant  charged  with the unlawful  occupation  of

State land, the defendant may apply to the High Court for

the  action to be transferred to that Court on the ground

that the defendant is claiming title to the land. The new

subsection will prevent frivolous claims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past some unlawful occupants of State land have

not  made efforts to remove their property which has been

deposited on State land even after they have been  served

with  a  notice requiring them to do so. Under clause  3,

which  amends  section 4 of the Act, the Government  will

now  be  empowered  to  seize  and  forfeit  any  movable

property  found  on  State land when it  is  not  removed

within 28 days of an eviction notice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 4, which amends section 7 of the Act, it

will  be  an offence for any person to trespass on  State

land  by  depositing, placing or throwing any article  or

thing  whatsoever, or any waste, refuse  or  other  thing

onto  State  land.  A new subsection  will  be  added  to

section  7  to  punish  any director,  manager,  partner,

secretary  or  other  officer  of  a  body  of   persons,

corporate  or incorporate who is convicted of an  offence

of  trespassing  on State land unless  such  persons  can

prove  that they had exercised due care and diligence  to

prevent the commission of the offence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new section 12 has been enacted under clause 5 of the

Bill to provide that State land shall not be acquired  by

adverse possession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum penalty of a fine of $50 prescribed (under

section  13  of  the Act) for the offence  of  unlawfully

depastoring on State land will be increased  to  $500  by

clause 6 of the Bill and the maximum penalty of a fine of

$200  prescribed (under section 14 of the  Act)  for  the

offence  of  trespassing on State land by the removal  of

timber,  minerals, shells and stones therefrom will  also

be increased to $2,000 by clause 7 of the Bill.

<br><br>3.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five years ago this House debated the Bill to

liberalise the law on abortions. It was debated  with  an

intensity  not  often seen in the recent history  of  our

parliamentary proceedings. This was for the  reason  that

it  raised  important social, economic, humanitarian  and

religious issues which touched the conscience of many.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of the debate, points for and against the

Bill were exhaustively put and argued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposing arguments against the Bill that were put

forward   were  of  three  categories.  They   were   the

Religious,  Moral or Ethical, and Medical  objections  to

the  Bill.  I  had  then refuted the opposing  arguments,

although many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>



of  them were highly theoretical and speculative.  As  it

has  turned out, nearly five years of experience  of  the

operation of the Abortion Act has proved that many of the

moral  and medical objections to the Bill were unfounded.

For  example, availability of legalised abortions has not

led to the breaking down of moral standards and increased

promiscuity. Neither has it led to increase  in  maternal

mortality and morbidity for our pregnant women. In  fact,

during  the whole period of nearly five years  there  was

not  one  single death or permanent disablement resulting

from the several thousands of legalised abortions done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the religious arguments against legalised

abortions for obvious reasons could not then as  well  as

now  be  proved or disproved. As I have stated  then,  to

allow   ourselves  to  be  tied  up  with  the  religious

arguments  for and against abortions, which in  any  case

would  never result in any conclusion even if the  debate

went on till the cows came home, was entirely futile. The

religious viewpoints must necessarily be based  on  one's

own  religious  beliefs and faith as well as  conscience.

And these must differ from individual to individual. They

include  one's  belief as to whether the  foetus  can  be

considered  human  life, which learned  men,  medical  or

otherwise for centuries have still not been able to agree

on.  Of  course, the religious beliefs and conscience  of

any  individual is to be respected. But at the same time,

should  not a pregnant woman be entitled as of  right  to

request  in  good  conscience  for  and  be  granted  the

termination  of  her pregnancy if it  will  lead  to  her

greater  benefit and happiness? Further, is it  right  in

our   multi-racial   and  multi-religious   society   for

opponents to the liberalisation of the law on abortion to

impose their moral or religious standards upon the entire

community?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in drafting the Act and in its introduction

five  years ago, it was in deference to some of the  more

valid  arguments  against unrestricted liberalisation  of

abortion that many safeguards



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>



were   included  in  the  Act.  For  some  who  supported

legalised   abortion  it  appeared  to  be   rather   too

restrictive. In fact, Mr Speaker, Sir, you as one of  the

speakers supporting its introduction, as Member  for  Joo

Chiat, stated then that the Act was too restrictive to be

effective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was for this reason that the Bill was sent to Select

Committee.   Here  oral  and  written  submissions   were

carefully  considered and weighed, resulting in  some  of

the  suggestions being incorporated in the final  version

as passed by Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also for the same reason that the Act was given

a  limited life span of four years of operation with  the

possibility of extension of one year, and one year  only.

The object was that Parliament should have an opportunity

to review operations and effects of the Act at the end of

the  stated  period. Parliament would  then  be  able  to

determine whether the Act should be allowed to lapse  and

cast  into limbo as a social experiment which has  failed

or  to  be re-introduced and made a permanent feature  of

the Statutes of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to report to Parliament here that this

social  experiment on legalised abortions has been highly

successful. In some instances it has more than  fulfilled

our  expectations. I therefore urge this House to support

and pass this re-enacted legislation which has been drawn

up  on the experience of operating the Act over the  last

4½ years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information of the past 4½ years is best given in

the  form  of  figures which should speak for themselves.

The  tables are given in the Addendum (Appendix I, cols 1151-4),

to my speech which I have distributed to Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me highlight some of the facts as we may derive

from these figures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of abortions done each year since the law

was  brought into effect in 1970 was gradually built  up,

averaging around 4,000 a year. Relating these figures  to

the total number of live births, as it is usually done in

reporting



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1974/19741106/19741106-HA-0331151.pdf"">APPENDIX I - CHARACTERISTICS OF WOMEN WHO HAD LEGALISED ABORTION 1970-1973 (Cols 1151-1152) </a><br>



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1974/19741106/19741106-HA-0331153.pdf"">APPENDIX I - RESULT OF APPLICATION FOR LEGALISED ABORTION (Cols 1153-1154)</a><br>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>



such  figures for purposes of comparison, the  number  of

abortions  which were procured under the Act  was  7  per

cent  of  all live births in Singapore from 1970 to  1972

and 10.3 per cent in 1973. The rate in 1974 projected for

the  whole  year may exceed this figure. You will  recall

that  the  estimates  given  at  the  time  the  Act  was

introduced was that it would amount to about 10 per  cent

of  all  births.  The rate of abortion recorded  is  thus

within our original estimate. It is also well within  the

rates  reported  in other countries, which  have  similar

liberalised abortion laws. In the United Kingdom the rate

is  14  per  cent  of  all births. In  Denmark  the  rate

recorded was 12.7 per cent in 1970, the United States  13

per cent in 1971, in Sweden 16.8 per cent in 1971 and  in

Japan 37.8 per cent in 1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to the fears expressed in the original debate,

our pregnant women have not been turning to abortions  in

great numbers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The categories of women who had aborted provide some

further interesting information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ethnic groups of those who had aborted were in

approximate   proportion  of   their   numbers   in   the

population.  In  other words, abortions had  been  sought

equally by all our ethnic groups. This indicates  that  a

common  need  for  legalised abortion among  these  women

which  transcended  cultural and religious  barriers  had

been met.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breakdown of the abortion figures by class of

persons  on  the basis of the combined income  of  family

indicates  that  the  vast majority  of  women  who  seek

abortions are those in the lower income group. The median

income is less than $300 per month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the marital status of the women who had

abortions,  more  than 90 per cent of them  were  married

women.  The  median number of children they  had  is  4.3

children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to the warnings made by those who opposed

abortions  that legalisation of abortions would encourage

promiscuity, the number of unmarried



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>



women  who had abortions numbered only 5 per cent of  the

total  number of abortions done in the first four  years,

and 9 per cent in the first half of this year. This is in

contrast  with  the experience in other  countries  where

abortions on the unmarried were very much higher. In  the

United  Kingdom it amounted to nearly 50 per cent of  all

abortions done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these are conclusive proof that our expectations of

the  Act  were  correct. The Act provided  an  avenue  of

escape  for  our married women, especially those  in  the

lower  income  group, to be freed from the burden  of  an

unwanted or unintended pregnancy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another fear that was voiced was that our women would

prefer    abortions   to   the   somewhat    inconvenient

contraceptive practice. It was argued that they will turn

to  abortions  and come over and over again for  repeated

abortions whenever they become pregnant. This fear is now

proved  to be unfounded. The number of persons  who  have

had  more  than one abortion have numbered only  6.6  per

cent of the total number of abortions undertaken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fear can also be put to rest on the basis of the

following  two  facts:  (a)  since  the  Act  came   into

operation  4½  years  ago, the  total  number  of  family

planning acceptors attending the family planning  clinics

has  consistently been in excess of the targets set;  (b)

contraceptions  must  have been practised  in  increasing

numbers  to have reduced both the crude birth  rates  and

the  absolute  number of children born  in  Singapore.  A

paper studying the various methods which have contributed

to this fall in birth in Singapore ascribed contraceptive

practice  as being responsible for about 50 per  cent  of

the  births averted while abortions were responsible only

for about 6 per cent of births averted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, there is evidence to suggest that overall

contraceptive  practice improved since the liberalisation

of   abortions,  due  to  post-abortal  family   planning

counselling.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To quote figures in support, in 1972, there were 788

post-abortal sterilizations. This works out to  about  14

per  cent of the total number of sterilizations in  1972.

In  1973, the number of post-abortal sterilizations  rose

to  2,056  which works out to 23 per cent  of  the  total

number  of  sterilizations in that year. In  1972,  there

were  428  new  family planning acceptors  through  post-abortal motivation. This works out to about 2.4 per  cent

of  the  total number of new acceptors in 1972. In  1973,

the   number   of  new  acceptors  through   post-abortal

motivation rose to 483 which works out to 2.5 per cent of

the total number of new acceptors in that year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore clear that contraceptive practice is

the accepted and preferred mode of limiting the number of

children  in families. This is as it should be.  Further,

to   encourage  contraceptive  practice,  women  must  be

confident  that  if these fail - as they do  sometimes  - they  can  fall back on readily available abortion.  Thus

legalised abortion is a very important complement to  our

already comprehensive family planning programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another expressed fear was on the safety of the

procedures  for  an operation of abortion.  Here  no  one

could  deny  the fact that under any operative  procedure

there  would be an element of risk, no matter how  small.

The  mortality  figures of abortions published  in  other

countries had ranged from 2 to 30 deaths per one  hundred

thousand. We were very conscious of such hazards.  But  I

am glad to announce that throughout this entire period of

4½  years, not a single death has occurred from abortions

performed  under the provisions of the Act. In  contrast,

you  will  have read recent reports in the press relating

to deaths from illegal abortions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complications resulting from abortions under the Act

have also been of a very minor nature. There have been  a

few  complications such as excessive bleeding. But in all

of these the patients were restored to health without any

permanent disablement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had been suggested, in certain studies, that there

might  be  adverse psychological effects, such  as  guilt

feelings   and   emotional  aftermaths   resulting   from

abortions. A study on the psychological effects, if  any,

on  patients  who had undergone abortions  was  therefore

undertaken  by  our  psychiatrists and  psychologists  in

collaboration with our obstetricians. The total number of

persons investigated were all the cases done in the first

year.  They  were  followed  up  throughout  the  period.

Although  the  full analysis of the results  is  not  yet

available, the preliminary indications are that there has

been  no  major or minor psychological effects:  such  as

emotional upset or mental anguish in the short  term  nor

has  there been any adverse effects observed in the women

in  the long term. On the contrary, the findings indicate

that  the  women  have been immensely relieved  when  the

abortions were over and perhaps, for these reasons,  have

benefited mentally by having had the abortions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A psychiatrist reporting on the psychological effects

of  abortion  had stated that the notion of post-abortion

mental illness is probably a myth, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Abortion far from being a precipitative of psychiatric

illness,  is actually a defence against it. For  a  woman

who  has  let her life be directed by forces  outside  of

herself,  to make a decision to take charge of  her  life

can  be  an  extremely liberalising, positive experience.

For  the first time in her life she is master (or  rather

mistress) of her destiny.'



<br><br>Conversely, a British woman psychiatrist, contended from

her studies on British women that -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If they are refused (abortions) their mental and

physical health, their family life and often their

children's future can be catastrophically affected.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of various disincentives against

large  family  size  and to promote acceptance  of  small

families, there should be made available the entire range

of  facilities ranging from family planning  services  to

abortion facilities. Failure, Mr Speaker, Sir, to provide

these  facilities  would be regarded  as  perpetrating  a

cruel fraud on our people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In concluding the review, it is with a sense of

satisfaction  and fulfilment to know that  this  historic

social  experiment was timely and had achieved  its  main

objectives.  It has freed our women from the  tyranny  of

unintended  and unwanted pregnancies. It has  provided  a

reliable,  safe  method  in  terminating  these  unwanted

pregnancies,  particularly for the benefit of  women  who

could  least  afford to continue with  such  pregnancies.

These  were  achieved without the dire  consequences,  as

prophesied by some, of a lowering of moral standards  and

increase   in   promiscuity.  Nor  has  there   been   an

abandonment  of  contraceptive  practice  in  determining

family  size. Abortions were resorted to by a  relatively

small segment of the population. It acted as an important

complement    to   family   planning   by    conventional

contraceptive methods. A spin-off from this has been that

legalised   abortions  have  contributed   to   a   small

percentage of the total number of births averted  in  the

population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was, however, one objective, Mr Speaker, Sir,

which  was  not  reached. This was the reduction  in  the

number  of  illegal  abortions. We did  not  expect  that

illegal abortions could be eradicated completely  but  it

was hoped that these would be reduced to an insignificant

number.  It is not possible, of course, to determine  the

exact   numbers   which   have   been   done   illegally.

Nevertheless,  an  indication of  their  numbers  is  the

number  of  septic  abortions which are  treated  in  the

hospitals.  These  abortions are  done  through  criminal

interference, mainly by unqualified quacks. Although  the

number of septic abortions treated in our hospitals  have

more  than  halved what they were during  the  first  two

years  when the law was brought into effect, it is  still

significant.  This is a problem which was borne  in  mind

when the new Bill now before the House was being drafted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Bill now before the House is the result of the

sum  total  of  experience gathered in the  4½  years  of

operation of the Abortion Act. Thus, Mr Speaker, Sir,  we

are  now  in  a much happier position than when  we  were

formulating the Abortion Act five years



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>



ago.  We then had no experience of our own to go  by  but

had  to  depend  on certain assumptions as  well  as  the

experience  of  other  countries.  We  then  had  to   be

extremely  cautious. On the other hand, in drafting  this

new Bill we have before us all the concrete experience of

the achievements as well as the drawbacks of the existing

Act.  We  therefore have the advantage of being  able  to

make decisive amendments to the Act free from speculative

doubts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, since five years ago the attitudes of the vast

majority of our people towards family planning, legalised

abortions   and   voluntary  sterilizations   have   also

undergone  radical change. More than 60 per cent  of  our

eligible  population are currently using  contraceptives.

Another  17 per cent have used contraceptives  some  time

earlier  although not currently practising  contraception

for various reasons such as planning for a child, husband

away and so on. Another 11 per cent have been voluntarily

sterilized. Thus the attitude towards family planning  is

now one of acceptance on the part of the vast majority of

our   people.  Favourable  attitudes  towards   voluntary

sterilizations and legalised abortions are  fast  gaining

ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attitudes towards legalised abortions have also changed

considerably  in many countries of the world.  There  are

now  55  countries  in  the world  which  have  legalised

abortions on "extended" grounds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since the passage of our Abortion Act

there  have  also  been  advances in  the  techniques  of

procuring abortions. Technically the conventional  method

at  the time when the Act was passed, was to evacuate the

womb  by  dilation and curettage. Now there  are  simpler

techniques  which are just as effective,  less  traumatic

and  very  much  safer,  such  as  evacuation  by  vacuum

suction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most promising advances are in the use of drugs

to  procure  abortions. There are now abortificant  pills

which  are known in common parlance as "the morning after

pill" and others euphemistically as "menstrual regulating

pills".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>



The  ones under intensive testing are the "prostagladins"

which  appear  to  be  the most efficient  abortificants.

Unfortunately,  these are still mainly  experimental.  We

have  on  our  own  been conducting large-scale  clinical

trials  of  several  of  these drugs  in  our  Government

hospitals  but  they  have not  as  yet  been  completely

evaluated to justify release for general use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence with these new developments and with the changed

climate of thinking and attitudes this new Abortion  Bill

is presented for re-enactment. The basic change reflected

in the Bill over the existing Act which will be repealed,

is  that the decision to carry out an abortion will  rest

with  the  pregnant  woman  and  the  registered  medical

practitioner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have deliberately avoided the use of this phrase

"abortion on demand". It tends to be emotive. Some  would

use this term to describe the position when abortions can

be  done,  but within prescribed conditions.  This  would

mean  removing  from  the penal and  medical  codes,  all

conditions   that  make  abortion  subject   to   special

restrictions, penalties or procedures except  those  that

apply  generally to sound medical practice. Others  would

restrict usage of the term "abortion on demand" where the

request  for  abortion  must be acceded  to  on  pain  of

penalty  to  the  doctor approached by a pregnant  woman.

This,  in  fact, is the present position in Sweden  under

their legislation. The position envisaged in this Bill is

akin   to   the  former  position  plus  certain  special

safeguards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safeguards in the existing Act are retained. This

has  been  done particularly to ensure that the  abortion

procedures   are  undertaken  safely.  The  conscientious

objection  clause against participation in  treatment  to

terminate pregnancy has also been retained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, two major restrictive provisions in the

Act have been removed. They are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The abolition of the Termination of Pregnancy Board;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The period of pregnancy where abortion can be done

has been extended from 16 weeks to 24 weeks.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing Act all applications for abortions

had  to  be  authorised by the Board before any abortions

could  be  undertaken  except  of  course  in  cases   of

emergencies.  Experience has shown that the  need  to  go

through  the  Board has resulted in delays. Although  the

Board  processed  applications with  des-patch,  it  took

about  a  week  from  receipt of  an  application  to  an

abortion  being done. This might appear  to  be  a  short

period  but  a  delay of a week is crucial  in  procuring

abortions. The reason is that with every passing day  the

pregnancy  advances and the more difficult and  hazardous

the operation becomes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the figures, it is noted that between 12 per cent

and  25  per  cent  of  those  who  had  their  abortions

authorised  by  the  Board  did  not  turn  up  for   the

operation. A study of these cases revealed that  a  large

number were rather desperate and were unable to wait even

for  one  week for their abortions to be done. Many  thus

went to have the abortions done illegally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the other reasons advanced as to why illegal

abortions still flourish is that many persons who want an

abortion are very reluctant to apply to a Board and  have

their applications assessed by a panel of persons. It  is

true that no matter how reliably secret records are kept,

women  would  naturally shy away from making known  their

secrets.  In  the United Kingdom a Commission  which  was

appointed  to  review their Abortion Act touched  on  the

suggestion  that  a  panel should be formed  to  consider

applications  for abortions. The Justice Lane  Commission

(as  it  was  called) quite categorically  rejected  this

notion  of setting up panels for adjudication. A  Supreme

Court  ruling in the United States in 1973 by Mr  Justice

Harry  Blackmun also rejected the demand that a panel  of

persons should approve abortions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second major departure from the existing Act is

that  the period of pregnancy when abortions can be  done

has been extended from 16 weeks to 24 weeks. This may, on

superficial consideration, be considered a risky step. It

should, however, be noted that the existing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>



Act allows for abortions to be undertaken up to  the

24th  week on medical ground but up to the 16th  week  on

socio-economic grounds. Therefore, this extension does no

more  than reflect the basic change in the Bill which  is

that the decision to carry out an abortion should be made

by  a qualified doctor and his patient. As it should  be,

the  decision  will depend on the doctor's assessment  of

whether or not an abortion can be safely done. If in  the

doctor's  assessment  the abortion  should  not  be  done

because  it might be too advanced, even if it is  at  the

16th week, then the abortion should not be carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An upper limit of 24 weeks is imposed as it is

generally  accepted that a foetus may be  viable  outside

the  mother after the 24th week. Thus after 24  weeks  of

gestation the operation should be looked upon as inducing

a premature birth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the safeguards in the existing Act which are

retained  in the new Bill are as follows. Abortions  will

have  to  be  carried out in Government hospitals  or  in

approved   institutions.  The  doctors  who   carry   out

abortions   will  have  to  be  officers  working   under

supervision in Government hospitals or those who have the

prescribed  qualifications  and  experience.  It  is   an

offence  to  coerce a person to submit to abortion.  Also

retained  is  the provision that abortions  can  only  be

undertaken on Singapore citizens or their wives  and,  in

the  case of other women, only if they have been resident

in Singapore for at least four months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking into the future when abortions may be procured

entirely  by  prescription,  a  new  provision  has  been

introduced  in  the Bill which will allow any  registered

medical practitioner to abort a pregnant woman if  it  is

procured solely by drugs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons that the law has proven to have met a

need  that  it  offers  a  safe and  reliable  method  of

terminating unintended and unwanted pregnancies and  that

many  of  the  misgivings  expressed  by  those  who  had

reservations about the law have proved unfounded,  I  now

urge  the House to overwhelmingly approve this Bill  that

will further liberalise our laws on abortion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the re-enactment of this Bill, the liberation of

our  women from unwanted and unintended pregnancies  will

be enshrined in a permanent statute of our Republic. This

will also ensure that every child born in Singapore is  a

wanted child.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, however, fully conscious that however

overwhelming  the  evidence,  be  they  medical,   socio-economic, or humanitarian that is presented to prove that

the  re-enactment of the Bill is m the best  interest  of

the  people  of Singapore, there will still be  some  who

will  oppose  it  on  grounds of  religious  beliefs  and

conscience. But these opposing views must remain personal

judgments. They will, of course, be respected. But it  is

not right in our multi-racial and multi-religious society

that  these personal judgments and dogmas be imposed upon

those who do not hold such views and beliefs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember in the debate in this House five years ago

on  the existing Act, I referred to a minority group  who

on  their out-of-date beliefs had hitherto stood  opposed

to  the introduction of birth control in Singapore. As  I

said  then,  Mr  Speaker,  the  negative  stand  of  this

minority  group  had  found itself  in  the  dustbins  of

history.  I had also stated then that the opposing  stand

to the Abortion Bill would in the course of time also end

up  in  the dustbins of history. I can now say  that  the

course of history in the last five years has proved  this

prediction to be correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, in respecting the religious and ethical

beliefs  of  individual hon. Members, is withdrawing  the

Whip in this debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, I have every confidence in

the   good   sense  of  judgment,  fair  play  and   high

humanitarian principles of our hon. Members in that  they

will  not oppose the re-enactment of the Bill when it  is

clear  to  them  that it is in the best interest  of  the

people   of  Singapore  even  though  some,  because   of

religious  beliefs, may not personally be  in  favour  of

abortion. They will certainly not seek to impose their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>



personal  religious beliefs on others who  do  not  share

such beliefs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for

Health  has  given a very long explanation  on  abortion.

There  is  no doubt that he has made mention  of  Western

countries or Europe, but he has never made any mention of

Southeast Asia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Is not Singapore in Southeast Asia?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> It is in Southeast Asia, but

mention  has been made of Singapore only, and  not  other

countries. You may recall that when the Abortion Bill was

first introduced in Parliament five years ago, I was  one

of  those who spoke against it. However, it was passed by

a  majority decision, and I had no choice but to abide by

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today this Act is being amended. I wonder why the

Termination  of  Pregnancy Board is to be abolished.  The

Abortion  Act  is being liberalised and this  causes  the

fear   that   henceforth  many  people  may  abuse   this

privilege.  I wonder whether the Minister is  encouraging

the  further killing of the foetus in the mother's  womb.

During  the last few weeks, after this new Abortion  Bill

was  introduced in this Chamber, controversial  views  on

the  subject have been expressed by both doctors and  the

people,  some  of  which  have  appeared  in  the   daily

newspapers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I also understand that after the first

Abortion  Bill was passed five years ago, there had  been

cases  where  some  doctors were  not  happy  to  perform

abortions. I have also learned that some doctors who were

required  to perform abortions had pushed their cases  to

other  doctors because they felt very bad  about  it.  In

fact, a few of them had resigned from the service because

of the nature of their duties. I do not know whether this

is  right  or  wrong, but the Minister  should  know  it.

Therefore,  Sir,  I do not support the abolition  of  the

Termination of Pregnancy Board.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

Singapore  has a very limited land area. With no  natural

resources and with a population of about 2.2 million,  it

is  necessary  for  us to achieve zero population  growth

through  family planning, sterilization and abortion.  If

we want to maintain our present standard of living and to

enjoy  political and economic stability, it is  necessary

for  every one, especially the younger people,  to  limit

his  family  to two children. One must realise  that  the

peace,  progress and prosperity of a country can only  be

achieved  through  the  quality of  its  people  and  not

quantity. Too many children in a family would be a burden

to  oneself,  to society and to the government.  Unwanted

children  are  not  cared for,  and  are  not  given  any

parental  love.  They will not have nourishing  food  and

proper  accommodation, and will thereby suffer physically

and mentally. This will affect their ability to study and

eventually  they  will become school  dropouts,  juvenile

delinquents,  drug addicts, gangsters and armed  robbers.

To  avoid all this misery and suffering, it is better  to

limit  one's  family to two children only through  family

planning,  sterilization and, if necessary only,  through

abortion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in legalising the case for abortion, I would

request the Minister for Health and Home Affairs  to  get

his  staff  in the Medical Department to explain  to  the

women through the media of publicity to make them realise

that  frequent  abortion  will affect  their  health  and

endanger their lives. The Medical Department should  also

explain  to  them the advantages of family  planning  and

sterilization,  which  are  far  better  than  undergoing

abortion.  I would also like to suggest that the  charges

for  performing  an  abortion  should  be  fair  and,  if

possible, limited to a certain rate to avoid unfair  high

charges.  The charges should be within the means  of  the

lower income group workers too.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after

hearing the Minister for some 20 minutes, it appears that

he crows over the achievement of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>



Abortion Act. According to the Minister's arguments,  the

Abortion  Act  is to protect the woman who is  afraid  of

having  more children. If that is the case, then I  think

this  Abortion Bill does not justify our support. I think

the  intention  of the Bill is more than  that,  and  the

Minister has failed to explain it. That is why we  cannot

agree  with him. Our arguments which had been put forward

five   years  ago  when  the  first  Abortion  Bill   was

introduced  in  this House still hold  water  today.  The

Minister  has  said that the Abortion Act has  not  shown

increase  in  promiscuity. But I say  that  it  certainly

encourages promiscuity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> How could you know?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> What authority has he to tell us that

promiscuity  has not increased? He is not  a  student  of

sociology!  The  risk  of mortality through  abortion  is

still there. He can get a battery of doctors under him to

explain  that there is no risk, and so forth. And  I  can

also  get  so  many doctors to testify that the  risk  is

still there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I never said that the risk was not

there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Yes, but your arguments just now seem

to  tell the House that there is no risk at all. This  is

the  impression  the public will get.  If  you  say  that

liberalised  abortion  is for the sake  of  stopping  the

population  growth which is the best for  the  future  of

Singapore and its people, then I will agree with him. But

I  will not agree that liberalised abortion is to protect

women because they do not want to have more children, nor

do  I  agree  with  him  that the  woman  just  wants  an

abortion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

passing  of the Abortion Act five years ago was traumatic

for  Singapore, and now the liberalising of the Act  will

be  much  worse for us. I am just wondering  whether  the

Hon.  Minister's conscience is not pricked. It is  really

strange  that  he  comes  up with arguments  saying  that

promiscuity has not increased in Singapore -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> As a result of abortion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> - as a result of legalising abortion. From

figures I have before me, in 1970 there were 91 unmarried

Women  who  had legalised abortions; 1971 - 145;  1972  - 190;  1973  -  316;  and  January  to  June  1974  -  304 abortions.  These are unmarried women,  mind  you.  Among

divorced,  separated  and widowed  women,  there  was  an

increase from 21 in 1970 to 26 in 1971, 35 in 1972 and 47

in 1973, and 42 between January and June 1974. This tells

me  that  promiscuity has increased because of  legalised

abortion.  In  addition to that, the Hon.  Minister  says

that  repeat abortions have decreased. Repeat  abortions,

according  to the figures, show: 1971 - 111;  1972  -269;

1973  -  356;  January to June 1974 --379.  Here  again,

there  has been an increase of repeat abortions. I cannot

follow  the Hon. Minister's arguments and neither,  I  am

sure,  can the other Members in the House. Not  a  single

death,   he  says,  has  occurred  because  of  legalised

abortions. How about the dying foetus? A foetus  that  is

alive  with a soul, a foetus that is living in the mother

-~   it  is  now  dead  because  of  abortion,  legalised

abortion, legalised murder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fail to follow his arguments really and I exhort hon.

Members  not to support the Abortion Bill that  is  being

presented to the House today. Our population needs to  be

reduced, I agree; but Education, hon. Minister,  is  what

is  required to get the people to realise that we need to

decrease our population because we do not have sufficient

food,  because we do not have sufficient land space,  and

because  we  do not have what we need to have to  support

such a large population. A decrease in sexual activity is

what  we have to look for. Has the Minister done anything

to  get  facts and figures to enable Singaporeans through

education to reduce their sexual activity? I believe that

we  are  trying  to  get away by using  the  easy  method

-legalised abortion. That is how it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>



works.  It  is surprising that with such intelligence  we

cannot come up with something that will not harm not only

the mother but the living foetus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that this Abortion Bill will not involve the

Government  in any extra financial expenditure.  This  is

true. No extra financial expenditure is needed, hut I can

assure  the Government that it will be involved in  extra

"moral and spiritual expenditure".



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

my  contribution is not as sex-oriented as  the  previous

speaker,  but  whatever the views against  abortion,  the

problem of too many bodies and so little food stares some

nations  in the face, and what the future holds for  many

of  the  people  of these nations is the tragedy  of  our

times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid hardship among ourselves as a result of an

undisciplined growth in the family unit in  our  society,

we  have family planning and family planning facility for

our  peoples.  For 4½ years now abortion  has  been  made

available  under certain conditions to our womenfolk  who

request  for  it.  This Bill seeks to release  applicants

from  some  o  these conditions and offer abortion  under

minimal control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, Sir, there are matters for concern. Unless

and  until family planning education reaches the populace

in    general   and   secure   their   response   through

contraception and sterilization, there is in  my  view  a

real  likelihood that many may have to resort to abortion

because  of  carelessness or indiscretion.  Abortion  may

then  be  accepted by the people and, in fact,  become  a

primary  means of controlling or planning their families.

This can be an unhealthy situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abortion in my view is both tragic and traumatic. There

is  a  moral  disorganisation in  the  person  undergoing

abortion,  the extent of the disorganisation  depends  on

the sensitivity of the person's moral character.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying this situation at a societal level, there can

result  what is termed an anomie in society - a situation

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>



society  where  people  find it no  longer  pertinent  or

meaningful to relate their conduct with social norms as a

result of their personal experience or interpretation  of

the  pettiness of life and its qualities. It,  therefore,

becomes  imperative for the well-being of our society  to

ensure that our efforts in family planning education  are

not  relaxed.  Easily  available  abortion  must  be  and

remain, as the Minister himself says it, a complement  to

contraception.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the problem which this Bill attempts to deal with

cannot  be gain-said. I believe we need to size down  our

families as proposed, in order that our children may live

in  some  comfort  and  experience in  some  measure  the

quality of life in the future.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Sir, despite the

considerable  self-satisfaction, even aplomb,  confidence

and,  very  likely  in his mind, the positive  assertions

with  which the Minister has presented this Abortion Bill

to  further liberalise the law relating to abortion,  the

facts   still  remain  that  abortion  is  a  very  vexed

question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this House in 1969 and even now, you hear all sorts

of  views, some very emotionally expressed, some  with  a

lacing  of purported wit. Even the Minister has not  been

free   from  certain  emotion-charged  phraseology.  This

problem of abortion is certainly a very vexed question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many people in Singapore who look upon this

Act  with grave misgivings; people who feel that abortion

is  even  an outright abomination. These people  are  not

rebels,  Mr  Speaker, Sir. They are not bad people.  They

are  not  anti-Government. They  are  decent  law-abiding

people. I would expect that more than 70 per cent of such

people  voted  for the Government in the  last  election.

They  support the Government. The Minister would consider

them  very  sane, intelligent, rational,  and  even  good

looking   people.   I  myself  would  like   to   express

considerable sympathy with the views of these people, and

I would express it in as sombre a way as I can.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt in

my  mind whatsoever that this Bill will be passed  today.

Let  us  look at the reality of it all. Arranged opposite

are  people  who will definitely cause this  Bill  to  be

passed. Arranged on this side are people who are speaking

with  opposing voices. There is no doubt that  this  Bill

will  be  passed. At the same time, a climate of apparent

social  approbation has been aroused  by  very  effective

Government   propaganda,  and  I  am   using   the   word

"propaganda" in the same way as it is used in  propaganda

fide,   propagation  of  faith.  I  do  not  intend   any

pejorative implication. There has been effective  planned

propaganda to sell the idea to the people, and the people

have  responded.  But  it is necessary  for  people  like

myself   and   others  to  assert  their  own  particular

viewpoint and, having asserted that, to see what  can  be

done that is practical and what are the realities of  the

situation.  This  is the art of the possible.  We  expect

that there may be some ill-effects of this Bill. What can

be  done to mitigate such ill effects? One of the  things

we should try to encourage as much as possible is greater

and  more  intensive family education, not merely  family

education  for  the  sake of family planning  but  family

education  to bring home to the people in a family  their

responsibility to each other - how they have  to  provide

supports  one for the other in a family. This is  a  very

traditional  local ethic and it has to be  encouraged  as

much  as possible, with emphasis on the integrity of  the

individual  in  the family. Of course, with  this  family

education, one has to intensify understanding  of  family

planning  in  all  sorts  of ways  so  that,  as  far  as

possible, people can avoid resorting to abortion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, Mr Speaker, Sir, I crave your

indulgence  to  let  me make an appeal  to  people,  like

leaders  of  religious  faiths, to  intensify  their  own

efforts  to bring home to their own adherents the  notion

of the value of life and respect for the integrity of the

individual.  For  those  who are against  abortion,  they

should try as far as they can to bring home to their own



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>



people  such  knowledge of family planning  practices  as

they  themselves  find approvable,  and  those  people  - religionists,  adherents of faiths who have international

affiliations - should give all the support  they  can  to

research  to provide, if possible (and I do not think  it

is  impossible), the means of family planning which  they

find approvable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another point is that we should as far

as  possible  encourage  those who,  in  my  own  way  of

thinking,  regretfully want abortion. We should encourage

them to have their abortions as early as possible. I mean

when  they  understand  that  a  child  is  coming,   the

realisation comes early. If a person indeed has  to  have

an abortion, then it should be done as early as possible,

and  this  is  tied  up with the question  of  additional

knowledge  or  complete knowledge in  respect  of  family

planning.  I  hope  this is not taken  to  imply  that  I

support abortion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> But you are!



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> No. But it is in the circumstances that

we  find  ourselves faced with, that I am just seeking  a

way  out  that is possible. At the same time,  those  who

come  for  abortion should be given adequate counselling.

The  Minister referred to the Lane Report. But  the  Lane

Report  also  referred  to  the  necessity  for  adequate

counselling  for those who come for abortion, counselling

that  will perhaps avoid abortions later on, by  which  I

mean  a  return  for  further  abortions.  The  rate   of

recidivism in abortions, according to the Minister's  own

figures, seems to be quite high. I would urge that  these

people be given adequate counsel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which the Minister has not mentioned in

respect  of the Lane Report is that it has also  referred

to  the  necessity that should a pregnancy be  terminated

after  24  weeks the abortion would be for  induction  of

birth.  We  should  also provide that particular  measure

when people come for abortion. I think we should try  our

best,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>



Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  not  to touch the  tradition  in  our

society  as  far as we can-the tradition  that  holds  on

moral, ethical or religious grounds, that abortion  is  a

regrettable act and one that should be avoided as far  as

possible.  Abortion,  therefore, should  not  be  a  mere

substitute  for family planning. We should  encourage  as

much  as possible those who do come for abortion to weigh

all  the  considerations. There  has  been  apparently  a

weighing of considerations, in view of the figures  given

of  those  who were permitted abortions but who  did  not

eventually accept. We should encourage this consideration

so  that  respect  for  life is something  that  we  hold

valuable in our society.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hon.

Minister for Health and Home Affairs has made a very good

analysis  of this Bill in moving its Second Reading.  But

it  is  sad  to  note the way in which he  has  tried  to

forestall  criticisms against the  Bill  by  urging  this

House   to  give  passage  to  the  Second  Reading   and

ultimately  the Third Reading of this Bill. He  has  said

something  like casting all criticisms and the  opponents

of this Bill into the dustbins of history. Sir, one would

expect  a  responsible Minister to be  more  tolerant  of

opposing views. I speak, Sir, for myself on this side  of

the  Chamber. I do not use terminology such as "cast away

into  the dustbins of history". Sir, that being the case,

any  criticism against this new Bill before the House  is

deemed  to  be rubbish and, therefore, ought to  be  cast

away.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>

I  have only one hour to speak I have to make full use of

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot allow a misinterpretation of what I have said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> There has been no misinterpretation, Sir. Anyway, I will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have never said

that the opponents of this Bill be cast into the dustbin.

I  never  said that. What I said was a quotation  I  made

five  years  ago - that because of history  the  opposing

stand  that  was taken "found itself in the  dustbins  of

history".  That  is  what I have  said.  I  said  that  I

respected the views of the opponents of the Bill but  the

stand taken "found itself in the dustbins of history".



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps, Mr Ng, you may want to correct

yourself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that being the case,

"found itself".



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Would have found itself in the dustbins

trying  to  fettle down any criticism or comment  for  or

against the Bill - more so in the case against the  Bill.

As  for  myself, I will be more tolerant. I would  listen

and say, "All right, what have you got to say?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may be permitted to start off by quoting the

Minister  for Health and Home Affairs when he  summed  up

the debate on the Second Reading on the 10th April, 1969,

before this Bill was committed to Select Committee.  This

is found in Hansard, Vol. 28, col. 1043.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>



This is what the Minister said. I did not say it, but the

Minister said it, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We are not in favour of abortions on demand because,

as  I have stated in my opening speech, this may lead  to

recurrent demands for abortion and we know, as a  medical

fact, that repeated abortions result in a higher rate  of

mortality and morbidity.'



<br><br>Further down the column, Sir, I quote again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where is the abortion on demand? It is a fantasy that

was  flourished again and again by the opponents of  this

Bill.'



<br><br>Sir,  I crave your indulgence to give me a little bit  of

time to get my notes right. The Explanatory Statement  to

the Bill says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This Bill seeks to consolidate and amend the law

relating to abortion by further liberalising that law  in

certain major respects and to repeal the Abortion Act.'



<br><br>And  the  last  paragraph  of the  Explanatory  Statement

accompanying this Bill states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Finally, it should be mentioned that it is intended

that  the  legislation will no longer be of  a  temporary

nature as is the existing Act. The Bill when passed will,

therefore, become a permanent feature of our laws.'



<br><br>Sir, I cannot follow or understand the explanation of the

Minister concerned when he said that this new Bill before

the  House would further liberalise abortion. Towards the

end of his speech on the Second Reading of this Bill,  he

said  that  he did not want to use the term "abortion  on

demand". The Minister can correct me if I am wrong. To my

mind,  this Bill is in fact a way out for women  who  are

pregnant and who do not wish to have the child.  In  such

cases  the  Bill says that abortion can be  allowed.  The

Minister  tried  to whiz himself out  of  the  debate  by

trying to forestall any argument and saying that - and  I

am  not  putting words into his mouth -all the criticisms

of  the  opponents  of  the Bill  spring  from  religious

dogmas, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not going to be concerned with this particular

aspect of the Bill, but I am going to talk on the ethical

aspect  of  this Bill. In one of the deliberations  about

ethical  considerations of the Abortion Bill, as recorded

in Hansard,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>



Volume 28, col. 878, the Minister himself referred  to  -

and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Ethical, moral and social reasons form the second

category. Based on religious premises, moral reasons  arc

advocated against abortions and these reasons are further

extended to social issues.'



<br><br>There  were  ethical  considerations.  But  that  was   a

criterion.  Here  he  has  quoted  the  Prime   Minister;

Hansard, Volume 29, col. 348:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As has been stated by the Prime Minister, one of the

social  yardsticks by which we shall have  to  judge  the

results  of  the  new  abortion law,  together  with  the

companion sterilization law, will be whether it tends  to

raise or lower the total quality of our population.'



<br><br>Sir,  I myself do not follow how the Minister could  come

to  that conclusion. If he wants a higher quality type of

population in Singapore, then does he not realise that if

he  has a house - I am sure he has - he has got to employ

servants or gardeners. Now what sort of quality of people

does  he want? He has a car. But who drives the car? Does

anybody  sit  by his side in the car? Is  the  amount  of

remuneration  the  same? Why do they  have  a  Government

comprising the Cabinet? Why do they have Members  elected

to  Parliament?  Why do we have the white collar  workers

and  blue  collar workers? What sort of  quality  of  the

populace  do  you want to have? I do not understand  that

yardstick, and neither do many of my Friends on this side

of  the  House.  Therefore, the question is  whether  the

Government  is  more concerned with human values  of  the

society  as  a  whole or whether Government is  concerned

with  the  efficiency of population control. The Minister

has  vigorously  denied this, and he has  given  us  some

facts and figures. But from the facts and figures one can

see  that abortion is on the increase, whatever  the  age

group.  As I have said, this Bill actually means abortion

on  demand.  If it is so, then I oppose it, because  even

though the Minister has vigorously tried to forestall the

criticisms,  the  opponents to the Bill would  say,  "All

right, if you have abortion on demand, then you are going

to breed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>



permissiveness." That is exactly so. Or can the  Minister

ascertain that this will not be so?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out to Members of this House that

it  is  my  belief  that a permissive society  inevitably

breeds  permissiveness and promiscuity, a word which  the

Minister   has   been  trying  hard  to  pronounce.   And

promiscuity  further breeds diseases like gonorrhoea  and

V.D.  Incidentally  he  is also  the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs.  There are laws with heavy penalties  and  fines

for  those  who indulge in drug-taking, drug peddling  or

drug  pushing. He can therefore be likened to a  pair  of

Siamese  twins  trying to outbox each other.  We  have  a

situation   where  one  Ministry  fights   against   drug

trafficking,  permissiveness,  drug-taking  and   against

increases  in  the  incidence  of  V.D, and  gonorrhoea.

Campaigns have been mounted. And the other Ministry says,

"Yes,  by all means, have abortions." Where is the logic?

I  do not follow. I do not know whether the argument that

I  put forward today will stand the test of time. If not,

he  will come out and say, "it has not stood and will  be

swept into the dustbins of history."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one looks up the 1969 debate on the Second Reading

of  the  Abortion  Bill,  the Hon. Minister  consistently

fought  back and declined a discussion of the  points  on

what  he  called  "religious  or  ethical  dogmas".   Any

fundamental   objection  to  the  Bill  was,   he   said,

attributed  to concealed religious premises, even  though

at  least  one  of the Backbenchers, my good  Friend  the

Member for Bras Basah, had said when he opposed the  Bill

in 1969 that he was a freethinker. I think he is still  a

freethinker,  and he has just opposed this present  Bill.

If   anyone  wants  to  challenge  the  validity  of   my

statement, Sir, I have got all the proof here. Sir, it is

not  yet  five  years since the last debate in  December,

1969.  My  good Friend is sitting down and is enjoying  a

rest. Now, Sir, if any of the speakers on the Backbenches

who  had  opposed the Bill had based their  arguments  on

religious beliefs - for myself I have made it very  clear

and it is all in the Hansard



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>



-  many  of  them did certainly base their objections  on

ethical  considerations. I would expect the Hon. Minister

to  consider their opposing views rather than jumping the

gun  by forestalling their criticisms and saying that the

opponents  of  this  Bill  would  again  come  out   with

religious  beliefs,  religious dogmas  and,  may  I  say,

"ethics", etc. - good, the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister  for Education is here. In the schools today  we

teach  ethics, we teach them what is right  and  what  is

wrong.  In this august Chamber if a Member stands up  and

argues  on the basis of ethics or ethical considerations,

he  would be shot down even before he is allowed to stand

up  to  speak. Is this argument not considered as ethics?

What sort of educational system do we want to evolve?  If

in   the   schools  we  teach  ethics  and,  for  ethical

consideration  in  this  august  Chamber,  what  is   the

application?  By  the same measure. Therefore,  this  has

given  rise to a very curious situation, and as a  result

people sometimes ask me what we mean when we say "we  are

a pragmatic Government". They seem to think it means that

we have no principles. In view of the refusal on the part

of  the  Minister concerned even to discuss  the  ethical

considerations of this Bill, can he blame the people  for

thinking in this way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Minister quoted you, Sir, when you were a

Backbencher. With due respect to you, Sir,  he  tried  to

hand  you a bouquet. But on the other hand, you told  him

then  in no uncertain terms - if the impression I  gather

from  the Hansard is correct - you would rather  call  it

the  Abortion (Restrictive) Act. In other words, why  not

call  it "white" and "white" only, rather than call it  a

shade  of grey or black. Come out with it! Sir, you  told

him  that  a few years ago, and today he says, Sir,  that

when you were the Member for Joo Chiat you supported  the

Bill. In fact, I do not think you supported the Bill. You

were  quite  frank  when you said,  "Look,  if  you  want

abortion,  go ahead." Therefore, Sir, it would seem  that

whenever  a  question of ethics is raised,  the  Minister

would  be  like an ostrich, burying his head in the  sand

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>



refusing even to look up to the argument. Sir, I am  told

that  even the most obstinate or determined ostrich  must

come  up  for  air.  So  we  may  still  hope  that   the

implications  of  this Bill will be examined  rationally,

impartially and without emotion. After all, if we were to

think that the Minister is a man without any concern  for

ethical  principles,  we would surely  be  doing  him  an

injustice. He does not, for example, propose to introduce

a  Bill allowing infanticide at the request of the parent

in  order to reduce the size of her family. This might be

a  quick  and efficient way of reducing the size  of  the

population,  but he probably thinks that this  manner  of

behaviour would be unethical.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, if I may be permitted to quote from Hansard,

Vol. 28, col. 1040:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A Bill of this nature, [that is, the present Act and

not  this particular Bill before the House] . , is not  a

licence  for a permissive society. I have already  stated

in  my  opening speech that if the object  is  merely  to

remove  the present restraints on abortion in  the  Penal

Code,  this  Bill  in  its  present  form  will  not   be

necessary. And yet the opponents have not taken  note  of

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to what the Member for Punggol has claimed,

and  I  believe that the Member for Bras Basah  has  also

claimed  that Singapore, with the passing of the Abortion

Bill, would become an abortion centre.'.



<br><br>And again, he says in col. 1040:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No community anywhere in the present world,

irrespective of its political character, has ever thought

of  permitting  the killing of human  beings,  as  it  is

generally   understood,  be  they  sick,   old,   infirm,

paralysed or totally decrepit.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister presumably thought that this would be

an  unethical  way of acting. I have mentioned  just  now

that,   as  Minister  for  Home  Affairs,  he  is  making

strenuous  efforts to stop drug-taking. Does he  consider

this an unethical practice? Unless the Minister wishes to

be  the complete ostrich, therefore, I think he will have

to  consider  whether or not there is anything  unethical

about   abortion.  It  is  not  a  religious   dogma   or

presumption of ethics. I opposed the former Bill  because

I was concerned about human values and that the then Bill

would  not  be good for our country. I believe  that  the

present Bill will be worse, and for the same reason



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>



I  am  opposing  it.  I  do not intend  to  go  into  the

philosophical aspect which the Minister dislikes so much.

So  let me put the matter in its simplest form to Members

in this august Chamber. This Bill, if passed, and it will

be  passed because you, Sir, had mentioned in your speech

that the Bill would finally be passed. That was true then

and  it  is  still  true  today. [Laughter]  This  is  no

laughing  matter.  Do  not be too happy.  Any  woman  who

wishes  to  get  rid of something inside  her,  something

which  is  already  a living thing and  which,  with  due

respect  to you, Sir, if allowed to remain there  and  to

develop  would eventually emerge as a recognisable  human

being, just like any one of us. Is it not so? Can any one

stand  up  and say that that thing has got no life?  Note

that  I  use  the  phrase "allowed  to  remain  there  to

develop".  Sir, as I said just now, with due  respect  to

you  and  to  my colleagues who are doctors  and  medical

practitioners, when it comes to near full term  there  is

the  heart-beat of the child. Is that not  a  process  in

which  a human being is subsequently born? Sir, I do  not

want  to go into the rigmarole of philosophy, as  I  have

said. But is there no consideration given to the question

of  human  values? I would strongly urge the Minister,  I

understand  his difficulty in the twin role  as  Minister

for Health and Home Affairs, to reconsider in a rational,

impartial  way  and  without any emotion  whatsoever  the

comments made by the many speakers just now. And  let  it

not  be said that there was no contradiction to the views

exposed.  What  I would like to say for the  purposes  of

record  is this. I oppose the Bill in toto, Sir,  as  you

had  mentioned in the last part of your speech that "this

Bill  will be accepted in tow." If it is passed in  toto,

then on the same principle and for the same reason, I  so

oppose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Amen.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the

new  Abortion Bill is a matter for grave concern, because

it  will  lead  to more serious social problems.  In  the

past,  people regarded abortion as a very serious  matter

and to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>



be  considered only as a last resort. The introduction of

the  present Abortion Bill will pave the way for more and

more abortions, with the result that people will take  to

abortion   easily.  Consequently,  there   will   be   an

undesirable social atmosphere and degradation  of  social

morals.  By  that time unmarried women will not  consider

abortion as a cause for shame. Unmarried women will  take

to  abortion  as a very common matter and there  will  be

promiscuity  in  our society. If we come to  that  stage,

young  girls  will not take pregnancy very seriously.  As

the  Minister  has already pointed out,  the  concept  of

abortion  in  the  minds of the people  has  become  more

enlightened.  Perhaps  parents  will  then   tell   their

children,  "Do  not worry, go and get an abortion."  What

would  become of our society then? What would  become  of

human  dignity then? Since it is our desire  to  build  a

healthy  society of traditional values, we must  maintain

this  dignity  in  our  legislation  by  setting  a  high

standard of social morals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a small country that is not able to accommodate

any increases in population. But to control population we

can  have  proper  family planning  programmes  and  thus

promote  our national economy. I am sure all hon. Members

in this House will support me on this point. On the other

hand,  Sir,  we  should not liberalise  abortion  law  in

Singapore because it is harmful to our society. When  the

first  Abortion  Bill was introduced five  years  ago  to

accommodate those people who wanted abortions because  of

financial or health reasons, that was understandable. The

Minister  has  pointed out that the old  legislation  was

effective. If so, it is therefore not necessary to  bring

in  this  new  Abortion  Bill  to  this  House.  I  would

therefore like to express my opposition to the new Bill.



<br><br>5.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, several Members

have raised certain points which, I think, need reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the Member for Anson who, unfortunately,

is  not  here.  He  said something  to  the  effect  that

abortion means killing the foetus and that amounts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>



to  killing a human life. That point has been repeated by

some  other Members who spoke against the Bill, e.g, the

Member  for Punggol. In fact, that was his only  point  - that  abortion means killing the foetus, a human life.  I

have  stated quite clearly in my opening speech that  the

question  of  whether or not a foetus under 24  weeks  is

human  life  is  a  matter which  has  been  debated  for

centuries  by  learned  people,  both  medical  and  non-medical.  They  could not come to any  conclusion  as  to

whether  a foetus is human life, and therefore to  equate

abortion,  i.e, the evacuation of the  foetus  from  the

womb,  to  killing, murder, or infanticide  is  something

which  cannot  be accepted. Perhaps they have  their  own

beliefs  that it is human life. But there are others  who

do not think so. Therefore, as I have said, if we were to

continue to argue this point till the cows come home,  we

will come back to where we started. But from the view  of

those  who are in favour of legalised abortion, they  are

quite  categorical about it. They do not consider that  a

foetus under 24 weeks of pregnancy is human life, for the

simple  reason  that if a foetus comes out  of  the  womb

under  24  weeks, it will not be able to survive  outside

the mother's womb.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson made comments that some doctors

are  not happy to perform abortions. I have stated  quite

categorically   here  that  there  is   a   conscientious

objection  clause where nobody is forced or compelled  to

perform  an  abortion  if he or she has  a  conscientious

objection. Therefore, to say that doctors are unhappy  or

are compelled to perform an abortion is nonsense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Ho Swee stated that abortion

should be only a last resort and that we should encourage

family  planning. This is exactly what I have stated.  In

fact,  over  the  last  five years  family  planning  has

advanced to such an extent that nearly 90 per cent of our

eligible   population  have  accepted  family   planning.

Therefore,  legalised abortion which we  are  introducing

today is a complement to family planning. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>



is  not  a substitute to family planning and it will  not

replace family planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the charges for abortion and the point that

doctors  should not be allowed to exploit their patients,

as  far as the Government hospitals are concerned, it  is

contained  in  the  new Bill that a fee  of  $5  will  be

charged  and  no more. However, if private  practitioners

want  to  charge  more, we cannot control  them.  So  the

pregnant  woman has the choice of paying only $5  for  an

abortion in Government hospitals or paying more outside.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Bras Basah, he said that I

implied  in my speech that there was no risk in abortion.

That was not what I stated. I said that we recognise  the

risk  not only now but also five years ago, and  that  is

the  reason why we have certain safeguards - that it must

be  done under absolutely safe conditions. That is why we

said  that  if abortions are done outside the  hospitals,

they   must   be  done  by  competent  doctors   and   in

institutions which are approved by the Ministry of Health

as  being capable of doing safe abortions. It is  because

we were very thoughtful about the need for safe abortions

that I am glad to say after 4½ years of operation of  the

Act  that  there  was not one single mortality,  nor  was

there any disablement resulting from legalised abortions.

As  opposed  to this, an illegal abortion, as  you  know,

often turns septic and the woman dies. So it is not  true

to  say  that we do not recognise the risk. It is because

we  were able to maintain a good record of no incident of

mortality  and  morbidity in cases of legalised  abortion

that  we  are preserving the same safeguards in this  new

Bill. That is to say, if abortions are to be done outside

the  Government hospitals, they must be done in  approved

institutions  and  by  doctors who  have  the  skill  and

experience in abortion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to the Member for Potong Pasir. There

again, the Member for Potong Pasir mentioned about murder

and  infanticide. As I have already said, it is a  matter

of  belief  -whether you believe that a foetus  under  24

weeks is human or not. If you do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>



believe that it is human, then of course there is no case

of infanticide when an abortion is done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About promiscuity and permissiveness, and so on, I have

stated that after 4½ years of operation of the Act, there

has   not  been  any  lowering  of  moral  standards   or

permissiveness as a result of legalising abortion.  There

may  be  other  causes,  but  certainly  not  because  of

abortion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is about repeat abortions. I have

stated  quite  categorically that repeat  abortions  have

remained  as low as 6.5 per cent, as compared with  other

countries like Japan, Sweden, and the UK where it is much

higher.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is about education to reduce population

growth.  I  think I must answer that. It is  quite  clear

that  family planning efforts will continue, and  I  have

stated  in  my  opening speech that we are only  offering

abortion  as a last resort and as an important complement

to a comprehensive family planning programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the Member for Katong is concerned, he has

made certain remarks which, I think, are very diplomatic.

On  the whole, I do not disagree with his sentiments.  In

fact,  some of the things he has stated are not  contrary

to what I have stated in my opening speech. He has stated

that it is a vexed question. Yes, of course it is a vexed

question.  He  has  stated that there must  be  effective

Government propaganda and so on and so forth to propagate

these matters. Of course, if the Government thinks it  is

good,  it will propagate it; whether it is accident-free,

family planning or crime-free campaign, it will be  done.

But,  of  course, it does not mean that those who  oppose

abortion cannot themselves conduct their own campaign  to

persuade people not to have abortions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point he said was something about adequate

counselling for those who are forced to have abortions. I

have  mentioned  in  my opening speech  that  the  Family

Planning and Population Board has made it a point to give

adequate counselling to those who go for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>



abortions. In fact, I have quoted figures and  perhaps  I

may  repeat  that there has been adequate counselling  or

what  they  call  post-abortal counselling.  May  I  just

repeat:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Further, there is evidence to suggest that overall

contraceptive  practice improved since the liberalisation

of   abortions,  due  to  post-abortal  family   planning

counselling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To quote figures in support. In 1972 there were 788

post-abortal sterilizations. This works out to  about  14

per  cent of the total number of sterilizations in  1972.

In 1973 the number of post-abortal sterilizations rose to

2,056  which works out to 23 per cent of the total number

of  sterilizations in that year. In 1972 there  were  428

new   family   planning  acceptors  through  post-abortal

motivation. This works out to about 2.4 per cent  of  the

total number of new acceptors in 1972. In 1973 the number

of  new acceptors through post-abortal motivation rose to

483  which works out to 2.5 per cent of the total  number

of new acceptors in that year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore clear that contraceptive practice is

the accepted and preferred mode of limiting the number of

children in families.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is quite clear that abortion is, so far, a last

resort. After abortion there is post-abortal counselling,

so  that  the people will accept family planning methods,

whether  it be the pill or sterilization. So  it  is  not

true that we do not do anything about counselling a woman

who goes for abortion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what I would like to say is this. The views of

those who oppose abortions, whether they be on ethical or

religious grounds, are respected. I have made that  quite

clear five years ago and again today. But they should not

impose  upon  others  who do not  have  such  ethical  or

religious  beliefs. If a woman's conscience and religious

belief permit her to have an abortion, why should we deny

her  an abortion? Who are we to deny? On the other  hand,

if  her conscience and religious belief do not allow  her

to have an abortion, nobody is forcing that woman to have

an abortion. It was quite clearly stated in the Bill five

years  ago, and it is repeated in the present Bill,  that

no  one  can on penalty or punishment coerce a  woman  to

have an abortion against her will.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Punggol, unfortunately he is

not  here. With his rather rambling dissertation, I  have

tried



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>



my  best to comprehend him, but I am afraid I could  only

comprehend a little of what he has been saying. First  of

all,  he  took objection to my reference to the  opposing

stand that found itself in the dustbins of history. I was

just quoting what I said five years ago. That was all.  I

never  said  that opponents of that Bill should  be  cast

into  the  dustbins  of history. I do respect  the  views

opposing  the Bill, whether they be on religious  grounds

or on ethical grounds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned about someone being an ostrich. I do

not  know  who is the ostrich, he or I. But the point  is

this. He keeps on quoting what I said five years ago.  It

is very nice to hear what you have stated five years ago.

But by doing so he has forgotten that we are now debating

a new Bill and not the existing Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also said something about forestalling arguments and

so  on.  If  his  arguments had been  forestalled  by  my

opening  speech,  I  am  afraid  I  cannot  help  it.  He

mentioned something about "abortion on demand".  Yes,  of

course,  five  years  ago, the Bill then  did  not  allow

abortion on demand. I had explained quite clearly  in  my

opening  speech  that  we  then  had  no  experience   in

abortions. We had to make certain assumptions. We had  to

learn  from  the experience of other countries.  We  were

cautious  because,  as  I  said,  there  might  be  valid

arguments  then  and,  therefore, we  did  not  agree  to

abortion  on  demand  then. But now  it  is  a  different

matter. Times have changed and we have gathered 4½  years

of experience. We have all the facts and figures to prove

our point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also brought up another point about raising and

lowering the total quality of our population. He does not

seem to understand the meaning of those terms. May I just

explain? If we have unwanted children around, they  will,

as  the  Member  for Bukit Ho Swee said, degenerate  into

delinquents,  drug addicts, and so on. Therefore,  do  we

increase  the total quality of our population  by  having

unwanted children around?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the Member for Sembawang. On the matter

of  promiscuity, permissiveness and so on,  there  is  no

proof   that   abortions  have  caused  promiscuity   and

permissiveness.  In fact, all the predictions  that  were

made five years ago did turn out to be correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Member for Sembawang talked about the

degradation of social morals, human dignity, and  so  on.

Do we raise the quality of human dignity if we have a lot

of unwanted children around?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Member rising on a point of clarification?



<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Sir, a few points of clarification and a few very small statements.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I might be simplistic in

my  thinking but I do not see any reason why debates  arc

necessary  among experts to finally come to a  conclusion

whether  a foetus is a living thing or not. To  my  mind,

something  living  requires  sustenance  and  grows.  The

foetus  requires sustenance from its mother and it grows,

because  by the ninth month it is born a bonny  baby.  In

addition  to that, if it is taken out whether  before  or

after  24  weeks it cannot grow unless it is  within  its

mother.  Is the Minister suggesting that if it  is  taken

out  after  24 weeks it can grow into a baby outside  the

mother's womb?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> The answer is no.



<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> The Minister also quoted lots of percentage

figures. In my case I quoted actual figures which I  have

obtained. In actual fact, the Minister has no proof  that

legalised  abortion  has  not  led  to  an  increase   in

promiscuity. I he has these facts and figures, I would be

most grateful if he could present them to the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

wish to clarify one point. When I spoke just now, perhaps

the Minister was not fast enough to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>



grasp  my  point.  He  seemed to have  misunderstood  the

essence of my speech, or perhaps he intentionally twisted

what I said or distorted what I said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I said was that the introduction

of the new Bill would create an undesirable atmosphere in

our society and would lower the standard of morals of our

society.  The  people will take promiscuity lightly,  and

consequently  our  social  and moral  standards  will  be

gradually  lowered. The Minister also referred to  higher

figures of abortions in the European countries. It  would

appear  that in his view it does not matter what  happens

to  Singapore. I do not know whether it is his  intention

to make Singapore a second Denmark or a second Sweden. If

that is the case, then it will be too bad for Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know

whether  I  was  not fast enough to grasp  his  point  or

whether he was not fast enough to grasp my point. But the

point  is  this. I have never said that we want Singapore

to  be  a second Sweden or a second Denmark. I have never

said  that.  I said that our figure of abortions  carried

out  on unmarried mothers is low compared with the  other

countries. But I am not saying that we must bring it  up.

That  is what the Member for Sembawang wants to interpret

it,  and he talked about twisting. I do not know  who  is

twisting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that the Member for Sembawang was

positive when he said that this new Bill would lower  the

moral  standards and all the pontifications and so on.  I

do  not know how the Member for Sembawang could make that

statement.   Has  he  got  any  facts  and   figures   to

substantiate  it?  I  have said  earlier  that  the  same

arguments were put forward five years ago when the  first

Abortion  Bill  was  being  debated  in  this  Chamber  - arguments that abortion would cause moral decline and  so

on and so forth. But five years after, i.e, today, has it

resulted in any moral decline?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir has brought up the argument

whether the foetus is a human life or not. He is entitled

to  his  belief.  As I have said, learned  men  have  for

centuries  debated  this point. We  know  that  it  is  a

biological fact that the foetus remains to be  born,  but

under  24  weeks is it human or is it not human?  Learned

men  are  still  debating it. Of course, the  Member  for

Potong  Pasir is entitled to his view, and so  are  other

people who may not agree with him. I accept abortion as a

fact  of life, otherwise we cannot go on from there.  The

Member  for  Potong Pasir can keep on arguing  until  the

cows  come home. This is where the matter lies. The  only

thing we can do is to agree to disagree.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point of the Member for Potong Pasir is the

figures. I think I have answered it partly when answering

the  points raised by the Member for Sembawang. I presume

the Member for Potong Pasir referred to the figures which

I  have distributed. Was he referring to increased repeat

abortions or was it abortions on unmarried mothers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Both.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> As far as unmarried mothers are

concerned,  it is good to know that unmarried mothers  go

to  the  Government hospitals for their abortions  rather

than  go surreptitiously to the illegal abortionists  and

risk  septicity. But that only proves the point. It  does

not  prove that there has been an increase in promiscuity

or  permissiveness or a decline in morals. As Members may

know,  most  of  the  cases of septic  abortions  involve

unmarried mothers. Let us face the facts of life. Let  us

not,  quoting the Member for Punggol, be an  ostrich.  As

far  as  repeat abortions are concerned, they could  have

gone to an illegal abortionist. On the record there is  a

low  rate  of  repeat abortions. But as I said,  even  if

repeat  abortions go up a little bit more,  it  does  not

mean  that  there  has been an increase  in  promiscuity,

permissiveness and so on and so forth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Member for Potong Pasir said about

education on sexual abstinence

and so on, or some study of that nature.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Whatever his proposal is, it speaks for itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to the Abortion Act, the passage of the

Voluntary  Sterilization Act through Parliament  in  1969

was  a  smooth  one. It came into effect on  20th  March,

1970. The Act is now in its fifth year of operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Abortion Act it was given a limited lease of

life, for the same reasons that the House should have  an

opportunity  to review the operation of the  Act  and  to

determine how it has served its objectives and its impact

on our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the Abortion Act, however, it was soon evident

that the safeguards written in to protect persons from  a

hasty  decision to be sterilized which they might  regret

later,  were  found  to be excessive. These  checks  were

found to operate against the objectives of the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, Parliament approved amendments lifting

some  of  the more restrictive provisions in the  Act  on

23rd  March,  1972.  These amendments were  brought  into

effect  on  12th May, 1972. The effect of  lifting  these

restrictions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>



became  immediately evident. The immediate result  was  a

noticeable increase in the flow of persons who  came  for

sterilization.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statistics given in the form of tables are in the

Addendum* (*Appendix II, cols, 1155-8) to my speech

which I have distributed  earlier. It  is  evident from

the yearly figures that they clearly

fall  into  two  parts. The early part  is  comprised  of

figures before the amendments were brought into effect on

12th  May, 1972. The second phase is after the amendments

Act had come into effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of sterilizations has increased

tremendously,  particularly  in  the  last   two   years.

However, male sterilization is still relatively unpopular

compared with female sterilizations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 4,787 applications for sterilization on

women  were  approved of which only about  three-quarters

were carried out. It would be noted that in the first  or

restrictive phase the numbers approved and performed were

less  than 70 per cent of total applications. After  some

of  the restrictions had been removed by amendments,  the

numbers  approved and performed went up to about  75  per

cent.  The fact that there are still sizable numbers  who

have  been approved for sterilization but do not  undergo

the  operation  probably  reflects  the  effects  of  the

residual restrictions imposed by the existing law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figures on the number of sterilizations undertaken for

therapeutic reasons are also given. It is interesting  to

note  that  the  proportion of female  sterilization  on

therapeutic indications increased from 66.8 per  cent  of

total  female sterilization in 1970 but jumped  to  90.1

per  cent  in  1973. This indicates that  women  will  be

prepared to be sterilized if it is more easily obtainable

such as on therapeutic grounds, rather than having to  go

through the Eugenics Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The age of sterilizations for those sterilized on socio-economic grounds has been decreasing since 1970. In 1970, 35 per cent of those sterilized were on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>



females  aged under 30. In 1971, the figure increased  to

38  per  cent; in 1972 40 per cent and 1973 49 per  cent.

The median and mean age show similar trends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sterilizations on therapeutic indications were carried

out  on  older  females,  as  expected,  since  the  main

therapeutic  indication  is  too  many  pregnancies.  The

hazards of pregnancies increase as birth order increases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only 22 per cent of females sterilized on socio-economic applications had two or less children in 1970.

But  the figure increased to 35 per cent in 1971, 48  per

cent  in  1972 and 81 per cent in 1973. The  increase  in

1972 and particularly in 1973 reflected the effect of the

amendment to the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In total nearly 11 per cent of all women aged 15 to 44

years  have  been voluntarily sterilized. The demographic

impact  of  sterilization on such a large  proportion  of

women  in the fertile ages is of particular significance.

It would of course be difficult to assess what would have

been  the  re-productive behaviour  of  these  sterilized

group of persons if they had not been sterilized. Such an

exercise    is   often   conjectural   and   speculative.

Nevertheless  there are mathematical  methods,  no  doubt

presumptive,  which  can be applied in  such  cases.  For

purposes  of  comparison of demographic  impacts  of  the

various  direct  components of a fertility reproductivity

programme  a method has been used to compute the  births

averted by contraception. Using such methodology  it  has

been  estimated  that  the number of  births  averted  by

sterilization in females was as follows: -



<pre>

            Births Averted by Sterilizations

                 in Government Hospitals



                     1970    1971    1972    1973

Percentage of all

averted births        5.2     8.2    13.2    18.3

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For comparison, using the same methods of estimation,

the number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>



births averted by abortions and contraceptions is as

follows:-

               Births Averted by National

                Family Planning Abortions



               No.           %           No.           %

1970         15,648         54.6        1,733         6.1

1971         15,798         54.6        1,972         6.6

1972         16,046         52.3        1,912         6.2

1973         17,441         49.6        2,167         6.2

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that irreversible contraception is now an

accepted  method  of  family  planning.  It  is  also  an

important  method. Its role in preventing births  is,  if

the  trends continue, going to be a more significant  and

an  increasing one. This is as it should be. It rids  the

parents once and for all, the inconvenience of having  to

use contraceptives, and freeing them permanently from the

tyranny of unwanted pregnancies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have come some way along the path on family planning

and  the  control  of  population.  We  have  passed  two

important milestones. The first was when we adopted, as a

national programme, measures for family planning when the

Act  on Family Planning was passed by Parliament in 1965.

The  next  milestone was when the laws on  abortions  and

voluntary sterilization were liberalised in 1970. At  the

time  when we passed these historic pieces of legislation

there  was  expressed concern whether  we  were  not  too

advanced  of  our  times. Sometimes as  a  Government  we

should  be  in advance of the times. If we  think  it  is

right  and  have  thought  through  these  problems   and

carefully weighed the pros and cons, we should  give  the

lead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As events turned out we need not have been too

concerned. We were not too far ahead of our people.  They

have  accepted  family planning and  taken  to  voluntary

sterilizations  in a way quite beyond our  fondest  hopes

and  expectations.  We  had offered  the  full  range  of

methods  of  contraception, from the  reversible  to  the

irreversible  which  is  sterilization.  We   knew   that

sterilization would be the preferable procedure where the

person had completed her family. A person was freed  from

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>



inconvenience  of adopting the inconvenient  measures  of

contraception. Sterilization was the method advocated  by

the  family  planners  and by doctors  as  the  best  and

preferred measure in such cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it turned out these advantages spoke for themselves

and  a  large segment of our married women have now  been

voluntarily sterilised. In fact, a sample survey  of  our

married  women has shown that more than 42  per  cent  of

them  know  about sterilization and will accept  it  when

they  have completed their families. This being the case,

we  have a duty to make this form of contraception freely

available to those who have given sober thought  to  this

as  a means of family planning and who have considered it

as the method which they will adopt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, from our experience we know that many of them

would  not  be  prepared to do so if there are  too  many

restrictions on their applications. We know for  instance

that the need to apply to a Board or panel of persons  is

repugnant  as  it interposes a third party  in  a  matter

which  is  essentially  of a very  private  and  personal

nature.  The  delays which have been  imposed,  that  is,

seven  days under the existing Act together with all  the

waiting  time  in  processing  the  applications   before

sterilizations  can  be done, are  also  unacceptable  to

many.  In  fact, a sizable number, approximately  25  per

cent, did not undergo sterilizations after the Board  had

approved them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sterilization under the Bill, as is proposed in the

case  of  abortions, will be entirely  a  private  matter

between  the  person applying for it and  the  registered

medical  practitioner. It will be undertaken entirely  on

the  volition  of the person wanting it. A valid  consent

will  be  given by the person if he is an adult. It  will

not  require  the  further consent of the  spouse  as  is

provided in the existing law. Consent is only required in

the  case  of  the  person  who  is  below  the  age   of

discretion, that is, under 21 years of age and if  he  or

she is unmarried.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, the procedures are accordingly

simplified  considerably by removing all the  unnecessary

strictures. These are: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Abolition of the Eugenics Board which, in the

existing    law,   authorises   all   applications    for

sterilizations. Decision for sterilization  will  now  be

made  between  the  patient and  the  registered  medical

practitioner;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Removing the restrictions requiring the persons to

have  at least two children before sterilization  can  be

done; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Not requiring consent of the spouse for

sterilization. However, consent of a parent  or  guardian

will  be required by those persons who are unmarried  and

are under 21 years of age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two authorities which exercise disciplinary

control over Police Officers. They are the Public Service

Commission and the Commissioner of Police. The  Singapore

Constitution (Amendment) Act, 1970, empowers  the  Public

Service Commission to exercise disciplinary control  over

Senior  Officers down to and including those of the  rank

of  Inspector. In practice, the Public Service Commission

has  delegated  the  power of disciplinary  control  over

Inspectors  to  the  Commissioner of  Police.  Under  the

Police Force Act



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>



(Chapter  78) the Commissioner of Police is  vested  with

disciplinary powers over all Junior Officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disciplinary proceedings against Inspectors and Junior

Officers are dealt with by the Police Disciplinary Boards

formed  under  the Police Force Act and its  Regulations.

These Police Disciplinary Boards are made up entirely  of

Police  Officers  and  this enables the  Commissioner  of

Police  to  deal  with  ordinary breaches  of  discipline

expeditiously.  However, for some cases  of  breaches  of

discipline such as those involving allegations of corrupt

practices  it  is  important that the Disciplinary  Board

formed  to  deal with them is not only in fact impartial,

but also seen in the eyes of the public to be so. Thus to

deal  with  such  cases  the Police  Disciplinary  Boards

consisting entirely of Police Officers are not  the  best

arrangement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore proposed that the Police Force Act be

amended  to  enable the Commissioner  of  Police,  if  he

thinks  fit, to refer any disciplinary case involving  an

Inspector  or  a  Junior Officer to  the  Public  Service

Commission   to   be  dealt  with  in   accordance   with

disciplinary  regulations  for  public  officers.  It  is

further  proposed  that  this amendment  be  effected  by

adding a section 28A to the Police Force Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 28 of the Police Force Act empowers the

President  to  dismiss or retire an  Inspector.  This  is

inconsistent   with  the  provisions  in  the   Singapore

Constitution (Amendment) Act, 1970, and with the terms of

delegation of powers by the Public Service Commission  to

the  Commissioner.  Therefore, it is necessary  to  amend

section  28  of  the  Police Force  Act  to  empower  the

Commissioner of Police to dismiss, retire, reduce in rank

or mete out other punishment to an Inspector who is found

guilty of an offence specified in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>



section 27 (1) of the Act. Any Inspector who is aggrieved

by  the  decision of the Commissioner may  apply  to  the

Public Service Commission to have the decision reviewed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the projects at Pulau Tembakul, Buran Darat and

Pulau Seletar involving the reclamations of 18 acres,  59

acres  and 70 acres respectively, of the fore-shores  and

seabeds   at   these   islands   are   for   recreational

development. Fill for the reclamations at Pulau  Tembakul

and  Buran Darat will be obtained from Sisters' Shoal and

that  for  Pulau Seletar from the Alang Perimbi  Reef  in

Johore Straits. The reclamations estimated to cost  about

$3.5  million for Pulau Tembakul, about $11  million  for

Buran Darat and about $13.5 million for Pulau Seletar are

expected to be completed in two years' time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reclamation at Ponggol, involving about 10 acres of

the foreshore and estimated to cost about $4 million,  is

complementary  to  the reclamation of the  foreshore  off

Coney  Island  which was approved by this  House  at  its

sitting  in  March  this  year.  On  completion  of   the

reclamations,  it  is  proposed  to  construct  a  bridge

linking   Coney  Island  with  Ponggol.  Fill  for   this

<br><br>6.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move the motion* standing in my name, as it appears under item 9 on the Order Paper.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Parliament, pursuant to section 7 of the

Civil  List  and Pension  Act (Chapter 52), resolves that

the  Schedule  to the said  Act be varied by deleting the

figures  "$667,020", "$145,060"  and "$14,050"  appearing

in  the  second column  thereof and substituting therefor

the   figures   "$686,720",  "$220,344"   and   "$14,773"

respectively'.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provision approved under Class II of the Civil

List is insufficient to meet increasing expenses such  as

the 1974 National Wages Council wage supplement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>



and   the   higher   rate  of  Central   Provident   Fund

contribution. The increase under Class III is mainly  for

the  purchase  of  household requisites for  "The  Lodge"

which is the proposed official residence of the President

and  for  increased costs of maintenance of  grounds  and

public utility services. Under Class IV, a small increase

in  provision  is required to meet the  cost  of  a  deep

freezer and the increased cost of a swing-fog machine  to

be  used  in  outdoor  vector-control work,  particularly

against mosquitoes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, necessary to augment the provision

for  "Salaries  of  Personal  Staff"  from  $667,020   to

$686,720; the provision for "Expenses of Household"  from

$145,060  to  $220,344;  and the provision  for  "Special

Services" from $14,050 to $14,773.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 7 of the

Civil  List  and Pension Act (Chapter 52), resolves  that

the  Schedule  to the said Act be varied by deleting  the

figures "$667,020", "$145,060" and "$14,050" appearing in

the  second column thereof and substituting therefor  the

figures     "$686,720",    "$220,344"    and    "$14,773"

respectively.
