<div align="center"><b>FISHING IN INDIAN AND INDONESIAN WATERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Foreign

Affairs,  in  view  of  the  frequent  arrests   of

Singapore  fishermen by the Indian  and  Indonesian

authorities  for  fishing in Indian  or  Indonesian

territorial  waters, if his Ministry will  approach

the  Governments of India and Indonesia with a view

to   seeking   an  arrangement  whereby   Singapore

fishermen  may be permitted to fish in  Indian  and

Indonesian territorial waters on payment by them of

a tax or royalty.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I think it is

necessary   for  the  Member  to  appreciate   that

national  territorial  waters  are  very  jealously

guarded by the nations that claim these waters.  In

fact,  there  will  be  a number  of  international

conferences held under the auspices of  the  United

Nations  and developing countries of the  world  to

resolve  law  of  the sea matters  arising  out  of

territorial  water claims. Therefore, the  proposal

by the Member is not likely to be acceptable to the

nations   concerned,  since  the   basic   problems

underlying  fishing rights have yet to be  resolved

in the context of the law of the sea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member's suggestion that my

Ministry   might  negotiate  with  the  governments

concerned  to  allow Singapore fishermen  to  enter

their  territorial waters to fish, I wish to inform

the  Member  that this has already been tried.  The

Ministry of National Development went even  further

and  proposed payment of royalties to a  number  of

countries   where  our  fishermen   are   allegedly

intruding  into their territorial waters  to  fish.

The response to such approaches, I am sorry to say,

has  not  been  favourable because of  defence  and

security  requirements.  There  are  also  problems

relating to piracy and the control of nationals  of

these  countries  fishing in their own  territorial

waters.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Government has failed to obtain an

agreement  for licensing of Singapore fishermen  in

such territorial waters, it might be perhaps better

that the applications by individuals to do so would

be  given  more  favourable  consideration,  and  I

propose that the Member could take up this proposal

with the fishermen concerned.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE BUS SERVICE LIMITED</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Examination of books and transactions)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  if  he  will  appoint  a  competent

officer  of his Ministry to thoroughly examine  the

books and transactions of the Singapore Bus Service

(Private)  Limited  before he authorises  bus  fare

increases; if he had caused such an examination  to

be  made  before  authorising  the  last  bus  fare

increases  on 10th February, 1974; and  if  he  was

satisfied  without  any doubts that  the  operating

losses of the company as reported were unavoidable,

true and correct.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as explained in press

statements  issued by my Ministry on 3rd  and  20th

February,  and  in replies given by  me  to  recent

Questions  in  this  House, the bus  fare  revision

effective from 10th February was allowed after  two

reports were submitted in August and November  last

year   by   professional   management   consultants

commissioned  by Singapore Bus Service  Ltd.  These

were  closely studied and examined by officials  of

the Ministry of Communications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reports of the management consultants were

based on the certified and audited accounts of  the

three  constituent  bus companies,  which  comprise

SBS.  Checking  and examination of books  of  these

three  companies were done by the auditors  of  the

three bus companies concerned. These certified  and

audited  accounts  for the year ended  31st  March,

1973,   were   later  submitted  to   my   Ministry

separately.   However,  one  of   the   three   bus

companies' accounts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



had  the  following  serious qualification  by  its

auditors, which goes as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We report that we did not obtain all the

information and explanations we required because of:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) an absence of adequate internal controls;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) an absence of external documentary

evidence to support certain payments; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) a failure to properly maintain accounting

and other records.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In assessing the reports submitted by the

management consultants, my officers had access only

to  these  certified and audited accounts  for  the

year  ended 3 March, 1973, as well as to other data

obtained  from  the three bus companies  and  other

sources.  In  addition,  my  officers  also  worked

independently  of  the reports  of  the  management

consultants on projected revenue and expenditure of

Singapore  Bus  Service Ltd, based  on  their  own

source  material. This was used as  an  independent

counter-check against the results of the management

consultants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these studies took several months and

involved very detailed work. Actual examination  of

the books of the three former bus companies was not

undertaken  by  my  officers  for  two  reasons  - firstly, there is no competent accounting staff  in the  Ministry  of Communications and, secondly,  it

would only have duplicated the work of the auditors

of  these  companies. But the  bus  companies  had,

naturally, to convince me that a fare revision  was

necessary  and  also as to when the revision  would

have  to be effected, as well as how much it should

he, before approval for the revision was given.  On

the basis of:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the audited accounts of ABC, ABS and UBC for

year ended 31st March, 1973;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the submission of the case for a bus fare

revision,  on  behalf  of SBS by  its  professional

management  consultants,  SGV-Goh  (Pte)  Ltd, in

August and November, 1973; and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the counter-checking of figures and

projections made by my officials in the Ministry of

Communications,



<br><br>I was satisfied that the projected operating losses

of  SBS,  on  the  old fare structure,  would  have

brought  it to a state of insolvency by the  middle

of  this year. Inaction would have brought about an

even  worse  situation than the Singapore  Traction

Company because when STC, with a paid-up capital of

over  $14  million,  folded up  bus  operations  in

December, 1971, it had then an accumulated loss  of

$9  million.  The  bus  fare  revision,  which  was

authorised on 10th February, 1974, and for which  I

assume  full responsibility, was necessary for  SBS

to be viable. It is all the more necessary if it is

expected  to improve on its services over the  next

three years, as required by my Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in an earlier answer to the Member for

Kallang  on  14th March, should the need  arise,  I

will  not  hesitate  to exercise  my  powers  under

section  9A of the Bus Services Licensing Authority

(Amendment) Act, 1973 (No. 27 of 1973)  to  appoint

an  Inspector to inspect the affairs of  SBS.  And,

should  it he in the public interest to  do  so,  I

would also cause the report of the Inspector to  be

published.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  am very satisfied with the answer,  and  I

would    like    to   thank   the   Minister    for

Communications.

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Law  and  National  Development (a)  how  many  bus

termini  have  been constructed; and  what  is  the

area,  cost and rental of each terminus; (b) if  he

is  aware  that oil drippings from badly maintained

bus  engines are causing damage to the termini; and

who  undertakes and bears the cost of repairing the

damage; and (c) if he will take action to stop  the

misuse  of valuable public property, utilities  and

services.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, eight bus termini

have   been   constructed  by  the   Public   Works

out  for  a total rent of $6,600 per month. Details

are as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the above, the Housing and

Development  Board has constructed two bus  termini

at  a  total cost of $1,408,000 and let out  for  a

total rent of $18,600 per month:

              ======       ==========    =======

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the bus parking areas are constructed

with concrete which is not so badly affected by oil

drippings  as  compared  to  areas  constructed  of

bitumen.  Any  damage  is  repaired  as  and   when

necessary  by the Roads Branch of the  PWD  or  the HDB.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oil drippings from buses are inevitable unless a

very  high standard of maintenance of the buses  is

exercised by the bus owners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PWD and HDB do take action against any misuse

of  the  bus termini. At one time action was  taken

against  unauthorised hawkers who were  related  to

bus  drivers and were brought in to hawk at the bus

termini.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

could not the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



give  these  figures in metric, as the  Government

policy today is metrication?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I could have really. But if I were to

repeat all these figures in metric, it will take up

much  more time. As it is, I have already taken  up

about   five   minutes  reading   out   all   these

particulars in square yards and dollars. Perhaps if

the Member were to ask the Minister for Science and

Technology questions of this nature, he  would  get

his answers in square metres.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING BOARD FLAT TENANTS AND OWNERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Ownership of private property)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Law and

National  Development  whether  a  person,  who  is

already  a  tenant  or  owner  of  a  Housing   and

Development Board flat, may own property.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a tenant of a

Housing  Board flat who buys private property  will

have  his  Tenancy  Agreement  terminated  and   be

evicted by the Housing and Development Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An owner of a Housing Board flat is not at the

moment prohibited from purchasing private property.

This is because when the Home Ownership Scheme  was

first  started,  very  few people  desired  to  buy

Housing  Board  flats  and  the  Board  wanted   to

encourage our citizens to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the situation has now completely

changed.  With  the  introduction  of  the  Central

Provident  Fund  Financing Scheme,  more  and  more

contributors  to the Fund have taken  advantage  of

the Scheme and registered to purchase HDB flats. As

a  consequence,  there  are now  more  than  80,000

applicants   registered  to  purchase   flats.   In

addition, of course, there are others who  want  to

rent fiats, and most of them will have to wait  for

some  time  before being allotted a  flat.  It  is,

therefore,  considered unfair to allow any  Housing

Board flat owner to retain his flat if he purchases

private property. By "private property,"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



of course, I mean private landed property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is, therefore, now considering

introducing  legislation to provide  that  any  HDB

flat  owner  who purchases private landed  property

must  resell  his  flat to the  Board,  subject  to

perhaps  certain exceptions, e.g, those owners  who

inherit property jointly with other beneficiaries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

according  to the Minister's reply, the HDB  tenant

would  have  no  alternative but  to  give  up  his

tenancy.  However, under extenuating circumstances,

would  the  Minister  exercise  a  little  bit   of

flexibility?  There  is the  case  of  a  shophouse

tenant  who  was  affected by  urban  renewal.  The

Housing  and Development Board offered him  only  a

residential  flat  and  so  he  could  not  do  his

business. So he had to buy a shop-house in order to

run   his   business,  upon  which   his   family's

livelihood depends.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, every case will, of

course,  be treated on its merits. But in the  case

cited  by  the  Member for Bras  Basah,  perhaps  I

should  ask him a question. Why did his constituent

not rent a shophouse, instead of buying it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, I think you are more than

aware  that today it is not so easy to rent a flat.

That is why I think this poor fellow was forced  to

purchase the shophouse, not because he did not want

to rent one.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> With your permission, Sir, can I ask

another  question? Is it not easier and cheaper  to

rent,  surely, than to buy especially  if,  as  the

Member said, he is a "poor fellow"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, in the long-term I think it

is cheaper to buy than to rent.

to  what  extent have such specified  schemes  been

implemented; (c) how much interest has accrued  out

of  the  moneys  collected  for  the  Institute  of

Medical  Specialities, and  to  what  use  has  the

the  implementation  of the  Institute  of  Medical

Specialities project been carried through, and what

is the intention of his Ministry with regard to the

future of this project.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in answer to part (a)

of the Question, as at 28th February 1974, a sum of

$3,548,359  stood  to  the credit  of  the  Medical

Progress Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) about 48 per cent or $1,321,757 of the total

sum  of  $2,736,308  donated was  to  be  used  for

specified purposes. A one-storey building  for  the

Radiotherapy Department was completed in the Outram

Road  General  Hospital in 1968. The  cost  of  the

project  was $908,168. This comprised $620,690  for

construction  works and $305,478 for equipment  and

furniture.  The equipment for the establishment  of

this  speciality  included the  installation  of  a

cobalt bomb unit. Half of the project cost, or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



$454,084,  was  met from the Medical Progress  Fund

and  the other half by the Government in accordance

with the Government's pledge of a dollar-for-dollar

contribution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) interest accrued, from August 1965 to

February  1974,  on  the moneys collected  for  the

Medical  Progress Fund amounted to $1,410,188.  The

interest  has  been put in fixed deposits  for  the

purpose of generating further interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) as originally conceived in 1965, the

Institute of Medical Specialities was to have  been

built as a completely separate building within  the

compound of the Outram Road General Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this concept has been superseded by

events  relating  to  the  development  of  medical

specialisation in Singapore. In December,  1969,  I

appointed a Committee to investigate the extent  of

development   of   medical  specialities   and   to

recommend a programme of development or creation of

a  number  of  selected specialities  in  order  of

priority,  to  achieve  eminence  as  a  centre  of

medical treatment, training and research.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report of the Committee of Medical

Specialisation was received in October,  1970.  The

Government  in  accepting the report  also  decided

that the recommended specialities of Neuro-Surgery,

Cardio-thoracic Surgery, Plastic and Reconstructive

Surgery, Paediatric Surgery and Nephrology,  should

be developed within an integrated plan of expansion

of the Medical Services in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This expansion plan included the building of new

hospitals.  The most significant of  this  hospital

building  programme  is the re-development  of  the

Outram Road General Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has now decided that all the major

specialities   which  have  been  recommended   for

development will ultimately be housed  in  the  new

hospital  to  be  built at Outram  Road.  This  new

hospital,  which  will be known  as  the  Singapore

General   Hospital,  will  be  Singapore's  premier

hospital and specialist centre.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July, 1973, the International Development and

Construction  Corporation (INDECO) was commissioned

to  build the new hospital at Outram Road on behalf

of Government. The planning, preliminary site works

and architectural designing of the new hospital are

proceeding according to time-table. It is  expected

to  be  put to tender for the construction  of  the

first two phases of the hospital before the end  of

the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the original donations for specified

schemes towards the development of the Institute of

Medical  Specialities have now  been  overtaken  by

these new developments as well as become inadequate

as a result of rising costs, the Government has now

decided  to  ask  the  donors  to  agree  to  their

donations  being  used towards the  development  of

this new premier hospital and specialist centre  at

Outram Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the design plans for the new buildings of

the   hospital   are  sufficiently   advanced   for

visualisation of elevations, with models as well as

more  precise estimates of costs have  been  worked

out,  the donors of the Medical Progress Fund  will

be  invited to a public meeting when the  plans  of

this new development will be put to them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, when this new hospital is

ready,  I  would like to know by how much will  the

Minister  increase the medical fees, which  at  one

time were free.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, firstly, that

supplementary  does not arise out of the  Question.

Secondly, the first two phases of this new hospital

will be completed sometime at the end of 1977. So I

do  not  think  I am in a position  to  answer  the

Member  for Bras Basah on an event that will  occur

in 1977.

Finance  if  the  Singapore Bus  Service  (Private)

Limited is given exemption or concession in respect

of payment of any duty or tax; and what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



is  the rationale of continuing this policy when it

has failed to serve the public interest.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the Singapore l3us Service  Ltd  was

given  a  waiver of the transfer fees on the  buses

which were re-registered following the amalgamation

of the three Chinese bus companies. This waiver was

also  previously  given to the  three  Chinese  bus

companies  when  they took over the  buses  of  the

former   bus  companies,  including  the  Singapore

Traction Company. The waiver was given because  the

amalgamation  of  the  bus  companies   was   being

encouraged   by  Government  for  the  purpose   of

reorganising  and  improving the  public  transport

system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the urgent need to increase the number

of  buses on the roads, exemption from import  duty

was given to the Singapore Bus Service Ltd recently

for  the  purchase  of 19 assembled  units  of  bus

chassis.   However,  no  waiver  or  reduction   of

additional registration fee has been given  to  any

of the bus companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the various bus companies have already been

amalgamated  into  the Singapore Bus  Service  Ltd.

there  should  he  no  further  occasion  for   re-registration of buses and hence for the  payment  o

transfer  fees. Nor should there be  any  need  for

future  imports of fully assembled  buses  by  this

company.  Completely knocked down or CKD  packs  do

not attract import duty.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, repair and

maintenance  bills  are  given  tax  allowance.  As

repair bills can be $1 and upwards, like any  other

professional  bill, is it possible  that  excessive

repair and maintenance bills cause leakages in  the

SBS finances?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member for Kallang please

repeat his supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> Sir, I was saying that repair

and  maintenance bills are given tax allowance.  My

question is this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



Is it possible for excessive repair and maintenance

bills  to cause leakages in the SBS finances,  when

it  comes  to  taxation? Badly maintained  vehicles

require  frequent repairs, and if  SBS  send  their

buses  to disreputable firms for repairs, they  are

prone  to over-charging. Would that cause less  tax

to be collected?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not aware

that excessive hills were paid. If the Member would

please  give me particulars of this information,  I

would  get my tax people to look into whether there

is  an excessive deduction from income and tax  for

maintenance  bills.  I  assume  that   they   would

themselves prefer to keep their profits as high  as

possible and keep the maintenance bills as  low  as

possible.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does the

Minister for Finance not think that it is the  duty

of  the  Income Tax Department to look  into  these

matters whether or not there is information?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not go on

particulars that he knows of, I will look into it.

<div align="center"><b>JOINT INDUSTRIAL TRAINING SCHEMES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  what  sort of joint training schemes  were

conducted through joint industrial training centres

in 1973; what further activities are being planned;

how responsibility for those schemes is distributed

between  the Government and the private sector;  if

there  is any intention to modify the basis of  co-operation;  and in what ways his Ministry  supports

other forms of industrial training.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1973, two

Government-industry   joint   industrial   training

centres were in operation, one in co-operation with

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



Rollei  Company of Germany and the other with  Tata

Industries of India. The two training centres  have

a  capacity  for training 200 skilled workers  each

year  in  the  following  key  skills  required  in

manufacturing:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Precision machining

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Tool and die making

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Precision mechanics

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Precision optics.



<br><br>After two years of intensive full-time training  at

the  centres,  workers are required to  undergo  an

additional two years of approved in-plant  training

in   industrial  establishments  selected  by   the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two joint training schemes have proved to be

effective.  The  Government is  now  exploring  the

possibility of establishing similar joint  training

centres  with other industrial companies  including

those in the shipbuilding and repair industries and

the  machine tool and machinery industries to  meet

the  expected  growth of demand for highly  skilled

workers by companies in these industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Joint Industrial Training Centres established

so  far  are  being administered  by  the  Economic

Development Board acting as the Government's agency

to  supervise and direct their training programmes.

Day-to-day   operations  of   these   centres   are

delegated  to  a  management  committee  comprising

three members from Government and two members  from

the    participating   private   sector    company.

Government's  responsibility is  in  providing  the

capital  for  the establishment of  these  centres,

supply  of  local  instructors  and  selection   of

trainees, in addition to its participation  in  the

management  committees to assist in the running  of

the  centres. The private companies contribute  the

industrial  training know-how  and  the  supply  of

foreign   instructors  from  industries   and   top

technical  schools abroad. They  also  provide  in-plant  training  in their operations  in  Singapore after in-centre training has been completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no immediate necessity to modify the

concept  of the joint Government-industry  training

schemes although



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>



the basis of co-operation in each scheme may be

varied from time to time on a case-by-case basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government also supports the following

industrial training schemes:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Overseas Training Scheme under which

selected  Singaporeans are sent abroad to train  in

the  industrial training facilities of  established

companies  in  Germany,  Switzerland,  Sweden   and

Japan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Industrial Training Subsidy Scheme under

which  companies  with demonstrated  capability  to

undertake  in-plant training may be  assisted  with

grants  ranging from $3,000 to $9,000  per  trainee

for  a wide range of modern industrial skills.  The

value of the grant to be given is determined by the

type and period of training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Industrial Development Scholarship Scheme

under   which   skilled  workers   may   be   given

scholarships  for  training locally  or  abroad  to

become foremen and supervisors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That the sum to be allocated for Head HE be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 1107.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr P. Govindaswamy is not here. Mr

N. Govindasamy, amendment No. (2).



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head HE be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 3004*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng Yeow Chong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have moved this amendment in order to seek

clarification  and  also to get information.  Under

the  Development Estimates, $310,000 is to  be  set

aside for new post offices. My query is, where  are

these  post  offices  to be  located?  To  be  more

specific, is there provision for a new poet  office

in  Telok  Blangah  New  Town?  The  Telok  Blangah

constituency  has no post office at all.  With  the

completion of the first phase of the Telok  Blangah

New  Town project, hundreds of families have  moved

in,  and 500 new housing units will be balloted  on

4th  April  this year. Phases 2, 3 and 4  are  also

expected  to  be  ready in a year or  two.  It  is,

therefore,  important that a  new  post  office  be

provided for Telok Blangah New Town.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  merely  wish to ask the Minister some  questions

concerning the provision of $310,000 for  new  post

offices  to be established during the new financial

year.  My  questions are: first, is there provision

for  a  new post office at the Old Kallang  Airport

Estate   in  my  constituency?  Second,  have   the

officials   of   the  Ministry  of   Communications

successfully  negotiated  with  the   Housing   and

Development  Board  for a suitable  site  for  this

purpose? If so, where is the site? Third, what type

of post office will it be? Will it be a delivery or

a non-delivery post office? Fourth, will there also

be  facilities  for  a  Post Office  Savings  Bank?

Fifth, when will this new post office be ready  for

operations?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will probably notice that every public

housing  estate  is now provided with  a  new  post

office. It is for this reason that my constituents



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



have  made  representation to me  for  a  new  post

office  to  be  set  up in my constituency.  I  am,

therefore,  taking this opportunity to  raise  this

matter  here, and I earnestly hope for a favourable

reply from the Minister concerned.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr Ang Kok Peng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the fiscal year 1974-75, there will be 13 postal development

projects,  two of which are actually  carried  over

from last year's allocation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following are the places where the post

offices  will  be located. There  will  be  a  post

office in each of the following places: Old Kallang

Airport Estate, Toa Payoh North, Brickworks Estate,

Marine   Parade,   Telok  Blangah,   Tiong   Bahru,

Balestier  Road,  Redhill Estate, Plaza  Singapura,

Shenton Way, Jurong Town and Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The post office at Telok Blangah will be a

delivery  type  but  the post  office  at  the  Old

Kallang Airport Estate will be a non-delivery type.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the question from the Member for

Mountbatten  as to where a suitable  site  for  his

post  office is going to be, he will be pleased  to

know  that  it will be at the Kallang Emporium  and

Hawker Centre. It will also have facilities  for  a

Post  Office Savings Bank. He will also be  pleased

to  know  that  it would be ready sometime  in  the

middle of 1974, that is, this year.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, my constituents and I are

indeed  grateful to the Minister of State for  this

information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to make a further request.

I  wonder whether the Minister of State could  look

into  the feasibility of setting up a delivery post

office  instead of a non-delivery one as  proposed.

In  my  view, a delivery post office set up  in  my

constituency  will better serve the  needs  of  the

residents in the Old Kallang Airport and Guillemard

estates,  as well as the Kallang industrial  estate

at Kallang Park and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



the neighbouring area. Moreover, this delivery post

office   will  help  to  reduce  considerably   the

pressure  of work at the Geylang Post Office  where

its capacity has been overstretched.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister of State would take that

into consideration.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ang Kok Peng:</b> Sir, the Geylang Post Office is

in a position to continue to serve the residents of

the Old Kallang Airport estate and its neighbouring

areas.  But in future if the need warrants it,  the

situation will be reviewed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

every  Member is asking for a post office.  Perhaps

the  Minister  of State has read in the  newspapers

about  the  inadequacy of the post  office  in  the

River  Valley  Constituency. For  a  business  area

almost  in  the centre of town, there is  only  one

small  post  office in Killiney Road, plus  another

opposite the Marco Polo Hotel which is under  urban

renewal. There have been numerous requests  in  the

newspapers   suggesting  that  a   bigger   or   an

alternative  post office be provided.  But  so  far

nothing has been done and I have been patient. I am

just  wondering  whether, in this provision  for  a

number of post offices, serious consideration could

be  given for the setting up of another post office

in the River Valley Constituency.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ang Kok Peng:</b> Sir, the request by the Member

for  River Valley will be looked into. Since he  is

now  the  Chairman  of the new Urban  Redevelopment

Authority,  we  should be able to  look  into  this

problem with much ease.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, before other Members

stand up and ask for post offices, let me say  that

I  am satisfied with the post office that is to  be

built in Telok Blangah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one problem which has been bothering

me  and  if  you  remember, Sir, I also  raised  it

yesterday. It is in connection with the Post Office

Savings



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



Bank located in the post offices. Yesterday I asked

about   the  need  for  subsidising  the  POSB   by

providing  certain sums of money from public  funds

for the payment of incentives to induce children to

save. Post offices are also providing space for the

POSB.  Would the Minister of State enlighten me  as

to  whether  the  POSB do pay rental  to  the  post

office?  Or is the POSB being indirectly subsidised

from public funds by way of rental subsidy?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ang Kok Peng:</b> Sir, the post office does not

subsidise  the  POSB.  They will  be  paying  their

share,  and  they  will also be  paying  their  own

counter staff.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, with that explanation, I

beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $27,820,350 for Head HE ordered to

stand part of the Main Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $635,000 for Head HE ordered to stand

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



Head HF --



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head HF be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 1109*.



(*The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Teong Eng Siong, J. F. Conceicao, Chin Harn

Tong, Sia Khoon Seong, P. Govindaswamy and Ivan

Baptist.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment today, it is not at all

my  intention  to  flog the dead buses,  especially

after  the  banner headlines that the Minister  for

Communications  got in today's  newspapers  of  his

pledge  on  the buses. However, Sir, you are  aware

that  this  issue was debated under the  Minister's

subhead which should really have been on the policy

of the Communications Ministry. The guillotine time

this  year  has  been  very, very  sharp,  and  the

Minister did not really have sufficient time to say

all  that he wanted to say about the buses. He said

yesterday, if I remember correctly, that  he  would

have  something more to inform the House in respect

of public transport in Singapore, when this subject

comes  up  for debate under the Head,  Registry  of

Vehicles.  This  amendment of mine,  therefore,  is

moved in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



order to provide the Minister with the opportunity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, under this amendment, since the Minister for

Communications is not here, I would like to ask the

Minster of State two questions. The first is on the

question of smoky exhausts of taxis and, second, on

taxi stands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have received many complaints from taxi

drivers   who  complain  that  they  arc  receiving

summonses  from the Registry of Vehicles about  the

smoky  exhausts  of their taxis  and  the  fine  is

usually  about S50. It is a heavy burden  on  them.

They  have  a  very limited monthly  income.  After

paying the instalments and fuel costs, whatever  is

left is very limited, about $200 to S300. They have

to  support their families with this meagre  income

and  it  is not easy to do so. As a result  of  the

endless  summonses  they  receive  and  the   fines

imposed  on  them,  they are in a  very  distressed

position. Because of this, I realise that many taxi

operators  have  resorted  to  getting  loans  from

moneylenders  at high interest. They  are  indebted

and they deserve our sympathy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxi drivers have also complained to me that they

have  frequently  been  summoned  to  the  ROV  for

inspection  of their taxis by ROV officers  to  see

whether the engines are in order and whether  there

is  any emission of smoke from the exhausts.  These

taxi  drivers told me that they have to send  their

taxis to the ROV and it takes about one day for the

inspection  to  he carried out. In this  way,  they

lose one day's income. I do not understand why  the

inspectors  at  the  ROV resort  to  this  sort  of

surprise inspections. According to the regulations,

all  taxis  have to he inspected every  six  months

before  they  are allowed to ply on the  roads.  If

there  is any fault with the engine, it has  to  be

repaired before approval is given for it to ply  on

the  roads.  Since  taxis are inspected  every  six

months, I do not see any reason why



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



taxi drivers should be asked to send their taxis to

the  ROV  for another inspection. This only results

in the taxi drivers losing a day's income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is with regard to the setting up

of  more taxi stands. Because of the drawing up  of

the  special bus lanes, the taxi stands along  many

roads  have  been  abolished.  For  example,  along

Robinson Road, Bras Basah Road, and Beach Road, the

taxi  stands have been removed and the taxi drivers

are  experiencing difficulty in getting a place  to

park  their  taxis. I would like  the  Minister  to

consider  whether it is possible to allow taxis  to

make use of the bus lanes to allow them to drop  or

pick up passengers. Since taxis are also a kind  of

public transport and they also provide an important

service   to  the  people,  I  think  it  is   only

reasonable that they should be allowed to  use  the

bus  lanes for the passengers to alight or  to  get

in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point concerns the setting up of a taxi

stand at the cable car terminal at Jardine Steps. I

have  received  a complaint from the  Taxi  Drivers

Association  that it has applied to the  Car  Parks

Division  of  the Ministry of National  Development

for permission to park taxis there. The application

was  recommended  by  the Association  hut  it  was

refused  by the Port of Singapore Authority because

the  area comes under the jurisdiction of the  PSA.

Since  the  PSA  is  also  under  the  Ministry  of

Communications, I would like the Minister of  State

to  take note of this complaint by the Taxi Drivers

Association and to direct the PSA to reconsider the

application for parking facilities at the cable car

terminal.  Many people go to the cable car  complex

and many taxis are plying at the terminal. If we do

not  provide  taxi drivers with taxi  stands,  they

will  not  be able to park their taxis.  They  will

have to park along the roadside, which will lead to

traffic congestion. For this, they will he ticketed

by the Traffic Police, causing an additional burden

on  them.  So I would urge the Minister to consider

their case in a sympathetic manner.

<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it

is with regret that I rise to voice my criticism of

the  Registry  of  Vehicles.  Having  been  closely

associated   with   the  ROV,  I   understand   and

appreciate the difficult working conditions of  its

officials and their inability to change or regulate

such  working  conditions.  But,  nonetheless   the

shortcomings of the ROV are too painfully  obvious.

It is my hope that the powers-that-be who are in  a

position   to   change  or  regulate  the   working

conditions in the ROV would take note of  not  only

the  shortcomings but also the underlying cause  of

such shortcomings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, for example, many things which, in my

view,  the ROV can do or refrain from doing  so  as

not  to  make life unduly difficult for all persons

seeking to earn a livelihood as taxi drivers.  Take

the  matter, for example, of the badges  which  all

taxi drivers must carry on their person to identify

themselves  as  licensed  taxi  drivers.  They  are

required to pin their badges on their shirt-fronts.

As  I see it, the badges are worn for two purposes:

one  is  to assist enforcement against unauthorised

persons  driving  taxis; the  other  is  to  enable

passengers  to  identify taxi  drivers  who  offend

them.  None of the two purposes seems to have  been

achieved. A taxi driver's badge does not in  itself

indicate a particular person is so entitled to wear

it.  The  ROV enforcement officer has to check  the

identity  card of the person wearing  it  with  the

record  kept  in the office to confirm whether  the

wearer  is  so  authorised to drive  a  taxi.  With

several  thousand taxis on Singapore roads  at  any

one  time of the day and with more than 15,000 taxi

drivers on record, enforcement by the ROV has  been

practically reduced to the ritual of enforcing  the

wearing of badges of taxi drivers. Similarly,  with

the  taxi  drivers wearing badges on  their  shirt-fronts, it is difficult for passengers in the back-seat   of   taxis   to  read  the   badge   number,

particularly so at night. Experience has shown that

complaining taxi passengers invariably identify the

taxis rather than the taxi drivers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



Instead of requiring taxi drivers to wear badges, I

would suggest that every taxi driver be issued with

an  identification card, similar to but larger than

the  laminated plastic identity card,  bearing  the

photograph,  name and identity card number  of  the

driver.  This identification card should be slotted

into  a  suitable  holder near the taxi-meter,  and

illuminated at night so that the identification  of

taxi  drivers  for  any  purpose  should  offer  no

problem.  The  introduction of such  identification

card would do away with the ridiculous necessity of

charging taxi drivers with the technical offence of

not  wearing  their badges. It would  also  prevent

unscrupulous taxi-owners from hiring their vehicles

at higher rates to unlicensed persons who manage to

get hold of badges to wear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is too often easily forgotten by those persons

responsible for enforcing law and order  that  they

themselves  can  also  be  responsible  for  public

disrespect  towards  law and order.  Disrespect  is

created  when  the  manner of enforcement  makes  a

mockery  of  law and order. Take, for example,  the

prosecution of taxi drivers for smoky exhaust.  Any

failure  to  maintain  engines  resulting  in   the

unnecessary pollution of the atmosphere should,  by

all  means, be severely prosecuted. There has  been

an  increasing tendency, however, for summonses for

smoky  exhaust  to be indiscriminately  issued.  It

seems  that if a police officer on duty spots  what

seems to be a smoky exhaust, he issues a ticket  to

the driver of the offending taxi, requiring him  to

take the vehicle straightaway to the ROV depot  for

compulsory test for smoky exhaust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the ROV Department is one of the busiest

offices in Singapore and the ROV officials, I  must

state,  are  generally hard pressed for  time.  All

taxi  drivers  dread the prospect of  having  their

vehicles tested at the ROV depot for smoky exhaust.

It  means they have to be off the road for  several

hours,  it  means their earnings for that  day  are

drastically reduced. And if they have  to  hire  or

pay  instalment on their taxis, it  adds  to  their

burden. What makes it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



worse  is  that more often than not the  officially

conducted  test conclusively proves the  degree  of

smoke is under the acceptable level. The result  of

the  tests  is not surprising when it is considered

that  every  taxi  has  to  undergo  a  half-yearly

inspection  by  the ROV. But the protests  of  taxi

drivers  that their taxis have undergone the  half-yearly  inspection the day before or not  too  long

ago are ignored by the summoning police officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A disturbing thought is that all police officers

must  have clear instructions to disregard the fact

of  half-yearly  inspection when issuing  summonses

for  smoky  exhaust. The ugly implication  is  that

someone  in  authority has serious  doubts  on  the

integrity,  honesty  or  competence  of   the   ROV

officials  in relation to the conduct of  thorough,

proper  half-yearly  inspection  and  requires  the

police  force  to  serve as  a  balance  and  check

against the ROV. Whether I am right or wrong in  my

explanation  of the policy governing the  issue  of

summonses  for smoky exhaust, I hope the  ROV  will

cause to eliminate or minimise the element of human

error in the issue of summonses for smoky exhaust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is common knowledge that human witnesses to

the same event or incident are unlikely to agree in

every  detail  on  what they have  seen.  A  police

officer,  who  is acquainted with the principle  of

diesel  engines, would know that all diesel engines

give  out  smoke when starting or accelerating  and

would   know  what  constitutes  an  unduly   smoky

exhaust.  Another police officer may  construe  the

slightest  sign  of smoke as constituting  a  smoky

exhaust. I would, therefore, suggest that  the  ROV

conduct for all police officers a practical  course

of instruction on how to judge a smoky exhaust with

naked eyes. As it is, prosecution for smoky exhaust

is becoming more and more like persecution. In some

cases, taxi drivers are asked straightaway to pay a

compound fee for smoky exhaust without a test being

conducted for that purpose.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always the danger of the routine nature

of   official   duties  making   public   officials

indifferent to the effect of any exercise of  their

powers.  Such danger is illustrated by the reaction

of  the  ROV  officials to the handing in  of  lost

property   by  taxi  drivers.  They  ask  harassing

questions  of  taxi drivers such as, "Why  did  you

allow  passengers to leave their belongings  behind

in  your taxi?" "Why did you not unwrap the  parcel

to  check  whether the contents are valuable?"  The

impression created is that the ROV does not wish to

encourage  taxi  drivers to return  lost  property,

presumably  because  of  the  additional  work   it

entails   for  the  ROV  staff.  It  also  probably

explains why summonses are issued to call  in  taxi

drivers  for  routine clarification in  respect  of

lost  property previously handed in. The effect  on

taxi  drivers  on  being served with  summonses  is

demoralising.  Their first thought  is  that  their

exhaust is smoking too much and they have to  spend

hard-earned   cash   on   unnecessary   repair   or

adjustment  before keeping their  appointment  with

the  ROV. The question is why do the ROV officials,

who  by  now must be aware of the unpleasant effect

of  summonses  on  taxi drivers,  continue  to  use

summonses for this purpose? If they must do so, why

cannot  they clearly spell out the purpose  of  the

Summonses?  I would hate to conclude that  the  ROV

officials   are   showing   a   could-not-care-less

attitude  towards taxi drivers.  But  it  helps  to

explain  why  some  taxi  drivers  hand  over  lost

property  to  newspaper  offices  where  they   can

expect, as least, appreciation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the ROV officials, in common with other

public   officials,  have  good  cause  for   their

apparent  impatience with and suspicion of  members

of  the public whom they come into contact with  in

the  course  of  their duty. It  explains  why  the

officials seem reluctant to consult members of  the

public  before  making decisions greatly  affecting

the  public. Take the matter, for example,  of  the

adjustment to the taxi-meters following the  recent

decision  to  revise the taxi-fare  for  the  first

mile. The ROV



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



officials were satisfied with consulting  only  six

taxi-meter   repairers.   In   return   for   their

undertaking to adjust the meters of 5,000 taxis  in

Singapore  in  two weeks, the ROV agreed  that  any

adjustment of taxi-meter must be carried out within

the  specified  period of two weeks  and  that  the

recommended   rate   be  $40  per   meter.   Strong

objections were raised by taxi drivers to both  the

limited  period for adjustment and the  recommended

rate. Once the ROV was convinced that the period is

too   short,  and  the  restriction  to  only   six

specified  workshops  is unreasonable,  the  market

rate  for adjustment of taxi-meters drops  down  to

less  than one-third of the recommended rate. After

all,  adjusting a taxi-meter does not require  more

than 15 minutes. The ROV officials would never have

allowed  themselves to be misled by  the  workshop-owners  if  they had bothered to consult the  other

interested   parties,   that   is,   the    various

organisations representing taxi drivers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Chin, your ten minutes

are up. Mr Sia.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, traffic

congestion  is  a  daily problem  during  the  peak

hours.  It  has  been  the  order  of  the  day  in

Singapore these days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the recent introduction of bus lanes buses

are   supposed  to  speed  up  the  travel  of  bus

commuters.  Has it helped in any way,  or  has  the

congestion in the other lanes prevented buses  from

leaving  the  bus  lanes? If it  has  improved  the

traffic   flow,  has  the  ROV  any  intention   of

introducing  more  bus lanes along  all  major  bus

routes?  One setback against this new bus  lane  is

that  when the traffic lights change to green, cars

which  are  turning left have to give  way  to  the

buses that are passing through the bus lanes.  This

results in a stretch of other vehicles coming to  a

standstill, until the car in front has  moved  off.

Furthermore, cyclists find it risky to ride between

the  buses and the other vehicles. What action  has

been taken to remedy the situation?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> I am not

speaking, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, I rise to

support  the  Member for Aljunied, particularly  on

the  point he has made concerning the delay on  the

part  of  the ROV in checking smoky exhausts.  This

applies not only to taxis, but lorries as well.  In

the  case  of lorries there is also the problem  of

checking  on overloading. Once a lorry is suspected

of overloading, it is ordered to go straight in for

checking.  In  a particular case, I was  told  that

this poor person pleaded with the staff of the  ROV

to  speed up the checking so that he could  go  and

deliver  the  goods to the port, for loading  on  a

ship  which  was due to sail that very  night.  But

this request was even not granted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think this is an area where it would seem

to me that there is a complete lack of sympathy and

sensitivity  for  people involved.  The  lorry  was

detained. That was fair enough. They even  went  to

the  extent of withholding the driver's licence.  I

cannot  see  what  it  has got  to  do  with  lorry

drivers,  because the lorry owner  is  a  different

person  altogether. The driver is paid on a  daily-rated basis. Once you detain his licence, he cannot

work.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  refer  to  the  statement made by  the  Minister

yesterday  that  he  would give an  assurance  that

every possible measure would be taken to ensure the

SBS  would provide an efficient bus service for the

commuters in Singapore. In this connection I  would

like to ask the Minister a few questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has stated that a sum of

approximately $1.2 million was awarded by  the  SBS

to  a  local workshop to repair the 400 buses  that

were  rendered unserviceable. May I know  from  the

Minister  who  are the owners of this workshop?  Is

the   workshop  competent  enough  to  handle  this

gigantic  task? In other words, does this  workshop

have the necessary equipment and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



skilled  personnel to perform the necessary repairs

to  ensure that the buses are put on the road  with

the minimum of delay?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is: will possible abuses lead

to  kick-backs for directors of the SBS, in so  far

as  they  have  a  financial stake in  this  repair

workshop or in any company that builds bus chassis,

or  in  any spare-parts supply shops, or  fuel  oil

supply distributors?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  raised a question here yesterday concerning  the

setting  up of the motor insurance bureau,  but  it

was  not answered. Perhaps it was due to the heated

debate  on the bus services. May I raise  it  again

and  ask the Minister when will the motor insurance

bureau become a reality? I am very concerned  about

this  matter because I read in the newspaper  today

that  another victim has just been awarded  by  the

High  Court  a  sum  of approximately  $110,000  as

compensation. I just wonder whether he  can  really

get this money.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ang Kok Peng:</b> Sir, I will first respond to the

invitation  from  the Member for Telok  Blangah  to

answer  questions raised under Head HA which should

more  appropriately be tackled  under  the  present

Head.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah suggested that a

referendum  be  held  on whether  the  bus  service

should  be handled by Government or be left in  the

hands  of  a  private organisation. We are  not  in

Britain  and  we  are not thinking of  joining  the

Common Market. Therefore we are not contemplating a

referendum of that nature. I do not think that  the

matter of the bus services warrants a referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were various comments on the poor

management  of  the  SBS.  The  SBS  is   currently

engaging   some  consultants  to   assist   it   in

modernising    its   management,   including    the

computerisation   of   the   various   aspects   of

management,  the  scheduling  and  maintenance   of

buses, inventory control for spare-parts, and other

matters. It is also in the process of appointing  a

Personnel Manager to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>



look after the Personnel Section, and also a Public

Relations  Officer to work more  closely  with  the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a suggestion from the Member for

Moulmein  that Government should develop  expertise

in  the running of the bus transport services.  You

will   remember,   Sir,  that  the   Minister   for

Communications  has previously announced  that  the

BSRC,   i.e, the   Bus  Services   Reorganisation

Committee, and the BSLA, the Bus Services Licensing

Authority, are keeping a close supervision  on  bus

operations, and in doing so they are acquiring  the

necessary expertise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have suggested better working

conditions   for  the  bus  workers.  SILO,   which

represents  the bus workers, is constantly  working

to  improve  the  working  conditions  of  the  bus

workers.  I would like to assure hon. Members  that

the Ministry is always in sympathy with any measure

taken  to  improve  the working conditions  of  bus

workers.  Steps  are also being  taken  to  install

canteen  and  toilet facilities at  all  major  bus

termini.  Furthermore, with the  implementation  by

the  SBS  and SILO of an incentive scheme effective

from  January,  1974, whereby $� million  would  be

paid  every quarter to courteous and effective  bus

crew    members,   there   should   therefore    be

considerable improvement in the morale and  in  the

performance of the bus workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah suggested the use of

automatic    transmission   and   power   steering.

Introduction  of automatic transmission  and  power

steering has been considered, but it was found  too

expensive for introduction at this stage.  However,

he  will be pleased to know that power steering  is

now part of the standard equipment of the new buses

that are being introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah also suggested that

some  relief or soft loans to SBS be considered  to

enable SBS to purchase new buses. The need has  not

arisen  as  SBS  has  no  problem  in  getting  the

necessary finance for the purchase of new buses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a suggestion that notice boards

displaying bus routes be put up at bus termini  and

at  bus  stops.  This  matter is  actually  in  the

process   of   being  implemented  at   the   major

terminals,  and  at  a later  stage  will  also  be

implemented at major bus stops. At the  moment  the

buses   do  carry  route  numbers  and  destination

points.  I  can assure Members that other  measures

will  be introduced for the greater convenience  of

commuters in due course of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong asked whether it was fair

to  use  taxpayers' money to provide bus lanes  for

buses  only. I presume that the Member is  assuming

that  bus commuters are not taxpayers as well.  The

purpose  of the reserved bus lanes is to provide  a

smooth  flow  of  bus traffic in order  that  large

groups  of  people  can travel  speedily  from  one

destination to another in the course of their daily

activity  during peak hours. This is vital  to  the

economy of our country. It is, therefore, a  proper

use  of public money to reserve bus lanes for buses

during  peak hours, and besides the bus  lanes  are

only operative during a few hours each day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the suggestion that the punishment of

confiscation  of vehicles on the third  offence  is

too  severe,  I  would like  to  say  that  it  was

considered a necessary deterrent in order to ensure

that  bus  lanes are free for smooth  flow  of  bus

traffic during peak hours. Otherwise the purpose of

bus lanes would be defeated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong also raised the question of

a  minimum fare of 10 cents instead of 20 cents.  I

would  like to refer him to two previous statements

released  by  the  Ministry on  the  3rd  and  20th

February, 1974, where adequate reasons were  given.

And   only  a  few  days  ago,  the  Minister   for

Communications also touched on this  point  in  his

reply  to  an  Oral Question. I need not  elaborate

here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Sembawang and Jurong also

suggested the use of 14-seater mini-buses. I am not

quite sure whether they mean just the participation

of these buses in the supplementary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>



transport  service which we have at the moment,  or

they  are thinking of an entirely new supplementary

transport system involving 14-seater mini-buses. At

the moment we do have a few small buses taking part

in  the  supplementary transport  system,  and  the

possibility  of  using a different  system  of  14-seater  mini-buses for passengers commuting  within

five  miles of the City centre will be referred  to

the BSRC for their consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied mentioned that there was

only one qualified engineer and a few assistants to

service a fleet of 2,000 buses. This is only partly

true. The SBS has one qualified engineer but a very

large number of technical assistants to help in the

maintenance of a fleet of 2,000 buses. Furthermore,

SBS  also contracts out work to motor workshops for

repairs  and'  other services. At  the  moment,  37

trainees are undertaking a special training  scheme

organised by SBS in conjunction with the Industrial

Training Board, the ROV and SILO, and they are on a

three-month attachment to Progress Motors and Cycle

and Carriage, which are the main suppliers of buses

to SBS.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir asked whether monthly

tickets  could be obtained at other places  besides

Changi. The Member will be pleased to know that SBS

is  getting  some expert advice on a programme  for

wider distribution of such season tickets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru asked when the motor

insurance  bureau  would be  set  up.  The  present

position is that discussions on the setting up of a

motor insurance bureau have been going on for quite

some  time  between the Insurance Commissioner  and

the  insurance industry, and they are now  reaching

the final stages of their discussions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may come back to some of the questions

raised  just  now. Regarding the fines  imposed  on

taxis  with smoky exhausts, I would like to  inform

Members of the House that the fines are imposed  by

the  Traffic  Police. As taxis are  public  service

vehicles,  it  is  necessary  to  ensure  that  the

vehicles are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



properly  maintained  and  kept  in  good   working

condition. For this reason, half-yearly inspections

for  any mechanical deficiency or body defects  are

being made. These measures are taken to ensure that

the  vehicles are in a roadworthy condition. On the

question of surprise inspections of smoky exhausts,

this  is  done  to  make  sure  that  vehicles  are

maintained in good condition at all times, and  not

just   for   the  sake  of  having  them   checked.

Therefore, it is necessary that inspections on  the

spot   should  be  made  besides  this  half-yearly

inspection.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Aljunied has any definite case

of   intimidation  or  undue  harassment  of   taxi

drivers,  I  would  be pleased  to  look  into  the

matter. However, I can assure him that the officers

are only doing their duty, not for any other reason

but  to  ensure  that these vehicles  do  not  emit

excessive smoke from their exhausts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a suggestion by him that taxis

should  be allowed to use bus lanes either to  drop

or  to  pick up passengers. This request cannot  be

granted because it would defeat the very purpose of

creating  bus  lanes  which  is  to  expedite   the

movement of buses during the peak hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also said that taxi stops along certain bus

routes have been removed to make way for bus lanes.

In  actual  fact,  taxis are  shy  of  the  Central

Business   District  during  peak  hours   because,

finding the traffic a little heavy there they would

not  be  able to make as many trips as  they  would

have  liked.  Concerning the  taxi  stands  at  the

terminal  for  cable cars, we will look  into  this

matter. If there is space or if there is a need for

it, then there might be a possibility of putting up

a taxi stand there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied has suggested that the

ROV  issues  identification cards with  photographs

and  names of taxi drivers. I think this is a  good

suggestion and we will look into it. And if he  can

also provide me with definite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>



cases  where the ROV discourages taxi drivers  from

returning  lost property or creates undue hindrance

to  their  wish to have lost property  returned,  I

will personally look into the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the taxi-meter adjustment, originally

six   workshops  were  included  in  the  list   of

workshops  where  taxi-meters can  be  adjusted  in

connection with the revised taxi fares. Members may

wish  to  know  that these six workshops  were  the

workshops  that the taxi drivers had patronised  in

the past in the previous meter adjustment exercise.

Therefore, they were automatically included in  the

list.  The  introduction  of  a  schedule  for  the

adjustment of meters was necessary in order to have

an  orderly  process  for the inspection  of  these

adjusted   meters.  Later,  more   workshops   were

included in the list because the six workshops were

charging  $40  per meter adjustment, and  the  taxi

drivers  thought that was too high. The reason  for

charging $40 was that the workload was such that it

was  necessary  to employ skilled workers  to  work

over-time   in   order   to  make   the   necessary

adjustments within the scheduled time. However, the

schedule  has been relaxed and more workshops  have

been  included  in the list and, I  am  sure,  this

problem has resolved itself satisfactorily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu has raised the question

of   delay  in  the  examination  of  vehicles  for

exhausts and for overloading. If we do not have  as

many  vehicles emitting black smoke as we have now,

the  workload  would have been  less  and  speedier

examination could be carried out. But if  there  is

any   case  where  undue  delay  has  come  to  his

attention,  I  would be much obliged  if  he  would

refer the case to me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the vehicles turning left,

which  was  raised  by the Member  for  Anson,  the

Member's problem is the difficulty of cars  turning

left  when  there  is a bus lane on  the  left-hand

side. He will notice that all the bus lanes end  at

a  certain distance from a road junction  or  where

there  is a slip-turn. Therefore, a little  bit  of

care  need  to  be exercised before  he  makes  the

necessary turn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I happened to be in the House when the Member for Toa Payoh raised his

questions,  perhaps I can now take  over  from  my

Minister of State and answer the two points raised

by him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the name of the private motor repairer

responsible for repairing 400 buses of the SBS  is

the  Singapore Automotive Engineers,  which  is  a

subsidiary of MINDEF. At the time when they signed

the  contract, they were not aware  that  the  400

buses  would be in such a bad state that it  would

take a very long time to repair them. So up to the

moment  I  believe they have been able  to  repair

only  50 buses, although they had hoped to be able

to  repair the 400 buses by April of this year.  I

think,  in a previous Oral Answer, I had indicated

that  it might take a bit longer for the 400 buses

of the SBS to be repaired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second question about various

connections  of repairers with the SBS  directors,

etc.,  I  am  afraid, Sir, he  is  anticipating  a

question  which the Member for Kallang has  tabled

for answer on Monday. Instead of repeating answers

to  Members, perhaps he could be a little bit more

patient.  It will be on Monday, the 25th,  only  a

few  days from now, when I will answer the  Member

for Kallang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I promised hon. Members, who were present

in this House last night, that I would be making a

policy  statement  today,  with  a  new  angle  on

reorganisation of Road Transport,  other  than  on

buses,  on  which  subject many have  agreed  that

there  is  already an overdose, with hon.  Members

repeating  tediously what had  been  said  earlier

-almost like flogging a dead horse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before proceeding, however, with my new subject,

may   I  be  permitted  to  place  on  record   my

appreciation  for the patience, understanding  and

maturity  of our long-suffering bus commuters  and

that I pledge to put our public bus service right,

soonest possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Singapore Bus Service Ltd (SBS) buses

operated  on Sunday, 10th February, 1974,  without

any incident



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



whatsoever,  the day the revised  bus  fares  came

into  operation,  Singapore  stood  proud  by  its

people,  especially the hundreds of  thousands  of

bus  commuters in having to pay more when the  bus

services   as  operated  by  SBS  fell  short   of

expectations,  especially  during  peak   periods,

without  resorting to riots or  burning  of  buses

which  irate commuters elsewhere do when fares  go

up,  be  it  in Hong Kong, or cities in  India  or

Pakistan. Ours are a law-abiding people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we became independent in 1965 (nine years

ago), we as a people have been constantly learning

the hard lesson that nobody owes us a living, that

nothing  is for free, as being without any natural

resources  but  human resources we  have  to  work

hard,  to earn our keep and pay for everything  we

need, even necessities for life, like food, water,

clothing, transport, etc. Water is for free.  When

the  rain  comes, you could open  your  mouth  and

drink  it.  But  you still have to pay  for  water

because  it has got to be processed, and  millions

of dollars have to be spent on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bus commuters are in the best position to know

how  the rising cost of living over the past  year

has  eroded into their daily or monthly income and

are,  therefore, able to understand and sympathise

with  the plight of 9,000 workers of SBS who  have

to  perform a hard and onerous job and hard-put to

provide   for   their   families,   under   trying

conditions. It was, therefore, my first concern to

ensure  that  SBS must improve on  the  terms  and

conditions of its workers even before SBS  started

operations  on  1st  November,  1973.  I  can  now

disclose  that SBS was not prepared  to  make  any

wage  increase  in  November, 1973,  because  that

would  immediately put its operations in the  red.

But  I  advised and prevailed on SBS to  make  the

gesture  of  a wage increase, so that its  workers

can  see that they are benefiting materially  with

the  formation of SBS. We must first raise  morale

before  we  can enforce discipline  and  call  for

better performance from workers. That was how  the

60 cents



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



per  day increase came into effect on 1st November,

1973,  besides  an incentive scheme costing  SBS  a

further  sum of $1 million per annum to be operated

by SILO, on behalf of the workers.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the $25 per month additional wage

supplement   recommended  by  the  National   Wages

Council,  which was made applicable to SBS  workers

as  from the 1st of February (last month), and I am

pleased  to  hear from none other than the  General

Secretary  of SILO, a valuable member  of  the  Bus

Services  Reorganisation Committee  and  Member  of

Parliament  for  Boon  Teck,  who  confirmed  at  a

television  feature one week ago and  yesterday  in

Parliament  that  SBS workers, on the  whole,  have

been  given  a  very good deal  in  that  with  the

formation of SBS, each worker got no less than  $40

per  month extra, all within a short space of  four

months,   which  is  not  what  other  workers   in

Singapore can hope to expect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the BSRC will monitor and supervise the

operations of SBS, it is my confident hope that the

public  bus  service will be seen to  improve  with

time,  as we tackle other aspects of Road Transport

reorganisation, in earnest. New hornets' nests will

be  stirred!  In  what direction will  this  arise?

Increasing restraints on the use of 137,000 private

cars  during peak hours and that is what I wish  to

dwell upon at some length, now. And Members will be

speaking on their own behalf after this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an earlier Oral Answer in this House, I had

indicated  that any attempt to improve  our  public

bus  service  cannot  be  successful,  if  made  in

isolation, and we must at the same time tackle  the

problem  of  increasing  traffic  congestion.   The

formation  of  the Road Transport Action  Committee

(RTAC)  in  November last is the weapon  to  ensure

high  priority  for the public bus service  on  our

limited  road  space and to launch a  multi-pronged

attack on traffic congestion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the problem we have to overcome? To

resolve  our  traffic problem let  us  identify  it

first,  which we have. I can do no better  than  to

provide  this House with a diagram of the peak-hour

travel pattern (typical of a week-day) which exists

in  Singapore today. I shall now hand over  to  the

Clerk  of  Parliament copies of  the  diagram* for distribution to Members.

(* See Appendix, cols. 525-6.)<br>



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1974/19740320/19740320-HA-0330525.pdf"">Total Transport Trips by time of day (Cols. 525-526)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Copies handed in to the Clerk and distributed to Members.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diagram in Members' hands was produced by our

Mass  Transit Study Unit and forms part of the many

diagrams  attached to the draft Final Report  (June

1973) of the Singapore Mass Transit Study, Phase I,

which I had occasion to refer to yesterday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the saying goes, "A picture speaks more than a

thousand words". Most cities of the world have only

two  peak-hour travel periods (morning peak from  7

to  9  a.m, and the evening peak from 5 to 7 p.m.).

We  in Singapore have three peak periods, i.e, the

addition  of  a  midday peak because  most  of  our

primary schools operate on two sessions-morning and

afternoon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This diagram of Total Transport Trips by time of

day  made up of work trips, school trips and  other

trips  was  drawn  up  after  the  State  and  City

Planning   Department  carried  out  a  survey   to

determine household trip-making characteristics  of

12,500  households over a period of six  months  in

1968.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traffic jams and frustrations we face in

Singapore  today are essentially those  encountered

during  peak-hour travel. Unless changed, which  we

have  decided  will be done and the sooner  the  to

determine household trip-making more congestion  on

our limited road space. The business and industrial

activities  on  which we depend for our  livelihood

would  then be forced to a slower and slower  pace,

ultimately coming to a grinding halt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The costs of travel will also increase if trips

made  during  peak-hour periods  are  not  reduced.

These   costs,   which  we  shall   call   "traffic

congestion costs", cost



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



to   the  individual  such  as  increased  cost  of

operation   and  increased  stress  and   emotional

tension,  and  social  costs  like  air  pollution,

accidents,  noise  and  the  undesirable  aesthetic

effects   of   congested   streets   and   parking.

Therefore,  to  resolve  our  problem  of   traffic

congestion, we need to attack the problem along two

fronts: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to spread (and thus reduce) peak-hour travel

demand, and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to reduce the number of private vehicles on

the roads during peak hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peak-hour travel demand can be reduced if all

trips,  other  than work or school trips  are  made

outside the peak periods. One way of spreading peak-hour  travel  is  by introducing staggered  working

hours.  From  January  this  year,  Government  and

Statutory Boards have introduced staggered  working

hours  for their staff, if only for a trial  period

of  six months. This has resulted in the following:-



<pre>

 Working Hours:

 0800 to 1630 hours  ... 44%

 0830 to 1700 hours  ... 51%

 0900 to 1730 hours  ...  4%

 0930 to 1800 hours  ...  1%

                         ----

                         100%

                         ====

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the civil servant population constitutes only

about  10  per cent of the total working population

of  Singapore,  it  is necessary that  the  private

sector should also adopt staggered working hours to

have any significant effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of car pools will not only save

fuel   but   will   also  greatly  reduce   traffic

congestion.  This was stressed by me,  Sir,  at  an

earlier  Oral  Answer. The insurance  industry  has

assured  vehicle owners participating in car  pools

that   the   insurance  policies   would   not   be

invalidated under the present terms of these  motor

insurance policies. It is now up to vehicle  owners

to   take  up  this  offer  to  help  ease  traffic

congestion during peak periods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another measure which employers in the private

sector  can help is to arrange for group transport,

like Scheme A of the Supplementary Public Transport



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



Service  (SPTS),  or Adult Workers  Contract  (AWC)

vehicles, whether of buses or lorries. Yet  another

alternative would be for the employers to  own  and

operate these vehicles themselves, i.e, to form  an

employers' supplementary public transport service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measures have been and will continue to be taken

to   provide   an  adequate  public  bus   service,

supplemented  where necessary with  other  feasible

forms  of public or group transport. However,  a  a

public  transport system cannot operate efficiently

if  it  is not protected from the congestion caused

by  private  cars in central areas, on high-density

routes  and  in peak-hour traffic. If  the  traffic

congestion cannot be eased through voluntary means,

such  as staggered work-hours and the formation  of

car  pools, then physical constraints will have  to

be  introduced  to obtain a mandatory  change.  The

introduction of reserved bus lanes is one  step  in

this direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In plain language, the priority of movement of

motor vehicles in our limited road space will be as

follows: -



<pre>

                                            Public

                                           Vehicles



(1) Public Buses (SBS)                       2,000

(2) Supplementary Public Transport

       - during Peak Hours only:

    Scheme B (PT) licences -

        School Buses 600*   }

        Lorries      400    }              1,000

    Scheme A - (Adult Workers  Contract)   1,000*

(3) School buses (*include

        Scheme B & AWC) (say)              2,000*

(4) Taxis                                  5,000

                                          ------

                                          10,000

                                          ======



(5)  Private cars - 137,000

</pre>



<br><br>In  other  words,  all  the 10,000  public  service

vehicles responsible for group



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



travel will be given higher priority and precedence

in  the use of limited road space during peak-hours

over 137,000 private cars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has already been announced that a study is

underway   to  consider  a  park-and-ride   scheme,

whereby  commuters could park their cars in  fringe

car parks and take a shuttle bus into or out of the

Central Business District during peak periods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, measures to curb the rise in private

car ownership are also under study.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not alone in this battle against peak-hour

traffic congestion. There is an authoritative paper

on  the  subject submitted to the Organisation  for

Economic   Co-operation  and  Development   (OECD),

Paris,  in  August  1973 entitled "Automobiles  and

Cities  -  Strategies For Developing Countries"  by

the  well-known Transport Consultant in Dr  Wilfred

Owen,   Senior  Fellow  of  Brookings  Institution,

Washington,  DC. With your permission, Mr  Speaker,

Sir, I am making available two stencilled copies of

this  Study to be placed in the Parliament  Library

for  the  information of Members who are interested

to learn more about this wide-ranging subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Copies handed in to the Clerk.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was revealed in page 53 of his Study that such

traffic  management programmes have been  initiated

in  many  American cities. The following data  show

the  extent of various low-cost traffic improvement

programmes   in  296  cities  in  the   U.S, with

population of over 50,000:-



<pre>

                                 Percent   of   Cities

</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before more measures are introduced to bring

about  a mandatory change in our travel pattern,  I

hope  that  employers, trade unions and  owners  of

private vehicles would consider a voluntary  change

and   to   give   serious  thought  to  introducing

staggered work-hours and formation of car pools. In

order  to  encourage staggered work-hours  and  car

pools,   we  are  planning  to  launch  a  National

Campaign  to drive home the need for such voluntary

restraints. A meeting will be called in  July  this

year  (after  the 20 busy streets  in  the  Central

Business  District  have  reserved  bus  lanes   in

operation)  to  drive home the problems  associated

with  peak-hour travel and to actively promote  the

staggering  of work-hours and car-pooling  schemes.

Representatives from Government agencies, transport

operators, organisations in the private sector  and

road  users will be invited. It is hoped this would

help bring about an extensive adoption of staggered

work-hours and formation of car pools in an  effort

to  voluntarily change the pattern of present peak-hour travel and thus help reduce overall congestion

on our roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us make 1974 the year in which we voluntarily

make  an  effort  to change our  travel  pattern  - namely,   to  avoid  peak-hour  travel.  Why   must

everybody  travel  at the same  time?  It  is  most

interesting to watch. All of us are affected.  When

we  have  a traffic jam, we always blame the  other

person,  "Why do you not stay away?" But  we  never

ask  ourselves: Why are we contributing to the  jam

and  to the frustration? It is in the hands of  the

137,000 private car owners to make it possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, who knows, if we succeed in doing what we attempt to achieve - to reduce peak-hour travel - we may be able to reach the happy prospect drawn by Dr Wilfred Owen in his Study - page 64 - of avoiding the heavy cost of spending billions of dollars to build a subway for Singapore. I think my colleague, the Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>



Finance, will be the happiest man in-deed. Dr  Owen

was  analysing the problem of building a subway  in

an oil-rich city of Caracas, Venezuela:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The success of the subway, therefore, will

depend on improved bus transport and on measures to

restrict  automobiles to the  extent  necessary  to

enable the feeder bus system to operate. But if  it

is   politically   feasible   to   introduce   such

restrictions with the subway, an alternative  might

be  to  restrict car use without subway. The  money

saved could be used to provide a system of buses on

exclusive  bus streets, fares could be considerably

lower than for the subway, and automobiles could be

confined  to areas outside the centre and  to  off-peak  hours.  The  cost  of  the  subway  could  be

avoided,  and  the  resources used  to  remedy  the

critical  housing conditions that compel one-fourth

of the population to live in squatter settlements.'



<br><br>Of  course,  Caracas  may  not  have  solved  their

housing  problem. We, in Singapore, have,  but  all

that money could go towards other forms of economic

development and social improvement of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Sir, the

Minister  has been discussing the best  performance

of   SBS.   I   have  harassed  the  Minister   for

Communications regarding this. I am not  sorry.  It

was  my  duty, and it was his duty to reply to  the

questions.  Anyway,  the  dialogue  has  been  very

valuable, and since the Minister for Communications

has given a pledge that he will solve the transport

problem,  I  believe we should all be  patient  and

wait for the outcome of the measures to be taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is this: is it envisaged that private

vehicles will be restricted or barred from entering

the business centre? If so, when is it expected  to

be  enforced?  Anyway,  we all  have  debated  very

thoroughly the transport situation right  now,  and

therefore I believe we should have a moratorium. If

the  situation  does not improve, we will  continue

discussing it next year during Budget time.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I rise to seek some

clarification.  The Minister's statement  just  now

arose  from  an amendment that I have moved.  There

are  two  points, Sir,If it is to be  taken  as  a

Ministerial statement, then perhaps



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



we  will be allowed to ask questions. But if it  is

going  to be treated as part of the debate  on  the

amendment, then we can open up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> You open up!



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> That is right. That was just

an opening for other Members to open up. One of the

questions  that I would like to ask is  the  rabbit

that  he pulled out of his hat just now: is  it  an

indication  as  to whether we are  seriously  going

towards  MRT, or not? The way he said it by quoting

the  oil-rich country, Caracas, Venezuela, that  by

doing  away with their subway they were saving  the

money  for other purposes, are we going to do  away

with MRT as a result of this restriction on private

cars coming into the City during peak hours? And is

he trying to get away from the fact that perhaps we

need  MRT,  if  not  now, in the future?  Will  the

Minister please answer?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> You will recall, Mr Speaker,

Sir, I paid the Minister a compliment yesterday for

his   eloquence.  Today,  after  listening  to  his

statement, I must say that he is also a strategist.

The  restriction of use of private cars during peak

hours is a fairly controversial matter. But then to

introduce  it after a lot of grouses from  the  bus

commuters  would put the private car  owners  in  a

spot  which  makes them very difficult  to  grouse,

because  they  will  not  only  be  taking  on  the

Communications  Minister but the bus  commuters  as

well.  I  would like to go along and see that  this

scheme  works, for the simple reason that  if  this

does not work worse things will come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to say one thing about what the

Minister  said  in the first part of his  statement

concerning his concern for the welfare and the well-being of the bus workers. I would like to take this

opportunity,   because  I   have   never   had   an

opportunity  publicly,  to bear  testimony  to  the

statement  that  he has made. I, together  with  my

colleagues  in  the leadership of  the  former  STC

union and the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



were very much involved in the funeral rites, so to

speak,  of the former STC, and the question of  the

plight of the bus workers in the former STC. I  had

the  opportunity to witness the concern and  plight

these workers were in when they were faced with the

prospect of retrenchment. For the Minister  to  put

pressure  on  the Chinese bus companies  to  ensure

their  continued employment, I think, was something

which nobody could see hut which meant a great deal

to  those  workers and their families. I  know  the

Minister  will  have a hard time dealing  with  the

transport problems in Singapore. He will have brick-bats thrown at him and I would probably join others

in  throwing brick-bats at him on things  that  are

not  right. But my conscience will not be clear  if

praise is due but not given. I wish it to be placed

on  record  that the part he played  is  recognised

particularly  by  the  former  STC  employees   who

secured continued employment. I have no doubt  that

they  will  share  with  me the  sentiments  I  had

expressed.  This is the little comfort I  hope  the

Minister  will have to help him in the  tough  time

ahead of him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, being a

Member  on  the  Government side, it  is  extremely

difficult for me to join Members, the Backbenchers,

in  some of the views they have expressed though  I

would go a small way to agree with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister today has given a wonderful

performance. The problem as I see it, Sir, is not a

problem  of  buses, bus services or  commuters.  We

must  take the problem in a wider context. We  call

it  a traffic problem, but some Members said it  is

the "transportation problem". So it is not buses or

commuters. The problem is that we should  dwell  on

it  at  that level. I think we should delve  deeper

into  the problem, that is, transportation, traffic

pattern,  and  how it affects the society  and  the

economy.  I  think we should look at  the  question

with more depth and see a little bit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>



further beyond the horizon than the rear of the bus

exhaust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not without some reservation that I

stand  up  to  speak.  I agree  entirely  with  the

Minister  on the statistics and examples  which  he

quoted.  His  officers have dealt with this  matter

for  several years now and I was told that some  of

them even have got degrees on Road Engineering  and

Traffic.  Sir, I must confess to the House  that  I

have  not  got  that kind of qualification,  but  I

think  that  does  not  prevent  me  from  speaking

objectively on the problem. Perhaps a layman  might

be  able  to  see the whole situation in  a  better

light.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago, I cannot remember exactly when, I

spoke  briefly in this House about the question  of

the  Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system. Some  Members

think   that  the  MRT  might  solve  our   traffic

problems. Even if the MRT can solve our problem,  I

think it is a long-term project, because even if we

approve it today in this very House, it will take a

minimum of five to eight years for the whole system

to  be completed. By then, as the Minister has said

earlier,   the  pattern  of  development,  concept,

principle, and data on which the MRT is mooted will

be  so much changed. You will remember, Sir, in the

old  Master Plan, the idea of the flyover from  Kim

Seng  Road  to  China  Street  in  town  was  first

conceived  as  early as 1956. That flyover  is  not

there  today  because  the situation  has  entirely

changed.  I  said sometime ago that if we  want  to

introduce  MRT it must at least conform  to  a  few

principles.  I will repeat what I said earlier.  It

must  be fast enough, it must be cheap enough,  and

it  must not interfere with the surface traffic. It

must also not be a source of pollution, whether  it

is noise or air.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would imagine, Sir, quoting the figures I

gathered from the newspaper, that the MRT will cost

anything  between $500 million and $1,000  million.

At  current  prices, I will put it at  around  $750

million, may be even $850 million. Let us take  the

minimum figure and, say, three years from now, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>



implement  this system. This $500 million  includes

the  possible  fluctuation upwards in three  years'

time.  If we put this money in the bank, we get  an

interest of $50 million a year. With this money, we

can subsidise the bus service. We may even have air-conditioned  buses.  So the MRT  is  not  the  only

solution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, we should look at the traffic problem

as  a  whole,  not only the bus problem.  One  must

decide  whether the bus service is going  to  be  a

service or a business proposition. It is typical of

the  Government, Sir, to try to strike a compromise

between the two - a service, and at the same  time,

a  viable business proposition. It is not difficult

to  achieve this if all of us co-operate and I urge

Members  of  this  House that in  their  "Meet-the-People"  sessions, it is better they sound out  the

people,  because  I think that is the  first  salvo

from the Ministry for more stringent measures to be

introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a discussion with some civil servants who

are  very  much  concerned about the transportation

problem.  My sample of their opinions perhaps  gave

me  the  courage  to  speak  this  afternoon.  Sir,

restriction on private cars travelling in the  city

area  may  well  be  the  only  solution.  I  would

imagine, if this scheme is implemented, there would

be some degree of hue and cry [Interruption]. Thank

you  for  that  -  here  is  a  Nanyang  University

graduate  who  is  getting on very  well  with  the

English language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would imagine that some kind of fee might

be imposed on cars travelling into the City centre.

This  might create the impression that if  you  can

pay,  you are free to go in; but if I cannot afford

as  I am a poor man, I am out. I think there is  no

intention  to  favour the rich, or  make  the  rich

richer  and the poor poorer. If it has to be  done,

it  has got to be done. But why do we not, Sir,  in

the  meanwhile,  maybe in the next  month  or  two,

agree  to  the rule that newly registered  cars  be

automatically  restricted from  entering  the  City

area  during peak hours? This will not involve  any

cost  to  the Government. Perhaps the new car  will

have a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



special  alphabet in the number plate, also  at  no

cost  to the Government at all. So if there is  any

favour, we will first favour the old rich, and  the

new rich may have to suffer a little inconvenience.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> On a point

of  order,  Sir,Is  there not  something  in  the

Standing  Orders  saying  that  we  should  take  a

Suspension before 5.00 p.m.?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No, there is no such Standing

Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> I will cut short, Sir, so that

the  hon. Member for Serangoon Gardens may  present

his  views to the House. Sir, the Minister  touched

on  car  parks so that private vehicle  owners  can

park  their  vehicles  in  certain  areas  in   the

periphery of the City.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I remind the Parliamentary

Secretary  that  the  guillotine  time   for   this

particular Head at 5 p.m, will be applied?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> I thought it is 5.30 p.m., Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No. That time includes the recess.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir,I do

not  think I am being fair to the Minister for  not

giving him time to reply. But just let me elaborate

a little on what I am going to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of car parks at the City fringes, I

think, is one of the solutions, but they should not

be  unimaginative, simple and plain. A car park  of

such nature should be a complex so that people  can

make  use of it. Then we can encourage them to  use

it.  So  the question of a shuttle service may  not

even arise.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may  I  comment  on the reply by the  Minister  for

Communications?   I   think  it   is   particularly

interesting  and  important to note  his  statement

that  we are stirring up the hornets' nest. Members

here will agree with me that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



hornets are not always rational. If the Minister is

a hornet, and if we keep on stirring the nest, then

his  reaction might well be irrational. Let me give

two  examples  of irrational action  on  his  part.

Firstly,  by trying to dissuade people from  owning

cars.  It  has  been well justified recently  in  a

statement by the Minister for Finance that the  tax

imposed  on  petrol  was to  dissuade  people  from

owning  cars. Secondly, a 30 per cent  increase  in

tax  on  car  sales.  Now these two  measures  were

introduced  with a view to dissuading  people  from

owning  cars. I am sure the people will use  public

transport  if it is a good system. If we  have  not

come  to  that  stage, let us  not  at  the  moment

proceed with irrational action, such as introducing

those two measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me comment on a few other

things.  I whole-heartedly agree with the  Minister

that there should be voluntary restraint in the use

of   cars  by  cutting  down  unnecessary  driving,

particularly during peak hours which  adds  to  the

congestion. Secondly, I also agree that car pooling

is  something  that  is  desirable  and  should  be

encouraged.  Thirdly, is the  Minister  quite  well

aware  that  the third peak according  to  the  car

congestion chart is due to school children going to

and  leaving  school at about noon  time?  This  is

something which, I think, the Ministry of Education

can  look  into. Students should as far as possible

be  posted to schools within the vicinity of  their

homes,  and  not  from east to west,  or  north  to

south. Otherwise, when they criss-cross, they  will

meet  somewhere and that happens to be the  Central

Business District. I think this is something  which

can  be  fully considered and should be given  good

attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe what the Ministry of Communications can

do right now is to cut down on kerbside loading and

unloading. Anyone travelling in the City  today  at

peak  hours  or during business hours  will  notice

that   other  transport  vehicles  parked  at   the

kerbside  add  to the horrible congestion  that  we

already have.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards staggered hours, I believe the

Ministry  can  take  a  more  active  interest   in

persuading  the private sector to get  this  scheme

going.   Unfortunately  only  the  Government   and

statutory  boards have started this scheme.  Before

we  stir the Minister further, may I seek assurance

from  him that he will not proceed to add new taxes

on new cars, and secondly, that he shall not -



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> That comes under the Minister

for Finance.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> The Minister can re-direct

that suggestion to him later. Secondly, he will not

impose  a ban on cars entering the Central Business

District   until  peripheral  parking  places   are

available and a shuttle service introduced  in  the CBD.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I remind the Minister that

there are about four minutes left.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, Sir, I think

the hornets' nests are already stirred and some are

buzzing around. And probably I may get one  or  two

stings, that is about all. But I will proceed  with

what I intend to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Sir, I am very touched by the

Member  for  Moulmein  when he  spoke  on  the  STC

collapse and the part he and I played in trying  to

resolve  the problem. I will only say  that  I  was

just  doing  my duty to try to reduce hardship  for

the workers with the collapse of the company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole purpose behind today's statement is

that  we  want  to  encourage voluntary  restraint,

because  more  and  more mandatory  restraints  are

coming.  So  if they do not do anything  about  it,

please do not complain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kallang asked when will the

restriction on private car travel be introduced. We

have  already explained that there will be a  park-and-ride scheme. It will be published. It  will  be

discussed,  and  any good recommendations  will  be

incorporated  before implementation. I  think  that

should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



answer  most of the questions raised by the Members

for Moulmein, Kallang and Kim Seng.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Member for Telok Blangah asked

whether  we are going to do away with the  MRT.  We

have  not even come to any decision about the  MRT.

The  report has not been finalised. It has not gone

up to Cabinet yet. So there is no decision yet. But

we have got to remember always that even if we have

the  MRT,  we still need to have a good public  bus

service.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid

the Minister has not given me the assurance that  I

sought  earlier on, i.e, no new taxes for new  cars

and  no  curb on private vehicles entering the  CBD

just yet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> In respect of taxes, it is a

matter  for  the Ministry of Finance. It  does  not

come under the Ministry of Communications, and I am

in  no  position  to answer that.  But  as  regards

restriction on kerbside loading and unloading, that

will  be  a  matter  for the Road Transport  Action

Committee to look into.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, in view of the fact that

we  have  not debated the Ministry of Finance  yet,

the   Member   for  Kim  Seng  will  have   another

opportunity. On that note I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,348,590 for Head HF ordered to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head IA be

(*The  same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I merely wish to know whether

the  campaign  launched  by  the  Ministry  of  the

Environment   to   safeguard  the  cleanliness   of

Singapore and to encourage the people not to litter

the  streets have achieved its objective. Singapore

is  well-known for the cleanliness of its roads and

surroundings.  This  opinion  has  been  voiced  by

foreign  leaders and tourists. They have seen  with

their own eyes how clean are our roads and streets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Ministry of the Environment is

launching  a  campaign to resite hawkers  from  all

over  the city to the various hawker centres  which

have been provided by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is a condition that these hawkers

must pay attention to personal hygiene and that the

food must be clean. The campaigns to keep Singapore

clean  and to teach our citizens to form the  habit

of  throwing their litter into litter-bins are  now

over,  and  we  can see the results. However,  Sir,

recently  our roads and streets are again  littered

with   unwanted  boxes  dumped  into  refuse  bins.

Moreover,   the   refuse  bins  provided   by   the

Government  are  old,  and  they  are   not   being

replaced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to know from the Minister whether our

efforts  to teach the people of Singapore  to  keep

Singapore  clean  and  to form  the  habit  of  not

littering have been rewarded or otherwise.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what efforts

are  being  made by the Public Health  Division  to

remove the rubbish in time? Although credit must be

given for the efficient removal of rubbish for most

of  the City areas, the same cannot be said of  the

rural areas and some housing estates. Sometimes the

rubbish  is collected only on alternate days.  Even

in  the  City  areas, certain streets are  used  as

rubbish  collection centres. These streets  do  not

have  a sufficient number of containers and,  as  a

result,  the  rubbish spill over on to  the  roads,

thus producing an excellent breeding ground for the

rats  and other vermin. Many of the people in  some

housing  estates  have been complaining  about  the

mosquitoes.  You  will remember,  Sir,  the  "Anti-mosquito  campaign". We can revive it.  The  Vector

Control  Unit,  which  was so effective,  has  been

defunct  for  some time. Could this  unit  also  be

revived?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to bring to the notice of the

Minister the complaint that the workers who collect

the  rubbish from households would just  chuck  the

dust-bins  after they have thrown the rubbish  into

the van. After one or two months the dustbins would

break.  The  Ministry should get the Inspectors  to

check  on all van drivers and workers. It  is  very

bad  if  the people have to buy dustbins every  now

and then.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

speaking of refuse disposal, some of our industries

are  facing  the  difficulty  of  finding  suitable

dumping  grounds for waste disposal.  At  the  same

time,   they  are  being  summoned  by  the  Health

Inspectors  for incinerating their  wastes  in  the

factory  ground. The reason is that the burning  of

wastes, including wood and paper, is considered  to

be a contribution to air pollution. I wonder if the

Minister could inform the House whether he has  any

plans to install public incinerators in appropriate

locations  to assist the sawmillers and other  like

industries to solve the problem of waste disposal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



is  true  that once a public campaign is over,  and

after  a lapse of time, there is slackness  on  the

part  of  the public with regard to cleanliness  of

the  environment  or  to  prevent  mosquitoes  from

breeding. But I would refute the suggestion of  the

Member  for  Kampung  Kembangan  that  we  are  not

concentrating on keeping the streets clean  because

we are spending time on resettling the hawkers. For

his information, we try to clean the streets daily.

I  think we are one of the few authorities that  do

this. When a Street is not cleaned or when it is  a

bit  dirty, we do send down teams of our inspectors

to  go on a blitzkrieg. Occasionally they may  come

across  streets that are dirty and this is probably

because the workers for that day are not available.

One  evidence which points to the fact that we  are

not  slackening  our efforts to  keep  our  streets

clean  is  the fact that during the last 12  months

20,000 persons were brought to court for littering.

I think we have taken sufficient punitive action by

bringing 20,000 persons to court during the  course

of the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution to the problem here really lies not

in  the  sweeping of the streets, but in  educating

the   public.  In  my  opinion,  several   of   the

campaigns,   for  instance,  the  "Keep   Singapore

Green",  the "Keep Singapore Clean", and the  "Save

Water"  Campaigns,  have been successful.  This  is

because in all the statistics that we have gathered

in  respect of the campaigns to save water  and  to

keep  our  streets clean, for instance, indications

are that there has been a great improvement. But it

takes  time. I would say that the solution lies  in

educating the public, especially the younger  ones,

to form good habits, and not automatically throw an

ice-cream  wrapper or an ice-cream  cup  once  they

have  finished their ice-cream. The solution rather

is   to   inculcate  in  them  a  sense  of   civic

consciousness  .-  make  them  think  twice  before

throwing  a  piece of paper. Education  takes  some

time to percolate through the whole section of  the

public.  At the moment, because of the shortage  of

labour, we have already bought and are using 13



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



mechanical   sweepers.  Twelve   other   mechanical

sweepers are under order. They will be here soon. I

can  safely say to the Member for Kampung Kembangan

that  there  has been no let-up at  all  in  street

cleansing,   and  the  enforcement   section   will

continue to take action against those littering the

streets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to reply to the Member for Anson. He has

asked  whether efforts are being made by the Public

Health  Division to remove rubbish on time. We  are

making  every effort to remove rubbish on  time.  I

have here the statistics which I receive regularly.

They show the number of complaints with regard  -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> It is theoretical.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> It is not theoretical. It is

practical.  If  the Member does not believe  me,  I

invite him to spend one day in our Operations room.

In  the Operations room we receive complaints  from

members  of  the public, but because of the  rising

standard of cleanliness expected by the public  and

the  campaigns  that we have launched,  we  receive

still  more  complaints. And when  they  find  that

their surroundings are not clean or where there  is

rubbish, they phone us up and tell us about it. The

telephone number of the Operations room is  635111,

extensions  232  and 233. If the Member  for  Anson

thinks that this is fictitious and it exists in  my

imagination or in the imagination of my officers, I

do  invite  him  to spend a day there  to  see  the

volume  of  complaints. We have compiled statistics

of these complaints and the action that follows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also asked whether we make

an  attempt  to  remove the rubbish  on  time.  The

complaints that we receive are divided into several

categories.  If  the refuse is not  collected,  and

people ring us up and complain, we put it under the

heading   of   "Refuse   collection".   The   other

categories are: Mosquitoes, flies, drainage, smell,

hawkers,  overgrown vegetation, dumping of  refuse,

sewage,  non-collection  of night-soil,  littering,

dust,  and so on. On the average, we receive  about

400



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



to  500  complaints a month, the least of which  is

refuse  collection - six. It may be that the Member

for  Anson  came across one of those few exceptions

where  refuse was not collected for the day because

there  was a shortage of labour for that particular

day  or  where  the refuse collecting  vehicle  has

broken  down. We collect on the average 1,200  tons

daily. It is normal for us to collect 1,200 tons of

refuse  a  day.  There  are  260  routes  all  over

Singapore where refuse collection is made, and  the

vehicles  make an average of 400 trips a day.  This

is  the volume of work on a normal day. On festival

days, or particularly during the durian season, the

volume of rubbish goes up to nearly 2,000 tons  per

day.  During  festival days when other citizens  in

Singapore  are enjoying themselves, or  during  the

durian  season  when they are eating  and  enjoying

durian,  the  officers  in  the  Ministry  of   the

Environment work over-time to clear up the rubbish.

Every effort is being made to see that the City  is

kept  clean.  We are one of the few authorities  in

the  world  which  go out daily to collect  refuse.

There may come a time when because of traffic  jams

caused by commuters, each driving alone in one  car

and because of a shortage of labour, we may require

the  householder, as is being done  in  some  other

countries,  to packet his rubbish and wait  outside

the house at a certain time of the day to catch the

van when it passes by to put the rubbish in. If the

householder is not there at that time, it  is  just

too  bad.  He will have to bring the garbage  back,

keep  it in the house, and live with the smell.  We

have  not reached that stage yet, but we are  doing

everything we can to prevent this inconvenience  to

householders.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also spoke about over-spilling of

bins.  Bins  are provided in markets at  a  central

spot  where  the surrounding areas are inaccessible

because  of  the narrow streets or because  of  bad

roads.  The  bins  provided  at  such  places   are

sufficient  for  the normal volume of  refuse.  But

some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



tradesmen  Sir, tradesmen now have to pay  more  to

have  their refuse removed if it exceeds a  certain

volume  - have surreptitiously dumped their rubbish

there, and as a result these bins overspill.  There

were  instances  where we had to collect  three  or

four  times  a  day  from one place.  I  would  ask

Members  to have a look at Queen Street. Two  hours

after  removal, all the bins are filled  again.  So

this is not an easy job, but we are doing our best.

Once we find that we have access to the roads,  the

bins  would  be  removed and the normal  method  of

collection would take place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the complaint of mosquitoes, I must say that

everybody is complaining about mosquitoes. We  must

have  mosquitoes in our tropical climate. We cannot

eliminate  them.  We  have anti-mosquito  campaigns

and,  as  usual, after the campaign people  forget.

Anyway,  I  am glad to inform the Member for  Anson

that  at  present the mosquito situation  is  under

control.  We  make random visits to houses  and  to

sites  every month and during the last two  months,

the  incidence of mosquito breeding has gone  down.

It  is  round  about  two per  cent  and  is  under

control.  Of  course,  we can have  campaign  after

campaign. But if we have it too often and too  long

a   period  for  each  campaign,  it  becomes  non-productive.  And there are other departments  which

may also want to carry out their own campaigns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the Member for Kim Keat as to whether

we  will  build incinerators or provide places  for

people  to dispose of their rubbish by burning,  if

he has been following the news lately he would have

come across an item in the papers which states that

we  are  building an incinerator costing about  $50

million.  But  that  apart, the question  of  waste

disposal  of  sawdust  from  sawmills  is  quite  a

problem.  Wherever  possible,  we  suggest  to  the

sawmillers   to  get  together  and  construct   an

incinerator to burn their refuse without  polluting

the  air.  Actually we encourage that. In the  past

they had been able to get away by just



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



throwing the sawdust anywhere. But with the setting

up of the Ministry of the Environment, such liberty

and freedom to pollute our environment must not  be

allowed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope I have answered all the questions

raised.



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I agree with

the  Minister  for  the  Environment  that  it   is

important to educate our children to form the habit

of  throwing litter into bins. But why is  it  that

old   and  damaged  refuse  bins  provided  by  the

Government have not been replaced?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I think it is up to the

householder  to make good the bins that  have  been

spoilt  or  destroyed. Our workers have  all  along

been  told to be very careful with the refuse  bins

when  they do their collection. Probably  in  their

haste to rid themselves of the dirt on the dustbin,

they  put it down quickly. I quite agree that there

have   been  many  instances  where  workers   just

carelessly  throw the bins into the  van  and  then

throw  them down again, causing damage.  Anyway  we

are  trying to instill into our workers a sense  of

paying  more regard to the household bins.  My  own

dustbins have also been damaged on many occasions.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Minister has asked

me  to go and check on one day. I would like to ask

the  Minister to go round one day to  the  area  at

Tanjong Pagar. The Minister is a busy man,  but  if

he has the time, he should see the rubbish there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I did not invite the Member

to  go round checking. I invited him to spend a day

in  my  Operations room because he  says  that  the

figures exist in my imagination. I do go round, and

that  is  why  I  am able to say  that  in  certain

instances we collect rubbish three or four times in

a  day.  And  there  are also places  where,  after

collection,  in two hours we find the  whole  place

filled  with  rubbish. The Member  is  shaking  his

head. I can guarantee him that I will spend one day

there.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I refer to the

dustbins  which are attached to lamp  posts.  These

dustbins, which are provided by the Ministry of the

Environment,   are  damaged  and  have   not   been

replaced.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I want the Minister to

take  action to clear the rubbish. That is what  we

want,  although  the explanation he  has  given  is

good.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, we are clearing 1,200 tons

of  refuse per day! The Member for Anson is a  very

hard  man  to convince. Here again, I would  invite

him  to  the dumping ground at Tampines to see  how

the rubbish is being weighed. We are doing our best

to collect the rubbish, and it is 1,200 tons on the

average  per  day.  Sir, if  the  Member  does  not

believe what I say, it is best for him to go to the

Tampines dumping ground and watch the lorries  come

in. And if he can stand the stench for a day there,

he  will  be able to check on 1,200 tons of rubbish

collected daily.



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I beg leave to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head IA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead BI 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the burial grounds close to the City

have  been  closed,  the Muslim cemetery  has  been

shifted  to Chua Chu Kang. However, the workers  in

charge of the grounds are the same workers who  are

provided  with  quarters in the  Bidadari  cemetery

grounds.  The Ministry of the Environment does  not

provide  them  with transport,  and  they  have  to

travel to Chua Chu Kang at their own expense.  With

the  increase in bus fares now, they  have  to  pay

more.  For  those who own scooters or  motorcycles,

they  also  have to pay more for petrol because  of

the  recent increase in petrol prices.  I  wish  to

know  whether the Ministry is considering providing

free  transport  for  these  workers  or  to  build

quarters near their place of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



employment. The incomes of these workers are low.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the workers who

are  being  transferred to Chua Chu  Kang  cemetery

from  Bidadari have all been offered quarters,  but

none of them has accepted. So it is no fault of the

Ministry that they are running into difficulties in

going  to  their  place  of work  because  we  have

offered them quarters and they have turned down the

offer.  We have tried to make things easy for  them

but the offer has been turned down. What can we do!



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Where are the

quarters located?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> It is about half a mile from Chua

Chu Kang cemetery.



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, with the

explanation of the Minister, I wish to withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head IA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead BL 1109.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the dreaded dengue haemorrhagic fever has

hit  Singapore  rather heavily  and  many  needless

deaths have resulted from it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monthly figures of DHF cases from 1969 to

date,   stating  the  number  of  suspected  cases,

confirmed  cases and deaths, would give  a  clearer

picture of the situation. I would appreciate  these

figures  from  the  Minister.  Knowledge  of  these

figures   would  enable  Government,  Singaporeans,

trade  unions and other organisations  to  be  more

vigilant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, much as I would like to give

the  figures  requested for, I am afraid  I  cannot

because,  firstly,  the figures are  not  available

and,  secondly, even if they are available I  would

request  that a Question be put up for oral  answer

because these are too detailed. For the information

of  the Member, there are no figures available  for

the  years  1969  to  1972 largely  because  dengue

haemorrhagic  fever  was  a non-notifiable  disease

then. It is very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



difficult to diagnose dengue haemorrhagic fever and

there  is no way of telling quickly whether  it  is

really DHF or otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to allay the Member's fears, the situation is

under  control. The number of incidence in  January

and  February has gone down greatly.  In  fact,  in

February there were only eight known cases. We have

come  to  an understanding with the authorities  at

the  General  Hospital  for  a  standard  form   of

diagnosing dengue haemorrhagic fever. The incidence

has  been  brought down largely because  of  swing-fogging in affected areas. That is all I can say at

the moment. But as far as figures are concerned,  I

am afraid I am unable to give the Member.



<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that DHF

can  be  suppressed if the mosquito  population  is

lowered  appreciably. There  are  various  ways  of

diminishing the mosquito population. One  of  these

is the oiling method. It appears, and if I am wrong

I  stand corrected and hope for clarification, that

there  has  been  some  slackening  of  suppressive

methods  of diminishing the mosquito population  by

the  Ministry of the Environment when  they  ceased

oiling  the  construction sites.  The  construction

sites,  at the present moment, are being  oiled  by

the   contractors  themselves.  This  is  far  from

satisfactory  because  the contractors,  not  being

directly involved in public health, do not have the

know-how  and have little to gain but something  to

lose in financial expenditure.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health hazards of such a potent nature in such

large  areas,  like construction sites,  should  be

obliterated  by  the Government. It  is  imperative

that the Ministry again implements, as a matter  of

urgency, this oiling process in construction  sites

and charge the contractors for this service, and be

ever  vigilant  in  other areas of  known  mosquito

breeding,  utilising whatever methods available  to

curb the breeding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



of  these  pests.  Would the Minister,  considering

that  the lives of the people are precious,  accede

to my humble plea?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, the most effective way of

keeping   down   mosquitoes   is   to   have   good

housekeeping. There are 500,000 homes in  Singapore

and  if  every  one does his share of housekeeping,

there would be no mosquitoes and there would be  no

complaints about mosquito nuisance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the oiling of construction sites,

under  the  law  now every one is  responsible  for

mosquito breeding in his home and the contractor is

responsible for mosquito breeding at his work site.

We  tried  to help before by oiling the work  sites

for  them. But we found that as a result there  was

no  feeling  of  responsibility. They  became  more

careless, and we found that it was not possible for

us  to keep track and do the work for them. Arising

out of this, they found that it is cheaper for them

to do the oiling themselves or to get professionals

to  do  it,  than to pay fines imposed on  them.  I

think  every one of us has a responsibility to  see

that  we do not provide the facility for mosquitoes

to  breed  in  our own home. In the same  way,  the

contractor  is responsible for the cleanliness  and

safety  of his construction site and to see  to  it

that  there  are  no facilities for  mosquitoes  to

breed.  Incidentally, by the way, for the  Member's

peace  of  mind,  the mosquitoes usually  found  in

construction  sites are not the  type  that  caused

dengue haemorrhagic fever.



<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Sir, my fears have been allayed by

the Minister, and I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head IA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead BM 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new regulations regarding handling of

food is no doubt good for the health of the public,

but  I am afraid to say that some of the conditions

are stiff and may drive many hawkers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



out  of business. Take, for instance, poh piah  and

roti prata hawkers. How can a hawker preparing roti

prata  make this bread with knives and spoons,  let

alone  chopsticks? Are the hawker inspectors  given

instructions  to be lenient with such  hawkers  who

have  no  choice  but to use their fingers  in  the

preparation of such types of food?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hawker inspectors should be given a course on

human  relations. I have received  complaints  that

some  of  the inspectors are arrogant and  rude  to

hawkers.  Some are so inconsiderate that they  pick

on particular hawkers and victimise them. I quote a

case of a female hawker in my constituency who  had

been harassed and issued with many summonses by the

hawker   inspector,  who  seemed  to   relish   his

authority   and  uniform.  The  woman   became   so

desperate  that  she committed suicide  by  jumping

down from a nearby block of flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what steps are taken by the Hawkers

Department to resite all stalls that are  operating

in back lanes? Nowadays we can find many of them in

the  lanes which are very unhygienic, with  toilets

sited  close to the stalls and with stagnant  water

in   the   drain.  Would  the  Department  consider

resiting  all  those hawkers in this  situation  as

soon as possible?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of late, there has been a move to computerise

hawker licences, and the hawkers are expected to co-operate   by  giving  their  particulars   to   the

officials concerned, or else they may lose  certain

benefits later on. It may end up similarly like the

tenants  in pre-war houses whose names were omitted

for  some obvious reasons during census-taking  and

that   resulted  in  no  priority  for  alternative

accommodation during clearance time.  Therefore,  I

request  that ample notice and plenty  of  time  be

given  to  the  hawkers in going  about  with  this

computerisation.





<br><br>6.05 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I rise in support of the

amendment moved by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



the  Member for Anson. I think there is  a  lot  of

merit in what he said. While it is right and proper

for the Ministry of the Environment to emphasise on

clean  and hygienic measures in the preparation  of

food and the method it should be served, I think  a

lot  of  consideration  must  be  given  by  hawker

inspectors  in  their  inspection  of  hawkers  for

cleanliness  and proper hygienic methods  used  for

giving out food to the particular type of food that

is prepared. The Member has mentioned quite rightly

two items, for example, poh piah and roti prata. To

insist  that this poh piah seller wears  gloves  is

utter  nonsense to me. Poh piah cannot be  prepared

with  gloved hands. On the other hand, emphasis  on

the  use of gloves is not in itself a guarantee  of

hygienic  preparation.  A  person  can  wear  dirty

gloves  for the whole day, dig his nose  and  ears,

and  the  pair  of  gloves will  certainly  not  be

hygienic.  The  emphasis  is  that  the  method  of

preparation  must be hygienic. In any execution  to

ensure  hygienic  measures, the  hawker  inspectors

should use their discretion and intelligence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I am aware that certain

sections  in  the  Food  Ordinance  do  not   allow

handling of food with bare hands, but I have enough

confidence in members of my staff to see that  they

enforce the law with intelligence and humanity.  Of

course,  there are exceptions. I quite  agree  that

poh  piah  and roti prata cannot be prepared  other

than  by the use of the hands. I think we have been

allowing such methods of preparation, and I am  not

aware that the officials of the Ministry insist  on

the  hawkers  wearing gloves. But I  am  sure  that

Members  would like to see that the  poh  piah  and

roti prata that they eat are prepared by very clean

hands.  In  fact, only last week I had occasion  to

come  across  some  hawkers  who,  while  preparing

certain  food with their hands, were  at  the  same

time  handling dirty shillings. This is an instance

of unhygienic handling of food that we want to stop

or  at  least to teach the hawkers the correct  and

hygienic way of handling food. As the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>



Member  for  Kim  Seng  has properly  put  it,  the

emphasis  should be on cleanliness and not  on  the

method of preparation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the sad story by the Member for Anson

about harassment by inspectors which caused a woman

hawker  to  commit suicide. I doubt his story  very

much.  If  it  were true, and if  he  can  give  me

details  of the case, we will see that the  culprit

is  brought to book. To blame the hawker  inspector

for  the suicide of that woman hawker is just  like

blaming  the  Housing  and  Development  Board  for

building high-rise flats which have led to so  many

suicide cases. So I think it is a bit unfair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Anson and hon. Members

must have known that during the last few months  we

have  been  spending a lot of time  and  effort  in

resiting   hawkers  from  the  streets.  Our   main

objective  is, of course, to move all hawkers  from

the  streets  into  hawker centres  or  appropriate

buildings  where they can exercise cleanliness  and

where  they can be better supervised so  that  they

would  not dirty or clog up the streets. This  will

go on until all of them are resettled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson need not have any fears that

computerisation   of  hawkers'  particulars   would

result   in  some  of  the  hawkers  losing   their

livelihood. This is just an administrative  measure

to  use modern methods of administration and  modem

machines  so  that  when  the  hawkers  go  to  the

Ministry for renewal of licences, it could be  done

quickly.  This  is just to speed up  administrative

procedure. There is nothing sinister in that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Sir, I would like to congratulate the

Minister  and  the Hawkers' Department  for  having

finally  implemented the Sale of Food  Act  to  the

advantage  of the consumers. Now consumers  can  be

assured that they have wholesome and healthy food.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I am glad the Minister

has  explained the position. After the introduction

of the Sale of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>



Food  Act,  I  saw in the newspaper  headlines  "50

people affected by typhoid fever". Before that Act,

nothing  happened!  Anyway, I beg  to  withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head IA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead CB 1109.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what remedial action is being taken to

alleviate   the   constant  floods   in   low-lying

localities after a short shower? For example, Bukit

Timah around Newton and in Thomson Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water in some of the drains, especially

those  covered  with metal grids,  is  not  flowing

properly and therefore stagnates. This results in a

stinking  smell,  and the drains  become  excellent

grounds for breeding mosquitoes. Furthermore,  some

of the canals and monsoon drains, like the one near

the  People's Park, are constantly giving out  foul

smell.  This  is also due to the poor flow  of  the

water.  Can  something be done to ensure  a  proper

flow of the water?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Rochore Canal has the reputation of

producing  the  "best aroma" for residents  in  the

area.  Of  late, it has acquired the ill-repute  of

being  the cause of floods. This is because of  the

canal work which has been going on for the last two

years.  In fact, work on that canal has stopped  of

late.  Has the contractor disappeared again? It  is

time something was done about this canal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of late, the City area has experienced freak

floods  - something that has never occurred before.

Is  this due to poor drainage in the City area,  or

is  it  caused by the filling of the sea to reclaim

more land? Such heavy floods have not occurred  for

many   years.  Could  it  be  that  since  we   are

reclaiming  land  from the sea, the  water  has  no

chance  of flowing outward but to flow back to  the

land?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has the department done to stop a recurrence

of  these floods? During one of these freak floods,

many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



shopkeepers had their goods soaked with sea  water,

resulting  in  a  heavy financial loss.  Therefore,

reclaiming  land from the sea is very bad.  But  if

the Government wants to do that, we do not want  to

object. It is better.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you stand at the Kallang Basin for one hour,

you  can  get a terrible smell. If you  inhale  it,

within  two  hours you will straightaway  get  high

fever.  I  have  been to that place myself,  and  I

could  not  stand the smell. The Minister  must  do

something about the drains and canals. Otherwise it

will  be  very difficult for us to be here debating

about  anti-pollution and anti-mosquito  campaigns.

What is the use of all these campaigns if we do not

do anything about drains and canals? We must do our

duty. Then we can ask the people to do their part.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, for the information of the

Member  for  Anson,  I  would  like  to  say   that

regulations  are not made to cause epidemics.  They

are made to prevent epidemics. So the occurrence of

typhoid  fever  has  got nothing  to  do  with  the

regulations. In fact, if we had not been alert, the

epidemic   would   have  spread  to   far   greater

proportions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked what remedial action has been taken

to  alleviate  the  constant  floods  in  low-lying

localities, like Bukit Timah and Thomson Road after

a short shower. I live around that area. In fact, I

pass  that area every day in the morning,  evening,

and  sometimes at night. But I am not aware of  any

increase  in occurrences of floods. There  has  not

been any increase and it is largely because we have

completed  the first part of the Bukit Timah  Flood

Alleviation Scheme. So what he has come  across  is

probably what we call a "flash flood" which  occurs

when  there is a sudden heavy downpour. Large areas

of our country have been developed. Where there was

land before, there is concrete now; it is built up,

and  the capacity to absorb water is not there. The

drains  are built for normal showers just like  our

roads are built



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



to  accommodate normal traffic. And  as  peak  hour

traffic  jams  up  our roads, so a  heavy  downpour

causes  "flash floods" which will subside  after  a

short period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the smell at Rochore Canal, I agree

that  this  place has been famous for it  for  many

years.  Government after government had been making

efforts   to  get  rid  of  the  smell.   For   his

information, I would like to say that the smell  is

not  due to poor flow of water, but rubbish  thrown

into   the  canal  by  careless  and  irresponsible

members of the public, and the rubbish prevents the

water  from  flowing. It decomposes, putrefies  and

the  result  is the smell. The Rochore Canal  is  a

difficult canal to work on too. That is one of  the

reasons why many contractors have gone bankrupt  or

have  given  up  their contracts  half-way  through

because  they had to work in between rising  tides,

and the canal being messy and dirty, they could not

get  enough people to work there. There was also  a

shortage of materials. But we have a new contractor

now,  and he has completed 70 per cent of the work.

There is a balance of 30 per cent of the work to be

done,  and we hope that he will find enough workers

to  work in these very unpleasant surroundings  and

complete  the contract by the end of the year.  The

sky may be bright, the moon may be high, but it  is

exactly when the sky is bright and the moon is high

that we get high tides.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> When there is a full moon,

there  is no doubt that there is always high  tide.

It  is not when there is a full moon that the  tide

is  low. But on the occasion that I mentioned there

was  no  full  moon, but still the  tide  came  and

flooded the City.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> The tide that he mentioned was a

freak tide, which is not normal. The freak tide was

the  highest recorded in 20 years. It was two  feet

higher  than  normal, and high tides usually  occur

around  that time of the year. We have  the  spring

tide  around the Chinese New Year and, as far as  I

can  remember, very high tides usually occur on the

3rd day and on the 18th day of the Chinese Moon. On

these occasions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



a  large  part of that part of the town is  flooded

because  it  is just a few inches above high  water

level.  But the freak tide that the Member referred

to was so high that it even covered the breakwater.

Those Members who were observant enough on that day

would  have  noticed  that  it  even  covered   the

breakwater.  So the freak flood that  had  occurred

was  not the result of land reclamation. It has got

nothing  to  do with it. It is the result  of  some

special  conjunction of the moon, the sun  and  the

earth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have replied to all the queries

raised by the Member.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, regarding the flood at

Bukit  Timah  Road, I think the  Minister  for  the

Environment  is  staying at Stevens  Road,  but  he

never  crosses Stevens Road. He must go to Balmoral

Road  at  the junction of Stevens Road/Bukit  Timah

Road.  When there is rain, the flood occurs  there.

He  has  never seen that. Probably he never crosses

that part of the road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the flood which occurred last month, it

has  never happened before. I know because  I  have

been   in  Singapore  for  45  years.  It  is  very

surprising that the tide was so high. The  Minister

has  said  that  it was not due to  reclamation  of

land.  But I think that most probably it is because

of  the  reclamation of land from the sea.  If  you

claim a part of the sea, the water cannot flow over

there,  scientifically speaking. There is something

wrong there. I would like the Minister to look into

the  matter. He can get experts to see why the tide

came into the land; came inside, and not that side.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not

know  whether  his explanation of the water  coming

this  side or that side is the right one.  But  for

his  information  the tide that day  was  not  only

unusually  high in Singapore, but it was also  high

all over the world. So this was a world-wide phenomenon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>



It was not a result of our land reclamation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the flood in Stevens Road and Balmoral

Road, I know that area much better than the Member.

I  know from my experience that now there have been

less floods there than before.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in

view of the Minister's explanation, I beg leave  to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head IA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead BM 300l*.

(*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Serangoon Gardens is improving all the time

and  the improvements registered of late have  been

the  near-completion of three large private housing

estates,  which will bring in close to  6,000-7,000

additional residents into the constituency. I  have

discovered,  Sir, that planning-wise there  was  no

provision  made for an additional market  in  these

housing    estates.   Therefore,   pressure    will

inevitably  be  brought  to  bear  on  the  present

Serangoon  Gardens  market. I  do  understand  that

there  are  some  vacancies in the  market,  but  I

anticipate,  with  the large  number  of  residents

coming  into the constituency, there can  be  scope

for expanding the present market. In fact, a septic

tank occupying a fairly large area of land has been

demolished  and  there is vacancy adjacent  to  the

present  Serangoon Gardens market. I have taken  up

the  matter  some  months  ago  with  the  relevant

department as to the feasibility of expanding  this

market,  but  to-date,  I have  not  heard  of  any

development, and I will appreciate enlightenment on

the part of the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ch'ng is not here. Mr Chor Yeok Eng.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment (Mr Chor Yeok Eng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, however you look at a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>



problem,  much depends on your position.  In  every

annual Budget, Members hope that something more can

be  provided  for  their  constituencies,  but  the

department  concerned  must  go  about  it   in   a

realistic way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the suggestion of the Member for

Serangoon  Gardens just now, I would say  that  the

expansion   of   the  Serangoon   Gardens   market,

according  to our survey, is not an urgent  problem

at  this juncture. At present, there are 148 stalls

in  this  market, out of which 30 are still vacant.

This goes to show that the demand for market stalls

is  not  high.  Unless all these stalls  are  fully

taken  up,  we will not expand this market  because

this  is  not  realistic. As to the improvement  of

facilities,  the  department concerned  has  always

paid   attention   to  this  and,   if   necessary,

improvements will generally be made to the existing

markets.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, in 1972 the Government has set

up  a  food  hawker  centre in  that  constituency.

According  to our understanding, many residents  in

the  locality often go to Lim Tua Tow market to buy

their  daily  necessities. Therefore,  we  are  now

planning to expand the market at Lim Tua Tow  Road.

After the completion of the expansion, it will also

provide  more  facilities  for  the  residents   in

Serangoon Garden Estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the general information of the Members, with

regard  to the policy on the licensing of  hawkers,

apart  from  the Member concerned,  I  think  other

Members may also wish to know the licensing  policy

of  the Hawkers Department. I would like to clarify

that after the 1968-69 nation-wide registration  of

hawkers,  bona  fide hawkers based on  the  1968-69

census of hawkers were issued with licences.  Since

June  1973,  the  department  has  not  issued  any

licence  to  any  out-door  hawkers  or  to  street

hawkers.  At  the  present moment,  we  only  issue

licences  to  hawkers  in  markets  or  in   hawker

centres.  At  the  present  stage,  we  will   only

consider issuing market or hawker centre licences



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



to the following categories of people. First, those

licensed   hawkers  affected  by   any   government

redevelopment  scheme.  Secondly,  those  who   are

disabled  due  to  industrial or  other  accidents,

because  by  being disabled they  have  lost  their

capacity  for hard manual or complicated work  and,

therefore,  we decide to help them by issuing  them

with licence for hawking. Thirdly, those who are in

receipt  of social welfare assistance. We  hope  to

make  them  self-supporting by  issuing  them  with

hawker  licences to make a living. Fourthly,  those

who  are  above 40 years old. We believe  that  the

younger   generation   have  undergone   industrial

training  or other basic education and they  should

make  use  of  their  talent  and  capabilities  to

compete  in  the field of international  industrial

technology.  They should not commit  themselves  to

the  world of petty hawking to make a small  profit

as   their   time  and  talent  would  be   wasted.

Furthermore,  by competing in the technical  field,

they  will  contribute not only  towards  bettering

themselves  but also to the national economy  as  a

whole.  Therefore,  we should encourage  our  young

people to embark on the right path. They should not

be  encouraged  to take up hawking as  a  means  of

livelihood just for the sake of a small profit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the

Parliamentary Secretary for the first half  of  his

long  and  lengthy answer. The second half  of  his

reply on hawkers was unsolicited, Sir, as I did not

address  myself to that problem. I am also grateful

for  the  information that Lim Tua  Tow  market  is

going to be expanded. It will serve residents in my

constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But an additional matter perhaps that I can raise

is  the nature of licences issued to hawkers in the

Serangoon  Gardens  market. Initially,  when  these

licences  were  allocated, they were allocated  for

certain  specified purposes which  it  was  thought

could  meet the need of the residents at that time:

so  many stalls to sell pork and so many stalls  to

sell such and such a commodity. The situation today

has changed, and I will be happy to hear of a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



reassessment  of  the needs and a revision  of  the

licences for specified purposes for the market.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  with regard to the reassessment  of

market  stalls, we will reconsider  the  demand  to

readjust  the need for the various stalls  in  many

markets. The Member has said that the stalls in the

market in his constituency should be reassessed.  I

would like to go there and find out for myself, and

then  liaise with him to find out what he  actually

needs.  If there is a need for adjustment, then  we

will take measures to see that it is done.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with that, I

beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr L. P. Rodrigo -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) That the sum to be allocated for Head IA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead CB 3010.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rodrigo, amendment (7).



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> I am not moving, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head IA in

respect of the Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move this amendment in order to provide me

with  the  opportunity, firstly, to point out  that

the  Ministry  of  the Environment,  in  its  short

history  of  about a year's existence, has  done  a

tremendous  job  in the promotion of  a  clean  and

healthy  environment. How else can I come  up  with

this  statement during Budget time? I have said  it

with the most honest intention, and I think we  are

immensely proud of the fact that Singapore is,  and

it  is again and again being repeated, the cleanest

city in Asia, and rightly so. Much credit should be

given to the Ministry of the Environment. I do  not

wish to dwell for long on praising the Ministry  of

the Environment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I originally intended to raise certain topics but

they  have already been covered. I therefore intend

to  point  out just two matters which the  Minister

for  the Environment might like to comment. One  is

the hawker problem. The Minister must be well aware

that  at  various  hawker centres, particularly  at

night  and  I  am  sure  also  by  day,  there  are

inadequate provisions for ash trays, litter bins or

dustbins for the disposal of all forms of waste. It

is no consolation to the consumers, in going either

to  Hokien Street, Beach Road, or the Orchard  Road

car  park  for a meal or a bowl of mutton soup,  to

have  at frequent times to wallow through a  rather

unclean  path  littered  with  food  wastes,  paper

litter  and cigarette butts. I believe the Ministry

of  the  Environment has powers to impose upon  the

hawkers   the   obligation  to   provide   adequate

facilities for containing these wastes. I think the

provision of ash trays on all the tables should  be

made  compulsory,  and  certainly  litter  bins  or

dustbins should be provided. Sometimes at  some  of

these  places you can even see rats joining in  the

race.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> It is a rat race!



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> The second matter which the

Minister might like to comment on is with regard to

the division of control on the hawker population in

Singapore. We all know that the hawkers are divided

into  two divisions, one under the Ministry of  the

Environment  and  the other under the  Ministry  of

National   Development.  This  division  into   two

categories has caused a fair amount of confusion in

the  eyes  of the public, and certainly among  some

Members of Parliament. Occasionally it has  led  to

passing the buck from one to the other, so  that  a

hawker applicant is shuttled from one to the  other

and back to the first. To me this is an unnecessary

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I think the division into two categories

may give rise to a lack of control over a situation

which I can well imagine. It is Government's policy

to allow one household to own no more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



than  one hawker stall, but it is well within their

imagination and certainly very possible - in actual

fact  true  -that some families own more  than  one

hawker  stall, one obtained from the Hawkers Branch

of the Ministry of the Environment and another from

the Housing and Development Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments I would like to thank you for

the opportunity, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to  thank  the Member for Kim  Seng  for  his

opening statement. I think my staff will be  really

encouraged  by  his expression of appreciation  for

the  work  they  have  done  under  very  difficult

circumstances.  Members  may  not  know  that   the

enforcement of rules and regulations regarding  the

cleanliness of a place and the control  of  hawkers

is quite a difficult and dangerous job. Members may

have often heard of officers of the Ministry of the

Environment being assaulted. Yesterday  two  of  my

inspectors were badly assaulted. One of them is now

warded in the hospital with a broken head. This  is

the  other side of the picture which the Member for

Kim  Seng should know. As far as possible, they  do

their  work with firmness and fairness, but  we  do

come across members of the public who take the  law

into  their  own  hands. And in instances  of  this

nature  we will definitely take a serious view  and

those responsible will be severely dealt with.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the suggestion in regard to the

provision  of litter bins and ash trays  at  hawker

centres,  there  are litter bins in these  centres.

Probably  there may not be enough. But  the  places

which  the Member mentioned, especially the Orchard

Road  car  park, are so crowded that the  customers

even  find  it  difficult to pass each  other,  and

invariably  litter bins are kicked  aside.  On  the

question of ash trays, we have tried it out in  the

old  market  at Beach Road. The hawkers there  were

asked  to  provide  ash trays.  Members  know  that

commercial houses have been giving



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>



away free ash trays as a form of advertisement, and

they come in various sizes and various shapes. They

were put there. Some ash trays were shallow and, as

a  result, cigarette ash was blown on to the  food.

And  if the ash trays were deep enough, they became

mini-litter  bins. So it does not work.  Anyway  we

are  looking into the problem and we will be trying

out  a new type of litter bin where the top section

is  filled with sand for cigarettes. This matter is

under consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also raised a question on the division

of  authority over hawkers between the Ministry  of

National  Development  and  the  Ministry  of   the

Environment. It is very clear cut. Hawkers who  ply

their trade in Housing Board estates come under the

Ministry   of  National  Development  because   the

housing  estates are built and maintained by  them.

It  would be difficult for another authority to  go

in  and maintain part of the estate. Moreover,  the

rents  collected from these estates are due to  the

Housing  Board. Anyway, there is very close liaison

between  the  Ministry of National Development  and

the  Ministry of the Environment with regard to the

control  of hawkers. I would not say that the  case

which the Member mentioned where a family gets more

than  one  hawker stall would not  occur.  It  does

occur  even if control were to come under a  single

Ministry. Such cases do occur. But whatever it  is,

there  is  very  close  liaison  between  the   two

Ministries,   and  we  have  been  operating   this

division of authority for quite some time.  As  far

as  we  can  see,  it  is working  quite  smoothly.

Whenever they have problems in controlling  hawkers

and in maintaining cleanliness, they come to us and

we do send reinforcements. On the question of rules

and  regulations governing hawkers, we try to  make

the same rules and regulations.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, in view of the assurance

and  comments made by the Minister, I beg leave  to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $60,949,880 for Head IA ordered to

stand part of the Main Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $49,094,800 for Head IA ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head JA --



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head JA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 1004*.

(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs P. Govindaswamy and Lai Tha Chai.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that culture and art are very

important  in the life of the people. Besides  such

necessities   as   food,  shelter,   clothing   and

transport,  the cultural life of the people  is  an

indispensable  aspect of their lives.  Culture  and

art  are not only the spiritual food of the  people

but  also  symbols  of their spiritual  outlook.  A

country  without culture and art  is  like  a  body

without life. It is like living in a desert. How do

we expect one to survive?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are a newly independent country. We have

many  cultural traditions. Basically,  if  we  work

hard to sustain and promote the rich traditions  of

our  various cultures, we can develop them  further

and  so  ensure that our people will be a  cultured

race.  Just  as  the Minister said last  week,  the

ASEAN  countries have a rich heritage of  cultures.

But  what  have  we  done in the promotion  of  our

cultures? I believe the Minister will agree with me

when I say that, in the development of our cultural

work, we are going about it very slowly. We are not

making much headway,.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt the Ministry of Culture has done

something in the promotion of our cultures and art.

In  the  last few years, for example, the  Ministry

has  organised  public art shows, public  concerts,

appreciation of drama, and so on. But this  is  not

enough.  There is not enough effect. On  the  other

hand,  Radio and Television Singapore has not taken

a  leading role in the promotion of our traditional

cultures.  In their broadcast programmes only  some

have any educational value. They are the various



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>



forums   and  seminars  on  the  fuel  crisis,   on

inflation, the presentation of the debates  between

the  Universities in Singapore, Malaysia  and  Hong

Kong,  programmes "For the Family"  and  children's

corner,  and so on. These programmes are  good  and

educational.  However,  a  great  majority  of  the

programmes are meaningless slap-sticks, meaningless

stories  without any educational significance.  Let

me  quote  some examples. There are some programmes

full of mystery and professional gamblers who teach

us   how   to  swindle  our  way  through   various

situations.   And  there  are  also   some   stupid

comedies.  The content of these programmes  is  not

right. There are supposed comedies all of which are

nonsensical    and    without    any    educational

significance. This will be a stumbling block in our

effort  to build a healthy culture and will  be  an

unhealthy influence on our young people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that the Minister has often

emphasised the need to build a healthy and cultural

life  so  that our people will be good and  have  a

healthy  outlook.  But I am afraid  the  people  in

charge  of  these  television programmes  have  not

implemented  these policies properly. In  order  to

further promote the cultural arts, I would like  to

suggest the following measures:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) We should promote healthy cultural activities

on   a   large  scale.  For  example,   we   should

periodically  hold  cultural  festivals.  In  these

festivals we can allow a rich intermingling of  the

various  songs,  dances and dramas of  the  various

cultures.  If  we  do  this,  we  will  provide  an

opportunity for the various cultural workers in the

various  language  streams  to  come  together  and

develop the cultural activities more fully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) We should set up a cultural committee to

supervise   the   content  of  the  programmes   on

television  and radio to ensure that the programmes

will play a greater role in education.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) We should promote and finance activities in

the  schools  and  in the various organisations  so

that they can organise more cultural programmes. In

the hiring of the National Theatre, they should  be

given cheaper rates as an incentive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) We should adopt more stringent measures on

suppressing yellow culture. We have to ensure  that

our young people grow up in a healthy environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to raise a second point.

This  is  in  regard  to  the  question  of  colour

television. Last year when Parliament was  debating

the policy of Government, the Minister informed the

House  that  colour television would be  introduced

this  year.  This year will herald in  the  era  of

colour television. I would like to ask the Minister

as  to  what  progress has been made. How  far  has

preparatory work been done for the introduction  of

colour   television?   When   will   the   official

commencement date be?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is in regard to cultural

delegations which are sent abroad. In the last  two

years,   we  have  sent  cultural  delegations   to

friendly  countries  for visits.  The  aim  was  to

introduce our cultures to other countries  so  that

those   countries  could  better   understand   the

development  of our country. Sending such  cultural

delegations  and missions have advantages  in  many

respects.   We   can  only  improve  the   cultural

intercourse between countries. We can also  improve

the  friendly  relationships between countries.  In

addition, it will provide our cultural workers with

a  great  incentive and encouragement  to  continue

working  in  their respective fields  in  order  to

bring  forth  shining and glorious  recognition  of

their  work.  I  would therefore like  to  ask  the

Minister  what  plans  are afoot  to  send  further

cultural  missions  overseas.  I  think  that   the

sending  of  cultural  missions  overseas  is  both

significant and meaningful.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point is related to a symphony

orchestra  for  Singapore. I had  brought  up  this

question  last  year. At that time  the  Minister's

reply was that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>



he  was prepared to consider this suggestion.  Now,

after  a year has elapsed, I would like to ask  the

Minister  what  has  he done  in  respect  of  this

suggestion.  Or  has he completely forgotten  about

it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth point is a question of helping and

assisting local writers to publish their  works.  I

had  similarly  raised this matter last  year.  The

Minister at that time said that it was a good idea.

Again,  a year has passed, and I would like to  ask

the  Minister what has happened to this suggestion.

Has he provided any assistance to local writers  to

publish their works?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth point concerns the question of

punctuality.  Sir, in our call  on  our  people  to

economise and to be thrifty, I think we should also

conduct  a campaign on punctuality to cut down  the

waste of time. We should spend our precious time in

productive  and constructive work. Since  we  have

conducted various campaigns on Health, Save  Water,

Keep  Singapore Clean, and Keep Singapore Green,  I

think  there  is need for a campaign on punctuality

to encourage people to be more punctual. I hope the

Minister  for  Culture will assume the  supervisory

role  in  making people realise the importance  and

the  advantages  to be obtained by being  punctual.

The  idea  is  to  make  our people  cultivate  and

acquire  the  habit of keeping to time  and  to  be

punctual.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, what effort is being

made  to  promote  a Singaporean  culture  here  in

Singapore?  When  the PAP came to  power  in  1959,

there  were  cultural shows like  the  Aneka  Ragam

shows.  These shows provided a direct link  between

the  artistes and the masses. Further, it  went  at

great length towards promoting an understanding  of

the other peoples' cultures. Very unfortunately  it

has  died out. Even the programmes arranged at  the

parks here have died out. Why, may I ask, has  this

been allowed to happen? What is the use of building

stages  at Hong Lim Park, MacRitchie Reservoir  and

at Seletar Reservoir, if these have been allowed to

become white elephants?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the field of art, the open-air Art

Exhibition  held on the first Sunday of each  month

has  not been heard, of late. What has happened  to

the  Art for Everyone exhibitions that are supposed

to  tour the community centres? How can we build  a

society  interested in the arts if the Ministry  of

Culture, which is responsible for the promotion  of

these arts, has let these exhibitions and shows  to

die out?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the young are being forgotten. The Education

Ministry  organises an art exhibition in connection

with  the Youth Festival. But the exhibition is  of

too short a duration and held only once a year. The

Ministry  of Culture should take the initiative  to

hold  similar  exhibitions of young peoples'  work,

and  to hold it more often. These exhibitions could

then make a tour of the various community centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote further interest in music and art the

Ministry  of  Culture,  in liaison  with  RTS,  can

introduce  more documentary films so as to  educate

our  public. Various aspects of art and  music  can

also  be  introduced. Art and music in our  schools

can  also  be  encouraged so that our citizens  can

take pride in what goes on in present day schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to mention that some sponsors

of   art,  after  succeeding  in  inviting  foreign

artistes  to  perform in Singapore, are  unable  to

look after them, such as providing proper food  and

shelter.  What restriction has the Culture Ministry

had  in  mind  for such sponsors?  Are  they  fully

screened before a permit is granted?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

various  Members  have  talked  about  policies  in

regard  to culture and other matters, but  I  would

like to touch upon items like variety shows over TV

telecasts.  The Minister explained to us  the  last

time why certain shows were permitted. He said that

shows  like  the  "Variety  Show"  and  such   like

programmes were meant to enable people to relax.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would propose that we should also allow those

luxurious  hotels and night clubs to perform  their

special type of decadent dances and music, even the

shaking  of  fleshy parts. I say so not  because  I

would  like  to promote such culture or activities,

but  to  provide  a certain amount of  latitude  to

allow the rich and the tycoons to spend their money

here  instead  of abroad,. If we do prohibit  night

clubs  to stage such decadent performances, I would

like  to  ask the Minister whether or not  our  men

could  be  stopped  from going  across  the  Johore

Causeway to enjoy the naughty shows there. They can

board a plane and, after an hour or so, reach their

destination  to  enjoy their  glorious  night  life

overseas. People can do that if they want to.  What

I  mean  to say is that in this mundane world,  the

world of idealism is very far away from what we are

able  to  achieve at present. We must be practical.

The  rich people in Singapore can spend their money

here  and enjoy their lives here. If they like they

can  go abroad and scatter their money there.  That

is  something that we cannot prevent. From my point

of  view,  at  the present juncture  while  we  are

subjected to various kinds of economic pressure and

when  our nation building in respect of culture  is

also subjected to foreign influence, we ought to be

practical.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Government's restriction prohibiting 18

year-olds from going into certain places,  I  would

suggest  that places like night clubs where  people

can  enjoy  decadent pastimes  should  be  open  to

everyone who can afford to enjoy themselves  there,

subject  to  the condition that the Government  can

levy  very  high admission charges or entertainment

duties  so that our money will not flow abroad.  In

this  way  the few rich people who can fly overseas

to  enjoy  their weekends can also well  afford  to

spend their money here in Singapore, so that we can

benefit  in  greater revenue.  If  there  are  rich

foreigners who want to go around various places  to

enjoy  the scenery, they can also throw their  gold

on these night



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



clubs or other places of resort in Singapore. After

saying  all these, I do not mean to say that  I  am

interested   in  promoting  yellowish  or   grayish

culture.  What  I  mean  is  that,  since  we   are

subjected  to  foreign cultural influence  and  our

influence on others is less than theirs is  on  us,

we  might perhaps choose the more practical way  to

solve this problem so that our people need not have

to  go abroad to spend their money. If people  want

to  spend their glorious nights here, they can have

such a facility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting that the Broadcasting

Department  in  Singapore should  also  allow  such

decadent programmes to be broadcast. We should give

our  children interesting shows than those for mere

enjoyment. The music in Chinese shows like  Ta  Min

and Seow Min, is not particularly beneficial to our

young  people.  So  I would like  to  propose  some

measures for the Minister to consider. In  view  of

our  present  particular situation, to formulate  a

kind of two sided cultural policies -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Member for Katong rising on

a point of order or clarification?



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I would just like to ask

whether  the  Member could speak a  little  slower,

because I find his speech extremely interesting. He

is going so fast that I cannot follow him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai:</b> The Member can find the English

translation from the newspapers tomorrow,  or  from

the Radio, or from the Hansard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Firstly, to allow such decadent

music  and  shows  to  be  performed  with  certain

latitude in the night clubs on the one hand, and at

the  same  time  to  build  up  certain  kinds   of

progressive  and proper cultural performances  with

the  right concept in arts and culture on the other

hand   through   the  media   of   radio   and   TV

broadcasting,  will have its peculiar  as  well  as

general characteristics. Secondly, the Chinese term

of "Variety Show" has a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



very rich meaning in the Chinese language. However,

the  Chinese  expression  is  far  nicer  than  the

English  translation. So I hope  the  Minister  for

Culture can give a better rendering to this Chinese

expression so that the English translation  can  be

as beautiful and fitting as the Chinese title.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than what I have said just now, the

Ministry  of  Culture  has  in  recent  years  been

promoting  and  encouraging performances,  such  as

"Music for Everyone" series which are cultural  and

artistic   activities.  This  will   provide   good

material for the TV department.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is a

pity  that  the previous speaker took a little  bit

seriously   the  injunction  of  the   Member   for

Sembawang to be punctual.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Sir, may I just comment on some of

the  remarks made regarding the unhealthy  pursuits

to which our young people and others are exposed to

because   of   the   dearth  of   better   cultural

opportunities. I think the Ministry of Culture  has

done  a  great deal to fill in the gap but perhaps,

especially because of a lack of financial  support,

it  has  not been able to do as much as  it  should

have done or could have done. But when we think  in

terms    of   trying   to   offer   people   better

opportunities to understand or to indulge  in  some

cultural  pursuits, perhaps a better  understanding

of  the  cultural environment would  contribute  to

taking  them away from interest in something  which

has  less  cultural value. I have brought  up  this

point  previously, Sir, regarding  encouraging  our

people  to  know  their  own environment  a  little

better,  and even the question of their, knowing  a

little   bit   of  the  history  of  our   country,

interesting  historical places, and the interesting

stories  behind  these  places,  and  in  this  way

cultivating a sense of belonging to this  place.  I

think  if we can encourage this a little bit  more,

there  can gradually be built a feeling of  greater

belonging, a feeling of greater



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



interest  in  history and cultural development  and

the  roots which we have in our own environment.  I

remember  the  Minister for Culture said,  in  last

year's debate on the Budget, that he thought it was

a  good idea to encourage talks and lectures on our

historical  places. But I have not seen  any  great

multiplication  of opportunities of  this  sort  of

thing  either over the air or through the  People's

Association  or  some other organisation.  This  is

just  a small point. But I think that since we  are

really  in  need  of  cultural  encouragement   and

development,  every little thing adds  to  the  sum

total of our achievement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also brought up the question of cross-fertilisation of cultures and getting people from

one culture to understand the background of another

culture.  The Minister also agreed that  it  was  a

good idea. Of course, he had some reservations  and

these  were our lack of personnel and their ability

to carry forward programmes of this nature. I would

like  to ask him whether he has made any effort  to

develop  such personnel. My experience  last  year,

after  I  had made some comments about the lack  of

such  opportunities, was that I was interviewed  by

somebody from the Broadcasting Department  who  was

actually  trying to discredit what I had  said.  In

fact,  he concocted a programme which attempted  to

discredit  what  I  said about cross-fertilisation.

But  in that very programme, he showed Ravi Shankar

playing  his  instrument with lots of explanations,

which  was, in fact, a proof of the correctness  of

what  I  had  said.  The Minister  himself  agreed.

Fortunately  for  the  Ministry  of  Culture,  this

person  is  now no more in the Ministry of  Culture

but peddling stocks and shares in the stock market.

He has removed himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point which I think could be

raised  in  regard to the encouragement of  greater

cultural  participation. I have mentioned  that  we

want to get something that is indigenous, something

that we can feel we belong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



to.  I think more encouragement should be given  to

our  people to compose music that is related to our

environment,  to choreograph a dance that  is  more

related  to  our  environment, or  to  write  short

literary  plays on topics that are related  to  our

cultural  environment. I think this could  be  done

through  competitions sponsored by the Ministry  of

Culture,  and we should have more of these  things.

Surely  we  could get sponsors for these programmes

and,  if  it is necessary, the Ministry of  Culture

could  try and try again, because we should not  be

discouraged if our initial efforts do not meet with

adequate  response.  We  should  try  to  encourage

people  to  participate in these  competitions.  At

some   juncture  I  think  we  will   produce   the

occasional person who may strike a happy harmony in

what  he  has to offer to the other people  in  our

society. If I may quote an English poet:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Full many a gem of purest ray serene, The dark

unfathomed caves of ocean bare.'



<br><br>If I may also resort to an image with which Members

have become a little more familiar recently:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, And

waste its sweetness on the desert air.'



<br><br>Now  we  want, of course, those things to emerge  - the flower and the gem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, I think, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that

we  have  a very good infrastructure where cultural

development    is    concerned.    The     physical

infrastructure  is there. What  we  lack  is  maybe

finance,  but we have a Ministry of Culture  and  a

hardworking  Minister. In many countries,  they  do

not  even have a Ministry of Culture. They  have  a

Ministry  which  is  allied  to  the  Ministry   of

Education or some other Ministry, like Information.

But  we  have  a Ministry of Culture, and  we  have

other  aspects of infrastructure, like the National

Theatre  and the People's Association. I  think  we

should  use all these devices and tools to  further

pursue our cultural policy more vigorously. What we

need  more,  particularly, is money.  I  think  the

Ministry  of  Culture should in no  doubtful  terms

place their requirements firmly before



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



the Ministry of Finance so that we can get money to

implement our cultural programmes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  in the coming financial  year,  the

Government  has allotted more than $10  million  to

promote colour TV, and there is also a plan to have

a  trial  run of colour TV before the  end  of  the

year. I remember last year Backbenchers raised  the

question  as to when colour TV would be introduced,

and the Minister answered that the Government could

introduce  colour  TV at any moment.  The  Minister

also  stated  that  if we did  so,  we  would  only

increase  our social burden. But at the  time  when

the  Minister gave such a reply we were in a  state

of  prosperity economically. Now, however,  we  are

under   inflationary  pressures  and  our  economic

progress  will be slowed down. Therefore, I  wonder

whether it is timely to introduce colour TV  within

this year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  I  would like to support  what  the

Member for Tiong Bahru has just said, because  even

recently  the  Monetary Authority of Singapore  has

also given orders to the various banks -



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> On

a  point  of  order,  Sir. The Member  for  Kampung

Kembangan has already filed an amendment on Head JA

subhead CA 1107, which I think includes matters  of

colour TV. Therefore, I think it is only fair  that

he  be given a chance to raise matters arising  out

of  that subhead, instead of being overtaken by the

others.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the question

is  if the Minister would like to oppose, he should

have  raised  his objection earlier  because  other

Members have touched on it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I am only saying that the

Member  for  Kampung Kembangan  has  already  given

notice to raise that question. I am going to answer

that question, and if the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



Jalan  Kayu wants an answer, can he wait until  the

Member for Kampung Kembangan has raised it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In view of the fact that an

amendment  has been put down for subhead  CA  1107,

Director of Broadcasting, I think we might as  well

wait  until  the  amendment comes up.  Perhaps  the

Member for Jalan Kayu can then have his say.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> I am still a little puzzled

because the point has just been touched on  by  the

Member for Tiong Bahru, So if he can touch on  this

point,  I  do not understand why I cannot touch  on

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have ruled that we will wait

for subhead CA 1107 to come up before discussion on

this subject can be raised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, all along we have been putting stress

on  the  economic construction at  the  expense  of

spiritual or cultural development. Everybody has  a

soul,  a country has its soul too, a national soul.

In  the promotion of culture, we have never had any

plans. Recently two cultural missions were supposed

to  go  overseas, one to Germany and the  other  to

Japan.  In  Germany, posters were  put  up  in  the

streets informing the people there of the visit  of

the  Singapore cultural mission for a  performance.

In Japan, the same publicity was given over TV, and

even the Japanese newspapers announced the visit of

Singapore's  cultural  mission.  But  at  the  last

moment, the two trips were cancelled. I do not know

whether  the person responsible was aware of  this.

Even  the high authorities, I think, are not  aware

of this. There were enquiries from an Embassy as to

why  the trip was cancelled. Is the Minister  aware

of this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one occasion when the person in charge of the

cultural  delegation went to  the  airport  to  get

tickets for the delegation, he was told that  there

were  no  tickets available because  the  trip  was

cancelled.   This   kind  of  haphazard   makeshift

arrangement speaks ill of the cultural plans and it

has dealt a great



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>



blow  to  cultural  activities. We  have  not  done

enough  in  regard  to  giving  publicity  to   our

cultural activities or heritage. We should not just

inform  other countries that we have Bugis  Street,

or  that we have a Surrender Chamber. So since they

know  very  little about our cultural heritage,  we

should  give  further publicity to  our  claims  on

traditional cultures, the cream of our heritage. We

should afford opportunities for our cultures to  be

introduced  to  other  countries  which  are   very

interested in our cultures.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our cultural missions went abroad there was

usually  a  representation  of  mixed  cultures   -

Indian,  Chinese, Malay and even Western  cultures.

Some  Iranians have been asking why we do not  send

our cultural missions to their country. Since there

are many countries which are very interested in our

culture,  why  do  we not avail ourselves  of  this

opportunity  to  give  greater  publicity  to   our

culture  abroad? Instead we just publicise the  bad

aspects  of  our country. Recently I returned  from

Geneva.  I received a Singapore publicity  pamphlet

on   tourism,  it  states  that  there   are   some

activities in Singapore which can be found  for  24

hours. The best activities will be from 7 p.m, to 7

a.m.,  especially after midnight. It also  gives  a

description  of  certain  streets  which  are  most

interesting and places which are of interest. I  do

not  know  whether it was published by the Ministry

of  Culture,  the Tourist Promotion Board  or  some

other  organisation.  It  also  mentions  that   in

Singapore there are two languages and that  certain

streets  have Indian names. This kind of  statement

is  misleading because in Singapore there are  four

official languages. Certain streets are named after

certain  people.  In  publicising  our  culture  we

should  have  a  proper  systematic  and  long-term

planning. We should not allow our culture  to  sink

or  float by itself. This is not very good for  our

country.  I hope the Minister for Culture will  try

to  get as much funds for cultural activities as he

can  so  as to enrich our cultural heritage and  to

increase our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>



publicity abroad in regard to our cultures.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, much

of what Members have raised had already been raised

last  year.  In fact, I suspect that some  of  them

have  been lifted from last year's Hansard.  It  is

filling  new bottles with old wine -- Sin pin  chiu

chiu.  It is only that the wine is a bit sour  now.

However,  I  should  reply to some  of  the  points

raised by the Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I must come to our old Friend, the Member

for  Sembawang. He has complained,  first  of  all,

about the programmes over the TV. I agree with  him

that to a certain extent some of our programmes are

not up to our expectations. But I must mention that

most  of  our  programmes are imported  from  other

countries. We cannot actually have whatever we want

because  in  some  cases we are fed  with  whatever

films that come to us. Sometimes it is not possible

to  put  in, what you call, the healthy educational

programmes.   I   myself   sometimes   feel   quite

embarrassed  whenever i watch those  mystery  films

depicting crime, robbery, and so on. But apart from

such  programmes, what else can we get? We  do  not

have  a  film  industry, and we depend  very  much,

especially Chinese films, on Hong Kong and  Taiwan.

These are the films which we get commercially  from

these two places.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, educational and informative programmes

have all along formed the highest percentage of the

overall  output on television. Last year, 22.9  per

cent  of  the average weekly output was educational

and  informative. This year, up to March, 1974, the

average   weekly  output  in  this   category   has

increased  to  23.2  per  cent.  Of  the   imported

programmes, excluding feature films, programmes  of

educational value comprised 12.64 per cent  of  the

current  weekly output. Therefore, TV Singapore  is

by  far  the largest user of documentaries in  this

region. At present the average weekly output of RTS

locally-produced films classified as educational or

informative  is  53.82 per cent. This,  of  course,

includes  newsreels, magazines and  public  affairs

programmes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must emphasise that the function of television

is  not just to educate the people. If all we  want

is educational programmes, then we can always scrap

TV and run only the ETV. But we have other purposes

too,  and  that  is to inform and to entertain  the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Henderson has also mentioned that

we  need  some  relaxation after work.  The  people

should have some relaxation, and so - Hua yeh liang

seow.  It  is a bit "soft", I agree, but I  do  not

think  that  would  cause any harm.  If  our  young

people  are  so weak that to watch a  variety  show

just  once  a week weakens them to such an  extent,

then T think it is really a hopeless situation  and

all efforts at nation building, discipline, and  so

on should be scrapped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has raised many points.

First,  he  has asked that, if possible, we  should

organise cultural festivals. Of course, if we  have

the  money, we will do so. He also wants us to  set

up   a   committee  to  supervise  the   television

programmes.  We  have  actually  such  a  committee

supervising these programmes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> He wants to be a member!



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> There is the Film Acquisition

Committee. I think they are doing their best to try

to  get  good programmes but, as I have  said  just

now,  good programmes are difficult to get. He also

wants  us to subsidise local cultural organisations

by  waiving  rent  for use of  theatres  and  other

places. That is rather difficult, because once  you

do  that, then everyone will start jumping  on  the

band  wagon,  and it would then not be possible  to

maintain our theatres properly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As usual, the Member for Sembawang also asked

about colour television. I wish to inform the House

that   TV   Singapore  will  be  radiating   colour

television



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Minister, since you have

said earlier on that you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



would  answer  that point only when amendment  (4)*

comes  up,  could  you  perhaps  wait  until  then?

Otherwise,  I  think it is only fair that,  if  you

want  to  speak on it now, I allow the  Member  for

Jalan Kayu to speak on it also.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The  amendment, standing in the names  of  Haji Mohd.  Ariff  and  Mr.  P. Govindaswamy, reads  as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That the sum to be allocated for Head JA be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead CA 1107.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I beg your pardon. I thought

that  was  in  connection with the  criticism  that

colour television is a waste of money and that,  in

view  of  inflation, we should therefore scrap  it.

That   is  another  matter.  But  the  Member   for

Sembawang  has  asked when would it be  introduced,

and I think that this point should be -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. In fact, the debate should

properly  come up under Head JA, subhead  CA  3001,

Colour  Television,  in the Development  Estimates.

But  since there is no amendment under that subhead

and  since  the  Minister is  responsible  for  the

overall policy, perhaps what we can do is this.  If

the Minister wants to answer that point now, he may

carry  on,  and then later I will allow the  Member

for  Jalan Kayu to say his piece. There  can  be  a

discussion  on it and the Minister can  then  speak

again.  If that is all right, please carry  on,  Mr

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> What I want to mention here is

only the technical `detail about colour television.

As to the criticism -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Minister, may I again interrupt

you?  If  it  is,  in fact, a matter  of  technical

detail  and  not on policy, then perhaps  it  could

come under Broadcasting. However, if it is a matter

of  general policy - whether or not we are going to

have colour television -then please carry on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I would rather wait until the

Member for Kampung Kembangan moves his amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with

regard  to  sending cultural troupes overseas,  the

Ministry of Culture has no plans to send a cultural

troupe  overseas  this year. However,  there  is  a

possibility  that  a  cultural  troupe  may  go  to

Indonesia  this  year because the  members  of  the

business  community  are contemplating  to  send  a

goodwill  mission  to  Indonesia,  and  they   have

invited  our cultural troupe to form part  of  this

goodwill  mission.  If this proposal  materialises,

the  cultural troupe will give performances in  the

Republic  of  Indonesia this year.  The  matter  is

still  under  consideration as plans have  not  yet

been finalised.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta has raised a point about

sending a cultural troupe to Germany and Japan, but

was later scrapped. I must inform him that actually

this  trip  was not part of our cultural programme.

We  were invited by the Tourist Promotion Board  to

send  a troupe to promote tourism, not culture.  We

responded by giving our dancers intensive  training

to prepare them for the trip. But later the Tourist

Promotion  Board  found  that  the  cost  was   too

prohibitive  and withdrew their support.  So  there

was  nothing  we  could do about  it,  It  was  the

Tourist Promotion Board that had asked us to send a

troupe  there, and when they found that they  could

not  afford  it,  they had to withdraw.  Sending  a

troupe overseas requires a lot of money. Of course,

it  would  contribute greatly to the  promotion  of

Singapore's culture, but I would rather  spend  the

money  in Singapore on our own artistes and on  our

own people than promoting shows for the benefit  of

other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> As regards the brochure

mentioned  by  the Member, I do not  think  it  was

printed  by  my  Ministry.  I  think  it  has  also

something  to do with the Tourist Promotion  Board.

So I need not elaborate on that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of a symphony orchestra, this

matter  was also raised last year. The answer  will

still be the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



same  because a symphony orchestra costs money.  If

we are to start a national symphony orchestra, then

it  should  be of a sufficiently high  standard  to

warrant   it  to  be  called  a  national  symphony

orchestra. To achieve this, it is necessary to have

a  number of musicians of the required standard and

for this we will have to recruit quite a number  of

them from abroad and to pay them well. It will cost

a  lot  of  money  to maintain such  an  orchestra.

Several  years  ago,  the  National  Theatre  Trust

started  a  symphony  orchestra  but  it  ran  into

financial  difficulties and, therefore, had  to  be

abandoned. In view of this experience, we are very,

very  careful  now  if  we  have  to  consider  the

prospect of starting another one. I think we  still

have  to  wait  for our budding musicians  to  come

forward,  so  that we can at least  start  a  small

chamber ensemble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards assistance to local writers, again I

had  already  pointed out to the Member  last  year

when   he  raised  the  same  question,  that   our

population of two million cannot support  them.  It

is  rather  difficult for people to make  a  living

purely  by  writing. However, if our local  writers

can   produce  any  work  of  a  sufficiently  high

standard, they should have no difficulty in getting

their   works   published.   The   National    Book

Development   Council  on  which  my  Ministry   is

represented  tries  its best to give  encouragement

and  assistance  to local writers. Book  awards  in

Chinese  were first inaugurated by the  Council  in

1972,  but  none of the 1972 entries was  found  to

sufficiently  qualify for the  award.  The  Council

hopes to inaugurate similar awards for Malay, Tamil

and   English  language  efforts  once  funds   are

available.  I also understand that the Council,  in

conjunction  with  the  Singapore  Book  Publishers

Association,  is in the process of  establishing  a

Writers'  Association. I think this is a good  move

and  the  Council should be congratulated  for  its

good work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of punctuality, I have no idea

that  my  portfolio includes punctuality campaigns.

However,  I think it is really a waste of time  and

money  to  launch  such  a campaign.  The  People's

Association had in 1968 launched such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>



a  campaign, but it fizzled out after a few months,

without  achieving any significant  effect.  It  is

quite  simple  to  make  a  person  punctual.  Much

depends  on  the circumstances he is  asked  to  be

punctual. If it concerns his work, he has got to he

punctual because he knows that he will be penalised

either  by suffering a pay-cut or a reprimand  from

the  boss. If it is a date with his girl friend,  I

am  quite  sure he is quite punctual. Otherwise  he

will  lose  his girl friend. In the case of  dinner

parties,  this  is  not  a  very  important  matter

because if he is not punctual, he will either  miss

his food or have less to eat. I do not think it  is

really necessary to bring this up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must come now to the Member for Henderson

because he has spoken at length on the variety show

entitled  Hua  yeh  liang seow on television.  This

programme has been a thorn in our flesh. If we  can

scrap  it  we  would escape from  quite  a  lot  of

criticisms by MPs who are trying to be puritanical.

After  all this variety show comes on only  once  a

week. If we can have those programmes in the night-clubs for the very well-to-do, then why can we  not

have  some  for  the not so well-to-do  people,  so

that  they  can also enjoy and relax? We should  be

realistic.  Since  they need some relaxation,  then

although those songs would not raise the morale  of

young  people in nation-building they can at  least

give  them some form of relaxation. I do  not  know

whether  the title Hua yeh liang seow is proper  or

not,  but  the  title has been at the  tip  of  the

tongue  of  many people who are familiar with  this

programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has said that we should

build a Singaporean culture. It takes time to build

a Singaporean culture. It cannot be created in just

15  years,  because  we have been  independent  for

about  only 15 years now. He has also said that  we

have allowed the Aneka Ragam show to die out. I  do

not  think it is true because we have called it  by

another name. We do not call it Aneka Ragam, but we

call  it  a  cultural show. In 1972,  the  National

Theatre Trust presented some cultural shows at Hong

Lim  Park,  MacRitchie Reservoir and at  the  other

usual places. In 1973,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>



the  People's  Association started  its  series  of

cultural shows for the people. Up to now, about  15

such  shows  have been staged at community  centres

and at other public places.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The open air art exhibition was started by the

National   Theatre  Trust  in  1968  but   it   was

discontinued  because  of  lack  of  support.   But

recently  the  Ministry of Culture has reintroduced

this  activity, and this time it is for  the  young

artists.  We found that it was very successful  and

because  of this, we have decided to continue  with

this  open air exhibition at regular intervals  of,

say, two to three months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Art for Everyone, this series of

exhibitions has been going on. It is not dead.  The

only  thing is that it takes time to go  round  all

the 65 constituencies. I am quite sure one of these

days  it will come to the community centre at Anson

and  the Member for Anson will be asked to open it.

So  far we have already held about 19 of these  Art

for  Everyone exhibitions in community  centres  in

various   constituencies.  Besides  the   Art   for

Everyone  exhibition, the Ministry of Culture  also

organises  the  National Day Art  and  Photographic

Exhibition every year. In April last year, a  young

people's  art  gallery which  can  accommodate  200

pieces  of  art  work was started at  the  National

Museum.  It  is a permanent art gallery to  exhibit

the  work  of our young people ranging  from  those

attending   kindergarten  classes   to   those   in

secondary schools and vocational institutes. School

students who are good in art can submit their  work

for  consideration of display at the  gallery,  and

exhibits  displayed  are  changed  once  in   three

months.  Also,  early  this year  the  Ministry  of

Culture  began  a  new series  of  concerts  called

"Concerts  for the Young". It is aimed at featuring

our  young  budding musicians and to  provide  them

with an opportunity to perform in public. This is a

monthly   concert  held  at  the  National  Library

lecture  hall, and admission is free. From this  we

can say that our young people are not neglected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, Radio and Television Singapore has done its

part in the promotion of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>



cultural  programmes.  Whenever possible, the RTS introduces  such  programmes,

either of local artistes or artistes from overseas. Currently, the RTS produces

a programme known as Art Appreciation which is being telecast.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About foreign artistes who have been asked to come in and then forgotten, the

sponsors of these artistes are responsible for their welfare in this country. I

am  afraid  there  is  nothing  very much we can  do  about  this  because  the

performers  are normally brought in under private arrangement and  are  usually

promoted on a commercial basis. In many cases, there is some sort of a contract

between  the sponsors and the promoters. I believe that if they are allowed  to

enter Singapore, the sponsors have to satisfy the Controller of Immigration. If

they  abscond  or  neglect  the welfare of their artistes,  the  Controller  of

Immigration would stop them from coming in.
