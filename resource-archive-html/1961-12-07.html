<div align="center"><b>MAIN ESTIMATES AND DEVELOPMENT ESTIMATES FOR 1962</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committee of Supply



<div align="center"><b>(Announcement by Mr Speaker)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In accordance with the provisions of

paragraph  (6)  of Standing Order No. 86 and  paragraph

(5)  of Standing Order No. 87, I have for both the Main

Estimates and the Development Estimates for 1962  fixed

the  times  on each allotted day at which consideration

of  the  heads  of  expenditure  in  respect  of  which

amendments  stand  on  the Order Paper  shall,  if  not

previously disposed of, be concluded. Those times  will

be  circulated to Honourable Members and will appear in

the  Official Report*. I might add that the  amount  of

time  requested by Honourable Members exceeds the  time

available  by almost four times, and it has accordingly

become necessary to cut the time requested drastically,

sometimes  by  more  than  three-quarters.   It   would

therefore be necessary for Honourable Members who  have

given notice of amendments to endeavour to get together

to  share  the  time which has been made available  for

each head of expenditure. It is appreciated, of course,

that Budget time or Supply time is Opposition time  and

they must make the best use of the time available.

<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Question. Mr Marshall.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Question No. 1+, Mr Speaker, Sir.

<hr size="2" noshade>

+ The Question reads as follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ask the Prime Minister whether the statement made by him over Radio

Singapore on the 10th October, 1961, to the effect that if an expatriate

lawyer, when pursuing his professional responsibilities, says or does something which is considered

foolish and is considered to injure the state of the mind of the people and to injure the Government,

the Government would have to move and the expatriate lawyer would have no residence in Singapore,

represents the policy of the Government, and whether he would clarify his statement.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b> not being in his seat -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Prime Minister is not here.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1530</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Toh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Just in elucidation of this, Sir. I am

not supposed to answer this question.  The question has been

directed at the Prime Minister. I just wish to apologise on his

behalf to the House that he is not here at the moment to answer it.

I believe he has completely forgotten that he has one question to answer,

because he has indicated to me that he will be here sometime later on at about 4 p.m. or so.

If the House so desires, you can defer this question till tomorrow.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The relevant Standing Order is Standing

Order 20, paragraph (3), which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If a Minister, Parliamentary Secretary or other

Member,  who  is to answer a question, is  absent,  the

question  shall, if he then be present, be taken  after

all  other  questions appearing on the Order Paper  has

been   disposed  of.  If  the  Minister,  Parliamentary

Secretary or other Member then be not present, he shall

send  copies  of the answers to the Members  who  asked

them  and to the Clerk, who shall cause the answers  to

be  circulated  to  Members and to be  printed  in  the

Official Report.'



<br><br>Therefore, the Prime Minister's answer will have to  be

circulated in the ordinary way.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir. Would

it be permissible if the Prime Minister were to make  a

statement instead of circulating the reply, so that  we

could ask supplementaries?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Certainly. If the Prime Minister thinks

fit, at the appropriate time tomorrow, he could make  a

ministerial statement.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I am quite sure he will be quite

prepared.

<br><br>2.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  before  I introduce  the  Appropriation

Bill,  it may perhaps be appropriate for me to  welcome

back  to  the  House  the pillars  of  democracy  which

departed from -

for    making   provision   for   estimated   financial

requirements  for expenditure to be  paid  out  of  the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1531</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>SUSPENSION OF STANDING</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ORDER</b></div>



<br><br>2.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, notwithstanding the Standing Orders, the Fifth

Supplementary Estimates of Expenditure of the State  of

Singapore for 1961 (contained in Paper Cmd. 37 of 1961)

and  the  resumed debate on the motion of the  Minister

for  Finance  relating to the financial policy  of  the

year 1962 be taken today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir, in

the  light  of the possibility that the Leader  of  the

House   is   not  acquainted  with  the  constitutional

traditions  of  procedure, I would like to  remind  him

that  Budget Day - as this day is, as, in fact, you  have

just  informed  the House - is a day for the  Opposition.

There are five hours, Sir, between 2.30 and 8 p.m., our

normal  time, when the Budget debate takes  place.  The

Opposition has met and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1532</b></font><br><br>



leaders  have  allocated amongst  themselves  the  time

which  is  theirs which is 4½ hours, leaving  half  an

hour  to Government, which is the traditional procedure

in  this matters. If the Leader of the House is of  the

view   that  the  debate  on  the  Fifth  Supplementary

Estimates would take so long as to eat into that  half-hour,  then the Opposition can meet and surrender  part

of  its  4½ hours. But if the intention is that  the.

Government Front Benches or the Government side  should

have  more  than the traditional time to  which  it  is

entitled,  Sir, I will oppose this motion, not  because

today  having received notice I am not prepared to  sit

till  late, but because I am not prepared to contravene

the   spirit   of   the   democratic   traditions    of

parliamentary procedure.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member for Anson has said

it is the practice for Government benches to be allowed

only  half an hour. This is the first time I have heard

of  this practice. Could he please elaborate? It is not

my  recollection that that was the practice we had last

year and the previous year.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure the Front

Bench will accept it from me. Could I crave the Chair's

indulgence?  The  Chair is acquainted with  traditions,

and  I  am  sure  the  whole  House  will  receive   an

indication  from  you,  Sir,  as  to  what  the  proper

procedure is.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think I have indicated in the past

that  in  all these matters, the parliamentary practice

in  other Parliaments is for agreement to be arrived at

between  the  Government side and the  Opposition  side

through  the  usual  channels.  That  means  that   the

Government Whip and the Opposition Whip - if there is  an

Opposition  Whip - get together, decide as to  what  time

should  be made available to each other when  there  is

limited  time  available,  decide  on  the  number   of

speakers  and so on and so forth, so that the  business

on  which  there  is  a guillotine could  be  completed

satisfactorily to both sides.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as our Standing Orders are concerned, the

position is that, ordinarily, the resumed debate on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1533</b></font><br><br>



Question, "That the Assembly approves the financial policy

of  the Government for the year 1962", should take from  3

p.m.  (not 2.30 p.m.) to 8 p.m. Ordinarily also, if  there

is  other  business  of Supply, that  business  of  supply

should be taken on a separate allotted day. But there have

been  cases  where it is anticipated that one business  of

Supply  would  not take unduly long, and it has  been  the

practice in the past for the type of motion which has been

moved  by the Leader of the House to be moved and accepted

by  the  House.  I  think the Leader  of  the  House  will

remember that there is an implicit understanding  that  if

the  first business of Supply enroaches on the time of the

second business of supply, then he will undertake to move,

at  the end of the day, the suspension of Standing Orders,

so  that the time taken up by the first business of Supply

could  be  added  on to the time taken up  by  the  second

business  of  Supply  after 8 p.m.  That  is  roughly  the

position.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, it is not my intention to rob

Members of the Opposition of any time they wish to use  to

speak  during the course of this debate, but as  you  have

pointed  out, according to page 6 of the Standing  Orders,

there   is  a  footnote  down  there,  which  says   quite

correctly:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The resumed Debate on the Annual Budget Statement or

Business  of  Supply  is taken at 3 p.m. on  an  allotted

day....'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now approximately at 2.44 p.m. If by 3 p.m. we do

not   finish   the  debate  on  the  Fifth   Supplementary

Estimates, then at 3 p.m. we will automatically go  on  to

the  resumed  debate  on  the Budget  Statement.  We  will

continue  with the Fifth Supplementary Estimates,  and  at

the  moment  of interruption we will extend whatever  time

that is lost.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think I have answered the Minister

for  Finance.  He  wants  to  know  whether  there  is   a

constitutional practice where the Minister is allowed half

an hour for a reply -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The whole of it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Well, the Ministerial bench. The answer is

no. There is no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1534</b></font><br><br>



such constitutional practice. All these things are made by

arrangement.  It  might well be that the Opposition  might

think  that even the time allotted by the Standing  Orders

is  such  that it is not sufficient for them  to  complete

what  they  want  to say and, therefore, insufficient  for

them  to give any time to The Ministerial bench to  answer

any  points they have made. That is left entirely  to  the

Opposition. If they want an answer to the points they have

made, then, of course, they should, of their own volition,

allow  certain time for Ministers of the Government  bench

to answer the points made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, notwithstanding the Standing Orders, the Fifth

Supplementary  Estimates of Expenditure of  the  State  of

Singapore  for 1961 (contained in Paper Cmd. 37  of  1961)

and  the resumed debate on the motion of the Minister  for

Finance relating to the financial policy of the year  1962

be taken today.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, do I now understand that

Standing Orders are suspended merely for the time that may

be  required between 3 p.m. and such time as we start  the

Budget debate - only that extra time?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Actually the Standing Orders have not yet

been  suspended  insofar as that aspect  of  the  case  is

concerned. The Standing Orders will be suspended between 7

p.m. and  7.30 p.m. The Leader of the House has given  an

undertaking that he will add to the time available for the

Budget  debate the time which is to be or may be taken  up

by consideration of the Fifth Supplementary Estimates.

<br><br>2.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Minister signify the

recommendation  of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  before  the

Committee  proceeds  with  the  consideration   of   these

Supplementary Estimates?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1535</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I so signify.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are now on the Fifth Supplementary

Estimates  of Expenditure for 1961 contained  in  Paper

Cmd. 37 of 1961. The summary is at page 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an amendment to Head 28 - Ministry of Finance

standing  in  the  name of the Member  for  Tanglin  in

relation to subhead 53. Dr Thio Chan Bee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 28 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 53.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not usual for Government to include an

item  involving such a huge sum as $80 million  in  the

Supplementary  Estimates. Naturally, Sir,  when  I  saw

this item, I wondered why the Minister for Finance  had

done so. When I read the explanation, I found it to  be

so meagre that I was left totally in the dark.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Then again with the Budget

Estimates  for  1962 coming up, one naturally  wondered

why  this  item could not have been included  in  those

Estimates. Therefore, we want the Minister for  Finance

to  clarify  the position and justify his  request  for

such  a big sum. We would like to know, Sir, why it  is

so  urgent that such a big sum must be included in  the

Supplementary Estimates. What are the schemes which are

so  urgent  for the money to be provided rightaway?  We

would  suggest that, in future, when requests are  made

for  such big sums, fuller explanations be given to the

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would also like to know from which unspent balance

this sum is going to be transferred.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must accept

responsibility  for the somewhat meagre explanation.  I

think  there  is a point in the criticism made  by  the

Member  for Tanglin. I must say I regret that a  fuller

explanation for asking this large amount was not  given

in the Command Paper.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1536</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say, however, that it is not true that this

thing  is not usual. I am speaking from memory,  but  I

think it was in the year 1954 or 1956 thereabouts  when

similar  transfers of sums were made from  the  revenue

balance  to  the  Development Fund.  Perhaps  I  should

explain  here  to Members who may not be familiar  with

financial  procedure that we keep Government monies  in

two  large  funds.  One is the Consolidated  Fund  into

which  all  revenues  are paid and  against  which  all

current  expenditure is charged. The other one  is  the

Development Fund which goes towards paying for projects

in  the  Four-Year  Development Plan  approved  by  the

Assembly.  The disbursement of money in the Development

Fund  is controlled by the Assembly itself, either year

by  year,  or  by Supplementary Estimates as  the  need

arises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, briefly, the position is this. When we draw up

the Four-Year Development Plan, we not only set out the

major  development projects which the  State  hoped  to

undertake in the course of the next four years, but  we

also  made  a  calculation of the resources  that  were

available  then for meeting this rather  large  sum  of

capital  expenditure. Copies of  this  blue  book  were

circulated to all Members in the House, and I  have  no

doubt  that  the  Member  for  Tanglin  has  diligently

perused  the  contents of this book. However,  I  would

like to refresh his memory on this point. In Chapter  V

of the Plan entitled "Financing the Plan", we described

various  sources  of  finance such  as  surpluses  from

current revenue, the present financial resources of the

Government, City Council Public Utilities, loans (World

Bank loans and loans raised locally), and so forth.  On

page  47,  you  will see a recapitulation of  resources

available  at that time. They included a transfer  from

the   Consolidated  Revenue  Account,  which   is   the

Consolidated Fund, of $57.2 million, a transfer of  $20

million  from the Contingency Fund/Advance Accounts,  a

sum  of $9.4 million from unexpended loan proceeds; and

on  another page we stated that local loans would  have

to  be raised of which about $50 million is expected to

be raised in the form of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1537</b></font><br><br>



Treasury  bills. So these are the sums roughly  calculated

in drawing up the Plan. These are the sums which represent

the financial resources initially available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you add the $57.2 million to be transferred from

the  Consolidated  Fund,  the $20 million  representing  a

running down of the Advance Accounts, and the $9.4 million

representing the unexpended loan proceeds, you will get  a

total  of,  I  make it, $87 million. Then, of  course,  we

wanted  to  keep  a  part of the loans  to  be  raised  on

Treasury  hills in long-term securities in the Development

Fund.  So  in  fact,  the  operation  to  be  carried  out

according  to  the Development Plan will  be  a  sum  much

higher  than $80 million. One of the reasons is  that  the

value of Treasury bills floated in the market has not been

as  much as we had hoped. So I limited this transfer  from

the  Consolidated  Fund  to the Development  Fund  to  $80

million.  Of course, this is rather necessary because  the

Development  Fund itself is running down in spite  of  the

fact  that we floated a loan of $50 million this year.  By

the end of this year, we have our payments for development

expenditure  out of this Development Fund. We  may  get  a

total of some $51 million as against $87 million which  we

started  with at the beginning of this year. So  with  the

transfer  of some $80 million to the Development Fund,  we

will  then get a fairly respectable figure of $171 million

roughly  for  the Development Fund for use next  year.  We

will be making transfers from the Consolidated Fund to the

Development Fund as and when the need arises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope my explanation is clear to the Member for Tanglin.

I  think  I do owe to Members of the House an apology  for

not setting it out in the Command Paper.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

refer  the  Minister  for  Finance  to  page  49  of   his

Development Plan. Paragraph 5.26 sets out the heads  under

which  he proposes to finance tile Plan. $871 million  was

the total required to finance the Plan of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1538</b></font><br><br>



which he hoped to get $116.1 million from Revenue Surplus.

Now  if  I understand Revenue Surplus correctly, it  means

money  saved from revenue. For the year 1961, there was  a

vote  of $30 million as contribution from revenue  to  the

Development  Fund.  In  the 1962  Estimates,  there  is  a

further sum of $30 million by way of contribution  to  the

Development Fund. $30 million plus $30 million  makes  $60

million.  Now  $80 million from current revenue  makes  it

$140  million. Do I understand the Minister  to  say  that

revenue has exceeded his most sanguine hopes when he hoped

to  finance the $871 million to the point of $116  million

from revenue'?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is not the

position.  When  we  said surplus here,  we  meant  really

surplus  after  the $30 million had been deducted  in  the

normal course of events in the ordinary Estimates, so that

to  realise the Plan, you would have to have a  series  of

Budget  surpluses  not only in Development,  but  also  in

Public Utilities, Harbour Board, and so on. Have I made my

point clear?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> As I understand it from the Minister for

Finance, of the $116.1 million which he hoped to get  from

Revenue  Surplus, the $80 million which he is  now  asking

the House would go towards part of that $116.1 million. He

is now asking the House to vote another $80 million to the

Development Fund. I take it it is from Revenue Surplus.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Perhaps he has got the book there. May

I refer him to page 47, paragraph 5.17?



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the third item of paragraph 5.17,

"Consolidated Revenue Account", there was to be a transfer

of  this amount because the Revenue Account (what you call

the  General  Revenue  Balance) was  substantial,  and  we

thought  we could write it down for development  purposes.

There is also a transfer of $20 million of the Contingency

Fund  into the Advance Account, because, in reviewing  the

various accounts, we found there was an over-provision and

we could safely reduce that amount



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1539</b></font><br><br>



by  $20  million.  Then there is the  "Unexpended  loan

proceeds"  which  is  still  in  the  General   Revenue

Balance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this roughly makes up the sum of $80 million. And,

of  course, we have floated Treasury bills, as we  have

said,  part  of which proceeds we want to  put  in  the

development fund.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Do I understand the Hon, the Minister for

Finance to say this: that this $80 million then is  the

sum  set out under "Consolidated Revenue Account  $57.2

million"  and  the  sum  set out  against  "Contingency

Fund/Advance   Accounts  $20  million",  making   $77.2

million.  That  is the amount he is now  asking  to  be

transferred to the Development Fund, and that this  $80

million  is not from any surplus revenue for  the  year

1961. Is that correct?



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just for further

clarification. In the Budget Estimates, page 8,  I  see

the  following particulars, "Deduct Deficit for  1961".

Just  one question, Sir. If there was not this item  of

$80  million to be transferred to the Development Fund,

would  that have altered the statement there,  so  that

instead of a deficit, there would have been a surplus?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> My recollection is this: it took

some  time  before we transferred this. My recollection

is that this is based on the Estimates presented to the

Assembly  last  year  plus  the  changes  allowed   for

increasing costs, variable allowances, and so on.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we hope that in

future  all these particulars will be included  in  the

Command Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the clarification given, I beg to withdraw

the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it the pleasure of hon. Members that

the amendment be withdrawn?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I was going to ask a further question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1541</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister for Finance has found it fit to refer to the

Barisan Sosialis in his speech on the financial policy

of the Government for the year 1962.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> You should have been honoured!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He has suggested that we should

not be unmindful of the hard economic facts facing the

people  of  Singapore. Sir, we are not only conversant

with the stern economic realities confronting us,  but

we  are  also acutely conscious of the need to put  up

with them and to make the best possible job of it.  We

are  well  aware of the entrepot nature of Singapore's

economy.   We   are   aware  of  Singapore's   growing

population.  We are aware and are keenly desirable  of

industrial peace, because this is closely tied up with

the  need for industrialisation upon which so much  of

our  population  would depend for  jobs  in  the  near

future. Sir, it is because of our consciousness of the

delicate  nature of our economy and the  magnitude  of

our  problem  we  have to face that we  feel  the  co-operation  of the entire people is a prerequisite  for

the success of any government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is here that I have to remind the P.A.P.

Government where they have blundered, namely, that  in

their  budgeting, in their taxation policy,  in  their

efforts to work out a policy of collection of revenue,

and  in  their  order  of  priorities  in  respect  of

expenditure of public needs, they do not seem to  have

taken  into  account the feelings and desires  of  the

people. Sir, it is here that we have to teach the P.A.P.

Government a simple but nevertheless grim fact amongst

all  other objective economic realities. That is, that

we have a politically conscious people and an educated

populace  who  could be persuaded to accept  policies,

and   even  hardships  that  may  follow  from   these

policies, if they are satisfied that Government is  in

sympathy  with  their basic problems and  aspirations.

Sir,  the  necessity of the people's  co-operation  is

fundamental,  especially when the people of  Singapore

are politically



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1542</b></font><br><br>



volatile.  I  would ask the Minister  for  Finance  to

remember  this reality. It is a particularly pertinent

reminder,   for   he  and  most  of  his   ministerial

colleagues  have  been  extremely  ham-fisted  in  the

application of their policies.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I must remind the Minister for

Finance that he cannot treat people like pawns on  the

chessboard, and that policies which hurt the people or

even  appear  to  do  so are ultimately  going  to  be

rejected by the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the speech of the Minister has given no great

comfort  to the people of Singapore. He justifies  his

proposed  Budget by the assertion that expenditure  on

various  items has been greater than that of preceding

years.  Sir, this is a rather naive way of  trying  to

get  acceptance of Government's financial policy.  Our

revenues  have  increased, and so expenditure  of  our

various  social  services has also increased  together

with the expenditure on various other items. There  is

nothing new or startling in this simple fact. There is

no  reason  for  the Minister for Finance  to  make  a

special point of it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I would.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, let me examine certain main

features  of the Minister's speech. The Minister  says

that  the  development expenditure for the  year  1961

would amount to $100-$110 million and, according to the

Minister,  this  is an all-time record  in  Singapore.

Sir, is this really true? I do not think he dares even

answer that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 8 of the Development Estimates for 1962, the

grand total for 1961 quoted for development was $166.2

million. Of this, how much is really going to be spent

by  the end of the year? The estimated expenditure  is

to  be  $107.8  million. Therefore, the Government  is

going  to  spend  only 65 per cent of  what  has  been

allocated  for  development. But, unfortunately,  even

this amount would not be spent. Of the $107.8 million.

$40 million is, in fact, a paper transfer. So actually

the amount to be spent by the end of 1962,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1543</b></font><br><br>



if  indeed  that amount will be spent, will  be  $107.8

million  minus $40 million, that is $67.8  million.  If

you  are  to  work  it out, this is only  41  per  cent

performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is interesting to note that this $67.8

million is much lower than the pre-P.A.P. years. It  is

much  lower  than what the Lim Yew Hock Government  had

spent. If you turn to page 25 of the Development  Plan,

Sir,   in   Table   2.11,  under  the  title   "Capital

Expenditure 1955-1960", you will see under column 1955,

(at  the  bottom  of  it); $89.2 million;  1956,  $83.9

million; 1957, $118.4 million; 1958, the figure is also

$118.4  million. But when it comes to  1959  and  1960,

there are only $73.5 million for 1959 and $66.6 million

for 1960.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Gob, point of elucidation, if it is

not too lengthy.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, Sir. I would ask the Member

whether  he  is  aware  that the total  he  is  reading

included   capital  expenditure  on  public  utilities,

transport  and communications - things like the railways,

the  Harbour Board, the power station and so on.  These

are   not  included  in  the  Government's  Development

Estimates. The grand total includes various items.  Let

us  take  the  first  two  lines  of  Table  2.11,  for

instance.  "Transport and Communications" includes  the

Telephone Board. We are spending millions of dollars on

such  items. "Public utilities" will include the  Power

Station  at  Pasir  Panjang. This  is  not  development

expenditure of the Central Government with which we are

concerned in the Development Estimates before  us.  You

are not comparing similar things.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> My colleague has pointed out to

me,  Sir,  that if you turn to the next page, at  Table

2.12,  the  amount  spent under the  Singapore  Harbour

Board  and  the  Singapore Telephone Board  is  only  a

comparatively small sum. Anyway, the point is that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1544</b></font><br><br>



the expenditure by the P.A.P. Government has fallen far

short of what it should have been.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Again, of the $67.8 million, which

I  mentioned a little while ago, $34 million is  to  be

spent on housing. Therefore, the actual amount spent on

social  services and public amenities is $67.8  million

minus $34 million; that is, $33.8 million, Sir. If  you

work  it  out,  Sir, this is only 25 per  cent  of  the

estimated expenditure. It is simple arithmetic. You  do

not have to be an economist to know all this.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

You should go back to medicine.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is time you learnt something,

my boy!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown should

talk  across the Chamber to the Speaker but not towards

the Government Benches.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> My apology, Sir. In the last

Budget, 1961 was to be called the year of construction.

We do not mind if slogans are used by political Parties

or  individuals  so  long  as  they  reflect  the  real

sentiments  or  the intentions of the  people  who  use

them. The year of construction! But has it really  been

so?  Can the P.A.P. Government stand up and say proudly

that it has been a year of construction?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On the contrary, Sir, this

assertion  about the year of construction is  a  dismal

failure. The people in the P.A.P. Government simply  do

not  mean  what they say. They are men who  believe  in

slick talk. They are men who believe that by the use of

attractive words and phrases they will be able  to  get

anything past the people. Sir, we had occasion in  this

Assembly  to mention that the first year of the  P.A.P.

was the year of excitement.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1545</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> There were many others. Most of

the  first year was spent by the Ministers in  throwing

their weight about.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> They saw themselves as a lot of

mighty  men who could get away with almost anything  on

earth - abuse  of civil servants, pay cuts, threats  and

insults  galore.  That was the essence  of  the  P.A.P.

Government  talk.  They became a lot  of  self-fancying

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second year, when they were running into

political  difficulties, when they realised  that  they

had  to  show  something for having been  elected  into

office,  they  called it the year of  construction.  We

have already said that it was more a year of confusion.

The  taxes  on petrol and tobacco, increased rents  and

numerous  other hardships brought them little sympathy.

Instead,  they persisted in their so-called tough  line

in  the  belief that everybody would support  them,  as

there was no other viable Left-wing force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Four-Year Development Plan was rushed

through  in view of the Hong Lim by-election. Sir,  any

plan that advances the interest of the people, any plan

that  brings  greater amenities and comforts,  must  be

supported.  Sir,  the  trade  unions  and  many  others

supported this plan. But it is one thing to draw  up  a

plan and another thing to implement it. The Government

had  to draw up the plan if only to prove to the people

of  Singapore that it was doing something for them. But

unfortunately, at the same time, it was  also  carrying

out  policies which made it difficult for  the  people,

especially for the poor men, in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall picture is as follows. The P.A.P. plans

to spend in the year of construction $166.4 million. Of

this  amount,  $40 million was to be  a  grant  to  the

Economic Development Board.

This  $40  million, we are told, is the  amount  spent.

But,  in fact, it is a mere paper transfer. It has only

been effected on paper. It has not been translated into

terms of actual development. That is, it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1546</b></font><br><br>



has not been used for the purpose it was given. Nothing

of  this  money has been spent in the sense  used.  The

money re-means invested in Britain. The only difference

is  that, instead of this money being held in the  name

of  the Accountant-General, it is now probably held  in

the  name of the Economic Development Board. Therefore,

to  get  a correct measure of the achievements  of  the

P.A.P. in its so-called year of construction, one  has

to  deduct  the $40 million which is still invested  in

Britain. You will therefore see, Mr Speaker, that only

$67.8  million would be used by the end  of  the  year,

giving  the P.A.P. Government approximately  a  41  per

cent  fulfilment. Is this not a true reflection of what

has been carried out by the Government? As I have said,

Mr  Speaker, of this $67.8 million, $34 million was  a

grant to the Housing Development Board. Even if we  are

to  assume that all the money has been used or will  be

used  by the end of the year, the achievements  of  the

P.A.P.,  in services other than public housing,  are  a

complete and utter failure.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Why?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Of the $92.2 million budgeted for

use in 1961, only $33.8 million is expected to be used.

That  is,  calculated at the very most, a 37  per  cent

fulfilment  of  what was expected.  By  any  test,  Mr

Speaker, this is a failure. Any honest government  will

admit that it is a failure.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Member for

Queenstown  should  provoke the  Ministerial  bench  by

pointing  at them. I think if he points at the Speaker,

the  Speaker will be quite happy. He is allowed  to  do

so.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I do not mind it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will bear that in mind, Sir.

Here  we  have a steady record of under-fulfilment  and

continuing under-fulfilment. But skilful Ministers with

their  ingenuity are able to find words  to  hide  this

failure,  words that make unprecedented  failures  into

all-time records of success.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1547</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, by the end of this month, which

brings  to  an end this so-called year of construction,

the P.A.P. Government can show only meagre efforts that

do  not deserve the praise of anyone. The fact is  that

the P.A.P. in 1961 has failed, and failed dismally.  In

1959,  when the P.A.P. took office, there was a  collapse

of   development   expenditure.  The  Government   and

statutory bodies spent $45 million less than  in  1958,

when the Labour Front was in office. This can easily be

seen  from the Development Plan, page 25. You take  the

columns  1958 and 1959. Subtract 73.5 from  118.4,  and

you  get 45. If you go further from the figure  in  the

1960 estimates, you will see that only $11.1 million of

the  $41.7 million was spent. This only constitutes  21

per  cent of the development expenditure in 1959.  Most

of  this  was  probably spent before  the  P.A.P. took

office.  In 1960, the supposed year of construction  of

the P.A.P., development expenditure was supposed to  be

$105.8  million.  That can be seen in  the  Development

Budget  of  1960, page 467. State Development Projects - $105.8  million.  The 1961 Estimates presented  to  the

House  are very significantly silent on the performance

of  1960. There is no column, Sir, which gives you  the

expenditure for 1960. We have been told of acute needs.

One   has  only  to  read  the  first  chapter  of  the

Government Four-Year Development Plan to see that  year

after year, very little has happened. All we get is how

much better than others the P.A.P. is in doing nothing.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> All that has happened is that our

investments in Britain are increasing. Money  belonging

to  the people is used in Britain for housing and other

social  and  economic purposes, and all our people  get

are  words, words and more words. At the end  of  1958,

the  Singapore Government's Sterling Securities in  the

Surplus



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1548</b></font><br><br>

Financial   Statements  for   the   year   1958,   page

15 - "Surplus Funds Sterling Securities - $70,663,941.04".

At the end of 1959, Sir, it has risen to $93.6 million.

Development  fund investments in Britain had  increased

by $46.1 million. Our investments in Britain doubled in

1959.

Minister. I refer you, Sir, to the Financial Statements

for  the  year 1959, pages 44 and 48. At page  44,  you

will  see at the bottom of the right-hand column  $93.5

million;  and on page 48, at the bottom of the  column,

$46  million.  In  1960 and 1961, the  P.A.P. went  on

investing  in  Britain.  I will  be  surprised  if  the

investment  from these two funds alone is  not  between

$250 million and $300 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What were the P.A.P. election promises on this

matter, Sir? Let me quote The Tasks Ahead, Part 1, page

25:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A P.A.P. government will make sure that a part of

Singapore  investments  in foreign  countries  will  be

channelled back into local industrial development.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not only have they not got back the money, but

more  has  been sent away. How has this  been  done?  A

large  part of this has been borrowed from the  public,

particularly the workers, at low interest and  sent  to

England to earn higher interest?

bankruptcy of the P.A.P., and this bankruptcy  is  even

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - the policy statement of the P.A.P.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, aside from certain information

given  to  us  by  the Minister for Finance  about  the

status of pioneer industries, one does not hear a  word

of what the Government has done to encourage investment

from  local resources. It has been a cardinal principle

of  the P.A.P.'s election platform to try and encourage

investment  in  industries from capital available  from

local sources. Let me quote again The Tasks Ahead, Part

1,  page  25 - I will read this little bit;  it  is  very

interesting:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The P.A.P. profoundly disagrees that the survival of

Singapore  depends  on  foreign  capital  and   foreign

capitalists.  We say that there are more than  adequate

capital  resources initially available locally. Indeed,

the  position is that large sums of local  capital  are

being   invested   in  foreign  countries,   often   in

unprofitable investments. The total amount of Singapore

capital invested by banks, insurance companies, central

government, local authorities and the public boards  is

not  known with certainty. It is probably in the region

of $800,000,000. It is absolute



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1550</b></font><br><br>



nonsense to say that our survival depends on foreigners

when  so much of our own capital is invested in foreign

countries.'



<br><br>And one more paragraph, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Foreign business concerns which wish to establish

factories   in   Singapore  will  be  given   all   the

encouragement and assistance they need. We  shall  give

them  guarantees  in  regard to  security  of  capital,

remittance  of  dividends and other matters  which  all

modern governments regard as normal practice. But  [and

this  is the significant paragraph] it would be foolish

to  imagine that, whatever we do, foreign capital  will

come in on the scale needed to solve our problems.  Our

salvation lies in our own hands.'



<br><br>I will finish the paragraph, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There are no benevolent foreigners knocking around

the  world,  anxious  to  discharge  these  duties  and

responsibilities which are rightly our own. Let us  not

face  the economic problems in the era of freedom  with

the mental attitudes appropriate to colonial servitude.

Let   us  never  forget  that  self-government  is  not

possible  without self-reliance. This is true  both  in

politics as well as in economics.'



<br><br>That is the quotation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what has the Government done to encourage local

business  to  invest in industry? There is  hardly  any

mention of this fact in the speech of the Minister  for

Finance. Are we to understand that the P.A.P. no longer

believes  that  capital for investment is  to  be  made

available from local sources?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Budget that has been presented to us here

has been a balanced one. Government is not expected  to

have  a deficit and, in fact, deficit financing is  not

part  of  Government's policy. In fact, I will even  go

further and say that with savings that would be made in

each Ministry every year we would again have a surplus.

Sir,  being  in this comfortable position of  having  a

surplus,  I  would  urge  that  the  Government  should

concentrate  on  providing  greater  amenities  to  the

poorer  sections  of the community - water,  electricity,

health  services  to the city population,  and  similar

amenities and better transport facilities to the  rural

population. We have been told that development projects

have  been  held  back  because  of  the  shortage   of

engineers, architects and quantity surveyors. Sir,  the

P.A.P. suffered  a loss of trained personnel  when  it

came  into  office. A greater loss was  suffered  as  a

result of the cut in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1551</b></font><br><br>



variable  allowances which was, Sir, a naive  political

gimmick on the part of the Minister for Finance  trying

to  convince  the people of Singapore  that  the  upper

strata  of the civil service were overpaid. Sir,  I  do

not wish to enter into arguments about whether they are

or  they are not overpaid, but the simple fact is that,

as  a  result,  we have had a shortage of  technicians,

which  in  turn has affected our development programme.

In  other  words,  it is the workers and  the  ordinary

people  of Singapore who have suffered from this  blind

and  narrow-minded policy effected by the Minister  for

Finance who was himself once a civil servant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has admitted that

delays  in implementing the development programme  have

been due to the shortage of these architects, engineers

and  quantity  surveyors. He should have  foreseen  the

result of his own actions. He should have foreseen that

the  people of Singapore are the ones who would  suffer

by  this naive and shortsighted policy of his. He is  a

man  who  talks  about realities and  he  has  shown  a

complete  lack  of a sense of realism in  his  previous

conduct.  Only  now,  Sir, is  there  some  glimmer  of

responsibility and realism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> After you have left them!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am glad, as said by the Member

who  interjected, that we in the Barisan Sosialis  have

compelled  him  to  move in the direction  of  realism.

Similarly, we note the sort of delays and inadequacy in

the  Ministry  of Health resulting in under-expenditure - something like $3.7 million less than the Estimates. I

am  glad  to note that the Minister for Finance  admits

that  this  is  principally due to  unfilled  posts - the

senior and ancillary grades.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this situation would never have arisen if the

Government  had adopted a more enlightened policy  from

the  beginning and had foreseen the effects of the  pay

cuts upon the civil servants. The P.A.P. is supposed to

be a socialist Government. But a socialist government,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1552</b></font><br><br>



Sir, is sensitive to the feelings of trade unions.  Yet

not   the   slightest  respect  was  shown  to   unions

representing the civil servants. But the end result  of

it all was that, in the case of the Ministry of Health,

doctors   and  nurses  left  the  medical  service   in

substantial numbers, causing serious dislocations  from

time   to  time.  I  am  glad  to  say  that  the   ex-Parliamentary Secretary and ex-Political  Secretary  to

the    Minister   for   Health   had   made    repeated

representations  to  the  Government  to   revise   its

attitude  and  improve  the  terms  and  conditions  of

service  of the staff in the medical service. But  this

probably  only met with increasing resistance from  the

Minister for Finance.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I never refused them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Fortunately, political events have

driven  the Government into a position where it is  now

compelled  to  revise  its whole thinking  towards  the

civil  service.  Sir,  we are proud  to  say  that  the

representations   of  the  Barisan  Sosialis   to   the

Government have had a salutary effect.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Government that once condemned

the  civil  service  in  the most  vulgar  tones  today

literally -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> On bended knees.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - bends backwards to please the

civil  service.  We  are glad that at  last  our  civil

servants have been restored their self-respect. We  are

glad   that  the  Government  has  been  startled  into

realising the folly of its past ways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not my intention to dwell at any length on

the policy speech of the Minister for Finance. It is  a

rather  colourless speech and there is nothing  in  the

Budget that can possibly generate enthusiasm. It is  as

flat and stale - if I may say so, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> As the speech we are listening to now.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - he knows it for the State of

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister is getting too

excited. I do not think that is a point of order. It is

perhaps  a  hope expressed by the Member for Queenstown

that  the  Minister for Finance has presented his  last

Budget. That is all. It might not be realised.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No, but he went further. He said

that  I  said  it may be my last Budget. I had  assumed

that  the hon. Member was literate and could understand

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On page 26, the fifth paragraph,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> So what?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Please quote the exact paragraph

carefully and slowly so that we will understand what is

being said.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It says here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Speaker, Sir, this may be the last Budget of the

State of Singapore under its present Constitution as  a

self-governing State.'



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> There is nothing about me.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is little wonder, Sir, that the

Minister  for  Finance himself should  show  so  little

interest in the whole matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would ask the Minister to, consider carefully

the question of reducing rents and of spending more  on

public  amenities so that the larger  sections  of  the

community  may  benefit by this expenditure  of  public

funds.  As I have said, there is no fear of our running

into a deficit. Even if this concentration of assisting

the lower income groups of our society should entail  a

little  mare generous policy to the professional groups

of  our  society who will assist us in our  development

plans,  then  I think this should be done.  For,  after

all, development is of basic interest to the people and

this  should  be  carried out in the swiftest  possible

time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Government has given a name to its first year  term  of

office. They call its first year term of office a  year

of consolidation, its second year term of office a year

of  construction.  But in the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's

speech and in the Budget Statement, it is strange  that

the  Government did not give a name to its  third  year

term of office.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1555</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The year of the dead rat!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> This year has been a year of

construction. But I would beg leave to call  its  third

year term of office a year of contraction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> Liquidation!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Not so fast. It was consolidation

and construction, and now it is contraction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, exactly a year ago, when we debated

the  second Budget policy of this Government,  we  went

into some trouble. But I hope, after all these disputes

and adversities of the Government, it has learnt to  be

more tolerant to our comments and sound criticisms. No

doubt  our  criticisms last year  on  the  Government's

Budget policy were valid because due to our criticisms,

many  of the taxes which were to be imposed were  never

imposed  at  all.  The business registration  tax,  the

profession-al  tax  and a few other  minor  taxes  were

never carried out. The pay cuts were restored.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps it is pertinent at this juncture for me

to  make  a brief comment on the financial and economic

policies of this Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will talk about the fiscal policies of this

Government.  From  the beginning  when  the  Government

assumed  office, it was quite clear to us that  it  was

bent  on  a  taxation policy of soaking the  poor.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, we have a very good economist who  never

bothers  to  take  advice from his  colleagues  on  his

financial policies, and that is why he lands himself in

such a mess today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many of the measures introduced - the

taxes  introduced - were to soak the rich, were  to  soak

the poor. [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That is right!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> For instance, the petrol tax, the

cigarettes tax, the lotteries tax, which were meant for

the  very poor classes of our community. The pay  cuts,

the increase in registration



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1556</b></font><br><br>



fees  of twakohs, and several other taxes - the business

registration  tax - are meant for the lower middle  class

and the middle class.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned in my speech last year - I crave

indulgence  to repeat a small section of  what  I  said

last year [Hansard, 8th December, 1960, col. 101]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Speaker, Sir, the taxation policy of this

Government  has been calculated to tax  the  people  of

Singapore  for  the benefit of foreign business.  Since

June 1959, this Government has introduced 12 new taxes.

In  the 1961 Budget these 12 new taxes in my estimation

will  yield  approximately $45 million. Most  of  these

millions  will  be squeezed, cent by  cent,  dollar  by

dollar, from the poor, from the wage earners, from  the

shopkeepers,  from the taxi-drivers  and  the  hawkers,

from  the  working population, from the  small  private

companies run by local merchants. An estimated $100,000

out  of  the  $45 million is all the contribution  this

Government has asked from the big European firms  which

control our economy and make most of the profits. These

European firms in my opinion make at least half of  the

profits of Singapore, and are asked by this [so-called]

"Socialist" Government to contribute less  than  1  per

cent of the $45 million; to be exact .002 per cent.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is, in essence, the taxation policy of this

Government.  During  the past 2½ years,  its  taxation

policy  was a failure and that is why now it  dare  not

introduce  any more new taxes. Its economic policy  was

also  a  failure. We see very few industries being  set

up.  We see the growing problem of unemployment. We see

a  shrinking  economy, and that is partly  due  to  the

failings of the financial and economic policies of  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the P.A.P. assumed office, we were faced with a

deflationary situation, i.e. business was bad and

economic conditions were bad. Normally, during such

times, what the government should do is not to impose

any new taxes but to use whatever reserves it has - up to

a reasonable safe margin - and spend it on capital

projects or other projects. Because the Minister for

Finance refused to give the money, and I cannot print

the currency notes myself -

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You chased away all the

architects!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1557</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will come to

the point of architects later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of not imposing new taxes and investing more

in  the  economy and encouraging the volume of spending

in  the country, what the Government did was to squeeze

more  from  the  public, particularly from  the  poorer

sections  of the community to whom one cent means  one

cent.  And on top of that, to stop spending.  We  could

see, during the first two years before the Hong Lim  by

election, there was very little construction - not  to

say S.I.T. houses, but schools and other projects which

were  very  few.  The  Hong  Lim  by-election  was  the

watershed of Government's economic and fiscal policies.

Only  then did it realise that it had made mistakes  in

those policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to explain, briefly, the

effect   of  the  failing  of  the  policies   of   the

Government. For instance, if a taxi-driver earns $200 a

month  and  if  the Government takes $20 from  him,  he

would  have  $20 less to spend. This would  affect  the

hawkers  and  would,  in  turn,  affect  the  vegetable

farmers, the shopkeepers and the wholesale dealers. The

reaction   would  be  more  than  the  $20  which   the

Government   is  taking  from  the  poor   taxi-driver.

Instead, the Government, in addition to that, not  only

imposes   a   tax  on  the  poor,  but  also  restricts

additional  expenditure on the building of  houses  and

schools.  For  instance, if the  Government  had  spent

money  on  the  building of houses, schools  and  other

capital projects, this money would have been circulated

in  the community. There would have been more jobs  for

the unemployed. The unemployed would have been able  to

buy  more vegetables so that the money would go to  the

hawkers  and  shops,  and more money  would  have  been

circulated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not all. In addition what the Minister for

Finance  did was to borrow, and borrow at  6  per  cent

interest; and if I am not wrong, just keep the money in

the bank.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You are wrong. Sir, on a point of

elucidation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1558</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> If things were as bad as he made

out - that everyone is suffering - could he explain why

tax  returns  are  better this year than  expected -  in

revenue, income tax, customs and excise? I have spent a

long  time in my Budget speech to say that 1960  was  a

good year. How does he reconcile that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these are the

normal tricks of a statistician, and as an accountant I

will expose that trick.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Do it now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Here is page 13 of his speech:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The 1961 revenue position is satisfactory. The yield

from  most  of  the  main  items  of  revenue  exceeded

expectations.  1960 by all accounts must  have  been  a

good  business  year,  for the yield  from  Income  Tax

surpassed  the  estimated amount of $75 million  by  $5

million.'



<br><br>Very  impressive, Mr Speaker, Sir,It  would  be  even

more impressive if, in last year's Budget, the Minister

for  Finance  did  not  put $75 million  but  just  $10

million. Then it would be surpassed by $70 million.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That is your logic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Yes. The normal Budget that is

presented year after year since 1945 has been presented

in  the  same  way - always  under-estimate  revenue  and

always over-estimate expenditure. Year after year,  the

income  tax  yield  will be more  than  what  has  been

estimated.  Expenditure will always be less  than  what

has been estimated and provided for in the Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Can the Member explain why there

were  more  cargoes and more ships, and more trade  was

done? [Interruption]

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1559</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for

Finance should have asked another question: why  should

there  be  more children? Business is bad. A  four  per

cent  increase. Sir, these are normal increases in  our

economy.  There is no need even for this Government  to

stay  on. Still there would be increases. Because there

are more people in the world, more cargoes are carried,

more  ships  pass  by to get water, so  there  will  be

increases.  Let  us  look at  page  10  of  the  Budget

Statement, paragraph 2:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Now to turn to the general economic picture of the

State.  The value of Singapore's trade in 1961 has  not

been as large as that of the previous year.'



<br><br>Is that sufficient?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Go on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For the first three-quarters of 1961, the value of

our  total trade amounted to $5,473 million as compared

with $5,700 million last year.'



<br><br>$5,473  million  as  compared  with  $5,700  million - a

decrease of about 7½ per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Our imports fell by $72 million and, more seriously,

our exports by $155 million.'



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, on a point of elucidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> If the trade would increase

because   of  population  growth - we  had  a  population

growth -  how  was it that trade increased  in  1961  as

compared with 1960?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are two

reasons. One reason was as the Minister for Finance has

said - the price of rubber went down. The second reason

was  the  failing of the Government's economic  policy.

The  government  did  not  do  whatever  it  could   to

encourage  more  trade to come in from  Indonesia,  the

Federation of Malaya, and the surrounding territories.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> We have more trade from Indonesia.

You cannot ignore that fact.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government

has failed in its fiscal and economic policies. Has  it

been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1560</b></font><br><br>



successful in its policy of industrialisation? We  all

know  of  the complete flop of the Industrial Promotion

Board.  I  think we must pass a law to make  sure  that

persons  who  are to promote industries must  at  least

have  the  minimum practical experience  of  running  a

small kachang puteh shop.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, armchair theoreticians who do not

know  how  to operate a cash register are not good  for

the  promotion  of industries. In my  view,  there  are

three basic conditions for the industrialisation  of  a

country.  First of all, we must have the  entrepreneurs

and  skilled labour. Second, we must have the available

capital.  And third, we must have a wide enough  market

for  the goods to be sold. In this respect, it must  be

admitted that Hongkong was and is in a better and  more

advantageous  position  than Singapore.  On  the  first

condition of skilled entrepreneurs and skilled workmen,

Hongkong has an advantage of having an influx of people

from  Shanghai,  which  is  an  industrially  developed

country, and other cities of China when the Nationalist

regime  fell  in China. These people went to  Hong-Kong

with  their  available  capital. The  entrepreneurs  in

Singapore   are   not   industrial  entrepreneurs   but

commercial  entrepreneurs.  It  is  very  difficult  to

convince  the commercial entrepreneurs, who want  quick

returns, to invest their money in industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the second problem is the question

of  capital.  We know there is enough capital  in  this

country  to start new industries. As a matter of  fact,

much  of  this capital has gone over to the Federation,

or   even   overseas,  to  be  invested  in  commercial

enterprises or stocks and shares. There is no  shortage

of  capital  in  Singapore to be  channelled  into  any

industrial  enterprises,  if sufficient  inducement  is

given..



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, it is the question of market. Unless

there is a sufficiently big market for the sale of  our

manufactured  products,  few  industries   will   start

enterprises  in  Singapore. If an  industry  starts  in

Malaya,  it is assured of at least an eight million  to

ten  million population as its market. But if the  same

industry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1561</b></font><br><br>



is operated in Singapore, it can be assured of only two

or three million population as its market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has not been successful in its

common  market  talks. During the  merger  debate,  the

Government  has  not  convinced us that  its  so-called

merger  proposals  will  bring  the  common  market  to

fruition.  We  hope that later, when the  Minister  for

Finance  gives  his reply, he will  tell  us  what  has

happened  to the common market proposals in  the  White

Paper. Will there be a common market?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, three basic conditions are necessary for the

successful operation of industries. Firstly,  available

capital.  What has the Government done?  Has  it  done

anything to induce it to go into these industries?  No.

Secondly,  a  common  market. Has the  Government  been

successful in achieving a common market? As far  as  we

can  see,  also no. Thirdly, skilled entrepreneurs  and

skilled  workmen.  Has the Government  been  trying  to

obtain  skilled entrepreneurs and skilled workmen  from

other  places  in order to fill the gap?  Mr  Speaker,

Sir, it is no use telling a businessman who has been  a

commission agent or who runs a trading house to start a

factory   because  he  does  not  know  how  a  factory

operates.  The  Government must provide  him  with  the

requisite  industrial entrepreneurs and  the  requisite

skilled  workmen - at  least the  foreman - to  start  the

factory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Government has done is not industrialisation

but  producing  paper  plans, blue  prints  and  United

Nations missions. I do not say they are valueless. But

too   many  missions  without  practical  results,   or

fantastic schemes like the iron and steel mill  do  not

lead us anywhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a known fact that if we can

have   a   steel  mill  in  Singapore,  we  can  create

employment for perhaps 80,000 people. That is more than-the   figure  of  the  present  unemployed  and

under-employed.  But  let us face facts. Is a  steel  mill  a

reality? Can it be successful? Mr Speaker, Sir,  where

are we going to get the coal? Is it from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1562</b></font><br><br>



Indonesia? Where can we get the iron ore? Is  it  from

Kota Tinggi?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Singapore!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Pardon?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Where are we going to get the iron

ore? Kota Tinggi is the nearest place. But we know that

the  transport cost of taking iron ore from Kota Tinggi

to  Jurong  in  Singapore or even from  Batu  Pahat  to

Jurong would be not much less than taking it from there

to  Japan  where steel mills have been established  for

ages  and where the operation, cost is cheap.  They  do

not have to spend $800 million or a few hundred million

dollars  on the steel mill. Mr Speaker, Sir, where  is

the  coal?  Indonesia?  How  much  would  it  cost   to

transport  a ton of coal from Indonesia for  the  steel

furnace  in  Jurong?  Even if we  can  overcome  these

difficulties - of iron, coal, water supply,  electricity

supply, skilled mechanics - even if all the problems  can

be overcome, Mr Speaker, Sir, where is the market? Are

we  going  to sell our steel plates and steel  wire  to

Australia  where there is a big mill, the Broken  Hills

Proprietary Ltd. They are exporting steel to us. Are we

going  to sell the steel to India, when at present  the

Tata Mills are selling to us? Are we going to sell  the

steel to the Yawata Mills of Japan? Or are we going  to

sell  the steel to the steel mills in Anshan in  China?

Mr  Speaker. Sir, except for the Federation of Malaya,

I do not see any sources or any place which is going to

buy  our  steel. The Federation of Malaya and Singapore

together are not a big enough market for a steel  mill.

What   should  be  done  is  that,  instead  of  having

preposterous  schemes,  we should  come  down  to  hard

facts,  we should come down to earth, and the practical

realities  of industrialisation. Concentrate  on  small

industries - cottage industry, small industry or  medium

industry. But not on gigantic proposals as steel mills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government's taxation policy

has  been  a failure. The Government's economic  policy

has  been a failure. The Government's industrialisation

policy has also been a failure.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1563</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we will now come to the architects.

In  the  1961 Budget, at page 23 of the transcript,  on

housing, the Minister for Finance said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The number of homes expected to be completed this

year is therefore 7,454. The Board expects to meet  its

future target of 10,000 homes a year well in advance of

its  time-table. The end of next year will see the  end

of the long and frustrating years of waiting for decent

homes  by more than 10,000 families on the register  of

applicants.  Some  have waited for six  or  even  eight

years.  By next year there will be a home for each  one

of  these families, and at rents they can afford.  This

is  a  record  achievement in the provision  of  public

housing  and can be claimed as a major success  of  the

P.A.P.  Government. The achievement  is  all  the  more

remarkable  if  we bear in mind that  the  Housing  and

Development  Board had to start with what was  left  of

the wreckage of the former S.I.T.'



<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir,  I

must  admit that the only sphere of public construction

where  the Government has been successful in  the  past

one year or since the Hong Lim by-election has been  in

the construction of S.I.T. flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the Four-Year Plan. Mr Speaker, Sir,

according  to  the  Four-Year Plan,  at  page  35,  the

Government  has provided $206.86 million for  1961.  In

the  Budget speech of the Minister for Finance, he says

that  in  1961  the Government will spend only  between

$100  and $110 million. Mr Speaker, Sir, $110  million

out  of  $206 million. This is about half  of  it.  The

Government can spend only half of what it has provided.

Now,  Sir,  this  is  a  very clear  example  that  the

Government  cannot satisfactorily carry out the  public

projects it has announced. The only sphere of operation

where  it  was  relatively  successful  was  in  public

housing.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I rather suspect that Members have

not understood the figures with which they are dealing.

May  I  explain that the $206.86 million on page 35  of

the Development Plan refers to development projects  in

the  whole  State,  including those undertaken  by  the

public utilities, such as electricity, water, gas,  the

Telephone Board, the Harbour



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1564</b></font><br><br>



Board  and so on? What we are discussing now  are  the

Government's  Development  Estimates.  They   are   two

different  things. I pointed this out when  the  Member

for  Queenstown raised some queries. I think the Member

for Hong Lim too has fallen into the same error.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if we deduct those

items  which  the Minister for Finance has stated  just

now,  I  think it will come to about $166 million.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, it must be admitted that housing has been

quite successfully completed in 1961 by the Government.

Why  is this so? Just now the Minister said that  there

were  no architects. Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that

the main architects who are now building houses for the

Government are the architects I recruited when  I  took

over  the  S.I.T.  The basic plans which  they  are  at

present working on are about the same basic plans, with

some  slight  alterations here and there, which  I  and

those architects drafted in the early days.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You chased them away!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> We did not run away. The Minister

for  Labour and Law ran away from Hong Lim.  He  forgot

about it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I never ran away from Hong Lim.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Sir, we prepared the basic plans,

the  basic  organisation  and machinery  on  which  the

present Government can build those houses.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Do you believe that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are known for

our  targets. We never failed to reach our  targets  in

the  City Council in the 15 months of our history.  The

Government has never successfully completed any of  its

projects, even in housing, which is 7,454 out of 10,000

units expected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are glad this Government is not

imposing any more taxes for 1962. We are also glad  the

Government  has  seen its errors  and  has  decided  to

withdraw the business registration tax and other taxes.

But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1565</b></font><br><br>



we  feel  that  these  measures in themselves  are  not

sufficient.  Sir, we feel that there are many  measures

which  the Government must take to remedy the  mistakes

they  have made during the past two years. We feel that

the Government's promise of a $1 million scheme for the

taxi-drivers  which  they themselves  promised  because

they  said the scheme was to take the place of  coupons

should  lx, immediately instituted. We wish  that  the

Government will also consider the reduction of  hawkers

licence  fees, which should not be a source of revenue,

but  should  only  be  for purposes  of  administrative

control.   There  are  many  other  taxes   which   the

Government has imposed during its two years of  office.

We  hope  the Minister for Finance will review some  of

them and see what measures can be taken to rectify some

of the mistakes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we also hope that in the

construction  of  these S.I.T. houses  (the  Government

have  said that these will be constructed at rents that

people  can afford), they will carry out what has  been

promised,  because,  as far as we  know,  many  of  the

present  flats are being offered to the public  at  too

high  rents. If I am not mistaken, there are still many

flats at present vacant and the Government is going out

of  its way to offer them to other applicants. Sir,  we

hope   the   Government  will  not  only  introduce   a

standstill  Budget, but will take certain  measures  to

rectify some of its past mistakes.



<br><br>4.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the first time

the Government has presented to the House an integrated

Budget.  When  I  say an integrated Budget,  I  mean  a

Budget  which  concerns  not  only  what  normally   is

accepted  as  Government items but also includes  items

which  were  in the City Council Budget. Unfortunately,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, as the Water, Gas  and  Electricity

Departments,  being  the  trading  departments,   still

remain  technically and legally with the City  Council,

it  has  not been possible for the Minister to  include

them in the State



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1566</b></font><br><br>



Budget. However, I have been trying to find out whether

the  City  Council has published its 1962  Budget.  The

sources  of  my information - I hope they are  correct,

Mr  Speaker, Sir - say that such a budget has not  yet

been  published. I hope I am right in that  surmise.  I

was hoping, Mr Speaker, Sir, that something would have

been said by the City Council on what it is going to do

for  the  year 1962, because, in my opinion,  what  the

City  Council  does  in the matter of  electricity  and

water  is particularly pertinent to what the Government

hopes  to  achieve  in the years  1962  and  1963,  and

thereafter in matters of industrialisation, housing and

such other public projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government hopes to start its Jurong project, if

I remember correctly, sometime towards the end of 1962.

It  thinks  something  in the way of  industrialisation

should be started in Jurong. If I remember the Minister

for Finance correctly, his scheme for Jurong was that a

steel  mill  would initially be established and  around

that a steel mill would centre private enterprise which

would  base its activities on the products of the  mill

itself.  I understand, Mr Speaker, Sir, that before  a

steel mill can operate satisfactorily, it needs quite a

supply   of  water.  Unless  this  supply  is   readily

available, and available on all possible occasions - whether it is a dry spell or a wet spell - the activities

of  this mill cannot be carried on. If ever a period of

months during the year the mill had to cease to operate

because  of  a water shortage, the whole project  would

become  uneconomic. Therefore, it is pertinent to  know

what  the  Government intends to do in  the  matter  of

water  supply. I believe water and electricity are  now

the  ministerial responsibility of the Hon, the  Prime

Minister. I hope he will, in his reply, tell the  House

what is Government's intention. If I remember correctly

again,  Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister, in answer

to one of the questions put in this House, said that it

was  the  intention of Government to go to  the  Scudai

River  before it goes to the Johore River and  that  it

hopes to spend $20 million on the Scudai River



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1567</b></font><br><br>



scheme, as a result of which it hopes to bring water to

Singapore within two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is unfortunate that that scheme is

not  in  the  Budget. If it had been in the  Budget  it

would  have  been  subject  to  the  scrutiny  of   the

Estimates  Committee where the whole scheme could  have

been carefully examined on the basis of whether it was,

in  fact, necessary for such a scheme to be implemented

before the Government goes to the Johore River. I  have

a little

experience of these matters, Mr Speaker, Sir,  and  my

own  considered opinion is that it is an absolute waste

of  public  money  to go to Scudai now  and  spend  $20

million there, while going to Johore at the same  time.

I  sincerely hope that before the Government embarks on

such  a  scheme, it will reconsider the position.  From

the  point of view of the Opposition - at least from  the

point  of  view  of the Alliance - I  hope  it  will  be

possible  for the Government to consult the  Opposition

before it embarks on such a scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, part of our trouble over the water

supply  has  been due to the fact that during  the  dry

weather the flow of these rivers dries up. We get quite

a  bit  of our supply from the Tebrau River. Now,  when

the  dry weather sets in, the flow of the Tebrau  River

comes  almost to a standstill, and naturally  water  is

scarce.  Scudai,  Mr Speaker, Sir, is  another  stream

which is subject to a dry weather flow. During the  wet

weather,  of course, it runs fast and high. But  during

the  dry seasons, it runs dry and slow. I am suggesting

to  the  Government that the water supply of  Singapore

should not be dependent on streams which are subject to

a  dry weather flow. The expert advice is that if we go

to  Johore  even  at  its  driest,  it  will  carry   a

sufficient capacity for it to give a sufficient  supply

of water to Singapore, both for domestic and industrial

uses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the City Council would have gone to the Johore

River  long ago, but unfortunately it was not  possible

for  the City Council to do so because the Johore River

Scheme was then centred



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1568</b></font><br><br>



in  an  area  which  was subject to  military  control.

Because of Communist and other activities in that area,

the  City  Council was not allowed to go  in  there  to

carry  out the scheme. When it became possible to carry

out  the  Johore River Scheme, the Council had  already

embarked  on  Tebrau, and, therefore, was committed  to

Tebrau.  Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, let us  not  make

the  same mistake - it was not a mistake then. We had  to

do  it  then. Let us therefore not go to Scudai now  to

supplement Tebrau and then go to Johore which will give

us  a full supply all the time for all the years yet to

come.  I  do  hope, Mr Speaker, Sir, that  before  the

Government goes to Scudai, it will consider the  scheme

very  carefully before it spends $20 million on such  a

scheme  which eventually must come to nought after  the

Johore River Scheme has come to fruition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to hear from the

Minister for Finance what definite plans the Government

has  afoot  in the matter of going to the Johore  River

for  a  supply of water. My own information, Sir,  for

what  it  is  worth - it may be incorrect - is  that  the

Government  is not ready even now on the  Johore  River

Scheme. It is still floundering. Did it sent the  Water

Engineer  to  Europe to look for water or to  look  for

money. I think it might have done better for itself  if

it had sent him to the Johore River to see how best and

how  quickly  he  could  carry  out  that  scheme.  Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   if  the  Government   is   sincerely

interested  in  getting water from  Johore  within  two

years, I will tell the Government how to do it. It  can

be done.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It can be done, Sir. This is not a joke.

There are people in Singapore who have told me they can

bring  water  into Singapore within two years  if  only

they  go to the proper quarters. The people who are  in

charge  of the water supply of Singapore know  it,  but

will  not go to them for that advice and for that help.

If that is correct, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is criminal.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1569</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the other point on which I wish to

touch  is  the  question of the electricity  supply  of

Singapore.  I  also  understand - here  again  I   speak

without  absolute knowledge; this is what I  hear  from

sources which I think can be relied upon - that so far as

our  electricity supply is concerned, we  have  reached

the  end. The peak load is now such that with  all  our

generators  going at Pasir Panjang, we can  just  about

make  it.  I  also understand that for some  reason  or

other St. James Power Station is not working. Why  that

is so, I do not know. I have been told the reasons, Mr

Speaker, Sir, but I have not confirmed them,  so  I  do

not  want  to  mention them to the House.  Perhaps  the

Finance Minister might tell us why it is that after  so

many  millions of dollars have been spent on St.  James

Power  Station,  it  is  not  operating  today,  hereby

placing a heavier burden on Pasir Panjang. The position

in Pasir Panjang is that one generator is always out of

function - it has to be. And if one generator should fail

accidentally, then we would be in for blackouts  again.

So  perhaps the Minister for Finance will let  us  know

what  the position is with regard to the future  supply

of electricity in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of housing, which rightly affects the

people of Singapore, here again, Mr Speaker, Sir,  the

question  of water and electricity supply is important.

Sir,  we  know  that during the last  year  or  so  the

Government  has  not  done very  much  in  the  way  of

physical  construction of houses, but during  the  last

six  months they have accelerated construction and  are

getting  on  with  the job. But I  do  not  think,  Mr

Speaker.  Sir,  that the Government can  maintain  this

rate  of  development  if  they  do  not  develop  the

capacity  of  water  supply and  electrical  energy  in

Singapore.  There is no point, to my mind, in  building

houses  in Singapore if we cannot give to those  houses

an   adequate  supply  of  water  and  electric  light.

Electricity may be unimportant: we might be able to use

candles or kerosene. But in a modern city such as ours,

where  the sewage is dependent for its carriage  on  an

adequate supply of water, you will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1570</b></font><br><br>



realise, Mr Speaker, Sir, how important it is that  we

have  a  safe and adequate water supply. If we have  no

water  supply, then houses will be left unoccupied, if

the Housing Board say, "We have constructed 3,000 units

for  this year," it is a meaningless statement  because

those 3,000 units will remain unoccupied merely because

the  Government has fallen down on its job of providing

an adequate water supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again on the question of housing, Mr Speaker, Sir,

we know that the Housing Board depend for their sources

of  money  on  the Government. I have read through  the

Budget  Statement of the Minister for Finance. We  know

that the money is on loan, but in no place does he  say

the  terms  and  conditions under which the  loans  are

made.  I  think this House will be interested  to  hear

from  the Minister for Finance the percentage  rate  of

interest,  the manner of repayment, and how  the  loans

are effected. He has also said that he is considering a

housing  subsidy, and has told the House that  when  he

has  definitely made up his mind on this, he  will  let

the House know all about it. If he is now in a position

to  tell us the quantum of the subsidy and how and  why

it is going to be used - whether it is going to be used

to  reduce rentals all round, or whether there is going

to  be a scheme by way of a means test - I think  this

House will be very much obliged to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point on which I wish to touch is the

question  of  a  tax  on properties in  Singapore.  The

Minister  for  Finance has done very well  out  of  the

property  tax.  I notice he has had a windfall  of  $12

million  more on property tax than he expected.  Now  I

ask him to reconsider the position which I advocated to

this  House some months ago when the property  tax  was

being  discussed - the question of remitting  assessments

on  vacant houses. The Minister then indicated that  it

was  not a practical problem, because there was such  a

housing shortage in Singapore that it was impossible to

have  a shortage of houses! I would urge upon him again

to  reconsider the position because it is not a  matter

of houses which are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1571</b></font><br><br>



built  and available to be let being vacant. On that  I

agree  with  him entirely. Unless he makes it  possible

for  property owners to claim a remission on unoccupied

properties, property developers are going  to  be  very

hesitant about developing a housing estate. This is the

point,  Mr  Speaker, Sir. As soon as a certificate  of

fitness is obtained by the developer, the property  tax

automatically  attaches to the property.  Unfortunately

it attaches to the property by operation of law. Now if

a    property   owner   develops   a   hundred   houses

simultaneously - and I believe they have to develop  them

simultaneously if they want to keep the  cost  down - and

if  they  do  not sell them simultaneously before  this

operation  of law attaches a tax to them, and  if  they

sell  Only  50 per cent of the houses, then assessments

on the rest of the 50 per cent of the houses is raised.

Instead  of  housing  development  becoming  a   paying

proposition,  one  can imagine a set  of  circumstances

where  it could be a loss to the developer. With  these

thoughts  in  mind,  he  is shy of  developing  houses.

Therefore,  the  position  is  that,  because  of  this

difficulty, housing developers are being precluded from

developing housing estates in the manner they would  do

if  they  know that ii is possible in law to go  for  a

waiver of tax on vacant houses. I think that will be  a

greater  impetus to housing developers.  Sir,  this  is

such  a  small matter from the point of view of raising

tax,  and  such a big point in the way of an inducement

to  housing  developers, that I think the Minister  for

Finance will do well to reconsider his policy on vacant

houses.  If  he reconsiders the position and favourably

considers vacant houses, then it might be necessary  to

introduce  amending  legislation to  the  Property  Tax

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another point I wish to touch upon. I

see that in the Minister's Budget Statement he has said

that  he is going to give a gift of houses which belong

to  the Municipal Rate Fund to the Trading Departments.

I  do  not  see why he should be so generous  with  the

ratepayer's money. I think he should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1572</b></font><br><br>



not  make  a  gift to the Trading Departments.  If  the

Trading  Departments  were  to  make  a  gift  to   the

Municipal Rate Fund, I would gladly accept that because

then  it would inure for the benefit of the Fund  which

is  the  taxpayer's money. The Trading Departments  are

purely  trading concerns of the City Council. They  are

purely commercial projects. I cannot understand why the

Municipal  Rate Fund should subsidise trading projects.

I  would  suggest  that is wrong in principle.  If  the

Minister thinks of handing them over, I would  ask  him

to  ask the new Board to hand over an equivalent sum of

money  to him when he makes the handover to this Board.

Perhaps I might refer him to this passage in page 15 of

the Annual Budget Statement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Certain houses and buildings which are the property

of the Rate Fund Departments will be handed over to the

new Board in order that it may be properly equipped  to

carry on its functions economically in the interests of

consumers of water, gas and electricity.'



<br><br>By the phrase "handed over", Mr Speaker, Sir - I hope  I

am  not  doing  the Minister an injustice - when  a  chap

hands over something to me, I hope he hands it over  to

me   as   a  gift;  but  if  the  handover  is  for   a

consideration,  for  an adequate proper  market  value,

then I have no objection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I wish to have elucidation from the Minister

for  Finance on another point. He has made a  statement

that  quite  recently a loan of $50  million  has  been

floated  which has been fully subscribed. I  think  the

House  would  like  to- know who the persons  were  who

subscribed  to it, whether they were local  or  foreign

subscribers, or whether it was mostly taken up  by  the

banks  or  by  private individuals, and the  extent  to

which  private individuals, banks, trustees and  people

in that category contributed to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point on which I would like to touch, quite

cursorily  now but I would like to enlarge on  it  when

coming  to debate the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's  speech,

is  the  question of income tax. I am  not  asking  the

Minister  to reduce income tax, but he has  taken  unto

himself  and his Department certain powers  of  raising

assessments whereupon the tax



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1573</b></font><br><br>



immediately becomes payable: and if any argument ensues

on the correctness of the assessment and the Income Tax

Department  subsequently  concedes  that  is  has  been

wrong,  then  there  must be a remission  of  the  tax.

Having  arrived  at  the stage  where  a  remission  is

accepted by the Comptroller, its payment takes a  long,

long time - almost an indecently long time, I am told by

the  people who are waiting for it. This is one of  the

difficulties  which  I expected would  happen  in  this

case.  It  is  purely  an  administrative  matter,  Mr

Speaker, Sir. If the Comptroller has said, "Yes, I have

assessed you too much. I must remit you X dollars," and

the money has been received by the Government, I see no

difficulty in repayment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Human nature!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It is not human nature, Sir. The

Government is inhuman. It is the inhuman nature of  the

Government.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would like to inform hon.

Members  what  is in my mind. The encroachment  by  the

Fifth  Supplementary Estimates was a  matter  of  seven

minutes.  Perhaps  if I do not use for  the  tea  break

until about seven minutes past five, that will meet the

case   of  the  time  being  taken  up  by  the   Fifth

Supplementary Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I was saying that the difficulty was

not  about  the  humanity  of the  Government  in  this

matter. Where an institution becomes so large that  the

left  hand does not know what the right hand is  doing;

the   Minister  for  Finance  wants  a  thing   to   be

implemented straightaway, but he has a Comptroller  who

has  so many vassals under him, and in the pressure  of

work  and in the computation of incomes which they want

to  gather - and I am told by the Minister he has caught

up  on the backlog - and while they are catching up on

their  backlog,  Mr Speaker, Sir, they have  forgotten

the people who are waiting to receive their money which

Government should not have had in the first place. That

is  the  position.  Sir,  one  of  the  reasons  why  I

suggested that an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1574</b></font><br><br>



interest   should  be  paid  by  the   Government   for

withholding   the   money  for  the   period   of   the

withholdment  was this. If an interest was  charged  on

that money, the Comptroller would see to it that it was

quickly  returned - at  least the  Minister  for  Finance

would see to it that it was quickly returned. The point

now  is  that  his  Comptroller is so  concerned  about

gathering  in the tax that he forgets to  pay  out  the

money  that he has over-gathered, and the Minister  for

Finance  does  not  know anything about  it.  The  only

chance  of getting this to the ears of the Minister  is

an occasion such as this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> He is very efficient.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I do hope that the Minister for Finance

will  issue adequate and explicit instructions  to  his

Comptroller to see that these remissions should be made

expeditiously,  otherwise it brings into  contempt  the

whole  of the taxing system, and we do not want  to  do

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point on which I wish to congratulate

the  Government is this. For a long time, City  Council

employees were in doubt as to what was going to  happen

to  their future and their terms of employment.  I  now

understand  from  the financial statement  that  it  is

proposed  not  to alter their terms and  conditions  of

service one iota. They were most worried about what was

going to happen to their Municipal Provident Fund.  And

I am very glad to see, Sir, that Government has made up

its  mind to carry on with the Municipal Provident Fund

and  to  let the employees who are now contributing  to

that  fund to remain on that fund and to retire on that

fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point that I want to touch upon is the

question  of  the Work Brigade. This Work Brigade,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, is an emotional matter, if I may  put  it

that  way.  From  the point of view of the  Government,

when  they started it, it was an emotional institution,

not a practical institution. For reasons best known  to

the  Government  it  started  this  Work  Brigade.   On

principle, Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it was wrong to do

that - to have this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1575</b></font><br><br>



small  Work Brigade do these little jobs all  over  the

place.  In a commercial and trading city such as  ours,

it  is  wrong.  There are lots of people  in  Singapore

whose livelihood depends on these little odd jobs which

the  Government, the City Council, the  Housing  Board,

and such like institutions provide. The institution  of

this   Work  Brigade  meant  that  those  people  whose

livelihood depended on that type of work were  deprived

of it.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> That, I think, Mr Speaker, was absolutely

wrong. I do recommend most heartily the dissolution  of

the  Work  Brigade. If the Government had  a  political

purpose, it seems to have overdone it. Members  of  the

Work  Brigade are on strike now! Anyway, leaving  aside

the  political implications, the rightness or wrongness

of  the strike, and whether people like them should  be

allowed to form a trade union, if they go on strike and

sit  down there, public projects are held up: and these

could  easily  have  been done by people  who  live  in

cubicles  in  Chinatown, whose livelihood  depended  on

these  things, and are now being deprived of them.  So,

Mr Speaker, Sir, if we talk about first-class citizens

and second-class citizens, we get to the stage where  a

Work  Brigade member is a first-class citizen, and  the

people  who  live in Chinatown and who are deprived  of

their  normal  livelihood by these people  are  second-class  citizens. And we do not want first- and  second-class  citizens  in  this city  anyway.  Certainly  the

Barisan Sosialis do not want it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> And you suggest to dissolve it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> If we dissolve it, then we will all become

first-class citizens!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty started when the ex-Minister for

National  Development - I believe that  was  his  brain-child - had the Work Brigade in his Ministry; for reasons

best known to the Government they transferred it to the

Labour  Ministry because I think it was getting out  of

hand under the ex-Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1576</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> I

think he was raising a private army.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I do not know of any private army, Mr

Speaker, Sir. But anyway it was quickly transferred  to

the  Ministry of Law so that the Minister for Law could

keep law and order. But now it seems that they want  to

send  it  back to the Ministry of National  Development

again. It is a pity the Minister is not here as I  want

to  ask him whether he is going to start a private army

of his own! Really, Mr Speaker, Sir, I really do think

the  Work Brigade is played out. Let us get back to the

old system. This old system. Mr Speaker, Sir, has been

established over a period of time, has been  tested  by

time,  and  has not been found wanting. So let  us  not

change  an accepted institution merely for the sake  of

change.  There is no virtue in changing:  it  does  not

bring  anything  good  commensurate  with  the  change.

Therefore, let us abolish the Work Brigade. And  it  is

even  more heinous to the public of Singapore when they

look at the composition of the Work Brigade. Members of

the  Work  Brigade get jobs when decent normal citizens

cannot  get  them. Government may have good  intentions

when they bring gangsters into the Work Brigade and put

them  under  discipline, instead of Pulau Senang,  they

keep them in the Work Brigade.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Banyak susah lah!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It may be a good social experiment, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I do not doubt it. It is a  good  social

experiment  to put them under discipline, put  them  in

uniform   and  make  them  undergo  rigorous  training.

Discipline  is  a  good  thing.  The  Barisan  Sosialis

understand  it.  The  P.A.P. understand  it.  We   all

understand it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the point is this. There seems to be no purpose

in  the  Work Brigade, and the sooner we abolish  it  I

think the better for all of us.

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the Assembly approves

the  financial policy of the Government  for  the  year

1962."



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, this is a standstill Budget of a

dying  Government.  It displays the  imagination  of  a

mouse and the promise of a dead rattle. One would  have

expected,  Sir,  that knowing that  it  is  dying,  the

Government would have done it with some grace.  Instead

we   have   the   Minister  for   Finance   ponderously

pontificating on providence and indulging in  gibes  at

the  Opposition. He told us, Sir, that it was  gracious

providence  that  ordained that  the  Budget  would  be

introduced  in the midst of the debate on  merger;  the

gracious providence being the P.A.P. Government and its

own  decision to introduce it in the midst of a  debate

vital  to the welfare of this country, a squeezing  out

of the merger debate in a manner contrary to recognised

and accepted traditions of constitutional procedure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, we have from the Minister for Finance, in

a   Budget  Statement,  all  that  I  consider  to   be

inappropriate  jeers  and  smears  of  the  Opposition.

According  to him, all that we have done in these  past

days is to indulge in euphoria, wild fantasies, and  he

fears  for  our sanity circling in orbit in space.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, whatever may be the ultimate home of  the

dead  P.A.P.,  let me assure the Minister  for  Finance

that I shall not be seeking to meet his ghost in space.

I shall remain on earth.

curious phenomenon of the Government Front Benchers who

squirm and laugh whenever they are hurt. Sir, the

Minister for Finance went on to describe us sneeringly

as amateur politicians. We are amateur only in so far

as it is true that we get paid nothing but our

allowance for our service to the State. We do it from

an almost masochistic urge to serve where others are

prepared to let things go by default. We are not in

politics, Mr Speaker, either as a career or to make

money, and I am proud of being called an amateur

politician from that point of view: a politician who

seeks to do his duty to his fellow human beings at his

own expense in time, energy, money and agony. The

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of elucidation?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, because if he had read my

remarks were really meant for the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am obliged to the Minister, and I am

a  little disappointed. Mr Speaker. I am not a  Member

my relations with them, they have been courteous. But I

do   repeat,  whether  directed  to  them  or  directed

elsewhere, remarks, sneers, and jeers of that character

in a Budget Statement are grossly inappropriate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1579</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for myself, I believe that when this Government

finally  ends  its  death rattle  and  disappears,  the

Minister  for  Finance,  of  whom  so  much  has   been

expected, will not be missed. He tells us that we  have

been  indulging  in  slogans which do  not  feed  empty

stomachs.  I  would ask the Minister for  Finance  just

what  does his Budget Statement do about feeding  empty

stomachs?  It  shamelessly shirks the issue  of  making

provisions  for  the  unemployed,  either  by  way   of

creating  employment  or  by way  of  providing  social

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, whilst blaming us for wool gathering in

orbit,  he  himself indulges in pipe-dreams  of  a  new

independence. It seems we have had an old independence,

and we are going to have a new independence. As he puts

it,  a  merger,  according to him, will certainly  take

place at the latest in 1963. I want to say this to  the

Government - and I trust they will believe me that I  say

it with a sense of the gravity of what I am saying - that

if  the Government continue to handle the issue of  our

relationship  with the Federation in the same  arrogant

and   ham-handed   manner  that  they  have   displayed

recently, then the referendum which they have  promised

will  be  a  slap in the face which will  really  shock

them, negative the proposals for closer relations which

they say they seek and which their conduct makes it  so

difficult to accept.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the most alarming feature of this Budget without

virtue  is the fact that it is completely devoid  of  a

dynamic  approach to what is recognised  as  a  dynamic

situation.  We are almost led to believe  that,  lulled

into  a  sense  of  security by  the  so-called  closer

relations with the Federation, the Government  seek  to

surrender Singapore to the greater priority of Petaling

Jaya. Is there then to be an end of a vigorous approach

to our unemployment problem, and even to the promise of

socialist measures to give our poor the security and  a

standard  of  living compatible with human decency?  is

the socialist concept of security for the individual to

give way to the prevailing Federation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1580</b></font><br><br>



economic  policy? is it to mean unconditional surrender

of  those very ideals for which this Front Bench  stood

and  in  respect of which it was elected - the practical

ideal  of socialism for the improvement of the  lot  of

the  common  man? For there is nothing in  this  Budget

Statement that gives even token sympathy for the lot of

the poor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Government has in its lifetime made two

substantial  contributions  to  our  welfare,   and   I

recognise them. One was the vigorous approach displayed

in  the  past  20 months by the Housing and Development

Board.  That  was a magnificent effort  for  which  the

Minister  for  National Development and his  Government

are  entitled to take full credit. I would like to  say

that  as  a  citizen  and  as a representative  of  the

people,  I want to express my gratitude for the  energy

and  skill displayed by his Ministry in that particular

field.  I want to say to the Minister for Finance  that

it  will be with pleasure that I will support all loans

and  assistance necessary to the Ministry  of  National

Development in the field of housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt the Minister recognises that he owes

much  to  his predecessor, and perhaps even to previous

governments, for the ground work laid for this dramatic

expansion in housing. But he himself is fully  entitled

to  a  hundred per cent credit for bringing those  past

hopes, plans and efforts to fruition to the extent that

he  has  surpassed all the previous efforts of previous

governments,  who themselves were seeking,  I  have  no

doubt honestly, to make their contribution to those  in

need of housing in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government, in 1959 and 1960, started with

the  sorriest possible record in the field of  housing.

It  is  only fair to give credit to those who  are  now

changing  the picture. It is my hope that the  Minister

will  not  rest on his oars and that we will, in  fact,

have annually the 10,000 houses necessary not only  for

those  who  need housing today but for the increase  of

our  population annually. I am happy to note, Sir, that

in that field at least there seems to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1581</b></font><br><br>



no let-up and that the Ministry is being given such tools,

both financially and otherwise, as he requires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one other field of this Government's

administration which has attracted, and still attracts, my

admiration,  and  that is in its realistic  and  energetic

approach   in   making  available  industrial   sites   in

Singapore. It is not a new idea, but they have taken  hold

of  it  well and they have brought about its fruition,  or

rather they have tried to bring it about in a manner  that

any  of us who travels to Singapore can see, and I for one

hope to see a great deal more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, both in the statement by the Minister and,

in so far as I can assess, from the Budget, there seems to

be  a flagging of interest which I find a little alarming.

The  excuse - it may be a valid excuse - the Minister  is

giving  is that there are inadequate professional  men  to

cope with requirements. This, Sir, is also the excuse that

he  has  given in respect of the promised reclaimation  of

swamps  known as the Kallang Project, where  we  are  told

quite  bluntly  that  the detailed  design  is  not  being

proceeded  with.  Again and again throughout  that  Budget

Statement,  the Minister has put forward this excuse - and

when  I  use the word "excuse" I do not necessarily  mean,

Sir,  that  it  is not valid - that adequate technical  and

professional  personnel  are unavailable.  I  say  to  the

Minister  that  the solution of the problem  is,  and  has

always  been, in the hands of the Government. It  is  this

Government  which has chased away technical personnel  and

which  has  made  it  very difficult  for  us  to  recruit

professional  and  technical men.  It  is  their  arrogant

conduct, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Prove it.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The facts are there in the City Council, in

the  legal  services and throughout the  public  services.

Since   this  Government  took  office,  the   number   of

resignations  of  professional and technical  men  in  the

medical  service - we have had some figures  already - and  I

say  it  is due to the arrogant conduct of this Government

and its complete ruthlessness in its human relations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1582</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, surely this Assembly has not forgotten the notorious

Enright  letter.  The  only  adjectives  that  are  really

applicable to that letter are unparliamentary, and I leave

it to the imagination of the decent Members of this House.

But  this House may well not be aware that that letter  of

gutter  culture had a tremendous damaging  effect  on  the

image  of  Singapore  overseas amongst  professional  men.

Their  attitude now is why should they, who are  respected

and  responsible men of academic standing and  stature  in

their respective fields, come to Singapore where they have

to subject themselves to the humiliations, the insults and

the  barbaric conduct of the notorious P.A.P.  Government?

The  Minister has told you he has made various  approaches

to  various  governments. That is true, Sir, I  have  some

knowledge  of  it.  But  I  say  to  you,  Sir,  that  the

Government  fails  because it fails to  recognise  certain

basic  principles. The first basic principle, to my  mind,

is  to  recognise that our Malayanisation policy  requires

that  as  soon  as  possible, in fact, even  where  it  is

impossible,  a  Malayan should be at  the  head  of  every

department.  Malayans  should be  in  key  positions.  But

otherwise professional and technical personnel may,  where

necessary,  be  expatriates. The other principle  is  that

professional  and  technical men are in tremendous  demand

throughout  the world. The world today is experiencing  an

expanding need, because in vast areas of the world  - not

only  Singapore,  Sir,  not  only  Asia,  but  Africa  and

elsewhere - there is a tremendous expansion on the  part  of

people for services which would bring them greater comfort

and  even  what are now recognised as basic  needs.  Those

services  are performed mainly by professional men.  Those

professional   men,   whether  they   are   engineers   or

architects, lawyers or doctors, are in very great  demand.

In order to attract them to Singapore, their conditions of

service  must  be encouraging and attractive.  Economy  in

this field is false economy resulting in a tremendous loss

to  our people. I urge our Minister for Finance, who is so

pedestrian  that  the word "imagination"  repels  him,  to

exercise a little human understanding and, if he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1583</b></font><br><br>



cannot,  to seek advice from those who have achieved  some

success  in  human relations in drawing  up  a  scheme  to

attract professional and technical personnel from overseas

to fulfil our needs. If we approach the problem as a human

problem, Sir, you will recognise that, first and foremost,

we must destroy the image that in Singapore a professional

man   will   have   to  suffer  P.A.P. insults,   P.A.P.

humiliations  and  improper  P.A.P. interference  in  the

discharge  of  his  duties. We must  also  assure  him  of

security  of  tenure.  We  must  give  him  conditions  of

remuneration that would have some relationship  with  what

he  can  get  in  private practice.  Today  the  image  of

Singapore, to professional and technical men overseas,  is

an  image  worthy only of their contempt. I  say  to  this

Government, which though I believe is dying yet  threatens

to  live one more year, that even in that one year it  can

do  a  great  deal of damage. I do ask that  it  seriously

reconsider  and  reorient  its  policy  not  only  towards

expatriate  professional  man, but  also  towards  Malayan

professional and technical men. Sir, these men can earn in

private  practice incomes considerably in excess  of  what

they  have  to  accept in Government service.  You  cannot

expect to attract good men although you can expect to keep

those  who are with you because they do not wish  to  lose

the  hopes  of pensions which are the main attraction  for

continuity of service. But I do say, Sir, that  unless  we

approach  the  problem realistically  of  recruiting  both

Malayan  and expatriate personnel in the professional  and

technical  fields, we will keep having a  bumbling  budget

like  this one, where all we can do is vote vast sums that

are never spent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the arrogance and false sense of economy of this

Front  Bench  has been a clot on the development  of  this

area -  a  clot  that  it  is time it  was  dissolved.  The

Minister   for   Finance   has  mentioned   the   Economic

Development  Board. I think we are all  happy.  Sir,  that

finally  it has been set up. The delay has been inordinate

and  the proud boast that solid progress has already  been

registered in farcical. The only progress, in so far as  I

can  assess from the Minister's statement, is that a half-million dollar



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1584</b></font><br><br>



loan  to  a local ship-building firm has been granted  and

some 12 industries for pioneer status have been processed.

Let  us  not  have  empty boasts.  The  personnel  of  the

Economic   Development  Board,  Sir,  do  give   rise   to

legitimate hopes of solid progress. Let us not spoil it by

cheap  boasts.  I look forward in the next few  months  to

solid  progress.  But the solid progress  which  has  been

achieved is a statement that comes from outer space  where

the Minister seeks to send the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Industrial Research Unit has been promised for

more  years then I can remember. Finally we are told  that

it  is almost in sight. Let us not drag our feet either in

its formation or its functioning. The P.A.P. now knows  it

has  not  got eternity to work in to meet the requirements

of  our  pressing  employment problem. We  are  told  with

pleasure  - and  it  is a pleasure that I  share - that  the

World Bank has agreed to finance our development projects.

It  is  certainly an achievement. I would like to ask  the

Minister whether this promise of loans will in any way  be

affected by the fact that in our proposed closer relations

with  the Federation, we would be only in control of  some

three-quarters of our annual income. Would Singapore still

be in a position to negotiate loans with the World Bank on

favourable terms?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The White Paper.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I gather, Mr Speaker, Sir, he tells me

that that is so. Well, I am glad to hear it. Sir, you have

heard more than one speaker amongst the few speakers today

mention the steel mill. The people of Singapore have  been

treated  to  a great deal of P.A.P. propaganda  about  the

steel  mill - how the Minister has achieved agreement,  and

with  Japanese capital, and we are going to have the steel

mill  for  cert.  Next day, the Minister has  not  reached

agreement.  Rather  I  do  not  think  it  has  ever  been

published. But I gather today that, in fact, there  is  no

agreement  with  anybody  to establish  a  steel  mill  in

Singapore and that the propaganda items published  by  the

newspapers came from the fertile brain of the Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1585</b></font><br><br>



Culture. It is a pity his imagination does not  go  with

the  facts. Sir, the Minister for Finance has  mentioned

the Schereschewsky Report on steel mills and he has also

mentioned  the Winsemius Report on industrialisation.  I

would  like  to  know why these reports  have  not  been

tabled. Is there a danger to our security that we should

know  what  is in those reports? Have they  anywhere  by

implication suggested it? Perhaps the P.A.P.  Government

has  not  got  white wings and a halo? I would  ask  the

Minister  to  tell us when we may expect to  have  these

reports, as we are entitled to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has congratulated himself on the

establishment of a trade representative in Indonesia.  I

certainly agree with him that that was a good move.  Our

trade relationship with Indonesia has been deteriorating

far  too  long  for  entirely  artificial  reasons, and

restoration to a healthier approach would be to both our

advantage  and Indonesia's. But in view of the  repeated

questions we have put to him, I would have liked to  see

an  effort on his part - at least a token effort - to send

a  trade  mission, not necessarily residing, but  for  a

trip to Delhi and Peking, to see what could be achieved.

I  do  say, Sir, the money involved would not be  great.

The advantage may well be great. It is worth the effort.

In  a country like ours which depends on trade, a little

imaginative  approach to our problems may well  pay  far

greater dividends than the costs of debentures which are

a  failure.  I  do express the hope that  even  now  the

Minister  will  tell us he will consider  sending  trade

missions  to  those  capitals  with  whom  there  is   a

potential of greater trade with Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has drawn your attention to

the  Work  Brigade. Sir, I was not here  when  the  Work

Brigade  was  formed. I confess I have not  studied  the

issue  whether the Work Brigade is a good thing or  not.

But  there is one aspect of our allotment for  the  Work

Brigade   which  exercises  my  mind.  It  should   have

definitely come from a trade unionist, but since it has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1586</b></font><br><br>



not,  Sir,  I  would like to draw the attention  of  the

House  to it. It is my view that the people in the  Work

Brigade  are  being  grossly underpaid  and  that  their

conditions  of  service are inappropriate.  I  say  that

Government  must accept the principle that a  member  of

the Work Brigade is entitled to the same remuneration as

they  would  have  to pay to a worker  who  is  a  trade

unionist  and  can  demand  a  proper  remuneration.   I

recognise that in the Work Brigade they are being housed

and fed, and I accept the principle that from the proper

remuneration that they should receive there should be  a

deduction  for  both housing and feeding.  At  the  same

time,  I  would  like an assurance that,  in  fact,  the

Government accepts the principle that payments for their

services  should  not  be less  than  payments  for  the

services of outside workers and that it is not a  device

for cheap and sweated labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year we will have a television service. It was

promised  to  us six years ago. Other things  intervened

and  we  are now told - not by this Government; I do  not

blame them - that we will be having it next year. Sir,  in

the  light of experience of what has happened  to  Radio

P.A.P.,  I  ask  for  an assurance that  the  television

service  will  not  be used as an adjunct  of  the  P.A.P.

political  machine but will be used for  the  legitimate

requirements of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture has proved himself quite an empire builder in the name of the P.A.P. He has no understanding of culture and little understanding of the needs of the people. In so far as I can judge, his activities have been materially directed to the political welfare of his colleagues and his party. I for one, in so far as I can, will resist the expansion of the empire that he seeks by the additional expenditure

in the Budget. The so-called expansion of the activities

of  the  Minister for Culture must be justified  on  the

needs  of the people, and there must be protection  from

what  we know to have been past political abuse  of  the

Government  machinery of propaganda for party  political

purposes. I do not think it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1587</b></font><br><br>



proper,  and, in so far as I can, I will not permit  the

use  of  public  money  for the benefit  of  the  P.A.P.

political machine and the whitewashing of the Government

Front Bench.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next we have the petroleum duty. Have you noticed that

the  petroleum duty has fallen by $2 million? Sir, in  a

Budget that clearly indicates a buoyant economy, that is

surprising;  and  whilst on the  subject  of  a  buoyant

economy, let me answer the question of the Minister  for

Finance who asked, "If we are a bad Government that  has

not  done well with the people of Singapore, how  is  it

that  our economy is expanding?" [interruption]  Oh,  it

was an indiscretion. I am so glad he recognises that  it

is   non  sequitur,  that,  in  fact,  the  economy   is

expanding - no thanks to this Government - but by virtue  of

the activities of our people and of the area in which we

live.

beyond the point of diminishing returns. [Laughter] Sir,

for a conservative economist, he has a curious habit  of

laughing  in  the wrong places. Sir, even a conservative

economist recognises - I trust - the phrase "the point -  of

diminishing returns. We are taxing petrol at  $1.20  for

what  is  being retailed at 72 cents - a duty of 170  per

cent.  Now that we have reached the point of diminishing

returns,  I  would  ask the Minister  whether  he  would

consider reducing that duty to something more reasonable -

Obviously he has done his homework. The moment there was

a slight disparity, cars either started shooting down to

Woodlands  or  Woodlands started shooting up  to  Johore

Bahru.  I  hope  one  of these days we  shall  have  the

pleasure  of hearing him in some other chamber in  Kuala

Lumpur where no doubt he will castigate the Minister for

Finance there.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not like

dragging  up  the  past but I would  remind  the  hon.

Gentleman who last spoke that we did have the increase

of petrol tax nowhere near to $1.20, that there was  a

disparity  until the Government increased  the  petrol

tax  and  that  there  were - he is quite  right,  Sir - I

gather  a few cats were shooting up and down Woodlands

in order to save ten cents (just a few cars - not even a

fleabite). Let us not exaggerate. As for its  being  a

Federation   responsibility,   again   let   us    not

exaggerate. We can have - if it pleases the  Federation

and if and when those closer relations are achieved - a

separate taxation. That is neither here nor there.  In

the  same  way  that we are having today  the  customs

barrier - and I have no doubt it will be maintained for

purposes  of keeping Singapore a free port - so  we  can

have  different taxes. But, Sir, the lack of logic  of

this  tax,  where  we  now  see  that  the  point   of

diminishing returns has been reached and there is  not

a  word  of regret and there is a refusal to recognise

it, is as amusing - although far more serious to a  lot

of  people - as  the  stupid tax on professional  boxing

about  which  you have heard we got zero  dollars  and

zero cents in 1959, 1960 and in 1961, and the Minister

has  informed me by letter that he intends to continue

that  tax and expects to receive zero dollars and zero

cents. That is his logic - the logic that can insist  on

a heavy burden on the taxi-drivers, that can insist on

taking away their livelihood, that can -

economist - all  right, no laughter  fortunately!  Maybe

they recognise that their Minister is not an economist

either  by now. But the point is, it is simple  logic.

If a tax is producing nothing, its existence is a dead

weight  on  the  administration;  and  if  a  tax   is

producing diminishing returns, then it is a danger  to

our  revenue. Here is a tax which has gone too far and

which has now brought in $2 million less than what  it

brought in last year and is expected to bring in less,

why  can  we  not give this $2 million  to  the  taxi-drivers  and the lorry-drivers - the $2 million that  we

are  losing anyway and stop this changeover? Does  the

Minister wish to rise?

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I was seeking elucidation on

the  tax  on professional boxing. I am not aware  that

there is any tax on professional boxing as such.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What about wrestling?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> There is an entertainment tax and

surely professional boxing has to pay the same rate of

tax  on  entertainment. For one reason or  other,  the

Member for Anson has developed a very keen interest in

this. I do not know -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Minister must

concentrate on elucidation only.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The point is this. If we were to

give  special preference to, professional  boxing,  We

could levy the same rate as in the Federation where it

is about 15 per cent against 45 per cent. But there is

a  similar  decline in the Federation; from  the  fact

that  professional boxing involves expenses, it  does

not lead to any increase in this sport at all. How can

the  Member for Anson expect that if we were  to  take

similar  steps there would be a revival of the  sport?

Before we can make any decision about the tax, we must

see the cause for the decline of the tax yield.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1591</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You are talking about a boxer.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am delighted, Sir, that what I hoped

would  be  an aside is now being made a major issue.  I

can  assure the Minister that I have not up  my  sleeve

any  organisation, nor am I a shareholder or  organiser

of any boxing entertainment, nor do I hope to go in for

professional boxing when he has finally defeated me.  I

have  tried  to  point out that  here  is  a  tax  that

produces  zero dollars plus zero cents every year,  and

yet this entertainment duty is left on the statute book

in  order  to act as an impediment and a punishment  to

anybody  who might like to have professional boxing.  I

will  not  insult  the Minister by saying  that  it  is

feminine logic, but I do not know what Other logic  one

can call it unless one can say it is a particular brand

of  his  logic,  that he maintains on the  statue  book

duties  which are a dead weight, which add to the  cost

of  administration,  and which have  produced  zero.  I

gave, as an example of his logic, a matter that is  far

more  grievous, in respect of the petroleum duty  which

has   its   effects.   The  Government   has   received

representations.  It  has  its  effect  on  the   poor.

[Laughter]  I do not know why every time the  poor  are

mentioned,  he laughs. It is so funny, Sir.  Yes,  from

the  depths of one's beer glass, one can laugh  at  the

poor. I do not and I will not.

to   elucidate  that  point,  because   that   may   be

misleading.  Perhaps the Member for  Anson  will  agree

that it is only in connection with the 1962 Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, these are estimates which we are

to get.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Point of order, Sir. We have

arranged  that the Government will have half  an  hour,

and if the Minister does not want that half an hour, he

speaking.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have no idea at all that an

arrangement   has  been  made.  I  am  very   glad   an

arrangement has been made. Interjections are, in  fact,

useful if there is some matter which needs elucidation,

because that will enable Members to understand what  is

being  said in a debate of this nature. In a debate  of

this  nature, I think Members are entitled to know what

is   being  said,  and  Assemblymen  are  expected   to

understand what has been said.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order, Sir. As the

announced that he has given the Government half an hour

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is not a point of order, but

a point of arrangement. Mr Marshall.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I do appreciate the

courtesy  I received from the Front Bench, particularly

yesterday  in  respect of a point of  clarification.  I

hope  I  am not considered mingy but I have,  I  think,

given ample opportunity to the Minister for Finance and

I would appreciate it if he would permit me to continue

my argument.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to come next to the business

registration  tax.  Sir, I was not  here  when  it  was

introduced  and I must confess to you that I  have  not

delved  into  it to ascertain whether  it  is  just  or

whether it is unjust. But I would like, now that it  is

being   withdrawn,  to  refer  you  to  the  Minister's

comments when he introduced it with a flourish  on  the

29th



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1595</b></font><br><br>



November, 1960 [Hansard], col. 44, Vol. 14. This is

what he had to say about the business registration tax:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The reason for introducing this form of taxation is

apparent. A large majority of small shopkeepers do  not

contribute  whatsoever to the Inland Revenue.  Further,

if  the  proprietor is a man of abstemious  habits,  he

does not even contribute to the liquor and tobacco tax.

If  he lives in a shop premise, as is usually the case,

he  does  not  own  a  motor car  and  hence  does  not

contribute to the petroleum duty. Such persons are in a

truly   privileged  position.  Their  children  receive

education, the cost of which the State pays  up  to  98

per  cent  or  more. If any member of his family  falls

ill,  he  can get free treatment or near free treatment

in State hospitals or dispensaries. Further, they enjoy

the  full  protection  of  law enforcement  and  public

order.  It is only equitable that he be called upon  to

make a contribution towards the cost of providing these

benefits.'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have a signal from the

interpreters  to  say that the Member is  speaking  too

fast.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am sorry:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Further, they enjoy the full protection of law

enforcement and public order. It is only equitable that

he  be  called upon to make a contribution towards  the

cost  of  providing these benefits. Nor can it be  said

that the rates are unduly high. Hawkers' licensing fees

are  on  the average much higher than the rates we  are

levying  on sole proprietorships and partnerships.  The

yield  from this business registration fee is  expected

to be about $2.0 million per year.'



<br><br>That was last year, Sir. Now we are told that we do not

need  this $2 million because of our reunification with

the  Federation - that is his word - and because the Budget

shows  a surplus. Sir, what has reunification, even  if

it  comes  about, to do with this business registration

tax  which  the  Minister, at the time  of  introducing

called a small tax on persons in a privileged position?

Are  they  not  any  longer  persons  In  a  privileged

position?  And he said it was only equitable that  such

persons  should be called upon to make a  contribution.

Is  it no longer equitable to call upon them to make  a

contribution? Can we not use this: $2 million in social

services,  in  increasing the allowance to  the  90,000

officially starving human beings in Singapore? Is  this

a  socialist  government? Or is it the truth  that  the

cloak



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1596</b></font><br><br>



of  socialism  is no longer required now  that  it  has

hopes  of  co-operation with the Federation Government?

And  people in privileged positions, Sir, we must curry

favour with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget, Mr Speaker, is a shameless confession

that  all  the socialist slogans mouthed by the  P.A.P.

were a mere facade, just as they now confess that their

former protestations - that they had no Communists - was  a

facade. This Budget is a confession that the Government

is,  and  intends to be, wholly on the side  of  vested

interests  and  of  capital  in  its  approach  to  our

problems. I have made repeated efforts in this  Chamber

to  obtain at least a promise from this Government that

they  would introduce social legislation. You  know  to

what extent I have been fobbed off repeatedly with  "in

due  course", "when", and "if'. I say to you, Sir, that

it  is  a  shameful thing that even in its dying  year,

this  Government is so completely devoid of  conscience

that it makes not even a small effort towards the ideal

for  which it was elected, the ideal of social justice.

I  condemn  this Government for its economic policy  of

supporting  the rich and ignoring the poor. Cancel  the

business   registration  tax - 90,000  people  officially

starving,  and  not  a word about them.  40,000  people

unemployed  and  a lot more under-employed - not  a  word

about  them. What has he done? I do not know, Sir,  how

it  is possible for this Government to have not even  a

twinge of conscience in refusing to make provision  for

unemployment insurance or for social security  measures

in  the field of sickness allowance, widows' allowance,

old  age  pensions.  The  country  is  ripe  for  these

measures.  Sir,  these  promises  were  good  for   the

election  when  these gentlemen whom  you  see  on  the

Government Benches used to spit, and spit, and spit  at

the Government of the Member for Cairnhill.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think it is appropriate

in  this  Assembly for anyone to say that a  Member  of

this  Assembly spits and spits and spits at  Opposition

Members, even metaphorically.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker. They were

venomous - much  I agree with them - about the  shortcomings

of  their predecessors. I, Sir, who have reason to  view

with  grave  suspicion any statement made by any  P.A.P.

person,  actually  believed that this  Government  would

genuinely make an effort to achieve a measure of  social

security  if only to maintain their popularity with  the

populace  and  keep  up the facade of  being  socialists

whilst, in fact, they were Right-wing capitalists.  Sir,

elementary humanity, if not electoral expediency, should

compel  them  to  make  an honest  effort  to  introduce

measures of social security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One matter that has been drawn to our attention by the

Member for Queenstown, if true, should cause us concern.

That  is the extensive funnelling of Singapore funds  to

the   United   Kingdom   to   finance   United   Kingdom

enterprises. I have no objection to assisting Britain at

all, Sir. But I say, let us help ourselves first. And  I

would  like a full explanation from the Minister  as  to

the reason for not utilising that money in Singapore  in

order to assist our industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one expects little from the Government that is

creditable. This Budget is not. This Budget is a  corpse

of broken promises and dead hopes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Dead what?

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Hopes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, we have heard the Financial Statement for 1962 made

by  the  Minister for Finance. It seems that the current

year's economic policy appears to be very simple to  the

Government. It gives the people the impression that  the

Government intends to shirk its responsibility in  order

to  cover  up its previous errors. I believe all  of  us

have  heard the Minister for Finance say that  the  1962

Budget would be the last of its kind in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. has said that this year is

a year of construction. Looking at the Budget, the word

"construction" is very attractive. In fact,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1598</b></font><br><br>



according to the Member for Queenstown (the Chairman  of

the Barisan Sosialis) the Budget for 1962 shows that  it

is  only 40 per cent of the performance of the Budget of

1961.  We  have looked at the Budget. To us, 1962  is  a

dying year for the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if you compare the 1962 economic

policy with the 1961 economic policy, you will note that

this  is still an old tune. The Financial Statement made

by  the Minister for Finance on the economic policy  has

not  mentioned  the state of unemployment in  Singapore.

That  is,  it has not stated whether the Government  has

tried to solve the problem of unemployment. The Minister

for Finance has not stated whether, during its two years

of  office, the Government has created opportunities for

employment and to what extent. During its two  years  of

office,  the  livelihood  of the  people  has  not  been

improved.  The  Minister for Finance has not  stated  to

what  extent it has been improved. All this has not been

mentioned in his Financial Statement. I feel much regret

at this omission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. has often said that its

deeds  conform  to its words. But if  you  look  at  the

promises  which it made in its pamphlet in  1959 - in  The

Tasks  Ahead - Part  I  under the  article  "Our  Economic

Policy" - you will find that it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The objective of the economic policy of a People's

Action  Party  government will  be  to  obtain  for  the

general  masses of the people, a happy, full and  secure

livelihood.'



<br><br>How confident and how considerate it was! Yet the P.A.P.

has  been  in office for 2½ years. Is there any solution

to the problem of unemployment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point in this article which has attracted

the attention of this House. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The unemployment problem is very serious. If we do not

take  any step to consolidate and strengthen our economy

to  create employment opportunities up to 1962, then  it

will be very serious.'



<br><br>These  were  the actual words spoken by the  P.A.P. in

1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore there will be about 20,000 to 30,000

people every year looking for work. We feel like asking



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1599</b></font><br><br>



the  P.A.P. this. How many people today  are  still  left

unemployed?  How  many  employment  opportunities  has  it

created so far?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance says that he has

tried   to   promote  economic  expansion, to   encourage

industrialisation,  and  to give  pioneer  status  to  new

industries. He says that up to the end of this year,  five

pioneer  industries will probably be established  in  this

country  and  will go into production. However,  how  many

employment opportunities can be created in such a  manner?

It  is  not clearly stated in the Financial Statement.  He

says  further there have been 27 applications for  pioneer

industry status and there will be employment for 1,900. If

we  calculate on this basis - taking for granted that these

factories  will  be  put  into production - how  will  these

employment opportunities compare with the 20,000 to 30,000

people  looking  for work every year in Singapore?  If  we

take  for granted that these 1,900 people can get jobs  by

the  end  of this year, it only constitutes 6 per cent  of

the total unemployed people.



<br><br>6.43 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If industrialisation is carried out in this manner, how

can   we  solve  our  unemployment  problem?  The  Finance

Minister did not set out the steps for its solution in his

statement. The only thing he is proud of is the  Four-Year

Development  Plan. The main objective of this  Development

Plan  is to increase the total national income per  capita

from  11  per cent to 20 per cent. Let us see whether  the

Government has raised the standard of living of the people

or whether it has raised the per capita income. If we look

at  the Government estimates, to tell the truth, it  is  a

very  attractive and impressive document. The figures  are

very  big. If you study the projects in detail,  you  will

note just how much the Government has done this year.  The

Member for Queenstown has exposed this just now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I will try to set out the three main features of this

Budget.  In  the  1962  Development  Estimates,  we   have

approved $3,690,000. However, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1600</b></font><br><br>



amount that has been spent in 1961 is about $673,000. This

is  only 20 per cent of the amount allotted. This  is  the

situation in the Ministry of Health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take a look at the Ministry of Education, in spite

of  the  fact that the Ministry of Education has  built  a

number of schools - it has made a promise to build a certain

number  of  schools, and in the 1961 Development Estimates

$22   million  has  been  allotted  to  the  Ministry   of

Education - not  enough schools have  been  built.  But  the

actual  sum  which is expected to be spent  this  year  is

about $6,900,000. This means that development in the field

of education shows only 30 per cent performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take a look at Social Welfare, the original

estimate  for  1961  is $360,000, but  the  actual  amount

expected  to  be  spent at the end of this  year  is  very

disappointing. The Department of Social Welfare has  spent

about $6,000. The Assembly has allotted $360,000, but only

$6,000  has  been spent. This is only 2 per  cent  of  the

amount allotted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a simple example and an actual fact. The Government has tried to make the Budget figures very impressive and attractive. As a matter of

fact, the Government is not firm in its implementation  of

policies.  The Government says it has money and wishes  to

implement  its  policies, but is short of technicians  and

professional  men.  If  you look  up  the  speech  of  the

Minister  for  Finance  with regard  to  the  government's

economic  policy, you will see a paragraph on  the  P.W.D.

That  department is short of engineers. It is a recognised

fact  that  the shortage of technicians is universal.  Yet

has  the  P.A.P.  Government ever tried  to  overcome  its

difficulties?  No. We know many technicians have  returned

from overseas after completing their studies but they have

not   got  jobs  yet.  There  are  many  local  university

graduates who have not got employment up till now. This is

only  one aspect of the problem. The Member for Queenstown

has  said  just  now that the attitude of  the  Government

towards professional men with regard to treatment and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1601</b></font><br><br>



remuneration  is the reason why they  have  left  this

country for other places. The Minister for Finance has

said  that  we  must look after these technicians  and

professional  men properly because all of  us  require

their  services.  We do not care what their  political

stand is so long as they are loyal to the policies  of

the   Government  and  are  able  to  carry  them  out

properly. What is the result? Well, we can clearly see

that experienced professional men and technicians have

resigned on a considerable scale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let us look at the financial

policy  of the Minister for last year. This has  never

been  mentioned  in  the current Financial  Statement.

Last  year  he  said that in a new  country  that  was

trying to shake off the shackles of colonial rule,  we

must  try  to create equal opportunities  so  that  no

class  would  have a privilege over the other  and  we

must  try  to  march  as far as  we  could  towards  a

socialist objective so that we could have a more  just

and fair society. "This policy will be able to rectify

the unequal relationship between the employers and the

employees.  In  the old country many  workers  had  to

suffer  a  great  deal under colonial rule  and  their

opportunities were very strictly restricted. In  those

days  the English-educated were treated very well  and

they  were isolated from the rest of society. But  now

you  can  see how the P.A.P. Government is  trying  to

give  equal opportunities to the Chinese-educated  and

graduates of Nanyang University." They continue to say

that  in a socialist government the government  should

not  only  try  to  give  equal opportunities  to  the

various classes of people but must also try to explain

the  economy of the country so that everybody will  be

able  to  make a contribution towards nation building.

"Because our population is increasing, we must try  to

do our best. This is very clear." But in the Financial

Statement for this year, the Minister for Finance  has

said   nothing   about   this.  This   paragraph   has

disappeared  entirely.  Let us  look  at  this  year's

statement  again on what he says about the improvement

of the people's livelihood -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1602</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen (Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen):</b> Order. Could the

Member please inform the House which book he is

quoting from regarding last year's financial speech?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

sir,  it  is  from the Nanyang Digest,  reporting  the

Finance  Minister's speech made in  this  Assembly  in

regard to the 1960 Financial Statement. He said  there

were  three items of tax increases last year. He  said

this  new taxation would increase the revenue  of  the

Government by $10 million. This burden of taxes is not

necessary  hut  this  additional revenue  will  enable

greater  development in the building  of  schools  and

more  hospitals in the interests of the  people.  That

means  to  say, if you get money from the people,  you

must  spend it on the people themselves, so that  they

will enjoy a better life. We agree with this principle

entirely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us look again at the current Budget

estimates. We find that the revenues for this year are

quite  considerable and we expect  the  Government  to

spend a great deal of money out of these revenues  for

development purposes. But it is regrettable for me  to

say  that this is not the case, because the Government

has  not  spent  the people's money  properly  on  the

people   themselves,  as  has  been  promised.  Today,

frankly  speaking, if we compare the current estimates

with  those of last year, we have a feeling that there

has  been  no foresight as to how much money  will  be

spent  for 1961. I wonder how the Minister for Finance

can  state  in  the  proper  column  that  the  amount

actually  spent  is very negligible  compared  to  the

amount  on  expenditure approved by  this  House.  The

P.A.P.  Government today is very disappointing to  the

people, because in 1959 it promised to do many things.

Although  I  have broken away from the  Government  to

join the Barisan Sosialis, I feel that the promises we

made in 1959 should be carried out as far as possible,

and  that  we must pay attention to the implementation

of the policies as laid down according to the promises

made  to  the people. Today, the P.A.P. is  trying  to

boast  that 1961 is a year of construction, but  I  am

still



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1603</b></font><br><br>



wondering how this can be true. I will say that this is

the last year of the P.A.P.



<br><br>6.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is a

matter  for  regret that the Budget  debate  is  taking

place  ahead of the debate on the Negara's speech.  The

normal  parliamentary procedure is  that  the  Negara's

speech will provide a debate on the Government's policy

for  the  ensuing year, and the Budget is  Government's

attempt  at  implementing that policy. But now  we  are

debating  the  Budget first instead  of  the  Negara's

speech  because  of the number of days  we  have  spent

debating the merger motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the past two years we have been on this side

of  the House. We were alone for the first year.  There

were  eight of us here and we criticised the Government

most vigorously in regard to their Budgets. In 1959, we

were  laughed at and ridiculed. Members of the  P.A.P.

even  went  to  the extent of saying how  bad  and  how

wicked  the Lim Yew Hock Government was and  how  clean

and  how good the P.A.P. Government was. Then in  1960,

when we had their second Budget, three Members from the

other side came over to this side, and there was a  lot

of  noise  going  on - in fact, a lot  of  exposures  and

counter-exposures - so  much so that  it  resulted  in  a

Commission of Inquiry. Then in their third Budget  this

year, this side has increased in number and their  side

has  decreased. This, however, is not so bad. But  when

those  who  came from the other side now say that  what

they  said to mean at that time was not what they meant

to  say, and that what they mean to say now is that the

P.A.P.  Government is a rotten Government and that  the

sooner  it  gets out the better for all concerned,  and

how good the Lim Yew Hock Government was, Sir, I really

find   it  difficult  to  reconcile  these  statements.

Although  we  on  this  side of the  House  might  feel

gratified that our strength has increased, it  is  very

hard  for me, Sir, to reconcile the statements now made

by  Members who have come over to this side  when  they

criticise the Government's activities during the past



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1604</b></font><br><br>



two  years,  with  which activities they  were  closely

connected.  Some of them were Parliamentary Secretaries

and some were very active Back-Benchers.



<br><br>7.02 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, Sir, what I would like to say is

this,  before  I  leave this subject.  The  Member  for

Queenstown  was  most violent in his criticism  of  the

Government  for the pay cut. He said that  that  should

not  have been done. If I remember rightly, when there

were  eight  of us on this side of the House,  we  were

very  vehement in our criticism of the arbitrary action

of  the  Government in imposing the pay cut, and  there

were  the  13 Members who are now on this side  of  the

House  and  who  stood up to say that we  were  talking

rubbish.  Now they have learnt the error of their  ways

and  they  criticise  the  Government  for  its  action

against the civil servants, to which action they were a

party. Well, perhaps they are now saying they are sorry

that  they  had  done  that  and  they  hope  that  the

Government will learn the error of its ways. It  is  up

to them. I do not know. The Member for Queenstown stood

up  this time and criticised the Government. I think he

said  these words, "They blundered in their Budget  and

in  their taxation policy," and it was only last  year,

when  the  Minister  for Finance introduced  eight  new

forms  of taxes, that the Member for Queenstown  stood

up  and  said in this Assembly - I think I can  remember

the   words   he  said - "I  unreservedly   support   the

Government."  It was then last year. This year,  things

have  changed  and  maybe they  have  learnt  that  the

taxation policy of the Government introduced last  year

with their support should not have their support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of speakers have touched on the cut in the

variable allowance. We are glad that the Government has

found  it  necessary  to pay back  the  cut  that  they

imposed arbitrarily, but it would appear that there  is

still  a  lot of heartache amongst the civil  servants.

They  maintain - as we have maintained for the  past  two

years - that the cut imposed by the Government was an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1605</b></font><br><br>



arbitrary cut and that it was against all trade  union

principles. Any cut which the Government had wanted to

introduce  could  have  been introduced  after  proper

negotiations with the trade union bodies. The  unions,

I   understand,  are  now  asking  the  Government  to

negotiate with them with a view to finding  a  way  to

heal  this sore once and for all. I do urge  upon  the

Government  that  they  should - if  there  is  such  a

request - negotiate  with  the  unions  and  bring  this

matter - which has caused a lot of heartache amongst the

civil servants - to an end once and for all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we read in the newspapers today that the Work

Brigade is going on strike. Members will remember that

for  the  past two years, I have said in this Assembly

that  the  Work  Brigade was just an  attempt  by  the

P.A.P. to build up a -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> A private army.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - Frankenstein. Today it has

turned  out to be an organisation which has  come  cut

openly  because it cannot stand it any more.  It  says

that  the Government is bad. I did say a year ago that

the  Work  Brigade is nothing but an  attempt  by  the

Government to impose slave conditions on those who are

unemployed.  Before the P.A.P. came  into  power,  the

previous  Government tried to solve  the  unemployment

problem  by giving the unemployed relief work  at  the

rate  of $3 a day plus rice and sugar. When the P.A.P.

came  into power - the workers' government as they claim

themselves  to be - they cut off the rice  and  sugar

rations  and  now the members of the Work Brigade  are

only  paid $1.50 a day. I told the Government that  if

they  hoped  to  make use of the Work  Brigade  to  be

present at the Airport to welcome Ministers home  when

they come back from leave or see them off when they go

elsewhere, or to make use of leaders of the  community

centres  to  cheer them when they walk from  the  City

Hall  to  this  Assembly, that was not going  to  help

them;  they would be creating a Frankenstein. We  know

today that the People's Association is out against the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1606</b></font><br><br>



Government  because they say that  the  P.A.P. is  no

good. It is the same thing with the Work Brigade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us go through the Budget Statement of the

Minister. The Minister rightly says that in  order  to

achieve  some success in the industrialisation  policy

and in the development programme:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...one of the main objectives of the Plan is to

induce  an  increase  in the rate of  private  capital

investment.'

<br><br>He  is quite right. You must induce an increase in the

rate of private capital investment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order, Sir. We have

to  close at eight o'clock and I think it is only fair

that  I  should be given an opportunity  of  replying,

being a target -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That, of course is not a point

of order. It is a waste of time.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact, I will

be  speaking  25  minutes less than my  allotted  time

agreed  among Opposition Members. But just to cut  the

story  short, this is what the Minister says, that  in

order  to increase the rate of private capital,  there

must be an inducement to see that there is an increase

in  private  investment. But how do they go  about  it

now,  Sir? We know in Singapore that there is a  trade

union  war  today between the P.A.P.-controlled  trade

unions  and S.A.T.U. - the Barisan Sosialis-controlled

trade  unions. Each group is trying to go all  out  to

prove that it is the better group. That is why we  are

having a series of strikes today. The P.A.P. tries  to

do  something to prove that it is better. The  Barisan

Sosialis might feel that they want to prove that  they

are  better.  Therefore, they are  creating  all  this

industrial unrest. How are they then going  to  induce

an increase in private investment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was touched upon by the Member for Anson - about

the  World Bank having agreed to finance some  of  the

development projects. The Minister says at page  9  of

the Budget Statement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is a source of satisfaction to the Government

that  the  World  Bank  has  agreed  to  finance   our

development projects, for a World



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1607</b></font><br><br>



Bank  loan indicates the confidence of the Bank in  the

financial standing of the Government:



<br><br>I think it would be more correct to say "the confidence

of the Bank in the financial standing of Singapore" and

not "of the Government", because the P.A.P. Government is

now  going  bankrupt. It started with  43  Members.  It

became 40, then 39, and now it is 26. One more less and

it will go completely bankrupt. It is just on the verge

of bankruptcy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the steel mill, there is one point

that has not been touched on, and that is, a steel mill

is  coming  into existence in Petaling Jaya,  Selangor.

One  steel mill there is more than enough to cope  with

the  requirements  of Malaya as a whole,  and  even  of

Malaysia  when it takes place. The Japanese steel  mill

is  out. It is no good. It has no chance. There  is  no

water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to prove that there were more imports, the

Minister  for  Finance says that  the  registration  of

private motor cars, motor-cycles and scooters increased

by  35 per cent, and yet it has been pointed out by the

Member  for  Anson that the revenue from  petroleum  is

going to be $2 million less than is estimated for  this

year. What is the reason for it? Diesel? I submit, Sir,

that the reason why petrol is being used less today  is

because  of this funny car park business that is  going

on.  Sir,  there  is nowhere to park your  car.  It  is

easier  for a car-owner not to go by car. It is  easier

to  travel  by bus or taxi. That is one of the  reasons

why  the  petroleum  tax  has gone  down.  It  is  more

convenient to travel by bus or taxi.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Do not shout. Read the Standing

Orders.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> This is the final point on which I

would like to touch. It has raised a good laugh. I hope

the  Government  side  will laugh  this  one  off.  The

Minister says at page 25:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Speaker, Sir, I now come to revenue proposals for

1962.  It is obvious that this is not the time for  new

taxes  and  I do not intend to introduce any new  taxes

next year nor to raise existing ones.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1608</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious. Surely it is obvious. They are going out

and  they  hope to come back. Therefore, they will  not

want to do anything -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Going out where?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Going out of the scene. Therefore,

they  think  it is obvious. Surely it is  obvious.  Who

does not know it? Last year, they came along with eight

new  tax proposals. They thumped their chests. When  we

stood up on this side of the House and said. "It is not

right  that you should introduce such and such a  tax,"

they tried to justify them. In fact, they ridiculed us,

On  the  professional tax, the Prime  Minister  himself

said - I  will  not quote it again because  it  has  been

quoted  by  the Member for Anson - that it was necessary.

What  was more important to the Government was  not  to

raise  money  but  to  explore  all  local  avenues  of

taxation before they go outside for loans. But now they

say  they are not going to introduce new taxes  because

of impending merger.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry that time is

short.  However, it is necessary that in  debating  the

Budget  speech  of the Minister for Finance,  I  should

bring up this point that I feel is important, i.e., the

surplus that we find today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that the Minister for Finance says

in  his  speech  that  all the political  slogans  have

brought  about results for the benefit of  the  people.

Mr  Speaker, we must face hard realities and find ways

and  means  to improve the livelihood of the people  of

Singapore.  In  our  efforts to  achieve  progress  for

Singapore,  we  should not forget  important  problems,

such as the composition of a multi-racial society. Each

problem  has its own difficulties, and our  first  step

must  be  to  get  rid  of the wall  of  division.  The

question  of  uniting our various peoples is  the  most

important  task.  If we are unable to break  down  this

communal barrier. I think it will be very difficult for

us to solve this problem as a whole.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1609</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of my Party, I say again

that  in  the  Budget  Statement  of  the  Minister  for

Finance, there is no mention of how we could solve  this

problem, with particular reference to the section  which

concerns  by industrialists who are non-Malays, and  in

the  effort  to bring about a more egalitarian  society.

There is mention of the field of employment. At present,

unemployed  Malays have no chance to gain employment  in

industries or factories, many of which are controlled by

industrialists who are non-Malays. If we  could  suggest

to  the industrialists to take in Malays, it would be  a

step  towards  bringing  about closer  relationship  and

mutual  understanding  between the  various  communities

which  live  in Singapore; like the step  taken  in  the

Federation  of  Malaya  today where  industrialists  are

giving  more opportunities to the Malays. This  will  at

least bring about an understanding in the development of

industries in our State and also bring about  the  unity

of  our  peoples in Malaya. So I hope this  matter  will

receive the serious consideration of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot achieve our political and ideological aims

if  the various peoples in our country cannot be united.

Although  it  is  our aim to bring about  a  more  equal

society,  if  we cannot bring about mutual understanding

among  the various peoples in all fiel4s, whether it  be

educational, industrial, etc., I think we cannot achieve

socialism.  Although my Party is not a socialist  Party,

we must aim at the unity of our peoples.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Leader of the House

wishes to move a business motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on item 2 be continued after 8

p.m. and be exempted from the provisions of Standing

Order No. 1 for half an hour.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1610</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Under Standing Order 83, one day is

allotted for the continuation of the debate on the

financial policy of the Government. In order to enable

this motion to be moved, there must be an assent of hon.

Members, because under Standing Order 99:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A question the object or effect of which may be to

suspend  any  Standing Order of the  Assembly  shall  be

proposed  only either after notice given  or  after  the

expression of the general assent of the Assembly.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion proposed to be moved would have the effect

of suspending Standing Order No. 83. Therefore, it needs

the  assent of hon. Members. Is it the pleasure of  hon.

Members that the motion be moved?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Then it cannot be moved. Perhaps the

and give the Minister as much time as possible to reply.

of  the  fact  that yesterday the Member for  Queenstown

this.  The  sooner  the Member for the Southern  Islands

completes  his speech, the better it will he. The  Prime

Minister  will  have  other opportunities - a  ministerial

statement perhaps.

<br><br>7.24 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

submit my views for the consideration of the Government.

I  shall discuss the general and detailed aspects of the

financial policy when we come to the Committee stage.



<br><br>7.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, today is supposed

to  be  the  day  for the Opposition. To  my  mind,  the

opportunity they have had of putting forward their cause

by criticising and pointing out the inadequacies of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1611</b></font><br><br>



Government in a rational way has been completely lost.  We

may  put  the  contributions  we  have  had  from  Members

opposite in a few categories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is the usual political line completely

unrelated  to  the Budget - to call upon the  Government  to

resign -  political issues which are completely unconnected

with  the  issues before the House. I shall  dismiss  such

comments  with, the contempt that they  deserve.  On  the

other  hand,  a  number of Opposition speakers  have  made

perhaps  well-founded criticisms or  pointed  out  certain

parts  of the Government's financial policy on which  they

are not completely clear. Therefore, in the short time  at

my  disposals I intend to dwell on the second category  of

the remarks by Opposition Members in this debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Queenstown falls into the first

category.  We  have wasted nearly an hour on a  thoroughly

fruitless, bellicose, inaccurate, and illogical address by

him.  Surely when you talk about the Budget, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  the first thing you have to do is to get your  facts

and  figures  right.  It is obvious that  the  Member  for

Queenstown  got all his facts muddled up and his  figures

confused. His only contribution to this debate - if  we  can

call  it  a  contribution - was a long political tirade,  so

familiar with Barisan Sosialis Members containing  nothing

but words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim just reiterates in the most

heinous  and blatant way the untruth that he uttered  last

year,  that  the new taxes we introduced were designed  to

tax  the  poor  and that only $100,000 came from  the  big

European firms. It is absolutely amazing that a man who is

an accountant could come to such a conclusion. No basis in

fact, none in evidence, and none whatsoever in logic. So I

shall  dismiss  the speeches of these two Members  of  the

Assembly with the contempt that they deserve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose, instead, to discuss here a number of salient

points  raised  by  other Members of the Opposition.  They

are:  first,  the reason for the shortage  in  technicians

which  is  preventing  the  full  implementation  of   our

Development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1612</b></font><br><br>



Plan;   second,  the  Economic  Development   Board,   its

functions and programme, and the problems facing  it;  and

third,  industrialisation. If I have time,  I  shall  deal

with  certain  matters  raised by  the  Member  for  Anson

regarding social insurance, the Work Brigade and  possibly

some  matters  raised by the Member  for  Farrer  Park  in

connection with loans and subsidies to the Housing  Board,

accommodation, assessment of empty houses, and  our  plans

for the expansion of the water supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, the shortage of technicians. That fact is

admitted  all  round. The Government has  never  tried  to

conceal  the  fact  that  there is  a  grave  shortage  of

engineers,  architects and other grades which is  impeding

the  implementation of our Development Plan. It  has  been

alleged  by some Members that this is due to the  arrogant

attitude  of the Government and political interference  in

technical matters. Sir, allegations are very easy to make.

But  not  the  slightest shred of evidence  has  been  put

forward  in support of these grave allegations. They  have

not  quoted  one  instance  in which  an  engineer  or  an

architect  or a quantity surveyor has left the service  of

the Government either because of political interference or

because of inadequate pay. But be that as it may, I  think

I  should  give  some  details of how  the  Government  is

proposing  to  remedy the situation. I will  talk  on  the

subject  in general terms. We have approached a number  of

governments  and asked them to recruit for us  technicians

in  different  grades.  This is  a  vital  matter  because

whether  or  not  we can fulfil the Four-Year  Development

Plan  depends on whether we can get the skilled men to  do

it.  So  far  as the present position goes, we  have  made

fairly  good progress with the U.K. Government. Our  terms

are these. We say that we are prepared to recruit overseas

engineers and technicians, but we are not prepared to  pay

them  more  than  what we pay our own officers.  Otherwise

that  would  be  one  of  the grounds  which  will  breed

discontent, jealousy, a decrease in morale and so on.  The

British Government have agreed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1613</b></font><br><br>



that  they  will  pay the expatriate element  - what  is

called the inducing element - which includes expatriation

pay,  passages,  home  leave and that  sort  of  thing.

Agreement would be reached any moment now, after  which

advertisements will appear in the newspapers in  London

and  elsewhere calling for applications to these posts.

We have also made some arrangements with the Government

of  Israel, and, as I mentioned in my Budget Statement,

we  have had three technicians so far in the fields  of

engineering, architecture and so forth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson, in one of his rather high-spirited moments, has ascribed this failure to get

technicians entirely to the arrogance of the P.A.P. and

the  fact  that  the  image  of  Singapore  is  not  an

attractive one. He may he true. He may have  the  facts

for  coming to his conclusions. But let us say this - who

are  the  persons responsible for creating such  a  bad

public image of Singapore abroad?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I say it is the Members of the

Opposition,  particularly  the  Member  for  Anson  who

cannot  possibly  control himself. I mean  between  his

tongue  and his mind there is inadequate co-ordination,

and  he  speaks  certain things which  his  mind  never

intends.   These   are  the  people   who,   by   their

exaggeration,  have created the impression  that  there

has   been   political  interference  in   professional

matters. These people have never been able td  quote  a

single instance. But the Member for Anson has at  least

honestly  pointed out a real reason, and that  is  that

there  is  a  world-wide  shortage  of  engineers   and

technicians. If you want to have them, you have to  pay

the price.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Have you?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> We are negotiating with the

British  Government.  They  are  prepared  to  pay  the

additional amount, and if they are prepared to  do  so,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, why should we refuse to  accept  it?

This  is  an  absolutely vital point in our Development

Plan.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1614</b></font><br><br>



As  I have mentioned, we have stepped up the awards for

scholarships in engineering, chemistry and so on and so

forth - several  posts - but  this  would  not  solve  our

immediate problem, because the bright boys and girls we

send  abroad now will not be back until about  five  or

six  years. In the meantime, we must get these  people.

If  we do not succeed to the extent that we wish,  then

Mr  Speaker, Sir,I can assure you that it is not  for

want of price.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Economic Development Board. There has

been  general relief expressed by Members opposite that

at  last the Board has been established. We have  never

pretended  that it is an easy thing to set up  because,

as part of our election programme, we said that we were

going  to  set up this Board and provide it  with  vast

sums  of money - $100 million. If you are going to  give

an  organisation  a huge sum of money,  you  must  make

absolutely  sure that they can spend this money  wisely

and  for  the purpose for which the money was intended.

We  took some two years to set up the Board. I  do  not

think  we  can be accused of being dilatory about  this

matter.  We do not pretend to he geniuses who have  the

right  solution at the finger tips and can  make  vital

decisions of great import just off the cuff. We have to

consult international experts. And we did. There is  no

need  to  apologise for that. And we have set  up  the

Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometimes I feel the Member for Anson is saying,

"Look,  at  long  last! What have you to  do?"  I  have

explained at great length that the way to do  it  is  a

step-by-step  process,  that is,  by  getting  experts,

setting up commissions and getting views all round.  We

took  a  long  time recruiting personnel. We  have  had

offers  from various organisations saying, "  I  think

this  man  is  good." We rejected  them  after  we  had

interviewed  them. We found thqy were not the  sort  of

people we think we should have. If we wanted to produce

quick  results, I would say that the P.A.P.  Government

would  be well advised to follow the techniques or  the

methods  of  the Member for Anson. When  he  was  Chief

Minister, I was then a student in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1615</b></font><br><br>



the  London School of Economics. One morning, to  my

complete  surprise, I was called to  the  office  and

told  that there was a trunk call from Singapore from

the  Chief Minister, and I thought some calamity must

have  befallen the country. So I went there, and  the

Member  for Anson, as Chief Minister, rang me up  and

said,  "Look,  a serious decision has been  made.  We

want  to appoint an Economic Adviser. Will you please

ask  Professor Arthur Lewis to take on the  job?"  He

said  the  Professor  was  absolutely  vital  to  the

country.  The  survival  of  the  State  depended  on

whether  Arthur Lewis would take up the  appointment.

Whereupon  I  took the first train from Lancaster/St.

Pancras  to Birmingham, rang up Professor  Lewis  and

said,  "Look,  I  have a proposal to make.  My  Chief

Minister has asked whether you will take on the job."

And  he  said,  "Yes,  yes. Queer  chap,  your  Chief

Minister.  He rang me up last night. He  rang  me  up

when  I  was having my bath." And he said to me,  "Go

home.  You  know that even if I took on the  job,  it

would  not make two pence worth of difference because

that is not the sort of thing you want in Singapore."

As I have said, if we want to proceed with this quick

method of appointing advisers to the Board, we  could

have  done  it. But I do not think that is  going  to

produce any result at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been alleged by some Members of the

Opposition - although  others  disagree;  they  take  a

diametrically  opposite point  of  view - that  we  are

trying  to  go  out  of  our way  to  please  foreign

investors and foreign capitalists while ignoring  the

local  industrialists. That was the  view,  I  think,

expressed by the Member for Queenstown. He quoted  at

length  from  our  manifesto, that  we  do  not  need

foreign  capital, and what are we doing now?  On  the

other  hand,  the Member for Hong Lim,  who  is  more

worldly  wise  in  his  methods,  because  he  is   a

businessman, - the   Member   for   Queenstown   is   a

doctor - knows that local businessmen are merchants and

traders  and  they cannot open Factories unless  they

are guided and assisted. That is our point. There is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1616</b></font><br><br>



nothing we are doing now that contradicts our  policy

which  was  stated at the general elections,  namely,

that  our survival did not depend on foreign capital,

because we have a sufficient amount of capital  here.

But the foreign manufacturers and industrialists,  as

distinct  from  the capital they bring to  Singapore,

can  provide  the  know-how. That is important.  Your

local businessman has the capital. But he has no know-how.  That is the point the Member for Hong  Lim  was

making.  Very often the foreign manufacturer,  though

he  has  the  know-how,  does not  have  the  capital

because of exchange control, restrictions and various

other  reasons.  The policy of the Government  is  to

bring  local businessmen in partnership with overseas

industrialists in some form of participation  to  the

benefit of both. It is, of course, untrue to say that

we  are  neglecting  the  local  industrialists.  The

majority of firms receiving pioneer certificates  are

local  firms. The majority of firms for which we  are

providing  factory  sites for  industrialisation  are

local  firms.  I  would not agree entirely  with  the

Member for Hong Lim who says that all businessmen are

commercial agents, because there is a small - true  it

is  a  small - but  vigorous  and  expanding  class  of

Chinese  local industrialists. It is our business  to

encourage them in every way possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an Economic Development Board to give them

loans  on  reasonable terms v.-high they  cannot  get

from banks, because our banks only give loans against

trade  credit - short-term  loans.  Thus  the  Board

gives  most  valuable  assistance  to  them.  We  are

starting  an  Industrial  Research  Unit  which   was

brought  up by the Member for Anson. I can  say  that

the  target date for starting this unit, as  told  by

me, would be March next year. Possibly things can  go

wrong - equipment  may be delayed - in  which  case,  it

would be June next year. In this way, we can give our

industrialists   assistance - in  technical   know-how,

capital  and  advice,  if  needed.  Of  course,   the

Economic  Development Board hope  to  have  a  fairly

comprehensive consultative service. But here again we

are held up because we have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1617</b></font><br><br>



to  recruit really first-class men. We have  been  in

touch with the World Bank and the United Nations, but

it  is  not easy to get good men. If you are prepared

to  put  up  with second or third-rate men,  you  can

start  some  sort  of  service. But  when  industries

confront some problems, you will find that they  will

not be able to solve them. In fact, for all practical

purposes, it is not worth setting up the unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I will say a few words about the steel

mill. From what the Members of the Opposition say,  I

gather the impression that they believe a steel  mill

to  be something of a gigantic establishment. Is  it?

It  need not be so. There is a scale for these  steel

mills. You can go for blast furnace. Then, of course,

there is a certain minimum scale, where, say, half  a

million  tons a year and nothing less than that  will

do.  On the other hand, techniques have been deeloped

where  you can go for smaller scale steel mills  with

every  prospect  of  success. In this  case,  it  was

expressed,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, whether  we  are  ever

going to have a steel mill at all. I mentioned in  my

Budget  Statement  that we have  brought  together  a

number of local businessmen to start this steel mill.

They  have  been negotiating with a Japanese  company

and  not  the  Government. The  Government  has  been

trying  to  bring them together. There are advantages

in  joint participation, but unfortunately the  local

men  thought  that the terms of the Japanese  company

for  capital  participation were too stiff.  So  they

said, "Well, we just run the show ourselves." This is

not  Government putting up the money and,  therefore,

you  do not know whether you will succeed or not. But

these  are  hardheaded businessmen, two of  whom  are

abroad  now, ordering plant, interviewing  applicants

for  posts arid so on. They are putting up about  $10

million   in  this  project.  Let  us  say   when   a

businessman  puts up that amount of money,  he  would

have a shrewd idea that it is workable, feasible  and

profitable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social insurance is a subject so dear to the heart

of  the Member for Anson. Then, of course, as a great

humanitarian,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1618</b></font><br><br>



he  could  not  feel otherwise than  to  deplore  the

distress, suffering and poverty of those who are  not

fortunate. Sir, I think the matter was discussed once

in   this  House  and  reasons  were  given  why  the

Government  finds  it difficult to proceed  with  the

introduction of social insurance. I can  assure  you,

Mr Speaker, Sir, that it is not because I am utterly

devoid of human feeling, as has been expressed by the

Member  for Queenstown, who thinks I am just a  chess

player, a calculator -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Zugzwang.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> - and even the Member for Anson

thought  that I could do more with warmth of feeling.

But,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, when you start, this  social

security  scheme, it is absolutely  vital  that  your

workers and their leaders accept social insurance  as

social security. If they do not accept it, then I say

it  is utterly fruitless; first, if it is just an act

of  paternalism, which we are now aiming to  do,  and

secondly, they will oppose it and if there are  ways,

jam up the administration -



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> What about the employers?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Nobody, of course, is, Sir, I

myself  had  a series of discussions with illustrious

trade union leaders such as Mr Lim Ching Siong,  Mr

Woodhull, Mr Dominic Puthucheary and others,  and  I

put  forth  before them proposals, not in  principle,

but  a  cut  and  dried administrative scheme.  Oddly

enough, Dominic's brother, James, the Chairman of the Central Provident Fund -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Ex-chairman.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> - ex-chairman - had worked out

this  scheme.  We said, "Well, let us introduce  this

thing", and they said, "No." What was the outcome  of

it?  This is for the benefit of the workers  and  the

State, because then you will do away with one of  the

most  important reasons for industrial  strife,  that

is,  redundancy.  Sir,  they said,  "No."  There  are

reasons - genuine or not, it is not for me to say. They

say we cannot persuade the workers to make their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1619</b></font><br><br>



contribution. They say if you give it to  them  free,

that  is  another matter. But, Sir, social  insurance

means the beneficiary must make a contribution.  Then

the  benefits  are theirs as of right, unlike  public

assistance where there is no contribution. When a man

accepts  public  assistance, there  is  something  of

charity  about it which does not taste right  in  the

mouth.  Therefore, social insurance. I  say  if  such

illustrious  trade union leaders do not  want  social

security for the workers, it is hardly fair  for  the

Government,  Mr Speaker, Sir, to introduce  it.  The

Barisan Sosialis never stop reminding us how close we

are  to the masses. Let them decide. The moment  they

say  they  want it, well, implementation is merely  a

technical problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Bring it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It is merely a technical problem,

I  agree with you. But the workers' leaders must want

it  first.  We  are not going to ram  it  down  their

throats.  No more than we are going to chase  student

pickets by force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Itching powder?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Itching powder in another matter.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Barisan Sosialis is going to

decide everything for you?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Now, Sir, the Work Brigade. There

may  be trouble there. A statement which causes great

hilarity,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  in  Barisan  Sosialis

circles - I  do  not  know whether  I  should  put  any

interpretation on it - but that is past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Work Brigade was conceived as an unemployment

assistance scheme. There were thousands of young  men

and  women coming out to work but are unable to  find

work.  What are they going to do? They loiter around.

So we say, give them work to do, organise camps, feed

them,  discipline their lives, get them to do  useful

work,  pay  them out of consideration a  daily  rated

allow-a  flee. That is the way the Work  Brigade  was

organised  and  conceived. They are  not  a  fulltime

working   force  because  it  is  out  intention   - [Interruption]



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1620</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> - that they stay in the Work

Brigade  perhaps 3 months or 6 months  or  9  months,

during  which time we hope to find them jobs  in  the

Government service or the statutory authorities. This

is  the period when they are trained and given useful

work,  when  their  aptitudes  can  be  assessed  and

training courses organised for them to fit those  who

are  more  able  for  productive work.  The  type  of

project that the Work Brigade is allotted to  do  and

the  method  of  carrying out the work  has  been  so

designed that you use the largest possible number  of

hands with the minimum amount of machinery. The  cost

does  not  matter. If we say this is a  Work  Brigade

project,  digging a ditch or putting a road,  and  we

need  not want to do it in the cheapest way,  we  can

let it out on contract, as the Member for Farrer Park

says,  which  is the thing to do. It  will  save  the

Government  money. But, Sir, we have to do  something

for  these  young  men and women who otherwise  would

just  be  cooling  their heels. We were  hoping  that

discipline  could  help the Work Brigade  develop  so

that  we  could find employment for them not only  in

Government  service  but also in private  employment.

They  can choose whichever form of private employment

that pays. They can say yes or no. Unfortunately, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, for reasons which I will  not  discuss

now, the members of the Brigade have different views

on   the  subject.  They  think  they  are  full-time

workers. If we are to treat them as fully paid  full-time  workers,  I will say, all right, two-thirds  of

them  would go, in fact: probably the whole bunch  of

them  would  go because we could carry  on  with  the

projects  far  cheaper by using  ordinary  commercial

methods. The project, therefore, is a temporary phase

where a young man does some work, lives a disciplined

camp life, has a chance of getting instruction. It is

not  employment  in the sense that others  have  some

work  result. It is quite different. We  have  found

permanent  jobs  for more than 1,000 members  of  the

Work  Brigade in the two years, and I say that  is  a

good record. To that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1621</b></font><br><br>



extent  we have established a Work Brigade which  has

fulfilled  our  original objective.  Therefore,  Sir,

when these people have the idea that they should form

unions  and  that they should find more pay,  and  if

they  do  press  their point, Mr Speaker  (no  doubt

there  are  less well intentioned people behind  them

egging them on to it), then I say the solution is  to

close down the Work Brigade and save money. So I  say

that  those  members who are now being  misguided  by

various persons should rethink the whole position. It

gives  us  no pleasure, Sir, to close down the  camps

because  we want to provide useful work and  activity

for  these  people. But they are not doing  full-time

work. It is not a full-time proper career. Because if

that  was  so,  the  whole modus  operandi  would  be

different.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have only two minutes to go and there are

some  4 or 5 other topics to go through. I would have

liked  to deal with the subject raised by the  Member

for Farrer Park, because I think it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1622</b></font><br><br>



is an important issue, particularly the future of the

Public  Utilities Board, and an expansion scheme  for

water  and light. Unfortunately, time does not permit

me to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the request that we should reappraise the

assessment of empty houses, I have already said in my

Budget  Statement last year that should  there  be  a

state  where large numbers of houses are  left  empty

because  the  housing shortage has been overcome,  or

any other reason, then the position will be reviewed.

If  the  Member for Farrer Park thinks that  we  have

reached  that stage, then I say the Government  would

he well advised to examine this problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Assembly approves the financial policy of

the Government for the year 1962.
