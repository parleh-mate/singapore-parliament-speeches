<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>CHARGING METHOD FOR MOBILE PHONE USERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Switch from Mobile-Party-Pays to Calling-Party-Pays)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon</b> asked the Acting Minister for

Information,  Communications and the  Arts  if  the  Infocomm

Development Authority of Singapore will make a decision  soon

on  whether  to  switch  from the existing  Mobile-Party-Pays

(MPP)   charging  method  to  the  Calling-Party-Pays   (CPP)

charging method for mobile phone users.

<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim (Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Mr David T. E. Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, IDA is now

examining  the  pros  and  cons  of  mandating  that   mobile

operators  switch  from  a Mobile-Party-Pays  (MPP)  charging

method to the Calling-Party-Pays (CPP) regime.  Moving to the

CPP  system may lower mobile rates.  But, on the other  hand,

fixed line users may have to pay more for calls between fixed-line and mobile users.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deciding which system benefits users more is a complex

issue.   MITA  is  therefore conducting a  detailed  economic

analysis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1827</b></font><br><br>



to  examine,  among other things, the capital  and  operating

costs  involved in implementing the change from MPP  to  CPP,

how   the  CPP  charging  system  could  impact  prices  that

consumers  pay, the system of inter-operator network  charges

for  both  fixed  and  mobile  operators,  and  consumer  and

industry behaviour arising from such a change.  We expect  to

reach a decision by the fourth quarter of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandating a change in the charging method is a serious

matter, because it would have a major impact on both industry

and  consumers.   This was why IDA had,  earlier  this  year,

conducted  a  public consultation to seek views  on  the  two

charging  regimes.  However, only two consumers had responded

to the public consultation.  IDA is, therefore, conducting  a

consumer   survey  to  obtain  more  comprehensive   feedback

directly from mobile phone users, in order to complement  the

views obtained from industry in the public consultation.  IDA

will  incorporate the survey results and consumer views  into

its study.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, I am sure the

Minister is aware that most countries have already opted  for

the  CPP system.  Although he has stated that the fixed  line

callers  may  end  up  paying more,  is  he  aware  that  the

experience in other countries is that, under the CPP  system,

operators  would  actually come out with a great  variety  of

charging plans and thereby offering consumers greater choice,

which in the end actually results in lower prices?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, indeed, a number of other countries

have  adopted the CPP system.  In Singapore, the adoption  of

MPP has not hindered the growth of the industry.  In fact, we

have  one  of  the  highest rates of mobile  phone  usage  in

Singapore.  Our penetration rate is higher than 70%.  I think

the  latest figure shows that it is about 71%.  So  this  has

not hindered the growth of the industry.  But for the reasons

I  cited earlier, switching from one system to the other does

have  implications for the marketplace.  So we want  to  take

time to study this issue carefully.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Thank you, Sir, for

allowing me to continue.  Yesterday, I started my speech  and

gave  my  impression  that  while the  streaming  system  was

intended to allow each child to learn and progress at his  or

her  own  pace,  the problem seems to be in implementing  the

system.   For  many reasons, including the  pressure  of  the

school  ranking system, schools and principals end up putting

their best resources to focus on the EM1 and EM2 streams,  or

the  best  streams in the school system, so that the  overall

grades  of  the  school look good.  The end effect  has  been

detrimental,  both  in  terms of  the  failure  to  let  late

bloomers  bloom at all, and in terms of destroying the  self-esteem  of our children at such a young age by putting labels

on them.  The Minister's argument has been that the streaming

system  has  prevented  wastage  and  resulted  in  very  few

children dropping out of the school system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest to the Minister that he would

still  achieve no dropouts from the education  system  if  he

allows  every  child to be streamed at the Primary  6  level,

after  the PSLE examinations.  There are many ways to skin  a

cat  -  to borrow a phrase from the Malaysians - and  one  of

them  in  the education system is to categorise our  children

after  the  PSLE examinations, a bit later, and  send  weaker

children  to  technical schools to pursue a different  route.

This  one  change  of streaming children from  Primary  4  to

Primary 6 level will satisfy many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1829</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans who have a major issue with the current system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues I would like the Minister to address are,

firstly,  are  there any scientific reasons for  continuously

streaming our children at Primary 2, Primary 4, Primary 6 and

Secondary  2  levels?   Children are moved  every  two  years

depending on their academic results.  From what I understand,

the  selection  of  the  Primary 4  level  was  an  arbitrary

decision  for lack of scientific information, when  the  then

Education  Minister, Dr Goh Keng Swee, made the  decision  on

the  streaming system.  The issues with continuous  streaming

are:  How  do  we teach children about friendships,  building

bonds  and  to  help those who have different ability  levels

compared to themselves when they are moved constantly?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, can the Ministry do a study on the attitudes

of  teachers  and students towards EM3 students?   While  the

intent of streaming is to allow them to progress at different

levels,  the real practice is that teachers dread taking  EM3

classes  when,  in fact, they should see it as  a  challenge.

The very fact that this happens means that the system has not

been able to achieve very good EM3 to EM2 crossovers. Can the

Minister  share with the House on the success  rate  of  such

crossovers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, does the Ministry have a performance target as

to  how many crossovers it hopes to achieve every year?  Lack

of  such  performance measures means that there is a lack  of

interest to see many more EM3 students making it back to  the

higher streams.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Ministry wants to take a conservative approach to

changing  the system, can we implement a hybrid system  where

children  are  kept  in the same class  and  share  a  common

curriculum for most of their contact time, and then break  up

for  specific  areas  to  focus, for  children  of  different

abilities?   Perhaps we can choose a few  schools  with  good

PSLE track records to experiment with the hybrid system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, in the USA, a new law was passed, called

the "No Child Left Behind



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1830</b></font><br><br>



Act"  (NCLB  Act  of  2002).  This Act, among  other  things,

places   important  priority  on  targeting   assistance   to

society's most disadvantaged students in the hope of  closing

the  learning divide once and for all.  A learning divide  is

what  our  education system is creating in Singapore,  in  my

opinion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that this is such an important issue that we

perhaps need a whole day session to debate this issue.  If  I

ask  the  MPs  here to put up their hands as to whether  they

agree - I would not try it - I think many would not.  I  have

spoken to many teachers and principals.  Many of them do  not

agree with this system too, although they are afraid to speak

up.   Most  Singaporeans  do  not agree  with  the  streaming

system, as it is.  I hope some changes will be made.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, this year, the

Education  Ministry  has been allocated  the  second  highest

budget.  In fact, a total of $6.79 billion has been allocated

to  the  Education Ministry, which is higher than the  amount

allocated  in  FY2001.  This is a strong  indication  of  the

Government's commitment to human capital development.   There

is no doubt that we have a good education system supported by

a  dedicated  teaching staff and a population that  places  a

high  premium on education as a means to uplift itself.   But

then,  Sir,  no  system  is perfect,  and  a  responsive  and

adaptable  system must take into account the  changing  needs

and concerns of those that it is designed to serve.  It is in

this  light  that  one has to view this  on-going  debate  on

streaming.   It is not an indictment of the whole system,  as

our   overall  educational  framework  is  sound.   But  some

policies clearly need some tweaking as we move along.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the desired outcomes of the education system,

one  may ask?  As many see it today, it is to feed the labour

market and ensure that everyone has the skill to find a  job.

There  is  nothing  wrong  with this  and,  in  fact,  it  is

something which is very necessary if we do not want  to  have

social problems.  Take the example of Malaysia, for instance,

where there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1831</b></font><br><br>



are  university graduates with irrelevant degrees  and  hence

they cannot find jobs.  But, then, at the same time, there is

also  nothing wrong to expect our education system to produce

balanced individuals who love education and learning for  the

sake  of  itself and who are capable of independent thinking,

not  mere rote learners, and who are very strongly rooted  in

our  values  as  a society.  The education system  must  also

provide a process of learning that is enjoyable and fun.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure that many of us remember our own

childhood  days  with  fond memories,  the  simple  joys  and

abandonment  of  growing up.  But what  about  our  children?

What  do  they remember about their childhood - examinations,

assessment books, supplementary classes and tuition  classes?

Is  it  right,  one may ask, to put so much pressure  on  our

children at such a young age?  This is precisely what happens

with  streaming.  Within a period of six years that he is  in

primary  school,  a child will have to go through  two  major

examinations - one when he is streamed at Primary 4  and  the

other  when  he  sits for the PSLE - and the two examinations

are  very  close to each other.  After a child  has  finished

mugging for the streaming examinations, he has to immediately

start  ramming up in Primary 5 in preparation for  the  PSLE.

Small wonder then that in a survey of 1,742 children aged  10

and  12,  commissioned by SPH last year, students  said  that

they  were more afraid of examinations than of their  parents

dying.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we also have to ask the question whether it is

realistic  for us to assess a child's capabilities and  later

stream  him  based  only  on the examination  results,  which

actually measure performance over a very short period of  two

hours  for each subject.  Based on this, we then decide  that

the  child  should go to the fast, the average or  the  slow-learning  track.  Many experts in education are in  agreement

that  at the age of 10 years, a child's cognitive skills  are

not  fully  developed  yet.  So, is it  reasonable  to  start

streaming our children at this age?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1832</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of very great concern to parents is the negative

effect of labelling - EM1, EM2 and EM2, slightly better  than

the  old  system  of classifying children  as  being  in  the

Normal,  Express or Monolingual streams.  But,  nevertheless,

it  is still streaming.  In those days, if you were a "Mono",

then  you  are  in deep trouble.  People look  at  you  in  a

certain  way  as  if  you  are a  moron  or  doomed  forever.

Although  the labels have changed, the implications  of  this

labelling  process remain.  If you are in EM1, you are  first

class;  EM2, second class; and EM3, sad to say,  you  are  in

third  class.  What is worse is that this labelling could  by

itself  be  a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Instead of  spurring

children  to greater heights, those labelled EM3  could  very

well  say  that they are useless and a failure,  and  nothing

that they do can change the situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is it fair, reasonable and justifiable to label

children at such a young age, and thereby sowing the seeds of

elitism and segmentation right from primary school?  Have  we

ever considered the impact and damage that such a system will

have  on our children's self-esteem and self-confidence, when

they are in their crucial years of self-discovery and are  in

the  process  of developing emotional and social  anchors  to

guide them as they grow into adults?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would therefore like to join my other colleagues,

who have spoken before me, to ask the Ministry to revisit the

streaming  policy.  Please consider doing away with streaming

at  Primary  4.  The children's examination results  at  PSLE

are,  in  my  view, sufficient for assessing  our  children's

capabilities  and to stream them according to their  results.

Alternatively, if this is not possible ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> 30 seconds, Mdm Halimah.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, I am finishing. Alternatively,

Sir,  if  this  is  not possible, I would  like  to  ask  the

Minister to consider allowing some schools or classes not  to

have streaming.  I would also like to ask the Minister to  do

of   EM1,   EM2  and  EM3.   It  has  very  serious  negative

connotations and I am not convinced, just like many  parents,

that it is good for our society in the long run.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I agree with the

objective of streaming if it is to maximise the potential and

ability  of  each  individual, develop  his  or  her  special

talents and minimise wastage of our education system.

However,  I  echo  the  concerns of my hon.  colleagues,  Mdm

Halimah  and  Mr  Inderjit Singh, on  the  shortfall  of  our

current streaming system.  As I see it, there are some  areas

of our current streaming system that must be addressed before

we can really achieve the objective we set out to do.

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, streaming at Primary 4 is too early, as children

at  this  age  are  not  fully developed  psychologically  or

connectively.  And this is the point that I alluded to during

the  debate  on the President's Address, and Mdm Halimah  has

also just reiterated the point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, streaming uses only academic results as the

only  criteria.   This  fails to  recognise  other  types  of

talents  in areas such as sports, arts and music.  If  we  do

not  recognise these talents, how can we maximise and develop

them?   Is there any surprise that we have not much  luck  in

achieving sports excellence?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, using academic criteria alone will also result

in  a  kiasu examination-oriented mentality, and defeats  the

true purpose of education.  It makes study and examination  a

source  of stress, just as Mdm Halimah quoted the SPH  survey

in  2000, that students were more afraid of examinations  and

tests  than of their parents dying.  I would be very sad  if,

one day, my daughter comes and tells me, "Dad, I would rather

you  die than I fail the examination."  Maybe, at that  point

of time, I would choose to die!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the present system does not address the need

of various groups of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1834</b></font><br><br>



students  who  do not do well at their streaming examination.

Under  the current system, if a student does not do  well  in

the examination, he is in EM3.  That is it!  However, we must

know  that  children may have done poorly for  a  variety  of

reasons,  other  than being a slow learner or  of  lower  IQ.

First,  there  may  be a group of students who  are  socially

disadvantaged,  such as those who come from broken  families.

This group of children would need social intervention to help

them,  and  not  a  placement in  EM3.   The  next  group  of

students,  who  may  not  do well, are  those  who  may  have

learning  disabilities, such as dyslexia,  and,  again,  they

need  special education and not EM3.  The third group may  be

those  who  have  just bad luck.  This poor kid  may  be  too

nervous  and  did  not  do well in the  examination,  or  his

parents  might  be  quarrelling the night  before,  therefore

affecting  his mental readiness for examination.  This  group

of  children need a second chance to sit for the examination,

and  not  a  placement  in EM3 that labels  him  permanently.

Therefore,  may  I  urge the Minister to review  the  age  of

streaming, and maybe do it at a much later age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry should also put in extra efforts to

identify the underlying causes of students who do not do well

in  the streaming - I have stated earlier the reasons for not

doing well - and help them accordingly.  Sir, I also urge the

Minister  to put in appropriate measures to spot and  develop

talents in non-academic fields.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, as I have

anticipated,  what  I wish to say in this House  has  already

been  the subject of much passionate debate.  But the subject

of  streaming continues to be a cause of so much anguish that

I  feel it would be morally irresponsible for me not to speak

up, at the risk of repeating what my colleagues have said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state, at the outset, that I think, overall, we

do  have  a good education system, one that is efficient  and

focused.   And it has succeeded in producing many generations

of skilled workers to support our economic thrusts.  It has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1835</b></font><br><br>



placed  Singapore on the world map as a leader in Mathematics

and  Science education and the application of IT to learning.

It  has  grounded  generations  of  school  children  in  the

realities  and  the  joys of multi-racialism  and  harmonious

communal living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 2000, the direction has been towards an ability-driven education to develop and harness the talents of our

students.  But while a differentiated curriculum for students

to  suit  differing aptitudes is administratively  efficient,

the question arises whether the gains to the nation from such

efficiency is outweighed by the psychological cost  this  has

inflicted  on Primary 4 10-year olds and their long suffering

parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we must first give credit where it is due. I know

of  a  Singaporean mother who has just come back from Germany

for her son's education because she feels that the system  in

Germany  is  the other extreme - too relaxed, no  home  work,

everything at one's pace, but usually pegged at the speed  of

the  slowest child.  Sir, I submit this is not the outcome  I

welcome,  as  soon, we, as a nation, may lose our  drive  and

competitive spirit and that is the sure road to perdition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, there is a yawning gap between parents and the

MOE for all its good and noble intentions.  I believe many in

this  House  have  school-going children, or have  interacted

with  other parents, and therefore will understand where  the

stress   point  lies.   At  a  recent  feedback  session   on

Education,  the  subject  that occupied  the  most  time  and

electrified the atmosphere was, as Members will have  guessed

it,  streaming.  One participant even objected  to  the  term

"gifted children".  She asked what does that imply about  the

other children.  Does this mean that they are not gifted?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents say streaming is bad for the following reasons:

streaming,  particularly  at the young  age  of  10  years  - Primary  4  - prematurely labels a child as slow,  a  no-hope

case and affects his self-esteem.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1836</b></font><br><br>



It demoralises the child and may make it difficult for him to

return  to mainstream education later on in Express or Normal

(Academic)  stream.  It disadvantages late bloomers,  causing

him to lose opportunities and also causing the system to lose

what  may  have  turned  out to be a brilliant  scientist  or

entrepreneur.  Einstein, it has been frequently pointed  out,

was not exactly a top student in school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, MOE is strongly convinced that streaming is

good  for  the  following  reasons:   streaming  allows   our

children  to  learn  at  their  own  pace,  and  not   suffer

unnecessary  performance-related stress.  The alternative  to

streaming,  to  quote  the Minister for  Education  from  the

Budget 2001 Committee of Supply debate, is that many children

will  fail  and they will drop out of school.  No doubt,  MOE

will  again furnish more and updated statistics this time  to

show the benefits of streaming.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am persuaded that there are merits to both sets

of  arguments.  However, I strongly feel that it is  time  to

refine the system, to close this gap between parents and MOE.

This  is  especially  critical  when  we  are  committed   to

maximising the potential of every Singaporean and  trying  to

nurture an entrepreneurial spirit in our young. We should not

disillusion them by labelling them as no-hope cases at such a

young age.  As noted by the Prime Minister, "Morale is a very

important thing.  If we feel demoralised, then we are not  in

the mood to fight competitively."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister if there are plans

to  review and modify the current system to mitigate some  of

these concerns.  For a start, may I suggest that the Ministry

assure  parents  that  as much attention,  if  not  more,  is

focused   on  these  "laggard"  children  to  develop   their

potential as for the other cohorts.  The successes  of  these

children  should be celebrated as much, if not more than  the

others,  so that parents' concerns are mitigated and children

assured that there are many roads to success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like my parliamentary colleagues before me, I would

like to urge the Ministry to heed the call to send all cows



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1837</b></font><br><br>



to  the  vets, for surely this cow needs a thorough  check-up

and medication, if not a worse fate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, with the world

changing  at  a  fast  pace  to  one  that  requires   future

generations to have critical, creative and innovative  minds,

there  is  indeed a danger of our young getting lost  in  our

nation  building process.  I therefore believe it  is  timely

now  that  the  Ministry of Education  review  the  streaming

system.   There are side effects about streaming of  students

under the current education system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, by categorising our young into

academically enumerated groupings, this reinforces  the  view

that  only  children  who  are academically  intelligent  are

valuable   and   relevant  assets  of  the   future.    Those

individuals  who  are talented in other  aspects,  be  it  in

sports or music, etc, seem to have no niche in this streaming

system.   Although the recent announcement of setting  up  of

the speciality school can address these problems somewhat,  I

am of the view that the streaming system should be changed to

better  reflect  the  emphasis on individual  capability  and

talent in areas other than just academia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, nation building means coagulating a diverse

population  into one entity.  The streaming system  does  not

encourage  the  recognition and toleration  of  diversity  in

terms  of  talents  and capabilities.  The  streaming  system

suggests  that  we  are judged purely in  terms  of  academic

performance.  In other words, only the academically sound are

deemed  working  to  be  our best pillars  of  tomorrow.   Of

course,  not  all those in the best stream eventually  become

leaders, and neither will those in the lower stream  fall  by

the  wayside.  But, as a general trend, what I have suggested

-   that the system has inculcated important values which,  I

emphasise again, are academic capabilities  -  is valid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, although the purpose of streaming is to

help an individual student to develop his or her potential to

the fullest, by being able to study in his or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1838</b></font><br><br>



her  own  pace, the question is whether streaming  itself  is

effective enough to develop a child's potential.  Earlier,  I

have mentioned that streaming will reinforce academic ability

as  the  only  criterion for judging students.  However,  the

question is: what exactly constitutes academic ability?  Some

children  are  better with their mathematical  understanding,

some better with Science, and some are better with languages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current streaming system streams in accordance with

the   cluster  of  subjects  and  determination  of  academic

ability, in totality, in the cluster.  Such a system fails to

take   into  account  the  relative  strengths  and  relative

interests  of each student based on the individual  subjects.

This is even more jarring at the Secondary 2 and Secondary  3

levels.   For example, a non-Pure Science Express stream,  or

non-Express  stream student, is likely to  face  a  situation

that  his interest in reading individual Pure Science module,

such  as  Biology,  might be hampered  as  a  result  of  the

streaming.   Also,  for that matter, a Pure Science  streamed

student  might never have the opportunity to pursue technical

studies, or arts subject at the "O" level, as a result of the

streaming.   This  is  because the current  streaming  system

assumes  that  students streamed to a particular  stream  are

naturally more inclined to certain subjects offered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore ask the Ministry to consider exploring

the idea of organising schools based on subjects.  This means

scrapping the current streaming system based on a cluster  of

subjects  and  replacing it with a system based on  subjects.

Students would be grouped into different classes based on the

merit  of  their individual subject.  Although  it  could  be

argued  that this is still a form of streaming,   I  am  sure

such  a  system of allowing individual students to  learn  at

their  own  pace is more progressive and is likely to  lessen

social  stigma.   This  is not to say  that  schools  are  to

abandon  the  idea of all-rounded education, but  rather  the

main  thrust  of the proposal here is the acceptance  of  the

fact   that  different  students  have  different  strengths.

Hence, there must be avenues, opportunities and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1839</b></font><br><br>



recognition available to allow individual student to  "major"

in  what  he  or  she  loves.   To  allow  the  above  to  be

implemented, there must be a total revamp, in terms of entire

education  process,  such as grading,  protocol,  examination

systems,  admission  requirements, etc, to  support  the  new

education   system   paradigm.   I  do  not   have   specific

recommendations  for  the various components,  which  require

further in-depth studies and analysis for more details.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I support the

principle  of streaming in schools, ie, allowing children  to

study  at their own pace and capabilities.  However, I  would

like  to  appeal  to  the Ministry to look  at  the  parents'

concern.   Streaming  is  not  only  at  Primary  4.   I  see

streaming is done at every year of study.  At Primary 5, if a

student does not do well, he will have to slide down  to  EM2

or  EM3.  This is similarly done in Secondary 1, Secondary  2

and  Secondary 3.  If the students do not do well, they slide

down  to  the Normal stream.  Why do we need to do  streaming

each year?  I would like to propose to do away with streaming

at  each  year  as, in the present system, the  students  are

already  streamed  and their capability of study  at  certain

intervals,  after  Primary 6 and at  Secondary  4.   The  two

stages  at  Primary 4 and Secondary 2 should just be  subject

combinations based on the language capability and interest of

each  child.   Remove the threat that goes with each  student

the  possibility of sliding down to the lower stream at  each

year.   We  should  allow a more flexible stream,  give  more

space  and  time for the children and the parents in  between

the  years, ie, before the major examinations of PSLE and GCE

'O' Level, to explore and have fun in their studies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have included the parents, as I know most parents are

studying alongside with their children in Singapore.   I  did

another  Primary 6 three years ago.  The rush by  parents  to

apply for annual leave



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1840</b></font><br><br>



before  each examination is a common phenomenon.  I  used  to

have female colleagues coming to apply for leave, but now  we

see increasingly more male colleagues coming forward to apply

too - a good sign for the ladies in terms of joint parenting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument is always that the students are allowed to

jump  into  the  upper  stream if they  do  well.   How  many

students, after being shot at the body, face and heart, would

be  able  to swim well in the upper stream, which requires  a

faster  pace and energy?  I chose the face as "mien  zi"  and

the  heart  as  confidence.  At the age of  10-15,  face  and

confidence  are very important to them.  I sincerely  believe

that if the children are motivated with confidence and pride,

they would be able to do well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are our principals so concerned and keen to put the

child  in the lower stream?  Is it the ranking of schools  or

the  actual belief that the child will be better off  in  the

lower stream and could perform better?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next topic is on ranking of good performing schools.

I  sincerely appeal to the Ministry to remove the ranking  of

good performing schools.  What is the purpose of ranking?  To

motivate the schools to perform better?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take two schools, RI and a neighbourhood school,

eg, First Toa Payoh Secondary School.  The assumption is that

we  use  the RI infrastructure - creative and flexible course

content, the support finances and the best-qualified teachers

available.  Can First Toa Payoh Secondary School be  able  to

be  RI,  if it accepts students from the top 1% of  the  PSLE

cohort  with a score of at least 260 points and above?   Yes.

I  believe  most  of  us  would agree that  First  Toa  Payoh

Secondary  School  would rank among the top  schools  without

much  effort.  Would RI then become First Toa Payoh Secondary

School,  a  neighbourhood school, if they accept students  at

<br><br>180&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSLE  scores and above?  RI may not be First  Toa  Payoh

Secondary  School but would move higher in the ranking,  say,

perhaps to that of Sin



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1841</b></font><br><br>



Ming   Secondary   School,  which  is  a  better   performing

neighbourhood  school.   This  is  in  view  of   our   basic

assumption of using RI's support infrastructure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most schools serve different levels of students. We are

ranking   the   schools  with  different  fundamentals,   eg,

comparing Fuji apples with Australian apples.  Both are still

apples  from the external look, but the taste and crunchiness

are  very  different.  Most schools would want to become  the

top 20 schools to attract the top students of the cohort.  It

is  a  cycle.   The schools which want to be ranked  high  to

attract  high-calibre students would have to perform well  in

the  assessment  statistics.  For most of  the  schools,  the

excuse  is  that  the students would perform  better  in  the

Normal  stream  if  they have students who fill  the  Express

stream, but the school does not have a class.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Phua, can you start winding up your

speech, please?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Why not have the time to nurture

these  students, as I understand that there  is  currently  a

software that could even predict a child's performance, based

on PSLE scores?  Why not give the children the opportunity to

perform  better in the schools, as their confidence will  not

be shattered?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I note that Members' speeches are getting

longer and longer by the amendment.  Can I remind Members  to

hold  on  to the virtue of keeping your speeches  short?   Dr

Lily Neo.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, the emphasis of the

Ministry  of  Education thus far has been  primarily  on  the

academic  achievement  of each student  and  maximising  each

child's  potential to the fullest.  The maximum curricula  in

the  name of maximising each child's potential may jeopardise

innovative  skills and creativity in our children,  which  we

are  trying  to promote.  Today, I would like to beseech  the

Ministry  of  Education  to  regard  our  students  not  just

academically  but  in totality, especially the  mental  well-being of our children.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1842</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, psychiatrists at the Institute of Mental

Health  saw  14,000 children.  This could be the tip  of  the

stress  iceberg, as psychiatric conditions are still a stigma

to  many, and many parents do not realise their children need

psychiatric help.  Suicides accounted for 2.2% of all  deaths

in  2000.   6% occurred among the 10-19 age group.   Although

the death rate from suicides has fallen in the past 20 years,

suicides for the 10-19 age group have not fallen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy syllabus, too much homework, enrichment

programmes, assessments and examinations have been  cited  as

the cause of stress.  Some stress can be useful and positive,

but  this is only up to a certain optimal level, beyond which

a  person's performance will deteriorate and may even end  up

with  a  breakdown.   May  I ask the Minister  for  Education

whether  studies have been done to look into  this  and  what

steps  his Ministry would take to rectify policies  that  are

causative factors of stress in our students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who are the surrogate parents during most of

the  day  should  try to care for the students  in  totality.

They  should  be  alert  to pick up  those  in  psychological

anguish and refer them for help if necessary.  Early referral

to  counsellors and doctors will help the students  de-stress

and cope better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streaming in schools and ranking of schools stress

parents.  The students, in turn, feel their stress.  This has

to be addressed accordingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School starting time should be at 8.30 am instead of

<br>7.00 am presently. Many children have to get up at wee hours

of  the morning, especially for those who need to travel  far

from their homes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom learning should be made as interesting as

possible, with technical aids whenever possible to facilitate

learning for students.  This will make learning fun and  less

stressful.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, there has been a downward trend

in the number of students who drop out of school.  At the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1843</b></font><br><br>



primary  level,  the number fell from 1,022 or  2.5%  of  the

Primary  1  cohort in 1998, to 183 or 0.4% in 1999.   At  the

secondary  level, it fell from 1,844 or 4.3% of  the  primary

cohort to 1,400 or 3.5% over the same period.  We should view

student  drop-out rates with a great deal of concern,  as  we

know  that  those who drop out will face serious difficulties

finding decent jobs or fitting into our society, and will  be

trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty.  If, on average, 2,000

children drop out of school every year, there will be  20,000

in  10 years who will join the pool of the unskilled, and  we

will  then have to put in a lot more resources to remedy  the

situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the statistics, I notice that most drop-out

cases occur at Primary 6 and at Secondary 3.  To me, this  is

significant  as  it  indicates that part of  the  problem  is

because of the serious difficulties that they face in  coping

with major examinations, such as PSLE and GCE O-level.  So  I

would like to ask the Minister what measures are currently in

place  to  help such students and prevent them from  dropping

out, and how effective are these measures?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know that in most cases, the problems are deep-rooted, such as dysfunctional families, poor foundation or

negative peer influence.  So the programmes that are  put  in

place  must be multi-pronged to reach out to the families  as

well.   Better,  in my view, to devote more resources  before

they drop out, rather than have the problems compounded later

on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to ask the Minister what follow-up action has been taken to bring drop-outs back to school,

and how successful has the MOE been in this effort?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the

Jack Neo movie "I Not Stupid" was a big hit.  On the surface,

"I Not Stupid" is a light-hearted story about three boys from

different  social  backgrounds who  find  themselves  branded

stupid and lazy all because they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1844</b></font><br><br>



are EM3 students.  But, through their interactions with their

friends and family, we come to see the pressures children and

adults  face  everyday.   Many  parents  who  saw  the  movie

identified with the pressures that their own children face in

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, one of the most emotional scenes of the movie

was  when  Kok Pin, the under-performing student,  wanted  to

commit  suicide  because  he could  not  cope  with  academic

pressures.  It may be an isolated and extreme example, but it

has happened in real life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are these pressures real? Sir, the Far Eastern Economic

Review of 9th August 2001 reported that in the year 2000, our

number of new cases of young people visiting psychiatrists at

Government  clinics  was 2,491, and  half  were  of   primary

school age.  The number has doubled compared to 1990.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can be done to help ease the pressure on students

in  schools?  There are no easy answers.  But the Ministry of

Education must monitor the situation very closely.   We  must

not  wait  for  any more actual and tragic  cases  to  happen

before we spring into action.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, we have

debated  on legislation to protect our children from parental

abuse, to protect them against child labour, etc.  Maybe, one

day,  we  will  need  a  legislation  to  protect  them  from

excessive pressure and stress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our children do face stress from many directions.

Firstly,  they face stress from their schools.  Teachers  and

principals  are  mindful  of the results  of  their  schools,

because  they are ranked every year based on the  performance

of  their students.  I believe that some pressure is good  to

push  the  children  to  go  an extra  mile.   But  excessive

pressure may push them over the limits.  I would like to urge

the Minister to consider replacing the current school ranking

system  with  the  banding system.  The  ranking  system  has

created substantial tension among the schools as they compete

with one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1845</b></font><br><br>



another.   I  believe that the banding system will  ease  the

pressure  on  the schools and, in turn, ease the pressure  on

the  students,  while  still having  sufficient  pressure  to

encourage the schools and the students to do their best.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, our children face pressure from their parents.

Many  young parents today want their children to do  well  in

the  schools, yet they spend little time with their  children

because, very often, both parents are working.  They can only

send  their  kids to the best tuition classes and  hope  that

they  will  outperform  their  neighbour's  kids.   This   is

particularly prevalent in the streaming year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs have spoken about streaming and I would not

belabour this point.  However, I would like to point out that

it  is true that streaming has created stress.  I would  like

to  request the Ministry to be open to alternative  ways  and

explore  some of these to see if it could be done  with  less

stress  on  the  students.  In this regard, I would  like  to

volunteer  myself  to  participate  in  any  review  of   the

streaming exercise, and explore alternatives to see if we can

help our students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area of stress comes from the students

themselves, from their own desire to do well.  This is  good.

However,  when their results are not up to their expectations

or  the expectations of their parents, some of them may  have

problem  coping.  In this regard, psychological and emotional

support for the students is most critical to help them  cope.

I believe that the problems faced by students are often multi-faceted.   It may involve parental problems or problems  with

their siblings.  Sometimes, it may involve financial problems

at home or others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I feel that it is crucial to provide a

holistic,  psychological and emotional support  that  may  be

beyond  the  capability of the non-professional  counsellors.

Hence,  I  would  like to ask the Minister  whether  he  will

consider  providing the schools with funds so that  they  are

able  to  engage professional counsellors rather than retired

teachers or, better still, allow them to tie up directly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1846</b></font><br><br>



with  professional organisations, such as the Family  Service

Centres,  to  provide  professional and holistic  counselling

services  to the students and, sometimes, to the  parents  of

the  students.   This will also help ease  the  load  of  the

teachers, who should really focus on teaching.  Direct  link-up  between  the  schools and the professional  organisations

will also help build up rapport and enhance the effectiveness

of  the  support  provider.  They can also become  more  pro-active  in  helping the school to identify students  who  are

potentially at risk, so that problems can be dealt with at an

early stage.

Sir,  once again, children are precious, and all of  us  will

agree  that  we  must  remake  our  education  system,  where

necessary,  to ensure that our children can grow  up  with  a

balanced character.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister will take these suggestions

into  consideration and, hopefully, we will not see  the  day

where  we  need  to  introduce a Bill on  protection  of  our

children against stress and pressure.

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, along the line of my colleague

who  spoke earlier, I would also like to ask for a review  of

the  existing  system  of  providing counselling  service  in

schools,  which is currently quite ad-hoc.  I would  like  to

suggest that a more formal arrangement be put in place  where

a  trained counsellor is employed by schools or a cluster  of

schools for the following reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, MOE has said that its education system is

capability-driven.   This  means  that   it   is   now   more

individualised,  more  suited  to  the  capability  of   each

student.   If  we are moving towards this kind  of  education

system,   there   is,   therefore,   a   greater   need   for

individualised  care.  The task of a professional  counsellor

could  be  to  help students manage the problems  of  stress,

coping with school work, relations with peers and even career

counselling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, students today need more emotional and

psychological  support,  as  they  are  faced  with  multiple

pressures and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1847</b></font><br><br>



the  development  process  has become  more  challenging.   A

recent newspaper report mentioned that the number of children

seeking the help of psychiatrists has increased three-fold in

over  eight  years.  The number had increased from  5,600  in

1990 to 20,000 in 1998, and this is based on the Institute of

Health Child Psychiatric Clinic figures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the problems faced are anxiety disorders and

behavourial  problems  which  range  from  fear  of  schools,

examinations  and, worst of all, failure.  In  view  of  this

increased  pressure  on  our students,  the  present  ad  hoc

approach  where teachers end up as counsellors is inadequate.

Teachers  are faced with tremendous time pressures themselves

to   complete  the  syllabus  and  meet  certain  performance

standards.  It is, therefore, not practical to expect them to

assume more and more non-teaching responsibilities.  Also,  a

recent  report in the newspapers involving a school principal

shows  that  there  are  risks if teachers  are  involved  in

counselling, as they are not professionals and thus  are  not

trained on how to handle students in counselling sessions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, as the

education system evolves and matures, I am confident that  it

will  continue to offer to our citizens the best options  and

services  to  learning  and training.  Similarly,  the  rapid

changes in the economy and the world stage also pose a myriad

of challenges to our students and parents alike.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, through the many interactions that I had with

students  and parents, I have noted that they need assistance

in   many   non-academic  areas  like   career   and   course

counselling,  discipline  and  also  personal  problems.   In

reality,  our  students are put under a lot of  stress  on  a

daily basis.  The majority is able to cope, but more and more

are  facing  difficulties.  These difficulties are manifested

in  the  form  of discipline and personal problems.   To  top

this,  many  parents are also clueless on the  ways  to  help

their children and the avenues to turn to for help.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1848</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, I would like to propose that the

Ministry allocate the resources to address the need for  more

qualified counsellors. I am aware that schools have some form

of  pastoral programme, but I believe this is not sufficient.

We  should avoid resorting to ad hoc and short cuts by  using

teachers  as  counsellors, but rather strategically  plan  to

increase  the  pool  of qualified and trained  professionals.

Our students and parents deserve better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my recent visits to the schools in my constituency

and  through my discussion with the staff, I gather that  the

students and schools could do with some structured assistance

in this area.  May I propose that the Ministry assigns one or

two professional counsellors for each school cluster?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report in the newspapers on 16th May 2002 concerning

the  complications  as  a  result of misunderstanding  during

counselling  further illustrates the complexity of  the  job,

and  also  the acute shortage of these professionals  in  the

school   system.   The  educational  institutions  need   the

assistance  of  MOE  in  this matter.   I  hope  to  get  the

Minister's position and plan on this issue.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Sir, in this House, we recognise that

in   Asian  families,  man  is  still  responsible  for   the

household.  Hence, woman is denied the medical fees  for  her

children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, we are talking about Asian families. Most

parents  would  not come forward to seek help for  themselves

and their children unless the situation is very serious.   We

would  like  to  urge  the Ministry to look  into  preventive

measures to spot high-risk students at a young age and  given

the  resources,  to  closely guide them through  the  crucial

years  of ages 10-15.  We need to help these children  before

they are irrevocably sucked into a life-time of problems, and

even crimes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose three recommendations:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A preventive screening of children at age 9. This

is at the age when children are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1849</b></font><br><br>



able to understand and be aware of the situation at home  and

in  school.  They would also have not lost their innocence in

telling  the  truth or become too conscious of  their  family

circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Have qualified full-time counsellors in the

schools.  We understand from the Senior Minister of State, Mr

Tharman,  in his reply speech to Mr Gan Kim Yong's questions,

that  there are two trained teachers in counselling.  I would

still like to urge for full-time qualified counsellors in the

schools.   Counselling needs a lot of time and  intervention,

especially  in  seeking family support  for  these  high-risk

children, and requires a lot of effort and visitation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides counselling, I am also advocating for these high-risk children to have supervised care. In most of these

functional  families,  the parents are  caught  within  their

problems,  and  they have no time to support their  children.

The  children,  unable  to defend themselves,  would  usually

suffer  in silence until they find their own form of outlets.

We  should have a supervised student care programme  for  our

students.  It could be on a cluster basis, a support for  the

children, as well as the parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Ministry to give more support

to our primary and secondary students in view of the fast and

intense  pace  of our education system.  As the British  Home

Secretary, David Blunkett, was recently succinctly quoted  as

saying  in  a Straits Times article titled "Criminals.   Spot

them  at  age 3",  "Instead of trying to pick up  the  pieces

when  things  go wrong, it makes a lot more sense  to  invest

resources in prevention."

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, in the IT

vision unveiled by the Education Ministry several years  ago,

all  schools are to be equipped with a student computer ratio

2:1  by the year 2002.  We are now in 2002, and I would  like

to  ask  the Minister for Education how well this  target  is

being met, in view of the importance of computer literacy  in

today's  globalised  world. Also, Sir,  there  is  a  natural

expectation for students to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1850</b></font><br><br>



conversant and proficient in the use of computers when  these

students enter into institutions of higher learning, such  as

the polytechnics and the universities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as part of the overall IT vision, I understand

many  schools have introduced computer-based home and project

assignments.  While  this  is laudable,  my  concern  is  for

students  in the low-income group who cannot afford  to  have

computers in their home environment.  Some low-income parents

have  expressed worry about their children losing out to  the

many  students  who have ready access to computers  at  home,

while  their  children are deprived from such access.   Their

concern primarily stems from such home assignments which form

part of the year-end assessments and examinations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know whether the Education Ministry

is directing schools to have supplementary classes for school

children  in  the low-income category, and whether  they  are

permitted to complete such computer-based projects in  school

outside of their normal curriculum hours.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> First,

let  me  thank  Members  for  contributing  their  views  and

suggestions  to improve our education system.   Allow  me  to

start with a broad overview of the progress we have made, and

where  we  are  headed, in order to place this discussion  on

education within the larger context of what we are working to

achieve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been done over the last five years. We have

moved  the  school  system forward in a  number  of  critical

areas,  including major enhancements to the teaching  service

through EduPac, trimming the curriculum to allow more time to

develop   creativity   and  thinking  skills,   strengthening

citizenship  and values education, devolving  more  authority

and  responsibility to schools and school clusters,  renewing

our  school  buildings,  and  introducing  IT  into  all  our

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Magad has just asked for an update on the IT

Masterplan.  The Ministry is completing its evaluation on the

current



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1851</b></font><br><br>



Masterplan  which is nearing completion  -  it has  been  5-6

years   -   and will unveil its second IT Masterplan for  the

period  2003-2007 in a few months' time.  So,  I  request  Mr

Magad  to be just a little patient.  When we wrap it all  up,

we will give him a full report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have made much progress, but the Ministry of

Education  is  not  resting on its laurels,  and  I  am  sure

Members  of  this  House  would not  allow  the  Ministry  of

Education to do so.  Dr Wang has suggested that the  Ministry

should   leave  no  stone  unturned.   Indeed,  the  previous

improvements I have enumerated have merely been  made  within

the  existing structure of the education system.   And  going

forward, our emphasis would be on structural issues.  We will

look  at what structures in the education system may need  to

be  changed.  The major thrusts in the coming years would be,

first,  the review of the upper secondary and junior  college

sector;  and  second,  the restructuring  of  the  university

sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will consider a new JC curriculum, better integrated

upper    secondary    and    JC    programmes,    alternative

qualifications, and private schools at the secondary  and  JC

levels.  We will also consider specialised schools in Science

and  Mathematics,  and in the arts, like the  sports  school,

which  will  cater to students with different  aptitudes  and

interest,  as  Mr  Low desires.  At the tertiary  level,  the

upgrading  of  the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts  and  the  La

Salle-SIA  College  of the Arts, funded by  the  Ministry  of

Education,  as  well  as  the  establishment  of  the   Music

Conservatory in NUS will provide more opportunities for those

with   the   talent  and  interest  in  these   areas.    The

polytechnics  and ITE will continue to expand,  and  we  will

also  provide more university places in the relevant  fields,

and   also   possibly  allow  private  universities   to   be

established.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken together, these initiatives will provide more

opportunities  and  options  to our  students  at  the  upper

secondary and tertiary levels, building on a very strong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1852</b></font><br><br>



foundation which we have today, providing a good solid  basic

education  to  our  children  in our  primary  and  secondary

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address some of the specific issues that

Members have raised. First, streaming.  First of all, I would

like  to  thank  Members for agreeing with the  principle  of

streaming.   Streaming provides opportunities for educational

advancement to all students according to their aptitudes  and

abilities.  It is not that we have not tried a system without

streaming before.  That was a system I grew up in,  and  also

many  of  the  Members of this House.   But  that  left  many

members  of our society by the wayside, and that  is  why  we

have,  today,  such a large problem in the age group,  40-50,

who have not completed their secondary education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our streaming differentiates curriculum and the pace and

method  of learning, so that each student can proceed at  his

or  her  own  pace  and  gain  a  sense  of  achievement  and

motivation  to learn.  Members have emphasised the  need  for

the  education  system  to  maximise  the  potential  of  our

students.  This is precisely what streaming attempts  to  do.

This  is  the strength our system has, and is a major  reason

for the high achievement levels of our students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alternative to streaming is mixed ability classes,

where  teaching  has to be targeted at the average.  In  such

classes,  the  more academically able will languish  as  they

lose  interest in the curriculum, while the less academically

able  students  give up, as they cannot keep  pace  with  the

curriculum.   This  was  what  we  found  previously   before

streaming was introduced.  There is a tendency for us to look

back in history with rose tinted glasses.  We should take  an

objective  look and see whether we are doing better  for  the

broad majority of our students today than we did in the past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah has asked how we address the issue of school

dropouts.   We do so by trying to make sure that  as  few  of

them do so as possible in the first place.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1853</b></font><br><br>



Through  streaming  and giving those who need  it  a  lighter

curriculum or more time, we have reduced educational  wastage

and  successfully  raised the educational attainment  of  our

students.  In 1980, before streaming was introduced, only 58%

of  our Primary 1 cohort completed secondary school.  By last

year, the proportion had gone up to 93%.  This is because  we

have been able to provide a differentiated curriculum for the

students.   Through streaming, we have, therefore, been  able

to  sharply reduce dropout rates due to educational  reasons.

Students may still drop out for a variety of personal, family

or social reasons. To address this, we work with the VWOs and

MCDS.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the best indicator of the success of streaming

is  how  well  it  has served our less academically  inclined

students.    Prior   to  the  streaming   system,   and   the

articulation of the EM3, normal technical stream and ITE,  we

really  had  very few educational opportunities for  students

like  these.   They would drop out of school  and  enter  the

workforce with no specific skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994, we introduced the Normal (Technical) course in

secondary  schools.  These students did  not  use  to  go  to

secondary schools.  They would go to primary school, spend  a

few  extra  years in primary schools as over-sized  students,

and then go on to VITB.  Those pupils who will do better in a

practical  rather than academic setting, who previously  went

to  VITB  after  Primary 6, now have a chance  to  shoot  for

secondary  education, to develop the foundation for acquiring

a  higher  level  of  skills  at  the  post-secondary  level.

Simultaneously, we upgraded the VITB and restructured  it  to

become a post-secondary institution, the ITE, to provide such

students   with  further  post-secondary  opportunities   for

education.   This  has lifted the level  of  these  students.

With the expansion of places at junior colleges, polytechnics

and  ITEs,  8  out of 10 of our students now go on  to  post-secondary  education compared to 1 out of 10  in  those  rosy

days  of 1965.  This percentage is at least as high,  if  not

higher



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1854</b></font><br><br>



than  even  those  achieved by the most  developed  countries

today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah asked how our less academically inclined

students do after they leave school.  They do very well.  ITE

graduates  are  sought after by employers who pay  them  very

well.   Even in the midst of the recession last year, 88%  of

ITE  graduates  found  employment  within  three  months   of

graduation.   In comparison, there were university  graduates

who  were  still  looking for jobs after  half  a  year.   In

particular,  the  average  monthly  salary  for   fresh   ITE

graduates  range from $1,100-$1,400 a month.   This  compares

well  with fresh polytechnic graduates, whose monthly  salary

ranges from $1,500-$1,900 a month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh, Mdm Halimah and others, said that streaming is

done  too  early.  Dr Ong asked if streaming  could  be  done

later  to  take  into account late-developers.   Sir,  it  is

precisely  because  we  have  late-developers  that  we  need

streaming.   Otherwise,  what  do  we  do  with   the   late-developers?   Whatever the reason for their  poorer  academic

performance at that point in time, forcing them to learn at a

pace  that  they  cannot or are not ready to cope  with  will

simply push them out of the system.  Streaming allows them to

continue to learn at a pace comfortable to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even after students enter a particular stream, there is

a well-structured progression route for them through to post-secondary education, and a net of "ladders and bridges", that

allows  students  to go as far as they can, and  even  across

streams.   It  is  wrong  to say that  our  education  system

provides  no  chance for late bloomers.  It is  our  previous

system,  before streaming, that did not provide  chances  for

late  bloomers.  That, as I said, is a major  reason  why  so

many  of  our 40 and 50-year olds today, people who  went  to

school   with  you  and  me,  have  not  completed  secondary

education.   They  had no opportunities and,  after  failing,

staying  back  a  few  years, they left school,  without  any

specific qualification or skill.  In contrast, our system now

provides students of all abilities, the opportunity to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1855</b></font><br><br>



get  a  solid foundation of at least 10 years of primary  and

secondary  education, with 8 out of 10 of them, going  beyond

that, to further education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late-developers still have opportunities for self-improvement. Those who do well, and can benefit from going

on  with their education, can do so.  Every year, about 1,000

ITE   graduates  go  on  to  the  polytechnics,   and   1,000

polytechnic  graduates  go on to our  universities.   Without

streaming, late-developers would have been nipped in the  bud

instead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a discussion with polytechnic students at a Poly

Seminar  three years ago.  One student stood up and  lamented

that  the  system did not provide second chances.  It  turned

out that he was 29 years old, and in the Polytechnic.  He was

in  the process of getting his second chance.  Last year, the

Lee  Kuan Yew Award winner in the ITE was a not so young man,

called  Simon Foo, from the Navy, I am proud to add.  He  was

the top graduate of ITE for the year, and has been offered  a

place  to  study in the polytechnic.  He is now 27 years  old

and  married.  Without the Normal programme and the  ITE,  he

might never have qualified to go to the polytechnic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the oldest student doing a full-time diploma in our

polytechnics is now 50 years old.  The oldest doing  a  part-time  diploma  is  68  years old.  The  ITE  is  the  biggest

provider  of  continuing education programmes  in  Singapore,

with  34,000  students enrolled, and another  20,000  on  ITE

accredited  courses conducted by industry training  partners.

We  should applaud the chances and opportunities that ITE is,

in  fact,  giving to many of our students,  to  many  of  our

mature  Singaporeans,  opportunities  which  they  might  not

otherwise have got.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a word on streaming. It is important to note

that  for streaming in schools, at primary level, there is  a

parental  option when students are streamed  at  the  end  of

Primary  4.  Parents have the final say.  Parents can  choose

not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1856</b></font><br><br>



to put their child in the EM3 stream at Primary 5, or if they

feel  that they are too stressed, they can choose not to  put

their  children  in  EM1.  But very  few  parents  opt  their

children out of EM1 and many parents opt their children  from

EM2 to EM1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh suggested that we have a hybrid system where

children  are kept in the same class in primary  school,  and

break  up  for  specific subjects to cater  for  children  of

differing  abilities.  The idea is not a bad one.  The  issue

is  one  of  practicality - whether  it  will,  in  practice,

achieve  the  objectives that Mr Singh has  stated.   In  the

primary schools, there are basically 4 subjects being taught,

mother  tongue  being one of them, with the children  already

split  up.  This means that if we split up children for other

subjects,  they  would  be breaking  out  of  their  classes,

perhaps  75-100% of their time.  This would have implications

on resources, time-tabling, etc, and, of course, it will mean

that  the  children do not get to spend most  of  their  time

together and just split up for some lessons, which is what Mr

Singh's objective was.  However, if schools wish to pilot  or

try this out, I have no objection to them trying.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh also said that students of different abilities

should  interact with each other, and I agree  that  this  is

important.   Students have opportunities to build  bonds  and

friendships  outside their classrooms.   For  instance,  CCAs

provide  avenues for students from different  backgrounds  to

engage  in the same activities.  The drum-major in the  band,

the basket ball captain, or the star in the football team may

not  come  from the fastest stream in the school.   And  they

learn  to work together and appreciate each other's strengths

and  weaknesses.  It does not have to be, as Members  of  the

House say, only in academic activities.  And, in the process,

they  get to know each other better and learn to support each

other  in common endeavours.  I should add that it is because

we  have streaming that we pick students from three different

queues to enter the same schools, that we have good mixing in

our secondary schools.  If we did not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1857</b></font><br><br>



have streaming, and students were posted to schools based  on

one  linear list, based on their PSLE t-scores, then all  the

academically weakest students would probably be  grouped  in,

say,  20  or  so schools, rather than distributed among  more

than 120 secondary schools with students from other streams.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Khor mentioned that streaming is unpopular among

teachers.   I  have  frank  discussions  with  teachers   and

principals  regularly, several times a month,  either  during

school  visits  or in dialogue sessions at  the  Ministry  of

Education  headquarters, in groups of a dozen or so teachers.

Teachers  generally  recognise children  learn  at  different

paces, and that it is not helpful for children to be given  a

curriculum  that they cannot cope with.  They are  supportive

of  a  stream, like the EM3, that caters for slower learners.

Contrary to what Mr Singh says, they also do not dread taking

on  EM3  classes.  Some of our most highly motivated teachers

derive  great  satisfaction, and a  sense  of  mission,  from

teaching  less  able  kids.  I think Dr Wang  may  well  have

interviewed  some  of  them for the Outstanding  Teacher  and

President's Teacher Awards.  But they, like my colleagues  in

this  House, do feel for these kids, and wonder how  best  to

help  the  kids  cope  with  the  issues  of  labelling   and

stigmatisation, and to help them build up their self-esteem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These concerns have been expressed by Dr Khor and Mr

Singh.  Such labelling is really a social phenomenon.  From a

purely educational standpoint, I think Members in this  House

would  agree, that streaming is the correct approach,  as  it

tries  to maximise the potential of all students by providing

them  with  programmes  as well suited  to  the  students  as

possible,  so  that  as  many of  them  as  possible  can  be

successful in their own right.  I am not sure really which is

more  damaging to self-esteem - to consistently fail  because

the curriculum and pace is so fast, or to perform comfortably

well,  achieve success in small bites every year, make steady

progress in a less demanding stream, and eventually attain  a

qualification that employers attach value to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has consistently sought to lift the level

of all our students.  Members, like Dr Ong and Mr Singh, have

suggested that there should be additional support for  weaker

students,  and  this  is being done.  At the  primary  school

level,  the  Ministry has a Learning Support Programme  (LSP)

and  the Encouraging Achievement and Better Learning (ENABLE)

programme to give additional support to pupils who  are  weak

in  literacy or numeracy skills.  At the secondary level, the

Normal  (Technical) students were among  the  first  to  have

access  to  computers in their schools, before students  from

any  other streams, when computer laboratories were specially

set  up  for  the  teaching  of  Normal  (Technical)  subject

Computer  Applications.   At  the post-secondary  level,  the

Ministry  has  devoted  great efforts  to  upgrade  technical

education.   Sir,  this is a segment of our education  system

that  I am particularly proud of.  Some Members of this House

were able to accept my invitation to visit the ITE, after the

debate on the President's Address, and I would like to extend

an open invitation to other Members of this House, to see ITE

for  themselves, and how well the students are  doing.   Come

and have a look.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have visited many countries in the past five

years, basically to study their education systems, to see how

we  can  adapt  the good things that they have done,  to  our

system.  They all have to deal with the issue of how to cater

to  the different educational needs of the whole spectrum  of

students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore education system does this better than

most.   And what is the evidence?  In the Third International

Mathematics  and Science Study (1999), 93%  and  80%  of  our

secondary 2 students were above the international average for

Mathematics and Science, respectively, for students  of  that

age group.  Sir, I am not surprised that the US needs to come

up  with new initiatives like the one that Mr Inderjit  Singh

pointed  out,  because a large proportion of  their  students

fall well behind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of a good solid foundation carried through

into post-secondary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1859</b></font><br><br>



education,  which  benefits 8 out  of  10  of  our  children,

provides them further opportunities in life.  And it places a

vast  majority  of our students on the correct  side  of  the

knowledge  divide that divides this world into the  knowledge

haves  and the knowledge have-nots.  And our education system

has been able to provide a vast majority of Singaporeans with

that leg up for the future, in engineering, bio-sciences  and

information technology, not just in the universities, but  in

the polytechnics and in the ITEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ultimately, it is better to recognise that

different  students have different needs, and  to  explicitly

provide  different streams and educational opportunities  for

them,  than to work on the premise, the hope, that  they  are

all  the same and fail to provide for their different  needs,

or  provide for them in an ad hoc way, and then lament  later

when they do not make it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents and schools need to work together so that

educational  features  like  streaming  and  other  forms  of

additional  support  that are meant to help  pupils,  do  not

become  a  cause of stigmatisation.  Ironically,  people  who

oppose  streaming are often the same ones who perpetuate  the

labelling of our students - I do not call them failures,  and

I  am  not  so  sure why so many Members do - by viewing  the

provision of a more moderately paced curriculum and  a  sound

technical education for students as something desirable,  and

we  can  encourage  them  to achieve their  potential.   This

attitude   of  labelling and calling them names is  something

which  we  should  change,  and  not  streaming.   I  welcome

suggestions  from  Members  on how  we  can  encourage  these

students, and discourage labelling.

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang suggested that we should also review school

ranking.   The  introduction of  school  ranking  has  had  a

salutary effect on our schools.  It has raised standards  and

allowed parents to make more informed choices, especially  as

to which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1860</b></font><br><br>



are  value-added schools.  We only rank the top 50  secondary

schools,  and not all the secondary schools, nor do  we  rank

the primary schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, school ranking is increasingly being adopted in the

United States and in the UK, where often all the schools  are

ranked  from  top to bottom.  And it is often in response  to

demands  from parents to know how well schools are  educating

their  children,  because parents want to know.   I  have  no

doubt  that  if we did not have school ranking  and  did  not

provide  information on how schools are doing, there will  be

parents  who  will ask us, and I think it is their  right  to

know.  There is nothing to hide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US and the UK, teachers do not like ranking - Dr Wang is quite right - because the teachers are now held

accountable  to  standards when, previously, they  were  not.

But  should we hold our schools and teachers accountable  for

standards?   I think the answer is yes.  Sir, I  am  open  to

ideas  on  how ranking can be improved, and suggestions  from

Members of the House are welcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago, I informed Members of this House that we

introduced   a  new  appraisal  system  called   the   School

Excellence  Model,  where schools do self-evaluation  on  not

just their outputs but also their internal processes.  I have

given out awards for Best Practice and Sustained Achievements

since  1999, to recognise schools for a wide range of  areas,

from  CCA  to staff development.  However, these awards  have

not  attracted nearly as much attention from the  public  and

the  media as school ranking.  But I do hope that, over time,

the public will learn to recognise that a good school is more

than  just an absolute ranking, and consists of a whole  host

of other things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo has suggested that our system is too stressful

and  puts too much pressure on students.  It is true that our

students study hard in school, and that our schools  seek  to

ensure  that  students do their best.   However,  the  strong

foundation that our Singapore children have acquired from the

hard work that they put in, and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1861</b></font><br><br>



strong  work  ethic, are important qualities that  will  help

them to succeed in life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, Members who feel that our children are

over  loaded should be strong advocates of streaming,  as  it

addresses  precisely  their concern  by  differentiating  the

pacing and content  of curriculum according to ability.   Mdm

Halimah and others have said that children are more concerned

about  their  examinations than they are about their  parents

dying.  Frankly, Sir, I think we are fortunate to live  in  a

country  where  children are focused  on  their  studies  and

examinations,  and not on their parents  dying.   I  have  no

doubt  that  if we live in a war-torn country  or  a  country

which is rife with terrorism and so on, then children will be

worried about their parents dying everyday, rather than their

schools  and  examinations.  I would not like to  live  in  a

country like that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of excessive pressure arises when there is a

mismatch  between  expectations  and  achievement.   Schools,

parents and society need to understand that while we want the

best  for our children, we should not push them beyond  their

limits.   One  example is streaming at Primary 4.   There  is

really  no  point  overloading children  with  higher  mother

tongue  in EM1 if they are unable to cope.  Yet, many parents

opt in to EM1 stream for their children, and few opt out from

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movie, I Not Stupid, reflected quite starkly how

some  Singaporeans  have  chosen  parochial  definitions   of

success  and imposed them on their children. Mr Yeo mentioned

a  serious  moment in the movie where one of  the  characters

wanted  to commit suicide.  Sir, I happen to think that  this

is an excellent movie.  It  provides a mirror for our society

and for each of us, and allows each of us to see how we might

actually  be behaving and how this behaviour may  even,  with

the  best  of  intentions,  have a  negative  effect  on  our

children and on others.  It is a useful movie for principals,

parents  and teachers to watch.   I should point out, though,

that in the movie, the student wanted to commit suicide,  not

because  he could not cope with his school work, but  because

he could not live up to his mother's unrealistic expectations

that he attain more than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1862</b></font><br><br>



90  marks  in  his  test.   We need a broader  definition  of

success.   Being  all  that we can be should  be  counted  as

success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr Singh said that the Ministry should set

performance  targets on the number of lateral transfers  from

what  he calls a lower stream to a higher stream, he  is,  in

fact,  narrowing  the  definition of  what  it  means  to  be

successful, to whether a student is able to move from EM3  to

EM2.    The  Ministry  does  not  have  targets  for  lateral

transfers, because setting such targets means that we will be

forcing  students  to learn at a pace that they  cannot  cope

with.   This is not the best thing for them.  This may result

in  pushing them out of the system.  It is more meaningful to

provide  an  appropriate programme with adequate  and  proper

support  to  weaker students to maximise their potential  and

provide  them with avenues of progression.  EM3 students  can

progress  through the system.  Nobody has given up  on  them,

and this has been our approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On counselling, the Ministry has a programme for

addressing  the  social  and  emotional  needs  of  students.

Counselling  is  available through the entire  age  range  of

students.    All  teachers  are  given  basic   training   in

counselling, and there are teacher counsellors of which there

are two in each school, but they are part time.  We also have

trained  some  30 retired education officers as  counsellors.

And  by July this year, they will be deployed to schools  and

to  clusters.   But this is an area in which I  will  be  the

first  to agree that we can do with more assistance.  Schools

work  with VWOs, Family Service Centres and self-help groups.

Incidentally, that is one of the reasons why since 1997-1998,

the  Ministry  of  Education, together with the  Ministry  of

Health, has been promoting the support services such as those

provided by the Institute of Mental Health, resulting  in  an

increase in attendances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While schools provide support for the pupils, the

support  from  home  is  of paramount importance  in  helping

students  to  cope with stress, and when they face  distress.

Mr  Gan  suggested that there might also be a need to counsel

parents.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1863</b></font><br><br>



Yes, that is so, and where there is a need for parents to  be

counselled, I suggest that they be referred to Family Service

Centres  for  the  necessary support.  The Ministry  and  our

schools  will  be  happy  to work  with  other  agencies  and

organisations  on  this issue, as it is an  issue  which  the

Ministry   itself  is  not  particularly  well  equipped   to

undertake.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, education seeks to provide Singaporeans with the

opportunity to fulfil their potential.  Because the potential

of our students is multi-faceted, our education system has to

provide  opportunities to different programmes and  different

types of institutions.  The way forward is to provide greater

diversity  in  the  school  system  and  allowing  for   more

educational routes and models, not just to consider one route

or  one model as the success paradigm, as many in this  House

seem  to have the orientation towards.  Such an approach will

allow us to more fully develop the different abilities of our

students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned earlier, the Ministry is currently carrying

out a review of junior college and upper secondary education,

and  I  will  ask  the Senior Minister of State,  Mr  Tharman

Shanmugaratnam, to update Members on that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</b> Sir, Dr Wang Kai Yuen has expressed views on

the issues under MOE's review of the junior college and upper

secondary education system.  The Review Committee on  JC  and

Upper Secondary Education, which comprises both educationists

as  well as people from the people sector, private sector and

public  sector  and which I chair, is looking into  two  main

areas.  First, the principles and framework for a revised  JC

curriculum;   and,  second,  the  introduction   of   greater

diversity of programmes within schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current JC curriculum has its strengths. The 'A'

levels have served  as the standard bearer for the rigour and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1864</b></font><br><br>



high standards of our JC and pre-university education for the

last  30  years.    Over  the  years,  we  have  continuously

improved  the JC curriculum, but the basic structure  of  the

'A' level programme is unchanged from the time we adopted  it

from  the  British.   It  is a system that  was  designed  to

provide students at age 17-18 with a strong core of knowledge

in  a few subjects  -  3 or 4 subjects  -  to prepare them to

enter  the workplace.  It also prepared students to go on  to

universities  in  the  British mould  -   universities  which

require  students to complete relatively specialised  degrees

within three years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic structure is one of specialisation at the 'A'

levels after a broad secondary school education leading up to

the  'O'  levels.  It is like the British system,  but  quite

unlike  that  in  the US and most of the European  countries,

where  students  undergo a broad-based curriculum  throughout

their  school  and  pre-university years.   Our  universities

have, however, departed from the British model.  They offer 4-year  degree  programmes  in many disciplines,  and  are  now

providing  a  broader education within the first  and  second

years of university.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, most students who are now sitting for the 'A'

levels go on to university, unlike the situation 20-30  years

ago.   It  is  no longer a terminal qualification.   Our  'A'

level  curriculum requires students to narrow their  interest

after  the  'O'  levels, before they  broaden  out  again  at

university.   Dr  Wang Kai Yuen described  the  structure  as

having a Coca Cola bottle shape.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are reviewing the JC curriculum, not because it has

worked  badly,  but  because of the  fundamentally  different

environment which young Singaporeans will have to  engage  in

in  future.  We have transited to a knowledge-based  economy.

We   have  to  prepare  the  young,  as  Dr  Wang  says,  for

uncertainty, in a rapidly changing environment.  Flexibility,

and  an ability to understand and draw on different knowledge

disciplines, will be at a premium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be difficult for students to know at age 17, or

even when they are at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1865</b></font><br><br>



university,  what  jobs  they will do  when  they  enter  the

workforce, or what new jobs they will take on over the course

of  their careers.  Further, whatever profession they are in,

they  will have to pick up new knowledge and skills every  so

often, to stay on top of their jobs and to keep an edge  over

the  competition.  More of this knowledge will be drawn  from

the  interconnections between disciplines.  Many of the major

breakthroughs  in  knowledge, and the economic  opportunities

that  come  with  them, are coming out of the spaces  between

traditional subject disciplines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to prepare our young for this future. An

example  is  bio-engineering, already an area  of  tremendous

opportunity.  To groom talent in bio-engineering, we  ideally

want  engineers  who know something about biology.   But  the

current  JC curriculum, like that in the UK, but unlike  that

in  the  United States, grooms future engineers who  have  no

exposure  to biology at the JC level, and often even earlier.

Within  the  framework  of  four 'A'  level  subjects,  those

wanting  to do engineering at university will typically  take

two  mathematics subjects,  physics and chemistry.  There  is

no  room to spare for biology.  NUS and NTU are now remedying

this by requiring engineering students to take biology during

their  first year at university.  But the long-term  solution

is  to  give some of our future engineers exposure to biology

at  JC, without them giving up any of the other subjects that

they  wish  to  take.  This is an example of why  we  need  a

broader and more flexible JC curriculum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key part of the work of the Review Committee is public

consultation.  Over the past two months, we have had dialogue

with  various groups with a stake in education   -   parents,

employers,   entrepreneurs   and  professionals,   academics,

principals and teachers, and students themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been broad support in the public consultation

on  the  need  to broaden the JC curriculum, in a  number  of

respects.    First,   on  the  academic  component   of   the

curriculum,   there  is  consensus  in  favour  of   students

acquiring



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1866</b></font><br><br>



a  broader range of knowledge, and for greater emphasis to be

given  to  critical  process skills,  such  as  thinking  and

innovative  skills,  the ability to make  connections  across

subject disciplines, and communication skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is considerable feedback that there should

be adequate emphasis on the non-academic curriculum, so as to

develop  life skills and enhance the leadership qualities  of

our  JC students. Employers, teachers and parents alike  have

emphasised  the  need to nurture strength of character,  team

spirit,  enterprise, and a passion in what the  students  do.

Whatever they choose to do, they must have passion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Review Committee is studying various approaches to

broaden  the academic curriculum in JCs.  One of these  is  a

modular approach to the junior college curriculum, that  will

allow  students  to  offer  a  core  curriculum  as  well  as

electives in different areas.  The elective subjects would be

quite  unlike the 'S' papers today, for instance, which drill

deeper  into  subjects that students are taking  at  the  "A"

level.   The  broader JC curriculum could also be  shaped  to

take  into  account  what  a student  studies  in  his  upper

secondary  years.   All  JC students  would  thus  undergo  a

holistic  programme of academic development over four  years,

in  a  range of subjects at their "O" and "A" levels, and  at

varying  levels of difficulty.  So as not to confuse Members,

this  is quite distinct from the issue of integrated schools,

or  through-train schools, which I will come to in a  moment.

The  proposal  I  have just mentioned is one of  those  being

studied  for  all  JC students as part of  the  comprehensive

review of the JC curriculum.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also support in the Review Committee and in our

public  consultations for retaining adequate depth in the  JC

curriculum.   The main reason for this is that students  have

to  pursue  some subjects to a sufficient level of depth  and

difficulty  in  order  to  train their  thinking  skills  and

develop their powers of critical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1867</b></font><br><br>



analysis.   The traditional reasons for depth  are  also  not

irrelevant - the foundations that students acquire at  JC  in

preparation  for university cannot be too thin,  particularly

for those going on to pursue engineering and the sciences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes we introduce to the JC curriculum must

therefore achieve an appropriate balance between breadth  and

depth  of  coverage,  between  content  mastery  and  process

skills,  and between the academic and non-academic components

of  the curriculum.  We must not compromise on the rigour  of

our  JC  curriculum.  If we adopt a broader or more  flexible

curriculum,  the learning process must remain demanding.   We

have to broaden the scope of the students' curriculum without

lowering  standards,  the  way it  has  turned  out  in  some

countries.  But there will have to be trade-offs, so that  we

do  not  increase the overall load on students and  teachers.

There is no slack in our JCs, unlike the situation in the UK,

for instance, before they introduced recent reforms requiring

students  to  take more subjects at the "A" levels,  or  what

they  called  "half-A  levels".   We  cannot  inject  greater

breadth  without reducing the scope of content which students

learn  within the subjects they choose to specialise in.   So

there are trade-offs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Review Committee is also studying whether we can

achieve  greater  diversity in the  structure  of  the  upper

secondary  and JC education system, by allowing some  schools

to   offer  new  pathways  to  a  university  education,  new

curricula and new assessment methods.  We need this diversity

in  our  system  because there can be no single  formula  for

preparing our young for an innovation-driven future   -   and

an  unpredictable future, a future which Mrs Yu-Foo described

as "a change every day".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our public consultation sessions, there has been

positive  feedback  on  the case for specialised  independent

schools   to  develop  students  with  special  talents   and

abilities.  For instance, an Arts School



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1868</b></font><br><br>



or a Mathematics and Science School, modelled along the lines

of  the Sports School, which will be operational in 2004.  Dr

Wang  asked if such schools should not be run by the Ministry

of  Education.  MOE will fund specialised independent schools

in the same way it funds other independent schools.  However,

we  prefer  to have a specialised school run by  a  community

that is willing to support the school and has an interest  in

its  success,  such  as the arts community  in  the  case  of

students with special talents in the arts.  This is the  best

way of ensuring that there is demand for the school, and that

the  expertise,  resources and energy of  the  community  are

brought  to  bear  in  the running of the  school,  not  just

initially  but on a continuing basis.  The community  has  to

take ownership for the school to succeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area that has attracted much discussion is the

possibility  of allowing some schools or Junior  Colleges  to

offer   integrated  programmes,  including  both  the   upper

secondary  and  JC level, within the same school.   There  is

support  in  our  public  consultations  for  this  proposal.

Integrated  programmes could be either  four-year  programmes

beginning  in Secondary 3, up to JC 2, or six-year programmes

from  Secondary 1 to JC 2.  They can be offered by  a  single

institution or by a family of institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the possibilities that is opened up by an

integrated school is for some of its students - those who are

confident of doing well in their "A" levels - to skip the "O"

levels  to  free up time to develop their interests  and  for

other  broader educational experiences.  We are also studying

the  possibility of allowing students in some schools to work

towards  different final qualifications, instead of  the  "A"

levels.   This could include allowing one or two  schools  to

offer   alternative  programmes  such  as  the  International

Baccalaureate, with appropriate local content.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to accept that a more diverse education system,

including  new  school structures or schools  with  different

curricula,   will   carry  with  it  a   greater   sense   of

differentiation.  However, admission



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1869</b></font><br><br>



into  such  programmes has to be open, fair and meritocratic.

Dr  Wang  raised  the  issue  of  whether  the  PSLE  was  an

appropriate  point at which students should be  selected  for

integrated programmes leading up to JC.  We are studying this

carefully.   There  could be different points  of  entry  for

different  schools offering integrated programmes,  depending

on  how  they  structure  their integrated  programmes.   One

method being considered is for schools offering an integrated

programme to admit students after the PSLE, as they currently

do, and to assess after the lower secondary years, whether  a

student is suited to progressing on the integrated programme.

Not  all  students in such schools will want to skip the  "O"

levels.   The  schools offering integrated programmes  should

also  be able to take in a certain number of students at some

point  after the PSLE entry level.  The school could do  this

by administering its own admission tests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we consider freeing up the mainstream state-funded

school  system  to  allow for greater choice,  the  case  for

schools which are privately run and privately funded has been

less  compelling.   Participants in the  public  consultation

process  have  placed  greater  priority  on  the  need   for

diversity  within  the  state-funded  system.   However,  the

Review  Committee  has  kept an open mind  on  the  issue  of

private  schools at this point.  We are not  ruling  out  the

possibility of recommending that the Government allow  for  a

few private schools who have a particular niche to serve, and

who  can  provide  an  added source of ideas  and  innovative

practices in education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to conclude, the review of the JC and upper

secondary  education  system is an important  part  of  MOE's

efforts to meet future challenges.  The Review Committee will

put up a consultation document for further public comment  in

a few months' time, and make its final recommendations to the

Government within five months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are embarking on major innovations in our upper

secondary and Junior College system.  Any changes that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1870</b></font><br><br>



Government  decides to adopt will have to be thought  through

in  detail, and prepared for extensively.  Teachers will have

to be prepared, and will have to be confident of teaching any

new  curriculum  well.  A major change to the  JC  curriculum

will  take about five years to develop and implement.  If  we

allow some schools to offer integrated programmes leading  to

Junior  College, those that are conducted within the existing

curriculum framework can take off within the next two years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines) Sir, a clarification on the

Minister's  earlier  statement.  In  asking  Singaporeans  to

redefine the definition of success, I would like to  ask  the

Minister  whether  the  Government is  prepared  to  set  the

example  by  doing  away  with the distinction  in  labelling

within  the  civil  service itself.  It is common  perception

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sin, that is not a clarification.

That is a question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> I will ask a question. I am coming to

my  question  soon.  Is the Government prepared  to  set  the

example ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not think you can ask the question,

Mr Sin.  I am sorry.  Mdm Ho Geok Choo.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, I am indeed heartened by MOS Mr

Tharman's  enumeration  of what is  likely  to  come  in  the

revised syllabus of tertiary students.  I would like to  take

this   opportunity  though  to  elaborate  on  the  important

economic survival skills that our tertiary students  must  be

equipped with, in order to give them that booster start  when

they enter their first career.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the educational institutions

train  and  educate our students well in  a  broad  range  of

subjects, from Mathematics to computing to the life sciences.

This education equips our students with knowledge, skills and

abilities  which  enable them to take up  jobs  in  different

sectors and thus contribute to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1871</b></font><br><br>



the  economic  life of the nation.  It seems to me,  however,

that  there  is  a  missing link.  In as  much  as  they  are

technically competent to take on employment, they  are  often

relatively less well-prepared to transit into the wider  work

environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this I mean that graduates need, on the one hand, to

have an awareness of trends and happenings in the wider socio-economic and cultural environment and, on the other hand, the

ability  or, at the very least, an understanding of  what  it

takes  to relate and interact with significant others in  the

workplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, words like `globalisation', `the knowledge

economy' and `continuous learning' are more than buzzwords  - they  have an impact on organisations and people who work  in

them.  Do our students actually know what they mean, and what

their  significance is?  How does the economic climate impact

on jobs and careers and how should these changes be managed?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the workplace, for example, how may one conduct

interpersonal   relations   effectively?    How   does    one

communicate   with  one's  superiors,  peers,   subordinates,

clients and suppliers?  What does it take to work in a  team?

How  does one motivate oneself and others?  How does one deal

with   the  `difference'  in  a  workplace  that  has  become

increasingly  diversified?  And as we move to strengthen  our

service  sector  of the economy, how much do fresh  graduates

know about the management of emotions that is inherent in the

nature of service work?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All such knowledge constitutes competencies which can

influence   significantly   individual   and   organisational

performance.   They  also have a role to  play  in  fostering

creativity  and  an innovative frame of mind.   On  a  larger

scale,  the possession of such competencies can constitute  a

competitive advantage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it may be argued that, even without formal

learning,  employees do, in time, acquire  such  competencies

relating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1872</b></font><br><br>



to  the  wider  environment and the conduct of  interpersonal

relations.  I would contend however that rather than  waiting

for  employees to acquire such competencies through what  may

be  painful and costly trial-and-error experiences over time,

we  can  shorten the learning curve considerably by inserting

that   learning  into  the  curriculum  of  polytechnic   and

university graduates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have in mind the institutionalisation of a course on

the  management  of  human relations in the  polytechnic  and

university  curriculum.   Could the Minister  kindly  outline

what measures his Ministry will take to prepare our graduates

for  this transition to the work environment in the knowledge

economy?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, some Singaporeans still

perceive Chinese to be dull and difficult to study,  and  the

Chinese  teachers to be rigid, inflexible and their  teaching

methods  outdated  and  uninteresting.   In  fact,  this  has

improved  as new teaching methods were introduced, but  image

problems  appear  to persist.  Today, more and  more  Chinese

Language teachers, as what we understand, employ creative and

lively teaching methods to cater to today's students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My key concern, however, is that MOE has set too many

restrictions on the assessment of the subjects in primary and

secondary schools.  Some examples of irrelevant and  outdated

contents, such as standard letter-writing format, unrealistic

composition  topics,  were still  enforced  by  MOE  and  the

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to enhance the effectiveness of teaching and

learning,  there is a need to review the assessment  methods.

For  example, in many secondary schools today, "ciyu  jieshi"

is still a key component of test and CA for Chinese Language,

which  request the students to write out word  by  word  from

memory  the meaning of the specific vocabulary.  The  way  we

set  the  test makes learning of Chinese as if memorising  by

heart  the book of vocabulary.  This has not only demoralised

and  made  the learning of the Chinese Language tiresome  but

also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1873</b></font><br><br>



hindered  the  ability of the students to learn  the  Chinese

Language  in  a  more  creative and  interesting  way.   Many

students end up really hating the Chinese Language.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, we also have many principals sitting in the

public  gallery.   I  really hope  the  MOE  and  the  school

principals will consider this seriously.  The examination and

testing  formats  should be closely linked to  the  desirable

learning outcomes.  We need innovative ideas for teaching and

learning,  but,  more  importantly, we  also  need  them  for

testing  and assessment.  Innovation in learning and teaching

of  the  Chinese  Language  will  not  be  effective  without

innovation in the assessment methods.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sin Boon Ann, you can try and slip in

your question now.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, I will save my question for

another day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the learning of mother tongue as a second language

in  our schools has been the subject of much contention, both

within and outside this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presumably, the underlying principle of our second

language  policy  is,  among other things,  to  preserve  our

cultural  heritage, since language is the  vehicle  by  which

values are transmitted from one generation to another.

Sir,  in  my  response during the debate on  the  President's

Address earlier this year in this House, I had said that  one

major  limitation  of sending Singaporeans overseas  lies  in

education.  In particular, I believe that it is the  learning

of  the  second  language that discourages  many  from  going

overseas to work.  There is a genuine concern that when  they

return  from  their  overseas posting  or  assignment,  their

children, having spent time overseas, may not be able to cope

with  the second language, especially if the posting is to  a

country  that does not provide a proper environment  for  the

learning  of  the second language.  The consequence  then  is

that for Singaporeans who invest overseas, it is difficult



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1874</b></font><br><br>



for  them  to find middle or top management to these  places,

usually it is these people who are the ones with school-going

children.

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a point, the Government recognises this problem. I

understand  that the children of school-going age  who  spent

sometime  overseas are given some dispensation from  learning

the  second  language.  For instance, a child who  is  absent

from Singapore for some time need not offer a second language

if he or she returns to Singapore in his PSLE year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in an extremely competitive environment, such as

ours, I am not sure if such policies are sufficient to induce

Singaporeans  to  go overseas.  While the Ministry  has  been

flexible in its second language policy, I feel that  it  does

not  go  far  enough.  To begin with, it does not  completely

exempt the child from the requirements of the second language

altogether.  There could be situations where the child may be

away  too  long  for him to catch up with his language  to  a

point  where he is at a complete disadvantage to  his  peers.

Does  this  mean  therefore that he will  perpetually  labour

under this disadvantage?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, the Government can do more. First, our

Government  should  be prepared to be more  flexible  in  the

second language requirements if it is clear that the child is

unlikely  to,  within  the duration  of  his  school  career,

effectively  attain  a measure of competence  in  the  second

language  that  will  not put him at a distinct  disadvantage

with  the  rest.   In such cases, the Ministry  should  allow

perhaps  the children the option of doing the second language

at a more basic level, such as the CL 'B', as a way of easing

the children into the language.  Additionally, the Government

should  be prepared to back its high demands on the  language

requirements, by investing more resources in the teaching  of

the  second  language through the Internet.  Sir,  using  the

Internet has the distinct advantage of allowing people to log

on to the site wherever they are.  It is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1875</b></font><br><br>



virtual  classroom  that  is not  constrained  by  space  and

perhaps time.  With multi-media capability, it would  not  be

difficult  for the child to pick up the language skills  even

in  the  spoken aspect of it.  The Internet may therefore  be

used  to  update  also  the parents on  the  latest  syllabus

requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that, to deal with the competing demands of

second language and the need to send Singaporeans with  young

families overseas, we need not solve this by doing away  with

the  requirement  to  learn the second  language  altogether.

However, if the Government can be flexible in its demands and

is  prepared to invest more in Internet technology to  assist

in  the learning of the language, I am sure it will go a long

way towards encouraging Singaporeans to go overseas.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, let me tell a

story.  Once upon a time, a pack of wolves were living  on  a

hill.  There  were  black  wolves, brown  wolves  and  yellow

wolves. At another hill nearby lived a group of monkeys,  and

they were gorgeous golden monkeys. Among this pack of wolves,

there was one yellow wolf  who did not like the colour of his

fur, and he was also not happy with the sound of his howling.

He  aspired to become a golden monkey, like those  living  on

the  nearby hill. He therefore tried very hard to  learn  the

cries  of  the  monkeys,  imitate  their  postures  and  even

practised the way they climbed the trees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, he thought he had mastered the crying, walking

and  climbing skills of the monkeys, and decided to go to the

other  hill  to  join the monkeys as one of  them.  But,  the

moment the monkeys saw this wolf approaching, they surrounded

him  and attacked him. Fortunately for him, he managed to run

away  very quickly, but not before he sustained injuries  all

over  his  body.   Dejectedly, he returned  to  the  pack  of

wolves.  But, when he opened his mouth, he had forgotten  how

to  howl like a wolf, and found himself unable to blend  into

the pack of wolves.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1876</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moral of this story is that no matter how well the

yellow wolf had learnt the language of the monkeys, he should

not  neglect  his  own mother tongue, to howl  like  a  wolf.

Likewise,  no  matter  how hard you have  learnt  to  acquire

proficiency in another language, you must not forget your own

mother tongue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his memoir, the Senior Minister mentioned that when

he and his wife were studying in England, they met a group of

Chinese students and from his interaction with them, he began

to realise the extent of his cultural loss.  He did not learn

the  Asian  culture,  and he did not belong  to  the  English

culture.  He  was lost somewhere between the  two.  For  this

reason,  he subsequently sent all his children to the Chinese

school to study their mother tongue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is former NMP, Dr Lee Tsao Yuan. It was

only  after  the age of 40 that she began to re-discover  her

own cultural roots. As such, we have a responsibility to help

every citizen know and retain his own cultural heritage,  and

mother  tongue  is the important key to the  preservation  of

cultural  heritage.  Therefore, we have a  responsibility  to

help  every  one of our citizens maintain his   own  cultural

heritage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people may say that you could also learn your own

culture  through  the  English  language.  Is  that   so?   I

personally feel that it is impossible for one to go deep into

the  quintessence  of  Chinese culture through  English,  and

learn to appreciate the beauty of the Tang Dynasty poems. You

cannot  really  understand your own  language  and  your  own

culture through another language.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people allege that mother tongue is the cause of

racial segregation, and are fond of proposing that the mother

tongue  be  abolished.    They  use  incidents  such  as  the

September  11, the tudung, etc, as an excuse to advocate  the

scrapping  of  the SAP schools and the community-based  self-help groups. Some   cited the United States as an example and

say  that  in  the United States, everybody speaks  the  same

language. It is a big melting pot, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1877</b></font><br><br>



nobody  cares about his cultural roots.  I do not think  this

is  true. As a matter of fact, a lot of people in the  United

States  are actively searching for their roots. Remember  the

famous  best-seller, Roots by Alex Haley. It  gives  a  vivid

account  of  how  the Americans are looking  for  their  lost

roots.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, our political leaders, including the Prime

Minister,   Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  the  Minister   for

Education have repeatedly emphasised the importance of mother

tongue to alleviate the doubts of these people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot prevent other people from giving up their

own  mother tongue and culture to accept another language  or

another culture, like the wolf in my earlier story.   But  we

must try to make sure that every Singaporean, whether Chinese

or  Malay  or Indian, will have the opportunity to learn  his

mother  tongue  to know his own roots.  Only  then,  can  the

various communities feel that their own culture will  not  be

threatened.  By learning their own culture, they will be able

to build up their  pride and respect for their own community.

And  only with the pride and respect for their own community,

can  they trust the other groups and to live in harmony  with

the other communities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, with this globalised new economy, it

will  certainly bring an impact on our society  and  culture.

The  retention and enhancement of our traditional values  can

help to alleviate some of these adverse impacts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hereby urge the Minister for Education to reiterate

the  status  of  the mother tongue. I also urge  the  MOE  to

attach  more  importance to the inculcation  of  culture  and

values  in  the contents of our mother tongue education,  and

thereby  enhance the students' knowledge in their own culture

and history.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I remind Members to be short, please.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, two to three years

ago,  the  Minister  chaired  the  committee  to  review  the

teaching of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1878</b></font><br><br>



Malay  Language in schools.  It was part of a general  review

of the teaching of mother tongue in our schools.  Some of the

key   recommendations  were  to  modify  the  curriculum  and

textbooks, also to introduce a third stream, or to  give  the

option  to do an examination in Tamil Language B.  The  other

recommendation was to enhance the Umar Pulavar Tamil Language

Centre as a place for the learning of Higher Tamil.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my first question is whether the Minister could

give  us  a  progress report on the implementation  of  those

recommendations and, in particular, on how the upgrading  and

improvement  of  the Umar Pulavar Tamil Language  Centre  has

progressed and the response of teachers and students to  that

new  facility.   The  second question I  have  is,  based  on

feedback,  whilst we have modified curriculum and  textbooks,

there  is  a  perception certainly among many parents,  whose

children take Tamil as a second language, that the assessment

system, whether it is examination or school-based tests,  has

not   reflected   the   change  of  the  curriculum   content

adequately.   This  is  quite a systematic  feedback  and  it

occurs   both   at  the  levels  where  there  are   national

examinations,   like   P4,  P6,  as  well   as   school-based

examinations  at other levels.   Sir, I would  like  to  know

whether  the  Ministry has a process by which the  curriculum

changes and the textbook changes will feed through to have  a

material impact on the examinations and assessments  that  we

have for the mother tongue and, in particular, Tamil.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third aspect, Sir, pertains to access to mother

tongue and specifically Tamil Language.  Sir, Higher Tamil is

offered  in,  perhaps, two or maybe three  secondary  schools

today - Raffles Institution, RGS, and, possibly, Cedar, I may

be wrong there.  The other students are required to go to the

Tamil  Language Centre and take up Higher Tamil.   While  the

facility  is  well  appreciated,  it  does  mean  that  these

students have to take time away from school which means  they

either miss out on CCA, or they miss out on remedial classes,

or  other  enrichment  classes,  in  order  to  pursue  their

interest in Higher



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1879</b></font><br><br>



Tamil.   The question is not perhaps that Higher Tamil should

be  ubiquitous and offered in all schools.  But in additional

schools  where  there  might  be  a  critical  mass  of  such

students,  could we reconsider offering it  in  situ  in  the

schools itself?  One example could be Crescent Girls where  I

have  received feedback that there are at least  20  students

who are taking Higher Tamil.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, Singapore is an

immigrant society.  The plural ways of life have been part of

our  living  here.  Against this background, it is  indeed  a

great  challenge for us to preserve the co-existence  of  the

plural ways of life among the ethnic groups while pursuing to

build  a  strong  nationhood.  To  a  different  extent,  the

various ethnic groups are facing a common problem, and it  is

how to preserve and protect their own language and culture in

a  predominantly English-speaking environment, so  that  they

will not be further eroded and even subjugated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In form, the Government's policy appears to favour

bilingualism, but in substance it is undoubtedly, "English is

supreme!"    We do admit that the use of English is conducive

to the interaction among the ethnic groups and enhances their

mutual   understanding.  But,  do  we  really  want   to   be

naturalised  by the English language to become  a  homogenous

people?    That  is  an  entirely  different  matter.   While

projecting our common destiny as Singaporeans, I believe each

ethnic group also hopes to preserve and retain its own way of

life,  its  own  language and culture.  We  also  agree  that

English  is  useful to us in making a living in  this  highly

competitive  global economy.  However, do we really  want  to

just  earn  a living and give up our own way of  life?   What

about  our  cultural characteristics?  I believe the  various

ethnic  groups of this generation are unwilling  to  see  our

society  losing  its  present  multi-cultural  flavours,   or

degenerate into a language and cultural form which is without

substance.   After  all, this is the precious  asset  of  our

nation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1880</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must strike a balance between the nation and the

community,  and  between  economic development  and  cultural

heritage.  This is a major issue we must explore  into.   The

significance  and  importance of this kind of  soul-searching

are  not inferior to the review of our economic strategy.   I

feel that the model of seeking similarity while accommodating

diversity, mutual tolerance and understanding, plurality  and

co-existence  is  far  superior  to  the  singular  model  of

"English-only",  and  is  better  able  to  consolidate   our

foundation  in building up a multi-racial nation. The  deeper

the  understanding of the various ethnic groups in their  own

language  and culture, the more positive effect it will  have

in the process of our nation building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, because of political reasons, the Chinese

community was not able to comprehensively discuss and resolve

the problem of its own language and culture. As a result, the

standard   of   Chinese  among  the  younger  generation   of

Singaporean  Chinese  is consistently on  the  decline.  They

disregard  and even despise their own language  and  culture.

This question comes on from time to time. After being left in

the  doldrums  for  some time, it resurfaced  again  recently

because of a few incidents of mistakes in the translation  of

some  official publications. It goes to show that the problem

does  exist. We have to look at it squarely.  These incidents

of  mistakes  in  translation are certainly not  an  isolated

phenomenon.  It  reflects our society's typical  mindset  and

style  towards the Chinese language. So long as this  mindset

remains  unchanged, I will not be surprised if this  sort  of

"classic jokes" or "national disgrace" are repeated again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the problem we are facing is purely the decline in

the  standard  of  Chinese  language,  then  the  remedy   is

relatively  easy  to find.  Unfortunately, the  problem  lies

with  the  mindset or mentality towards the Chinese language,

and  this  kind  of mindset is quite common. We  should  ask,

"While  some  communities in the world are sacrificing  their

lives  to  protect  and  defend  their  cultural  and  ethnic

identity,  why  are our young people despising or  abandoning

their  own  mother tongue, the most important link  to  one's

cultural and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1881</b></font><br><br>



ethnic  identity with absolutely no psychological  burden  at

all?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education said that it would take three

generations before a society can truly claim to be proficient

in   a   language.  Singapore  needs  another  one-and-a-half

generation  before  English can be extensively  used  by  the

entire  society.  Regrettably  in  less  than  one-and-a-half

generation,  the  status  of the  Chinese  language  here  is

already in a very precarious situation. In another one-and-a-half  generation's time when English is universally  used  by

the  entire society, what will be the position of the Chinese

language  then?   If  we do not do something  about  it,  the

consequences  will  be quite obvious.  As  far  as  the  many

intellects  who  take  the destiny of Chinese  to  heart  are

concerned, they have already said all that they need to  say,

and  have probably done all that they ought to do. Yet,  such

individual  efforts  are  incapable  of  changing   the   big

environment,  because this big environment  is  set   by  the

Government's  educational policy and the  society's  attitude

towards  the  language is influenced by such  an  educational

policy. Moreover, whenever the Chinese community talks  about

the Chinese language and Chinese culture, it will be labelled

as being Chinese chauvinists.  We are still living under this

kind of shadow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government claims the low standard of Chinese is the

result  of  the parents' own free choice, and is a  price  we

have  to  pay for our economic development.  I am  unable  to

agree  with this argument. The crux of the matter undoubtedly

lies  with  the attitude of our people towards  their  mother

tongue.   Such  an  attitude  is  the  result  of   the   PAP

Government's  social engineering over the past 30-odd  years.

It  has  fundamentally altered and even severed the emotional

ties  between  the people and their mother tongue.  They  are

treating  the  language entirely by a so-called rational  and

utilitarian principle.  Some may call it "pragmatic  policy",

but  I  will  call it the "rootless policy". It is  a  policy

whereby English reigns supreme.  That being the case, why  do

we  not just simply embrace the western civilisation?  If  in

the fields of technology, humanity and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1882</b></font><br><br>



culture, we can thoroughly and effectively arrive at the  way

it  is  done in the west, then we may well consider it as  an

alternative.  However, if after careful consideration we find

that it is not possible for us to embark on such a path, then

should  we  not  accord our own mother  tongue  language  and

culture the status and respect it deserves?  We should not be

bashful about it. Otherwise, we may end up "neither fish  nor

fowl".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no point to pinpoint who is to blame for all

these. The most important thing is that we must have a  clear

understanding  of  what our present situation  is.  Recognise

that this is indeed a problem. Deal with it seriously. Adjust

the  mindset. Shake off the over-sensitiveness in  discussing

issues  concerning  the Chinese language. Then  mobilise  the

resources of the Chinese community, and take advantage of the

collective  wisdom, and genuinely strive to  improve  on  the

present situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should discard the adverse effect of the

too pragmatic attitude on the choice of culture and language.

Recognise   the  pluralism  of  our  society.  Our   cultural

foundation shall never be built on the English language.  The

passing on of cultural heritage from generation to generation

requires firm mother tongue foundation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): --- and Singapore

will  degenerate  into a rootless duckweed  floating  in  the

ocean of theworld economy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong Seh Hong. Can you please keep

your  story  short, if you have any, so that the others  will

have a chance to speak?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> I tell only one story per day, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Sir, the low standard of Chinese is a

subject  of  great  concern  to  the  Chinese  community   in

Singapore.  In the past two or three months, we have  seen  a

lot  of  the  articles of this nature in the Lianhe  Zaobao's

editorial  and  forum pages. In our exchanges  with  the  NUS

Chinese   Department,   the   Singapore   Chinese   Teachers'

Association and the media, we keep hearing the same voice  of

concern.    For  example,  the  many  mistakes   in   Chinese

translations in some of our official publications have become

a  laughing stock, and the fact that some  undergraduates  in

the  Chinese  Department of NUS had to use  Hanyu  Pinyin  in

their  examination papers because they had forgotten  how  to

write the Chinese characters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general feeling is that while most Singapore Chinese

could speak simple Chinese in casual conversations, they  are

completely  off  the  mark  where  reading  and  writing  are

concerned. Many Singapore businessmen find themselves  unable

to communicate with their business partners in China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where does the problem lie? First, it would be the

environment.  Because in our environment where English is the

main  working  language, there are not many opportunities  to

speak Chinese, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1884</b></font><br><br>



not much importance is attached to the Chinese language here.

Secondly, the curriculum time for the learning of Chinese  is

reduced. Chinese is regarded as a subject and not a medium of

instruction. In Primary 1, the time spent on Chinese is  only

1/3,  in Primary 4, only 1/5, and in secondary school, it  is

even  less.   Thirdly,  with  the  retirement  of  the  older

generation  of  Chinese  teachers,  we  are  now   short   of

specialist  Chinese  teachers who could  teach  the  language

well.  Fourthly, the mentality of the students.  The students

are  treating  Chinese  as  an  examination  subject.   After

graduating, they just throw it aside.  Fifthly, the  teaching

method and curriculum. These were already mentioned by Mr Yeo

Guat Kwang earlier on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the question is how are we going to improve on all

these areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I think the Government leaders should give a

very  clear instruction and send a clear signal to raise  the

status  of  Chinese  in  our  society.   For  example,   more

importance should be attached to the official publications in

the Chinese language.  They should be carefully monitored and

vetted before they are sent to the printers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have to improve the quality of our Chinese

teachers.  We must have specialist Chinese teachers, starting

from  primary  school onwards.  We should also send  them  to

some well-known overseas universities to improve themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, they should teach Chinese in a more interesting

manner, as mentioned by Mr Yeo Guat Kwang earlier on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, to further raise the standard of Chinese in

the  SAP  schools and encourage the students  to  learn  more

profoundly  the  Chinese  culture,  history,   language   and

philosophy.  We could perhaps cooperate with the NUS  Chinese

Department to work out something along this line.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, we should let the graduates from our NUS

Chinese Department  play



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1885</b></font><br><br>



an important role in our society.  If we want to benefit from

the  emerging  Chinese economy, we should  give  the  Chinese

language in Singapore a boost in the arm.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the lowering of

the  standard  of Chinese language in Singapore  has  been  a

cause   for   concern  among  the  Chinese  community   here.

Especially   of   late,   when  the  tourism   pamphlet   was

misinterpreted and has created a joke out of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speak Mandarin Campaign has been in place for many

years.  The  main objective of this campaign is how  to  make

Mandarin  the  medium  of  communication  among  the  various

dialect groups in the Chinese community in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our schools, most of the students are able to speak

and listen to Mandarin.  There is no problem about that.  But

in  terms  of  writing,  they have  a  lot  of  problems  and

difficulties.  In order to raise the standard of the  Chinese

language,  much will depend on the Government's effort.   The

Federation  of  Chinese  Clans Association  and  the  Chinese

community  itself  must also put in more efforts  to  conduct

classes, hold seminars, discussion sessions and workshops for

the improvement of the Chinese language in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, we must start from the schools. This is a

long-term  approach to the raising of the  Chinese  language.

In  primary schools, there are a lot of opportunities for the

learning of English.  But in the case of Chinese language, it

is  only confined to teaching within the subject.  We  cannot

arouse  the interest of the students in the learning  of  the

Chinese  language. In fact, many students treat the  learning

of the Chinese language as a chore and feel that it is a very

difficult  subject to learn.  As a result of  such  attitude,

the standard of Chinese remains very low.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should include some interesting stories, such as how

the ancient sage in China, by the name of Sima Guang, broke a

large water vat to rescue a boy who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1886</b></font><br><br>



had fallen into it, and another boy, by the name of Kong Rong

who,  being  the  youngest  in the family,  was  offered  the

largest  of the pears in the tray. He graciously refused  the

offer and said that since he was the youngest, he should only

take  the smallest one, and the biggest pear should be  given

to  the  eldest brother.  Stories like these are  interesting

and  inspiring. They could inculcate in our young the correct

values  while capturing their attention with the  interesting

contents.   Incidentally, the name of Sima Guang was  changed

to  Ali  in  our  local  textbook, but this  has  since  been

rectified by MOE.  We cannot just change the names  of  well-known  characters  in  the Chinese  history  at  random.  For

example,  we cannot change the name of Justice Bao to  Kumar,

or  Dr Sun Yat Sen to Robert Sun.  This will not reflect  the

philosophy and the culture that they represent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from teaching the students how to read and write

the  language,  we  must  also teach  them  the  culture  and

philosophy  behind the language.  Besides the textbooks,  the

editorials  and the feature articles in the newspapers  could

also  be  used as materials for discussion in the  classroom.

Students  will then also learn to understand current  affairs

in  the  process.   They can be encouraged to  express  their

views  on  these current affairs using the Chinese  language.

Such  application  will strengthen their proficiency  in  the

Chinese language.  The schools can also encourage students to

watch  good programmes in the cinemas or on Channel  8.   For

example, one programme is Who Wants to be a Millionnaire?  It

is  a  good programme.  It enriches the general knowledge  of

the  students  and  can  also enhance  the  interest  in  the

learning  of the Chinese language.  Such programmes  will  be

able  to  help  students  to better  understand  the  Chinese

language.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should encourage the students who are better in the

Chinese  language  to  take up Higher  Chinese.   With  China

opening up successfully, and with strong economic growth,  we

must encourage our people to jump onto the bandwagon.  But if

our  standard of Chinese is low, then we will not be able  to

succeed in China.  For



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1887</b></font><br><br>



example,  when it comes to signing of agreements in  Chinese,

we will have problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With proper learning of the Chinese language and

culture,  the  students will be better-equipped  to  take  on

China  as the future engine of growth. The Chinese Department

of NUS can play a greater role in this respect.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ang, finish your speech, please.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng:</b> Sir, can I have another two minutes?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Half a minute.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I believe that we must

correct  the   attitude of the students on Chinese  language.

Give them more training to enhance the value of Chinese.  The

Chinese  community should organise more cultural  activities.

The  various Government departments should emphasise  on  the

use  of  the  Chinese  language. MPs who  are  conversant  in

Mandarin, should speak more in Mandarin. The TV media  should

introduce   more  educational  programmes.    Through   these

channels,  we  will be able to enhance the  standard  of  the

Chinese language in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Teachers play

significant  roles  in  ensuring that  our  students  receive

proper  guidance  and quality education in schools.   Sir,  I

have  proposed  in this House before that we need  a  quality

accreditation system, such as the ISO 9000 in the Ministry of

Education  and  our  schools.  This will  provide  consistent

quality  assurance  in our education system.   It  will  also

benchmark   our   education   services   with   international

standards.  We need a quality system to make sure that  there

are  quality policies and procedures in place in our  schools

and  in the Ministry.  Sir, we need quality input and quality

process to produce quality output.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1888</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, the Ministry has been actively

recruiting  many  new  teachers to  address  the  problem  of

teacher  shortage  and  replacing retiring  teachers.   I  am

concerned about the quality of teachers recruited, especially

during  the recession.  Sir, I hope the Minister could update

the House on the recruitment process of teachers and what are

the  quality criteria for teachers.  I would also like to ask

the Minister the following questions:  One, how many teachers

were  recruited over the last five years, and how  many  have

left  the  Ministry?  Two, what is the long-term strategy  to

attract good quality teachers?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, this subject of

class  size is not a new issue.  I have brought up this issue

of class size many times in this House.  As a former teacher,

I  know  that it is impossible to teach effectively  a  class

size  of  40-44  pupils.  I am certain the Minister  is  also

aware  of this.  But, year after year, the Minister adamantly

defends  the  huge class size that we have in our  Government

schools,  except  the independent schools where  the  average

class size is much smaller, at about 25 pupils per class.  25

pupils  per class is a good class size.  But I am only asking

for  a  reduction from the present average of 40  pupils  per

class   to  30  pupils  per  class.   This  is  a  reasonable

compromise between an educationally acceptable class size and

the  cost  of  building  more schools  and  the  problems  of

recruitment of more teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that much of our problems of low education

amongst a large section of our workforce can be traced to our

large class size that is still found in our schools.  Despite

rigorous  streaming in our schools, there are still  sizeable

dropouts  from  our schools at the Primary 6  and  the  lower

secondary  school levels.  These children normally come  from

non-English  speaking  homes.   The  English  language  is  a

foreign  language to them and, due mainly to lack  of  family

support,  they  just cannot cope with the  English  language,

neither can the teachers in the schools help them because  of

the  large class size. The teachers do not have the  time  in

such  a  class size to give more individual attention to  the

slower pupils in the class. They, therefore, year



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1889</b></font><br><br>



after  year, fail badly in their English language  tests  and

other  subjects.  In fact, English language to  these  pupils

has  never  really taken root.  They will join  the  pool  of

dropouts in our schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that at least this year, the Minister will say

that he recognises that large class size is a problem in  our

schools  and  the  Ministry shall start  to  look  into  this

problem, rather than brushing it off year after year and hope

that this problem shall go away.  Unfortunately, it shall not

go away unless the Ministry does something about it.

<br>2.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I understand

the  Ministry's problem in wanting to recruit  more  teachers

and to double the number of schools if they are to reduce the

class size.  We are not talking about doubling or reducing  a

class  size  by  50%.  I also understand  that  the  Minister

actually understands that certain subjects like English would

be  most  beneficial if the class size is smaller.   I  would

like to urge the Ministry to consider reducing class size for

this subject in particular.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a small class size is the first step in the right

direction.   It  gives  more  individual  attention  to   the

students in their learning and practice of this language and,

also  at  the same time, reduces the workload and demands  on

the  teachers.   The  learning of  English  is  very  much  a

practice  subject and individual attention  of  the  teachers

would  be  there  to help spot grammar mistakes  and  correct

pronunciation errors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is a shortage of good English teachers in

Singapore,  I  will  support the  Ministry  in  its  overseas

recruitment   for  more  qualified  native-speaking   English

teachers  to  come and teach our children.  In  view  of  the

importance of good English language in our society,  and  the

generally weaker English language foundation of our  students

entering  the neighbourhood schools, I hope the Ministry  can

start  and  put more emphasis on the reduction of class  size

for this particular subject.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1890</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, before the PAP came to power,

nearly  all Chinese schools were private schools.  They  were

known  as  private  schools because they were  all  privately

funded  and administered.  Nowadays, all schools in Singapore

are  Government schools except for the foreign schools  which

are all private schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Government schools are centrally controlled and

supervised  by  the  Ministry of  Education.   Our  so-called

Independent schools are really not independent at all.   They

are  very  much controlled and regulated by the  Ministry  of

Education.   Since our schools are centrally controlled,  one

would  expect  that  there is uniformity  in  all  Government

schools in Singapore.  All our children wear uniforms in  our

schools up to the level of junior colleges and the curriculum

and  syllabuses  of  all  Government schools,  as  one  would

expect, are fairly narrow, restricted and uniform.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in all developed countries like England and

America,  private schools blossom in those countries.   Those

schools are privately run, and are dynamic and vibrant.  They

produce outstanding students who serve their countries  well.

I  think we should also encourage private schools to be built

in our country in the light of Singapore wanting to encourage

entrepreneurship.   The Government must change  its  attitude

and  be  more  liberal.  The Education Act must  be  amended,

together  with  its  related laws,  to  make  it  easier  for

enlightened Singaporeans, who wish to set up private  schools

to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think funds are not the real problem. The obstacle is

the   reluctance  of  the  Government  to  encourage  private

schools.  All private schools we see in Singapore are set  up

by  the  foreign  communities here.   If  funds  are  not  an

obstacle to foreigners building their own private schools  in

Singapore,   why   should  funds  be  a  problem   to   local

Singaporeans who outnumber the foreigners?

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Mr Chairman,

our  national schools provide excellent opportunities for our

children to mix and integrate.  They



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1891</b></font><br><br>



are  the  common  grounds for our children to experience  and

explore  our  commonalties and, at the same time,  appreciate

our apparent differences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the natural reaction is for our children to

gravitate  among their own kind.  Children's minds  are  most

impressionable when they are still in school.  Value  systems

and  social  behaviours are often shaped through  such  early

experiences in schools.  Given the backdrop of September  11,

and the increasing need to enhance inter-ethnic understanding

and  appreciation among our people, we must ensure  that  our

schools  continue  to  provide a  conducive  environment  for

students  to  mix, and mix well.  To this end, Sir,  I  would

like to ask the Minister the following questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What in the Minister's assessment is the current

level of inter-ethnic integration in our schools today?  From

a  scale of 1 to 10, where are we?  What would be some of his

criteria in making such an assessment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Are there differences in the levels of inter-ethnic

integration  in  the  different types  of  schools,  eg,  the

Independent   schools,  neighbourhood   schools,   autonomous

schools and the SAP schools?  If there are differences,  what

are the Ministry's plans to improve the situation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What does the Ministry plan to do with the schools

that  have a lower proportion of ethnic minorities?  How  can

inter-ethnic  integration be enhanced in  these  schools?   I

think more needs to be done than merely expecting them to mix

through  the  school cluster system, where  students  in  the

cluster  of schools get to mix through some joint  events  or

functions. There must be a concerted effort that ensures  the

process is continuous.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) What are the programmes that have been put in place

to ensure better inter-ethnic integration in our schools?  We

have to go beyond the programmes that see our children put on

each  other's ethnic costumes during Racial Harmony Day.   If

there are such programmes, what are the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1892</b></font><br><br>



outcome  indicators of these programmes, ie,  how  would  the

Ministry  determine the success of these  programmes?   Where

are  we today in terms of these indicators?  What do we  hope

to achieve in the immediate and the long-term future?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Have there been studies that document the level of

inter-ethnic  integration in our schools to  date?   If  yes,

what are the findings? And if no, is the Ministry planning to

conduct one such study?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we certainly cannot take our inter-ethnic

relationship  for  granted.   This  relationship,  like   our

children,  is the cornerstone of our future.  Our  children's

formative years in school will have significant influence  on

their attitudes and perceptions in their adult lives.  I have

come  across  many university undergraduates, who  know  very

little  about  the top cultural values and practices  of  the

different  ethnic  groups.   When  given  an  assignment   to

interview people who are ethnically different from them, many

have  difficulties, even when the assignment allows  them  to

interview people who they already know. This seems to suggest

that  these  undergraduates  do  not  know  people  who   are

ethnically  different from them as  part  of  their  network.

Sir,  I  hope this is not a result of what happened in  their

earlier schooling years.  These undergraduates are our future

leaders.    We   must  ensure  that  such  trends   are   not

perpetuated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed, we must invest in the formative years of

our  children  to ensure that their experiences are  positive

and  meaningful, thereby guaranteeing a future generation  of

socially    conscious    and   inter-ethnically    networking

individuals.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

schools, no doubt, play a key role to instill racial harmony.

Understanding what multi-racialism is about in  Singapore  is

critical,  if we are serious about integration. Despite  over

36  years of our efforts at nation-building, there are  still

serious gaps of understanding and misunderstanding about what

it takes to make a success of multi-racialism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is MOE's experience in tackling this problem and at

promoting integration?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1893</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay MPs, sometime back, had taken the initiative

to  request  that there be a cap of 25% admission to  Primary

One  intake,  the  purpose being to encourage  better  inter-racial  mixing and to facilitate more Malay students  to  use

English rather than just Malay language among themselves.   I

realise   that   there  are  practical  problems,   including

convenience and transportation, that made parents request for

more  admission despite the cap.  What is MOE's  position  on

that  cap now?  I think, as far as possible, that cap  should

be encouraged for better performance and integration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, it was brought to our attention that certain

schools,  for  example, Siglap Secondary  School,  had  Malay

students  reaching  60% of the student  population.  This,  I

believe, was because of the post-PSLE posting and choice made

by  the  students themselves.  I gather too that  in  certain

classes  in  such schools, the number of Malay students  even

reached  90%.  I was also told that once such schools  attain

such   an   image,  non-Malay  students,  especially  Chinese

students,  even  refrain  from  choosing  such  schools   for

posting.   Is  this  true,  Sir?  What  effect  does  such  a

situation have on our efforts at integration?  Will  MOE  try

to  have a better spread of students to make the schools more

multiracial and thus, facilitate integration?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge MOE to view the matter seriously

and not allow expediency, eg, convenience of language classes

or  transport  consideration, to deter them from  efforts  to

forge a better integrated society.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Teo Ho Pin, you have got two cuts.

You can take them together.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, the planning of schools, especially

neighbourhood schools, has a tremendous impact on the quality

of  life  of families.  The mismatch of supply and demand  of

school placement often causes much anxiety among parents, who

will  thereafter make numerous appeals to the  school.   With

fluctuating child births yearly, and rapid population shifts,

it  is  difficult for the Ministry to forecast the demand  of

school placements in schools.  As such, we need to review the

planning  process  of  schools  to  better  cope  with   this

fluctuating demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What are the measures taken by the Ministry to ensure

that  students  staying within 1 kilometre of a neighbourhood

school can have a place?

(2)  Can schools be planned and built based on actual school

placement demand data obtained through an early school

registration system?

(3)  Will the Ministry consider increasing the capacity of

schools so as to cope with the yearly fluctuating demands for

school placements?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On school design, the development expenditure of $1.48

billion  in the building programme of schools and educational

institutions must be carefully monitored to ensure that money

is  appropriately spent to provide a conducive and functional

learning  environment for our students.  I wish to  highlight

some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1895</b></font><br><br>



concerns regarding the design of schools, especially the  new

generation schools, and those under the PRIME programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too much emphasis may have been placed by the architects

to create unique design features for schools.  These features

may  be unnecessary and unfunctional.  It may pose durability

and maintainability problems.  It will also increase the cost

of  construction and subsequent maintenance.  Thus, I wish to

ask the Minister the following questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the average durable score of schools built over

the last five years?

(2)  Does the Ministry conduct any design audit to check on

the durability and maintainability of schools?

(3)  Is design-and-build an appropriate procurement method

for schools?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Singh, Dr Wang, and Mrs Yu-Foo

spoke  on the importance of a well-rounded education,  and  I

agree with them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curriculum content has been cut by up to 30% to provide

time  for  the  infusion of thinking  skills.   Strong  moral

values  are  promoted through the Civics and Moral  Education

programme.  Last year, we also announced a set of initiatives

to  develop  and enhance arts education in our  schools.   In

addition,  the changes to the University Admission System  in

2003  will  include  bonus points  for  CCA.   So  that  will

reinforce other measures of ability and make CCA count.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh and Mdm Ho had spoken about the need to expose

our  students  to  entrepreneurship, financial  planning  and

starting  up  businesses, for the  new  economy.   While  the

specific  skills  of financial planning  and  starting  up  a

business  are  not  an  integral part  of  the  programme  in

schools, students do learn useful practical life-skills, such

as    self-management,   social   and   cooperative   skills,

communication, and information skills.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1896</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In co-curricular activities in particular, students have

the  opportunity to organise challenging activities involving

managing people, time and money.  Some schools have their own

cooperatives,  for  example, Ping Yi.   And  Anderson  Junior

College's Enterprise runs a gift shop in the college and  has

a  link-up  with  One.99 shops.  Students acquire  experience

running a company and even raising business capital.  Temasek

Junior  College, Mr Singh's alma mater, has an Entrepreneurs'

Club  with  50  members learning about product marketing  and

risk  management from external instructors and  mentors,  and

they are trying to put their skills to work on some projects.

We  encourage  schools  to  provide  such  opportunities  for

students,  but we leave it to schools to decide whether  such

activities fit into their overall programme and priorities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our main focus is really at the post secondary level,

where  much  has already been done.  At ITE, entrepreneurship

training is now part of the core training programme  for  all

students, as it is in the polytechnics, particularly for  the

engineering, IT and life sciences, the non-business  courses.

NTU  has the Nanyang Technopreneurship Centre hosted  by  the

Nanyang  Business  School, and NUS  has  the  NUS  Enterprise

office.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have also asked about the mother tongue policy.

On  one  end  of  the spectrum, we have Mr Sin  suggesting  a

relaxation  of mother tongue requirements, on the other  end,

we  have  Dr  Ong and others, highlighting the importance  of

mother   tongue   and  that  it  cannot  be  over-emphasised.

Bilingualism  will  remain  a cornerstone  of  our  education

system.   English  is  needed for the globalised,  knowledge-based  world,  and  as a common language to communicate  with

each other across ethnic boundaries, and the mother tongue to

imbibe values and appreciate our cultural heritage.  This  is

our policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policy is to encourage every Singaporean to study

his  mother tongue in school for as long as possible, and  to

as high a level as he is capable of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang asked for a review of our mother tongue policy,

to turn over this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1897</b></font><br><br>



stone.   It  was  indeed reviewed in 1999  by  a  high  level

committee  chaired  by  DPM  Lee.   The  1999  mother  tongue

language  review made several recommendations to achieve  our

objectives.   The recommendations were carefully  calibrated,

and we are just implementing them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognised that not all pupils have the same natural

ability,  home background and motivation.  We needed  a  more

customised  approach, where we aim for  different  levels  of

achievements for pupils of different abilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Wang has said, the growing proportion of English-speaking families, and the large difference home language

background  makes,  means  that we  cannot  ignore  the  real

problems some children have learning the mother tongue.  That

is  why  we  introduced the Mother Tongue B  syllabus.   This

syllabus focuses more on speaking and listening aspects,  and

is  designed  to  make the attainment of  a  basic  level  of

competency   in  mother  tongue  to  proceed  to   the   next

educational  level  less of a hurdle for  students  who  face

exceptional difficulties in learning their mother tongue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we also sought to enlarge the pool of

students studying Higher Mother Tongue, so as to broaden  the

base  for a literary elite.  I agree with Dr Ong and  Mr  Ang

that  we  should  have high standards for the  mother  tongue

language.   Higher Mother Tongue is the standard  bearer  for

mother  tongue  in  Singapore, and incentives  are  given  to

encourage students who are strong in mother tongue  to  offer

Higher Mother Tongue.  And these incentives include:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Relaxing the eligibility criteria to allow more students

to offer their Higher Mother Tongue, from what was 10% to now

the top 30% of a cohort;

(2)  Providing 2 bonus points for Higher Mother Tongue for

admission to junior colleges, and bonus points for students

who perform well in mother tongue, or Higher Mother Tongue at

A-level for admission to courses related to mother tongue

languages in our local universities;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1898</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Increasing the number of Special Assistance Plan

(SAP)  schools  from  9  to  10, and  introducing  a  special

programme  called "Elective Programme in Malay  Language  for

Secondary  Schools (EMAS)" at Bukit Panjang  Government  High

School  as well as upgrading the Umar Pulavar Tamil  Language

Centre  for the teaching of Higher Tamil and Tamil  Language.

This Centre which is now open  -  Mr Iswaran asked about this

-  also serves as a national resource centre for the teaching

and learning of Tamil Language.

<br>3.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also set up the third centre for the Chinese

Language elective programme at Nanyang JC, and introduced the

Malay   elective  programme  at  Tampines  JC.    Outstanding

students   are   awarded  the  language  elective   programme

scholarships.  This more customised approach at both ends  of

the  spectrum   -  the lower achiever end mother  tongue  and

higher  achiever  end mother tongue  -   has  allowed  us  to

maintain  the standard of mother tongue that can be  attained

by  the majority of students with reasonable effort.  And  we

will  review our mother tongue policies regularly  to  ensure

that our policy objectives continue to be met.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo and Mr Ang spoke on Chinese language teaching and

learning.   We agree with them that it is important  to  make

the  learning  of  mother  tongue  languages,  including  the

Chinese  language,  not only effective but also  interesting.

Following   the  Mother  Tongue  Reviews,  Chinese   Language

syllabuses  were revised, and new textbooks have been  phased

in  by  level  from  the  year 2002.   Training  courses  and

workshops  on  the  use  of the new  materials  and  creative

strategies  on  the  teaching of Chinese Language  have  been

conducted for teachers.  As Mr Yeo has said, today, more  and

more  Chinese  language teachers employ creative  and  lively

teaching methods to cater to the needs of their students, and

we want to encourage this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be reviewing the modes of assessment and the

examination formats



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1899</b></font><br><br>



to  ensure  that  curriculum and assessment are  aligned  and

geared to achieving the learning outcomes of the new syllabi.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Mr Yeo's comment that the Ministry sets

too  many restrictions on the teaching of the subject, I like

to  clarify  that students are not required to  memorise  the

content  of  the  text or the meanings of  words.   In  fact,

teachers   are   encouraged   to  exercise   flexibility   in

determining the modes of assessment when setting school-based

examinations for their students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran asked if the Ministry could allow a school

with  20  Indian students taking Higher Tamil to have school-based   Higher   Tamil  classes.   I  fully  understand   the

aspirations  of  parents who want to  see  Tamil  instruction

offered in as many schools as possible, and the Ministry will

strive  to  do  this.  But if a school has only  20  students

offering Higher Tamil across Secondary 1 to Secondary  4,  it

means there will be, on average, only five students per level

offering Higher Tamil.  I think this is too small a number to

justify starting Higher Tamil classes in that school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh asked about non-Tamil Indian languages. At

present,   the  Ministry  conducts  examinations  for   these

languages at PSLE, N levels, 'O' and 'A' levels.  And  grades

obtained  at these national examinations are treated  on  the

same basis as the other official mother tongue languages.   I

am  aware that the non-Tamil Indian speaking communities have

made  commendable  efforts to improve the teaching  of  their

languages,  and  that they hope to persuade the  Ministry  to

recognise  non-Tamil  Indian  language  marks  in  the   five

different  languages  - Hindi, Punjabi,  Gujarati,  Urdu  and

Bengali   - for various purposes, on a comparable basis  with

students taking the three official mother tongue languages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I should say from the outset that those taking non-Tamil Indian languages have a dispensation that no other

group



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1900</b></font><br><br>



of  Singaporeans have.  Chinese Singaporeans are not  allowed

to  offer  Cantonese or Hokkien nor Singaporeans of  Javanese

extraction, Javanese.  All other Singaporeans are required to

offer  one  of our three official mother tongue languages  of

Singapore.   Schools  will  place students  taking  non-Tamil

Indian languages in the appropriate classes, and assess their

eligibility  for  Edusave and other awards,  based  on  their

ability demonstrated by the students in their other subjects.

Students   are   therefore   not   unduly   advantaged    nor

disadvantaged  by  this.   Though we allow  non-Tamil  Indian

languages  to  be  offered in lieu  of  the  official  mother

tongues, we can make accommodations and arrangements only  up

to a point.  I will ask my officials to work with the various

groups   offering  these  five  different  non-Tamil   Indian

languages to discuss what can be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the important subject of teachers, Mr Chiam and Mr

Chia  have  raised  the subject of pupil-teacher  ratios  and

smaller class sizes.  The issue of smaller class sizes is not

new.   It was something I discussed at length at last  year's

debate.   Mr Chia was not in this House then, and  I  am  not

sure  if  Mr  Chiam was present when I gave  a  comprehensive

response  on this matter.  Nevertheless, this is a matter  on

which Mr Chiam crows as often as the sun rises!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally, we should have small classes, every one of

which  would be taught by good teachers.  But, as I explained

last  year,  there  is a real trade-off between  quality  and

quantity  of  teachers  - and this is a problem  which  every

country faces, not just us, in the United States and the  UK,

which  is coming to us and trying to recruit our teachers   - especially  when  we  take the desire to have  smaller  class

sizes over the teacher numbers required for the entire school

system.  It is actually not too difficult to double the  size

of  the  teaching force.  All I have to do is  to  lower  the

standards  that  we  require of our teachers.   There  is  no

shortage of applicants if we lower standards.  The choice  is

not  between  40  students taught by a good teacher  and  two

classes  of  20, each taught by an equally good teacher;  but

having 20 of these 40 students



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1901</b></font><br><br>



who  is perhaps not fit to teach by today's standards  for  a

teacher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our approach to building up our teaching force is

to  recruit  as  many  teachers that  we  can  who  meet  our

standards.  We take this issue of teacher-student ratios very

seriously and we do not brush it aside.  We have not  limited

the  numbers  that we can recruit.  Through EduPac,  we  have

made a career in teaching more attractive and rewarding.   We

have  been  able  to expand the size of our  teaching  force,

especially  in  the last five years with some help  from  the

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked how many teachers we have recruited and our

attrition  rates.  In the last five years, the  Ministry  has

been  able to recruit more than 2,000 teachers per year  into

the Education Service.  This is more than 10,000 teachers  in

the  last  five years in the teaching force of about  25,000.

The resignation rate of teachers has been fairly constant and

low,  between  2%  and 3% per year in the  last  five  years.

However,  our  retirement rates have gone up,  as  the  large

number  of  teachers recruited in the 1960s reach retirement.

Over the next five years, 3,500 teachers will retire, or  700

teachers a year.  On the whole, however, as a result  of  the

higher  recruitment numbers, the size of the teaching service

has  increased from about 22,500 teachers in  1997 to  24,500

in  2001,  a  9%  increase.  In fact,  there  has  been  some

improvement of pupil-teacher ratios  -  not large, but  some.

But  because our target is to recruit our teachers  from  the

top one-third of each cohort, there is a limit to how far  we

can  reduce  pupil-teacher  ratios  without  compromising  on

teacher quality.  At the recruitment rate of 2,000 per  year,

we  are already recruiting 1 out of every 8 of the top  third

of  each  cohort.  And these new recruits have  to  stay,  on

average,  12.5 years in order to maintain the teaching  force

at  the  current level of about 25,000 teachers.   I  believe

that  this is achievable, but I am not confident that we  can

have  a  dramatic increase in the size of our teaching  force

without a significantly lowering of quality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given these constraints, our position on deploying our

teacher resources is to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1902</b></font><br><br>



do  so  where  the  additional teachers can  contribute  most

toward  the  learning of students.  Mr  Chia  said  that  the

Ministry should at least reduce class size for some subjects,

such  as  English, so that students can get better  attention

and  learn  better.  This is indeed what we are  doing.   One

good  example is the Learning Support Programme (LSP)   where

Primary  1  and 2 pupils with difficulties in basic  literacy

skills  are  taught  in  small group sizes  of  8-12.   Using

teacher  resources  for targeted programmes,  like  the  LSP,

which  may mean smaller class sizes for specific subjects  or

periods for specific students, is more effective than to  try

to reduce class sizes across the board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On private schools, Mr Tharman's committee is studying

this  subject  already, and I shall ask him to  take  special

note  that  Mr  Chiam supports the introduction of  privately

funded private schools, like the exclusive schools in the  UK

and the US.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now ask my Parliamentary Secretary, Mr

Hawazi,  to  address issues on ethnic integration and  school

planning.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Hawazi Daipi):</b> Sir, Dr Mohamad Maliki asked

about  programmes  to  promote ethnic integration  and  their

effectiveness.   Mr  Zainul  Abidin  asked  whether  students

appreciate the constraints and value the opportunities  of  a

multi-racial society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE actively promotes social cohesion among students of

different  races and different ability groups.  Our education

system and our school programmes foster social cohesion among

the different races at every opportunity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform Dr Maliki that we have achieved a

high level of acceptance and appreciation of ethnic diversity

in  schools.   This is based on the National Education  Study

which MOE has been conducting annually since 1997.  Findings,

since  the  1997  baseline  study, also  show  that  students

generally  have a better appreciation of racial  harmony,  as

they proceed to the next higher level of their education.  We

will continue to strengthen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1903</b></font><br><br>



inter-racial understanding and mixing in schools through  the

curriculum,   co-curricular  activities   (CCA)   and   other

programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through subjects like Civics and Moral Education, Social

Studies  and History, the formal school curriculum emphasises

appreciation  and  respect  for  the  cultures,  customs  and

traditions of the various ethnic communities in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE has also developed and implemented the National

Education  (NE)  programme since 1997, which  aims  to  build

national cohesion and inculcate the instinct for survival and

confidence  in  the  future.   It  reinforces  the  important

message that Singapore is a multi-racial society.  As part of

NE, schools set aside one day in the year -  21st July, to be

precise   - to commemorate Racial Harmony Day.  This  is  the

day  when students reflect on and celebrate our success as  a

harmonious  nation  built on a rich  diversity  of  cultures.

Since  its inception, this commemorative event has proven  to

be  effective  in promoting inter-racial understanding  among

our  students.   By learning about Singapore's  strengths  as

well  as  constraints and vulnerabilities,  through  subjects

such  as  Social Studies, History and Geography, as  part  of

National  Education  and  through  other  National  Education

activities,  we  are  able  to deepen  understanding,  foster

comradeship  and  bonding  among students,  both  inside  and

outside the classroom.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Co-Curricular Activities programme also promotes

social  integration, by providing avenues for  students  from

different social and racial backgrounds to engage in the same

activities.  Students train side by side in sports,  organise

club  activities in committees, and participate  actively  in

house  competitions.  In the process, they get  to  know  one

another  better  and learn to support one  another  in  their

common    endeavour.     This   enriches   students'   social

experiences  and enables them to have a better  understanding

of the spectrum of our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools on their own have also embarked on various

initiatives to knock



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1904</b></font><br><br>



down  barriers  between  students of different  races.   Last

year,  for example, Ngee Ann Primary School set up  a  multi-racial  "gamelan" Malay Cultural Ensemble Group.   Nan  Chiau

Secondary  School,  which  is a  Hokkien  Huay  Kuan  school,

encourages its Secondary 1 Malay and Indian students to learn

Chinese calligraphy and Chinese painting.  There are numerous

examples  of  how  our  schools  have  been  able  to  foster

comradeship, and to foster closer rapport among  students  of

various  ethnic backgrounds.  Schools within the same cluster

can  also  come  together  to  organise  joint  projects  and

activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At our national schools, students of different races and

religions  go  through a common curriculum,  share  a  common

experience of growing up together, studying together, playing

together,  and  singing  the National  Anthem  together,  and

reciting  the  Pledge  together.  These are  invaluable  life

experiences,   which   help  in  building   emotional   ties,

identification, and a sense of commitment to one  another  as

fellow citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on strengthening of racial harmony in schools, we

have   been   successful  in  having  an  easy  and   relaxed

relationship  among  our communities in  Singapore.   In  the

aftermath of the terrorist attacks in the United States,  and

the  heightened sensitivities to race and religion that  have

followed,  we  need to further enhance racial  and  religious

harmony   in  our  schools.   Let  me  highlight  two   major

initiatives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One change that MOE is effecting that can enhance cross-cultural interaction is in the extension of its Third

Language  programme.   PM announced recently  that,  starting

from 2004, MOE will offer Chinese as a third language to non-Chinese  students with the aptitude for it, in the  same  way

that  Malay is now available as a third language to non-Malay

students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE will also be relaxing the eligibility criteria for

the  existing  Malay as a Third Language programme,  so  that

more non-Malay students can qualify.  The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1905</b></font><br><br>



relaxed  criteria  will  also apply to  Chinese  as  a  Third

Language programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE has also set up the Committee on Strengthening

Racial   Harmony   in   Schools   to   enhance   inter-racial

understanding and mixing in schools, and organise  activities

to  strengthen  racial  harmony in schools.   The  Committee,

which I chair, comprises representatives from schools, parent

support groups, and the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul asked for an update on the Committee's work.

The   Committee  aims  to  broaden  and  deepen  inter-racial

understanding  and  mixing  in schools  through  articulating

desirable programmes and strategies, seeding initiatives  and

raising the profile of Racial Harmony activities, such as the

celebration of Racial Harmony Day.  The Committee  will  also

consider  how  the  impact of racial harmony  initiatives  in

school could be assessed.

<br>3.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has come out with several preliminary

ideas to deepen understanding and mixing among students.  One

way  is  to  raise the profile of the Racial Harmony  Day  by

organising  an  annual  symbolic event  for  all  schools  to

participate  in.  This year, the event will  be  known  as  a

Racial Harmony Games Day, to be celebrated on Saturday,  20th

July,  to  promote inter-racial interaction through enjoyable

games.   Another  initiative is through the sharing  of  good

practices  and  useful  resources from schools  and  external

organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul also shared with this House efforts by the

Community  Development  Councils to promote  racial  harmony.

The  Committee has noted that external organisations such  as

CDCs  and  Parent Support Groups have a key role to  play  in

promoting  racial harmony and suggests that schools  leverage

on  these  organisations  to maximise  efforts  in  promoting

racial harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee will be meeting community leaders,

parents,  teachers and principals in focus group  discussions

to gather their views on how to broaden and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1906</b></font><br><br>



deepen further inter-racial understanding and interaction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Zainul asked about racial quotas for Primary One

intake  in schools.  We tried implementing in 1987 a  Primary

One  racial quota where Primary One Malay student  intake  in

each  school  was limited to 25%.  However, there  were  many

implementation problems.  The HDB's housing quota, introduced

in  1989,  has  helped  to reduce the  problem  and  maintain

certain balance in our primary schools.  We will continue  to

monitor  the  situation and, if necessary,  see  what  action

needs  to  be  taken.  For secondary schools,  streaming  has

helped us to ensure a better mix of students in our schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to conclude on this point, let me just say that we

try  to  integrate  students  of various  ethnic  communities

through  cultural activities and traditions of the  different

communities  as well as through better mixing.  This  can  be

done  through  the curriculum, through outside the  classroom

activities, CCA, and enrichment programmes as well as through

the  National Education programme.  We celebrate  four  major

events   in   a   year  in  school  -  Racial  Harmony   Day,

International  Friendship Day, Youth  Festival  and  National

Day.   These are all activities which can prove to be  useful

in strengthening further racial cohesion among our students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Teo Ho Pin asked about school planning and the

design  of schools.  MOE plans the provision of school places

such  that  no  child in Singapore will be  denied  a  school

place.   We  ensure that every Primary One-going  child  will

have  a  place  in  a  school in the  town  where  he  lives.

However,  it is not possible to ensure that every child  will

be  placed  in a primary school located no further  than  one

kilometre from where he lives.  To do this, we would need  to

build many more primary schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In planning for the building of new schools, MOE takes

into  account  the  actual  number of  school-going  children

living  in  a town and potential demand due to new  residents

moving in, based on data from the Housing and Development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1907</b></font><br><br>



Board.   MOE  does not just look at total demand  for  school

places,  but  ensures that there will be enough  Primary  One

places each year to cater to projected demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist students who move house and need a school

place nearer their new home, MOE conducts what we will call a

Student  Transfer  Exercise for Primary School  Children,  or

STEPS,  every  year,  to  facilitate their  transfer.   These

students  should be able to get a school place  nearer  their

home, provided they have no specific choice of schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there are sufficient vacancies for all, MOE

recognises that parental demand for places in popular schools

will  always  exceed available vacancies.  Where  demand  for

places   exceeds  available  vacancies,  balloting  will   be

conducted.  Allowing parents to register for Primary One  two

years  ahead of actual intake would not remove the  need  for

balloting, as parents would still continue to opt for popular

schools,  but two years earlier.  Hence, the "Build-to-Order"

approach  is not likely to work for the provision  of  school

places  since  parents would still not  be  guaranteed  of  a

school place for their children in the more popular schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on school design, school development projects are

constantly  guided  by design criteria that  are  crafted  to

ensure  value for money and that they meet users'  functional

requirements such as safety, flexibility and maintainability.

School  designs are rigorously checked at various  stages  to

ensure  compliance  with our design parameters  and  standard

specifications.  Features that are not functional  or  costly

to  build  and  maintain will be rejected.  Our  schools  are

functional, and yet aesthetically pleasing, with each  having

a unique identity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Dr Teo that durability and maintainability

are  two  key  design  considerations in the  development  of

schools.   Over the past five years, the buildability  scores

of  our  schools have ranged from 72 to 77.  This  is  higher

than the requirement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1908</b></font><br><br>



of  64  for  schools set by the Code of Practice on Buildable

Design  under the Building Control Act.  Based on the records

of our managing agent, the maintenance cost of our schools is

generally  lower,  at $9.40 per square  metre  per  year,  as

compared  with about $15 per square metre per year for  other

low-rise buildings maintained by them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Design and Build" (D&B) is one of the contract

procurement methods used by both public and private  sectors,

and  MOE has called a number of D&B contracts in the past for

school  projects.  When used, we will ensure overall  control

of the design.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, on this cut, I

would   like  to  talk  about  the  development  in  National

University of Singapore (NUS).  Many of us are alumni of  the

University  and  we have very fond memories of  our  time  as

students.   As such, the continued development of NUS  is  of

great interest to us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even to the casual onlooker, one can discern that a

reform  is  being implemented in NUS, which goes  beyond  the

change  of the title of Vice-Chancellor to President.   There

was  a newspaper report carried by Today, dated 19th February

2002,  commenting on certain aspects of the changes currently

ongoing, under the title "The Plain and the Gain".  The paper

later  apologised, retracted the article in full and  without

reservations on 2nd May.  Nonetheless, the fact remains  that

the  attrition of the faculties has been high in  year  2002,

and  many  from these faculties are well-known names  in  the

academic circle in the Asia Pacific region.  This NUS  reform

was  also  described  by an article that appeared  in  Times,

Higher   Education  Supplement,  dated  3rd  May   2002,   as

"Americanization".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Feedback Unit Chairman, Sir, I too got an earful. I

gained  the  impression that the morale of the staff  in  the

University  is  low, as established norms of  employment  are

turned  upside down.  I hesitate to give some of the comments

I heard, but I thought that perhaps I should do so, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1909</b></font><br><br>



give a depth of the emotion of the undercurrent that is going

on.   But  I  would  like  to disassociate  myself  from  any

innuendoes associated with them.  For instance, a  number  of

staff  reaching 50 years old were given short-term  2-3  year

contracts,  which  is very upsetting to the  staff  who  have

committed their working life to the University.  On the other

hand,  the  President has recruited advisers and  consultants

from US universities, many of them 60 years old or above,  to

advise him on various development programmes.  It seems  that

we are forsaking younger staff for older staff.  Of course, I

understand  that  reform that impacts  established  norms  is

always unwelcome and discomforting to the incumbents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is disquiet on the NUS campus. The public is

uncertain of what is going on.  I would like the Minister  to

lift  this  veil  off  the reform in the University,  and  to

elaborate on the goals and objectives of the reform currently

being  implemented.   For  instance,  what  are  the  desired

outcomes?   What is the progress to-date and  how  would  the

proposed setup of another campus for the NUS tie in with  the

proposed  plan of a fourth university that we earlier  talked

about?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate in Committee of Supply resumed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head K - (cont.)

<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, the recent announcement by NUS that it

would open perhaps one or maybe two campuses in Singapore, in

addition to its existing Kent Ridge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1910</b></font><br><br>



Campus,  has raised several questions which I would  like  to

bring up today for some elaboration by the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First question is: what is the preferred model for our

university  education  system going forward,  as  we  try  to

enhance  the  capacity of the system  to  meet  our  goal  of

allowing   more  Singaporeans  to  participate  in   tertiary

education?   Is it a model where we are going  to  have  many

universities,  such  as the addition of a fourth  university,

maybe  a  fifth,  or  one where we are going  to  have  fewer

universities,   such  as  the  existing   three,   but   then

mushrooming multiple campuses?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I ask this is because previously, when we had

discussion  on  the fourth university, Deputy Prime  Minister

Tony  Tan had made the point that Singapore should move  away

from  the  model of one university suits all, and  we  should

instead  be encouraging the development of diversity  in  our

university  system, so that there is diversity  in  terms  of

curriculum, criteria for enrolment and generally in terms  of

the  cultural lifestyles of these universities.  So, I  would

like some clarification on that as to how we will proceed  as

the University system develops.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A related question then is that for a university like

NUS,  which  already  has a capacity of  about  15,000-16,000

students, if I am not mistaken, is developing more campuses a

desirable  way  to go forward?  Or would it have  an  adverse

impact  on  its  standing  as  a  premier  research  academic

institution in Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final question is that of the fourth university

which  had  been announced as something that was under  quite

intense  study.  I want to know whether as a result  of  this

announcement by NUS, that plan has now been set back or it is

proceeding apace.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, the idea of a fourth

university  was  first  mooted by the International  Academic

Advisory  Panel in January 2001.  The IAP had felt then  that

there was room for greater diversity in university education,

with a number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1911</b></font><br><br>



institutions  each  having  its  own  niche  and   areas   of

specialisation.   The Panel thus supported the  establishment

of  a fourth university which will be built upon the role  of

the  polytechnics.  Many Singaporeans, including  polytechnic

graduates,  will  then  have a shot at university  education.

Currently,   a  significant  seven  out  of  10   polytechnic

graduates  go  on to pursue degrees, many of  them  overseas.

This is a leakage that the local universities can plug.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 2002, Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan had

noted  in  his  speech  at  the Graduation  Ceremony  of  the

University  of Chicago Graduate School of Business  that  the

Committee  to Review Upgrading Opportunities at Degree  Level

had  submitted a report to MOE recommending the establishment

of  a  fourth university.  DPM Tony Tan had then said that  a

fundamental review of the structure of the University had  to

be  undertaken  before a decision on the  proposed  structure

could be finalised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, like many of my parliamentary colleagues

alluded to, it was reported in the press (Straits Times, 30th

April  2002) that NUS will be setting up two new campuses  by

2010,  in  response  to  the growing  demand  for  university

education  in  Singapore.  One of the two new campuses  would

take  3,000  undergraduates  into practice-based  engineering

programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was reported that the potential target students for

this campus were polytechnic graduates who now go overseas to

upgrade their qualifications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister in the context of

the NUS' plans to go multi-campus, if there has been a change

of  heart  regarding the establishment of a fourth university

and, if so, the rationale for the change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the Government's aim to increase

Singaporeans' access to university education so that  one  in

four Singaporeans in each year's cohort,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1912</b></font><br><br>



instead of the current one in five, will have the opportunity

to  attend  university in Singapore by 2010.  This is  timely

and  indeed  crucial  in view of the  demands  for  a  better

educated workforce.  It is also in line with our rallying cry

to   allow  every  Singaporean  a  chance  to  maximise   his

potential.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With both NUS' multi-campus plan and the establishment

of  a fourth university, both would also help to achieve  the

Government's  objective of increasing the  university  cohort

participation  rate.  But I feel that the  fourth  university

route  would  contribute more definitively to the development

of a vibrant university sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed fourth university, as recommended by the

Committee to Review Upgrading Opportunities at Degree  Level,

is to have a practical bent with industry links.  It is to be

a  major provider of continuing education and training and is

to  cater to both part-time and full-time learning as well as

adult  education.  The Committee had felt then  that  with  a

fourth university, the higher education sector would be  more

equipped  to cater to the varying needs of both industry  and

individuals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully concur with these observations. I feel

that  the  introduction of a fourth university  would  better

enrich   our  university  education  ecosystem.   The  fourth

university  with its own mission, structure  and  niche  will

inject diversity into our university education landscape  and

more competition amongst the universities.

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fourth university with the specific mission to focus

on  practice-oriented programmes and caters to the continuing

professional development needs of working adults up to degree

level  would help fill the gap that currently exists  in  our

university system, ie, giving a second chance to those who do

not  make  it to the local university system the  first  time

round.  I feel that a fourth university that is given such  a

clear  mandate  would be better able to tailor its  programme

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1913</b></font><br><br>



admission  criteria to meet the needs of this group  than  an

NUS  that  tries to be all things to all men with  a  diverse

range  of  objectives and goals that may be incongruent  with

each other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, I feel that a fourth university will be

unencumbered by any baggage which the existing university may

carry.   For  instance, currently, only the  top  polytechnic

graduates in each cohort are able to gain admission into NUS,

or  NTU, in view of the keen competition for a limited number

of places.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Khor, could you please wind up your

speech?

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Yes. So these applicants are

required  not  only  to  have good academic  results  in  the

polytechnic  but  also at "O" level and it clearly  does  not

give late bloomers a second chance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore strongly urge the Ministry to study the

merits   of   establishing  a  fourth  university   to   meet

Singaporeans' increasing demand for university education  and

to  give  that second chance in life that they are  searching

for in the new social compact.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, there was a recent newspaper

article  in  the  Straits  Times  "NTU  Grads:   Is  there  a

difference?" dated 8th April which reported that there  is  a

difference between NUS and NTU graduates.  According  to  the

report,  local  companies surveyed found that  NUS  graduates

write  and speak better, but NTU graduates are more creative.

Are  these  true  or  are  they just perceptions?   The  more

critical  question is whether it is writing, speaking  skills

or  creativity,  have our universities sufficiently  prepared

our graduates for the new economy?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than students, I share the concern of the other

Members, with the transformation of the university, what  has

the impact been on the academic staff?  Has the rapid changes

in the universities, particularly the NUS, affected the staff

morale?  This is a critical issue because the morale  of  the

staff may affect the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1914</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third issue I want to raise here, which is my main

concern, is the role of the Chinese Studies Department of the

NUS,  guo  da zhong wen xi.  Here, in Singapore, the  Chinese

Studies  Department  plays a key role  in  nurturing  Chinese

language  teachers and journalists.  Would the Ministry  want

the   NUS   Chinese  Studies  Department  to  continue   this

traditional role in future?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new broad-based education system to be implemented

in  the NUS emphasises an all-rounded general education, that

means,  undergraduates are encouraged to study a broad  range

of  subjects  and  would learn about each subject  in  lesser

depth.  In this case, my worry is that undergraduates in  the

Department  of  Chinese Studies would  study  only  a  single

Chinese major plus other non-Chinese subjects.  This is a big

change  as  students  of the department  today  are  used  to

studying double majors, namely, Chinese Language (Hanyu)  and

Chinese  Studies (Hanxue), which would give them a reasonably

all-rounded  exposure to Chinese language,  culture,  history

and  philosophy.   Many people worry that, with  such  a  big

shift,  graduates  of the future would be  sufficiently  less

proficient  in  Chinese to be Chinese language  teachers  and

journalists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One practical suggestion is that there should be a

scheme  for undergraduates who intend to be Chinese  Language

professionals, such as teachers and journalists, etc,  to  be

exempted  from  this  generalist approach  and  opt  for  the

present  system.   They  should be allowed  to  study  double

majors,  ie, Chinese Language and Chinese Studies (Hanyu  and

Hanxue)  like  the previous batches.  At the same  time,  the

Chinese  Studies Department should continue to offer  courses

to others who would like to study it as a single subject.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, the House was recently

told about the high amount of subsidy the Government provides

for  tertiary  education.  This is  rightly  so  knowing  how

important our human resources are.  We need to do all we  can

to ensure that those deserving of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1915</b></font><br><br>



tertiary education be given all the support necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, the Malay community also deeply

appreciates the tertiary fee subsidy given to the Malays  who

qualify for university and polytechnic education.  Those  who

are  better off give up that subsidy for the benefit  of  the

needy  and  those  who  are more deserving.   But  those  who

receive  the Malay TFF subsidy will be required to give  back

to  the community by doing social service.  This is the point

which  I  would  like to raise about tertiary students  as  a

whole.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because of the large subsidy given by the

Government  for tertiary education, our graduates  should  be

taught  to  pay back to society in one way or another.   Will

MOE consider programmes to encourage and facilitate that?  At

the  North  East  CDC,  for example,  we  encourage  tertiary

student  recipients of our programmes, for example, the  BUST

subsidy  programme to help in the community work.  They  help

in our IT programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to raise is how MOE could

keep  in touch with students who study overseas.  MOE  should

work  with the Singapore International Foundation and Contact

Singapore for that purpose.  Sir, the Government has recently

decided  to  remove  the  tax rebate for  Singapore  students

studying overseas.  I think it is a pity as it could serve as

an  indirect  bond for them.  I would like the Government  to

please  reconsider  withdrawing  that  rebate.   The  British

Commissioner  is here, he knows that we have a  few  thousand

students studying in UK, a few more thousands in the US and a

few  more  thousands in Australia.  But I  think  only  about

5,000 benefit from that tax rebate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not easy for parents to send their children to

study  overseas.  Some go because they could not get a  place

in  Singapore, others for courses not available here.  In any

case,  they are enhancing their worth and, thus, their future

contribution to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1916</b></font><br><br>



Government having to spend more on subsidies for MOE.  I  was

at  the memorial service at Ann Arbor where an undergraduate,

the  late  Miss Amanda Yeo, who was studying at the  Michigan

University died at a road accident.  She was the only girl of

the  family.  I met her family at the church service  in  Ann

Arbor  and I could feel the anguish and the tragedy  felt  by

the family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents whose children study overseas face all kinds of

anxiety and uncertainty.  They deserve understanding.  I must

declare  my  interest.  I am also a recipient and beneficiary

of  that.   But  on  a larger picture, beyond  the  financial

consideration, beyond the tax rebate, we need to find ways to

bond overseas students to Singapore.  I think MOE can help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, can MOE update the House on its thinking about

the honours course for Malay studies at the NUS?

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, it was only about three years

ago  that the Ministry announced that the US-based Scholastic

Aptitude Test (SAT) would be used as an additional assessment

test  for  university entrance.  Presumably,  once  accepted,

this would become a substitute for the "A" level examination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are problems with this approach. At this

point in time, the inclusion of SAT simply meant that our  JC

students   have  to  prepare  for  two  university   entrance

examinations  in their final year of studies.   Interestingly

enough,  none other than the respected UC President,  Richard

Atkinson, has lambasted the SAT 1 test as being unsuitable as

a  university admission assessment test.  As a result, the US

College  Board  announced  in March  this  year  that  it  is

planning   to  revise  its  SAT  1  to  better  service   its

objectives.   For  a test that the Americans themselves  have

declared as not very suitable, we have to ask ourselves  what

is  the value of us switching to SAT.  Of course, I am  aware

that  there is another part of SAT, known as SAT II, that  is

more vigorous.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Addendum to the President's Address, the

Ministry has declared its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1917</b></font><br><br>



intention  of  taking  greater  control  of  the  "A"   level

examinations  in  year 2002.  It also  floated  the  idea  of

setting  up our very own Examinations Authority.   It  states

that  from year 2003 onwards, university admission will  take

into  account other measures, in addition to the "A"  levels.

I  would  like  to  find out from the Ministry  whether  this

announcement meant that we have second thoughts about SAT.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage of development, Sir, I think we do not

have  to  depend any longer on the "O" level  and  "A"  level

examinations.   As  an  independent nation  with  outstanding

scholastic  track  record, a well-funded R&D  sector  and  an

aspiration  to  become an education hub for the  Asia-Pacific

region, I strongly support the proposal to establish our  own

Examinations  Authority.  However, we should be always  aware

of  the  penchant of Singaporeans to crank up standards  year

after year.  In establishing our own Examinatiions Authority,

we should focus on developing a well educated individual with

high  academic achievement, strong cultural ballast and sound

character.   We should avoid falling into the  trap  of  ever

increasing content to stress the students to the limit.  Sir,

would  the Minister share with this House on his thinking  on

the Examinations Authority?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

as  we embark on the new high-tech knowledge-based economy in

Singapore,  we require not only many graduates from  tertiary

institutions, we also need highly-skilled technical  officers

so  that all these technologies could be applied smoothly  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ITE had, during our early days of nation building,

played  a  major role in producing our skilled workforce.   A

great   number  of  technicians  were  cultivated   for   our

industries, particularly the building industry. Now, with our

economy restructuring, we need a different type of skills for

our  workers  and it is quite different from  those  that  we

trained  in  the old days.  Very often, during  my  meet-the-people sessions, I would meet residents who complained to  me

that  their  children  were sent to ITE  and  they  were  not

comfortable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1918</b></font><br><br>



about it.  They wanted their children to go to the mainstream

schools.  To them, those who were sent to ITE were those  who

could  not make the grade to the mainstream schools. Given  a

choice,  they  would  want  their  children  to  go  to   the

mainstream  schools, so that they could do their  "O"  level,

"A"  level  and  then go to the university.  Because  in  the

minds of the parents, going to the university is a sign and a

promise of a good future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, when parents have overly high expectations

for  their  children, it could result in the  students  being

pressurised, and when they are sent to ITE, they will be very

demoralised,  and  lose  their  self-respect.  Many  of  them

believe that   graduating from ITE may not land them a job. I

am  very  glad to hear from the Minister, just now, that  the

prospects  of ITE graduates were not too bad after  all.   We

have  read newspaper reports of some ITE graduates  who  have

gained  admission to the polytechnic, and from there  to  the

university where they obtained their bachelor or even masters

degrees. Some went on to become successful entreprenuers.  It

shows  that our ITEs are also capable of producing successful

and useful citizens for Singapore.

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the problem lies with the fact that many

parents do not understand what prospects their children  have

when  they  go  to  ITE.   So I feel  that  the  Ministry  of

Education  should give ITE a make-over. Like the Remaking  of

Singapore, we should also have a Remaking of ITE.  We  should

establish its brand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I observe that students of ITE are still required

to  wear  uniforms, like the school children from the  junior

schools,  while the polytechnic and university undergraduates

are  not  required to wear any uniform. This  makes  the  ITE

students  feel  inferior.   Why can  we  not  allow  the  ITE

students  to do away with their uniforms like the  university

undergraduates?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if we want to instill more confidence in their

parents, we should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1919</b></font><br><br>



enhance  the status of ITE. Our universities have  linked  up

with  other  renowned foreign universities to  become  sister

universities.   Why can we not encourage ITE to tie  up  with

some  of  the  well-known colleges overseas  to  enhance  its

reputation?   Here I am not saying that the moon overseas  is

brighter than the one in Singapore.  But I am saying that the

Singapore  moon  is just as round as the moon  in  the  other

countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I hope, Sir, that the Ministry of

Education  would make efforts to "remake ITE" while  remaking

Singapore,  so  that the students of ITE will  be   proud  of

themselves.   As a matter of fact, many parents felt  ashamed

when  their  children were sent to ITE. When asked  by  their

friends where their children were studying, they would  reply

shamefully,  "Oh, some neighbourhood school.  I do  not  know

its name."  Why is it that we make these parents harbour such

inferiority complex?  Why can we not do something  about  it?

Raise  the status of ITE, tell the parents that the  moon  in

Singapore  is  just as round as in the other countries,  that

our  ITE  in  Singapore  is just as  good  as  the  technical

colleges overseas.  I know the Minister for Education is very

modest,  but  I  think sometimes he can  afford  to  be  more

arrogant.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Sir, I am not sure if we should thank

Mr  Jack  Neo for thrusting ITE into the limelight  with  the

film I Not Stupid because "it not good"!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ITE plays a crucial role in providing the much-needed skills training, as well as continuous training. One

good  thing  about the recession is that it reminds  us  that

skills training is an integral part of our economic survival.

As  Singapore  restructures our economy,  there  is  an  even

greater need to increase the pool of skilled workers.   Those

who  do not possess relevant skills will find it increasingly

difficult  to  keep their jobs or find new jobs  in  time  to

come.   The ITE produces more than 10,000 graduates  a  year,

and many of them have done well.  In fact, more than 1,400 of

them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1920</b></font><br><br>



thereafter.  This shows that ITE indeed is not the end.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I feel compelled to remind ourselves that the

success  and  the contribution of ITE should not be  measured

only by the number of graduates who proceeded to polytechnics

or  universities.  We need to redefine success and, to do so,

we  must  first recognise that ITE provides a wide  scope  of

curriculum, ranging from cutting-edge information  technology

to biomedical technology.  ITE graduates are professionals in

their  respective  fields,  and  they  can  excel  and   make

positive, even critical, contributions to the economy and the

society,  even if they do not proceed to the polytechnics  or

universities eventually.  Without them, we will not  be  able

to attract good investments to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister said earlier that even in the year 2001,

when the recession was at its worst, 88% of the ITE graduates

were  able to secure a full-time job within three months  and

their  average salary ranged between $1,100 and  $1,400,  not

bad  in  a recession year.  We have also heard stories  about

ITE   graduates  being  successful  in  business.   ITE  has,

undoubtedly,  done  a  good  job.   Its  graduates  are  well

regarded  by their employers.  Unfortunately, Sir, the  image

of  ITE  has been somewhat less than what it deserves, partly

due  to  its association with its predecessor, the VITB,  and

partly due to the show I Not Stupid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether he would

consider putting in more resources into ITE to further expand

and  upgrade  its programmes, as well as to have a  proactive

programme to improve its profile and image.  I note that  the

recurrent  budget for ITE has been reduced by 2.6% while  the

recurrent  budget for the overall Ministry of  Education  has

increased by 1.5%.  I hope that we are not sending the  wrong

message.  However, I note that the capital expenditure budget

for the ITE has increased substantially.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister would also consider encouraging

the ITE to have academic exchange programmes with reputable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1921</b></font><br><br>



similar   nature.   This  will  undoubtedly  inject   greater

professionalism  into  ITE.  It  will  also  help  raise  the

international standing of ITE and boost its image.  Then,  we

can  change the image of ITE and it is no longer the end  but

to change it to the Institute of Technical Excellence.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir,

the  Institute  of  Technical Education in  our  country  has

played  an  important  role  and will  continue  to  play  an

important role in training our technicians and engineers  for

the  future, our industry and the new economy.  In our effort

to   remake  Singapore,  we  should  study  skills  upgrading

programmes,   retraining  and  lifelong  learning   for   our

workforce.    The   ITE  and  polytechnics   will   play   an

increasingly  important  role  in  this  matter.   The   main

challenge  for  the ITE and polytechnics is  to  attract  and

encourage our workers to return to school or the classroom.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we often hear stories of outstanding ITE and

polytechnic graduates who become successful entrepreneurs and

businessmen.   They bring pride to the ITE and  polytechnics,

and  I feel more will achieve success.  They make a name  for

themselves, thus bringing prestige to the institutions of ITE

and  the  polytechnics through their success.  Through  their

success, we will better appreciate the good efforts of  these

institutions  that have prepared and equipped  them  for  the

employment  market and the industrial world  which  are  very

challenging and competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ITE is one of the pillars of our education system.

Both  the ITE and polytechnic system emphasise excellence  in

technical  education.   Year after year,  these  institutions

have    undergone   numerous   renewals.    Therefore,    job

opportunities for ITE and polytechnic graduates are good, and

Singapore  offers  many opportunities for those  who  undergo

technical  education.   We will see more  new  jobs  and  new

potential   in   the   knowledge-based  economy.    ITE   and

polytechnic  graduates will find that they have a  place  for

themselves



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1922</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many areas in which the ITE and

polytechnics can explore.  The services industry has a  large

potential  for them.  Our nation is expanding the information

technology, life sciences and chemical industries.  These are

areas  which  need a skilled workforce, and the ITE  and  the

polytechnics  could think of ways to support  these  thriving

industries.  Like other educational institutions, ITE and the

polytechnics  should  encourage  creativity  and  innovation.

Their students should be given the freedom to explore and  go

deeper  into  their  studies.  Practical skills  and  certain

skills  are  important, but they cannot ensure our  survival.

We should nurture our students with an entrepreneurial spirit

and  a "dare to fail" attitude so that they would work harder

and face new challenges with success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of technical education is high, and we are

respected  in  many countries in the world.  There  are  many

examples  where  ITE graduates are successful  in  continuing

their  education  to  the university and  polytechnic.   This

shows  that the ITE has built a strong foundation and  should

be  seen  as  a  good beginning for our students.   Technical

training and the ability to "adapt oneself" for the  ITE  and

polytechnic  graduates  are seen as two  positive  traits  to

nurture  those  who  are technopreneurs.   But  ITE  and  the

polytechnics  can  do  more by offering  additional  business

modules and giving support to the potential graduates through

an  incubation  system  and network of graduates.   Technical

education  in  our  country has come  a  long  way  and  will

continue to expand.  With new changes in the structure of ITE

and  polytechnics and also continuous upgrading of the  staff

and  their  facilities, these institutions will  continue  to

excel.   Our  polytechnics have trained many people  in  this

region.  They appreciate our assistance and have praised  the

quality  of  the  courses that we offer.  Our  neighbours  in

ASEAN have also benefitted.  From one angle, we grapple  with

the  effort to continue improving our products and  services,

but  here we already have a good product, ie, the quality  of

our education and training.  Outsiders see these as our brand

name, but we have not reaped its full benefits.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1923</b></font><br><br>



Why  do we not market our educational services industry  more

aggressively?  Sir, I propose that our main institutions  can

lead  in  this effort.  We should not have the old  thinking,

ie,  "Why  should we help others to catch up or compete  with

us?"  This is wrong because, if we do not improve on whatever

we  have,  others will take over our place.  Let us  increase

our effort to market our courses and services.  Singapore can

become  the  leading  education centre  in  this  region.   I

believe  we  can  expand our services beyond the  borders  of

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, we have a strong and diverse

post-secondary  sector  that caters  to  different  types  of

students.   Our  ITE,  polytechnics  and  universities  offer

Singaporeans  access  to an array of academic  and  technical

options in further education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to thank Mr Ong, Mr Gan and Mr

Zainudin for the encouragement that they have given  to  ITE.

We will continue to try and market ITE as well as we can.  In

fact, I would invite all Members of this House to come along,

and  I hope that they will come, including Mr Inderjit Singh,

to see for themselves how well the students are doing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ITE has come a long way. It is now a confident,

increasingly    well-regarded   post-secondary    educational

institution.   The  real success of ITE is  not  measured  in

terms  of  how  many  students  have  been  able  to  go   to

polytechnic  or how many students have gone on to  university

from   ITE,  although  we  celebrate  the  success  of  these

students.  The real success of ITE has been the fact that  it

has  successfully  raised  the prospects  and  maximised  the

potential  of  young  Singaporeans who,  in  other  education

systems all over the world, would have been left behind.  The

fact  that youth unemployment in Singapore is not a  problem,

even  in  the  middle of the recession, is  evidence  of  the

success of ITE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a robust polytechnic sector which provides vital

technical and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1924</b></font><br><br>



supervisory  manpower,  and many  of  our  entrepreneurs  and

business leaders today come from the polytechnics.   We  have

three  good  universities,  each  with  their  different  and

distinct   focus   and   character.    Different   types   of

institutions,  each  with different  missions  and  different

emphasis, together, they provide a range of options  to  meet

the needs of both the economy and individuals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving forward, we intend to expand opportunities and

introduce greater diversity in the further education  sector.

We  need  to  increase capacity so that  all  those  able  to

benefit  from  further  education  can  have  access  to  our

technical institutes, polytechnics and universities.  We have

significantly expanded opportunities across all types of post-secondary  and  tertiary education.  Twenty years  ago,  less

than  three  out  of  10  pupils made  it  to  post-secondary

education.  Ten years ago, it had grown to nearly six out  of

10.   Today, more than eight out of 10 do so.  At the  degree

level,  the Ministry is considering further expansion of  the

university sector.  Our university cohort participation  rate

has  quadrupled  from  5% in 1980 to  21%  today.   With  the

sounder  foundation that our students now receive in  school,

the  university cohort participation rate can be raised  from

the  current 21% to 25%, and we are now working to make  this

possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater capacity is also necessary to provide for the

larger  cohorts  of  students feeding through  to  the  post-secondary  sector.  As Members know, 1988 was a dragon  year,

with  a  bumper  crop  of 53,000 babies.   In  the  10  years

following  that,  the number of babies born averaged  49,000,

about 20% higher than the decade before 1988.  These children

started to come into the school system in 1995.  In 2005, the

dragon  babies  will be ready to enter ITE, the  polytechnics

and  pre-university.  We have anticipated this, and  we  will

have sufficient places for them.

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve greater diversity and expand opportunities in

the  sector,  the  Ministry is currently  restructuring  ITE,

building  a  fifth polytechnic and reviewing  the  university

sector.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1925</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ITE will regroup its current 10 campuses into three

Regional  Campuses (RCs) over the next 15 years.  The  larger

campuses  will  allow each campus to offer a  full  range  of

courses  and provide the opportunities for cross-disciplinary

training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$700 million will be spent to build a fifth polytechnic

which  will  open its door in 2003.  The Republic Polytechnic

will  not  only  increase capacity, it  will  inject  greater

diversity into this important sector of our education system,

and help to further raise standards all round.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Inter-ministerial Committee, chaired by Dr Ng, is

currently  reviewing the university sector.  He  will  update

Members on this later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with specific issues on our public

universities brought up by Dr Wang and Mr Yeo.  I would first

like  to thank Mr Yeo for pointing out that NUS and NTU  have

achieved  a  degree of international standing for themselves.

Both  NUS  and NTU aim for excellence in education,  research

and contribution to the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo expressed concern on the impact of curricular

broadening on the Department of Chinese Studies.  I have been

told  by NUS that the emphasis on broad-based education  does

not  preclude  students from gaining a rigorous grounding  in

Chinese  Literature, Chinese Language, history or philosophy.

Students  can  still  opt  to read modules  in  both  Chinese

Studies and Chinese Language.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, a university will only flourish if they have

capable  and committed staff of high quality.  Both  NUS  and

NTU  have  put  in  place  a market-driven  performance-based

renumeration  system  that  gives them  more  flexibility  to

reward excellence and to attract and retain talent.  Dr  Wang

and  Mr  Yeo have expressed some concern about the impact  of

these  changes  on staff.  Sir, both universities  are  going

through  a period of transition from basically teaching-based

institutions  to  institutions that place  emphasis  on  both

teaching  and  research.  Some staff may  adapt  faster  than

others.  However, I am



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1926</b></font><br><br>



confident that these changes are necessary for the success of

the  universities in the long-term.  Dr Wang  said  that  the

staff attrition rate of NUS is high.  Last year, 5.9% of NUS'

faculty  members  or 116 left the university.   This  is  not

unreasonable, especially compared to the attrition  rates  of

reputable universities worldwide, where the attrition rate of

10%,  12%  or  15%  is not uncommon.  NUS has  been  able  to

successfully  recruit new faculty members.   Last  year,  NUS

recruited 194 new faculty members. Too high a turnover  rate,

of  course, is undesirable.  But a certain level of  turnover

is  healthy,  if any organisation is to renew and  regenerate

itself.    This   turnover   of  faculty   in   NUS   creates

opportunities  for  intellectual  renewal  and  ensures  high

academic standards, which is key to NUS' goal of being world-class.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our educational institutions must recruit the people

strictly based on merit, and if Dr Wang has any evidence that

this has not been so in any of our institutions, I would urge

him to immediately make this known to my Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang spoke about universities switching to SAT. I

would  like to clarify that my Ministry has never  said  that

SAT will replace the "A" levels.  SAT I is only one component

of  the University Admission System and serves as a reasoning

test that complements a content-based "A" level examinations.

Having a basket of admission requirements provides for a more

holistic measure of an applicant's ability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SAT II tests that Dr Wang mentioned are tests that

measure  specific content-based knowledge and would duplicate

the  function already served by the "A" levels.   Hence,  MOE

has  no  intention to introduce SAT II.  We will  study  what

changes  the College Board intends to make to SAT I, and  see

if  it  continues to be a test that suits our  purpose.   The

establishment  of an examination board does not  reflect  any

second thoughts about SAT I.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of establishing an examination board is to

build up our own capability and expertise in educational



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1927</b></font><br><br>



assessment and examination services.  As Dr Wang pointed out,

it  will  support  our  efforts to develop  Singapore  as  an

educational  hub.   The examination board  will  conduct  the

national  examinations  based on  the  Ministry's  prescribed

syllabuses  and curriculum framework, and the Ministry  would

ensure   that  the  examinations  accurately  assess  pupils'

achievement validly and reliably and are closely  aligned  to

curricular objectives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, examinations, testing and assessments are an

integral  part of the education process. They should  not  be

seen as something separate.  They provide feedback and ensure

that  standards  are  maintained.  Examinations  only  become

dysfunctional if they are not aligned with the objectives  of

education.  If they measure things which are not really  what

your  objectives are in education, it thereby leads  students

down a path which is not what you really want them to do.  To

reflect  our focus on creativity and thinking, we  have  been

modifying  our  examination  formats  to  include  open  book

examinations,  source-based  questions  where  students   are

required  to  draw inferences, project work, and school-based

continuous  assessment  of  the  practical  and  experimental

capability of our "A" level Science students. These are quite

different  from the traditional examinations and tests  which

students  have taken in the past.  Of course, they  are  more

challenging  for  both the students and teachers  to  prepare

for.   Such assessments are more aligned with our educational

goals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our own examination board, we will be more able to

ensure   that   examinations  are   well-aligned   with   our

objectives, and that we can introduce innovations, such as IT-based  assessments, without having to wait  till  others  are

ready.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now ask Dr Ng to respond to the other points that

Members have raised.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</b> Mr

Chairman, the Minister has sketched an overview of our  post-secondary education sector.  I would like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1928</b></font><br><br>



to  address specific queries from some Members.  Let me touch

on ITE and the polytechnic first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry wholeheartedly agrees with Mr Ong, Mr Gan

and  Mr  Zainudin Nordin that the polytechnic and ITE sectors

are  important pillars of our education system.  I would like

to assure Members that the Government will continue to invest

in  technical  education.  For  FY2002,  the  Government  has

budgeted  $1.2  billion which translates to  an  increase  of

about 25% over FY2001's provision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed FY2002 budget may give some Members,

including  Mr  Gan,  the impression that  the  Government  is

spending  less.   This  is because in FY2001,  the  operating

budget included a one-off payment for the outstanding GST  on

the  polytechnics  and ITE for prior years.   Excluding  this

item,  Government's  spending  for  the  technical  education

sector is actually significantly higher for FY2002.  A  fifth

polytechnic  will be developed and we will be  spending  more

than $350 million in developmental costs to build ITE's first

Regional  Campus  at Simei.  The construction  of  the  first

Regional Campus will begin in the second half of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that Mr Ong Ah Heng and Mr Gan Kim

Yong  agree  with  the  Ministry that  ITE  is  an  excellent

institution. They feel that the ITE has been wrongly maligned

and  asked if we can do more to improve the public perception

of  ITE.   I agree that ITE has been unfairly misrepresented.

MOE  is  extremely  proud of what ITE has  accomplished.   We

consistently "show off" ITE to overseas guests  who  go  away

with  great  admiration and commend us for  doing  it  right.

What  they mean is that we have resisted, in the words of  Dr

Amy  Khor,  trying to be "all things to all  men".   We  have

focused  on substance, rather than form.  We have  done  this

because  we assess correctly the abilities of that sector  of

the  students, given them relevant value-added education  and

thereby help them find jobs and retain their dignity.  Mr Ong

Ah  Heng can tell the parent, who was worried about her child

who went to ITE, that not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1929</b></font><br><br>



only is the moon very round, it is like a moon cake, you  can

taste  the substance, with the yolk. The Minister has already

reported that 88% of our ITE graduates find employment within

three  months of graduation.  This is not not bad.   This  is

very  good.  Hong Kong recently reported an unemployment rate

of 14% for those aged 25 years and below, first time entering

the  job  market.  Many of these students  went  through  the

education  system, but failed in so many subjects  that  they

achieve neither substance nor form.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we get international praise for ITE whilst some

locals  perceive ITE negatively?  Singaporeans will  have  to

examine  themselves  to  determine if  they  are  making  the

correct  value judgement.  We will be proud, as  my  Minister

says, to take them on a tour around ITE to help them make  up

their  minds.   But  my ITE board, principals,  teachers  and

students know full well my highest regard for them and  their

institution.   More importantly, the teachers  are  proud  to

teach  in ITE - they have a very low turnover rate.   If  the

institution  is bad, explain to me why the turnover  rate  is

only  4%?   They  are  proud despite the derision  from  some

Singaporeans,  many  of whom have never  visited  ITE.  These

Singaporeans, by their unfair remarks, diminish the good work

of  committed  teachers and the significant  achievements  of

students in ITE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thankfully, the majority of the public is more

discerning  and  this  has  been  helped  by  ITE's  outreach

programme.  ITE indeed reaches out to 14,000 students in  the

Normal  Stream and 1,800 parents annually.  Special  outreach

programmes  are also conducted for existing secondary  school

teachers  and principals and the graduating trainee  teachers

at  NIE,  as  they are significant groups of people  who  can

advise students on their post-secondary educational choices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to report that ITE's image has improved

significantly  in recent years.  In an ITE public  perception

survey  conducted in 1997, many Singaporeans felt  that  "ITE

was  good but not for me".  However, in the 2000 survey, many

people are now accepting that ITE does indeed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1930</b></font><br><br>



provide  an alternative and viable educational pathway  which

meets  their career and academic aspirations.  What  is  more

encouraging  is that 37% of respondents put  ITE  as  one  of

their top three choices for post-secondary education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the polytechnic sector. Mr Zainudin

Nordin has asked if we should leverage on our reputation  and

strength to market services and products in quality technical

education.   Our  institutions have already done  that  to  a

limited  extent.  I must, however, emphasise  that  marketing

service   overseas  is  not  the  primary  mission   of   our

polytechnics  and  ITE.   Our  polytechnics  and  ITE  should

continue  to  focus  on  providing  accessible  and   quality

technical education to Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now speak about the university sector. I

thank  Dr Wang, Mr Iswaran and Dr Amy Khor for their interest

in the Government's approach to expanding the capacity of the

university sector.  Both at the Inter-Ministry Committee  and

the  ERC,  we  are  fundamentally reviewing  what  roles  the

universities need to perform to continue to play an  integral

part  in supporting our economic initiatives.  This would  be

an  opportune  time  to  surface strategic  issues  regarding

university education in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For brevity, I will simplify things by stating that the

universities play three roles for Singaporeans. Firstly, they

fulfil aspirations for those who want degrees. Secondly, they

train  and  produce  graduates  to  support  our  industries.

Thirdly, they are incubators and "hatching grounds" for ideas

that will lead and shape industry.  We would have started  on

a  very  wrong footing if we approached the review mainly  to

fulfill aspirations - as Dr Amy Khor suggested, to give  some

people  a  second chance - of just deciding how to create  an

additional  3,000  more  university  places  each   year   to

accommodate  25% of our cohort of students.   Governments  in

some   European  countries  funded  the  expansion  of  their

universities to cater to an ever-increasing pressure to allow

more and more citizens to enter universities - and with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1931</b></font><br><br>



diminishing returns. The idea is noble, well-intentioned  but

illusory:   whoever seeks to be educated in  whatever  course

shall  be  admitted.   If  the citizen  is  enriched  through

education,  even  if  he does not have the  academic  ability

required, then society is still enhanced.  What happens?  30-50%  of  the  first  year  cohort drop  out;  professors  and

lecturers  become  disheartened  and  demoralised.  Standards

drop,  and the diminishing cycle perpetuates.  Consider this.

Despite   50%  of  the  cohort  in  some  European  countries

attending university, Europe is short of engineers  (as  told

to  me  by Spanish, Danish industrialists and the UK Sterling

Group  of  Professors)!  So, too the United States.   Let  me

quote   to  you  what  the  Dean  of  Engineering  at  Tuft's

University at Boston testified at the Capitol Hill last week.

He  said, "We have a severe shortage of engineers. We  import

engineers from abroad and a lot of our new technologies  that

we rely on for security reasons are developed abroad.  And  I

don't think that's a safe path".  Despite a dramatic increase

in  the country's demand for engineers, interest in the field

has   dropped  significantly  at  colleges  and  universities

nationwide.   So this leading academician is now  asking  for

more  funds  to reverse this trend.  Even if he gets  it,  it

will take some years for them to catch up.

<br>4.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been more prudent and only funded students

of  sufficient calibre to enter our public universities  and,

more  so,  in  particular  disciplines  of  engineering   and

sciences that would help our overall economy.  That policy of

producing graduates relevant to industry enabled us  to  ride

on  globalisation and manufacturing in the last  two  decades

and  the economy thrived.  This policy will continue but will

not  be enough to secure our future prosperity as we move  up

the value chain in a knowledge-intensive economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China has a birth cohort of 24 million per year.

Currently,  they  produce  1.6 million  graduates,  and  that

number will grow.  In comparison, Singapore produces



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1932</b></font><br><br>



10,000 graduates each year from our public universities.   We

cannot compete on size or the average of our graduates alone.

The  "peaks", in other words, the highs that our universities

and  their  graduates  attain, must  be  our  differentiating

factor.  Our universities must now move further up the  value

chain  and  have  people  who can create  new  knowledge  and

innovate.  They must be able to effectively transfer this new

knowledge  into  the business and industry,  so  that  wealth

creation will ensue.  This is not something that we want  but

need to have for our economy to grow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The precious material in a knowledge-based economy is

brain power, and investments will flow to wherever there is a

concentration  of this.  The Research Triangle  Park  in  the

state of North Carolina, where Deputy Prime Minister Tan  and

I visited recently, clearly exemplifies that universities can

create  wealth for the country.  The state of North  Carolina

has  about  eight million people.  Forty years ago,  its  per

capita  income was the second lowest in the USA,  only  above

the  state of Mississippi.  They were very much dependent  on

tobacco,   textiles   and   agricultural   industries    with

diminishing profits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaders from business, academia and industry, with

the  help from legislators, decided to start a research  park

based on their three leading universities - the University of

North  Carolina  at  Chapel Hill, the  North  Carolina  State

University  at  Raleigh  and  the  private  Duke  University.

Today,  the  Research Triangle Park has achieved  the  wealth

creation  effect.   Gross  revenue generated  last  year  was

US$6.5   billion  and  the  park  provides  work  for  44,000

residents.  The average incomes of the state have risen to be

equivalent  to  the average income earned  in  the  USA,  and

workers  within  the park earn 120% of the median  income  of

workers  within  the  USA.   The  average  salary  is   about

US$55,000 a year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This story of brains attracting investments is repeated

across  the  USA  and, indeed, much of  the  world,  eg,  the

Oresund Region based in Sweden and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1933</b></font><br><br>



Denmark.  Some are planned more than others, but the elements

of   success   are   the  same.   Multi-national   industrial

corporations  are moving away from their central laboratories

to  congregations of brains to mine for ideas.  This  creates

wealth and it is a virtuous cycle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are cogent lessons to be learnt. The first is

that  our universities must become engines of growth for  our

economy,  not  only  just produce graduates  to  support  the

economy.   All our public universities must find their  niche

in creating wealth.  How can we help them do this?  We can do

so by matching capabilities with resources; allowing students

and,  indeed, faculties to move at the desired pace.  We must

create   a   robust  eco-system  incorporating   our   public

universities, ie, NUS, NTU and SMU, research institutions and

even  private  universities.  We must allow  each  university

and,   indeed,  each  faculty  or  discipline   within   that

university,  to differentiate itself and find  its  niche  in

this economic imperative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25% of our students will go to university by 2010. They

will  have  differing capabilities and  strengths.   I  agree

absolutely with Dr Amy Khor that the university cannot try to

be 'all things to all men'.  Our universities must respond to

that diversity, take ownership of their students, faculty and

institutions, and understand their mission accordingly.   Not

all can or will want to do research.  Some would prefer to be

more  industrially-oriented.  So it is not only about setting

up a fourth or even a fifth university, as Dr Amy Khor and Mr

Iswaran enquired, but about establishing a university  system

that can fulfill our desired goals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not come to a conclusion, but the multi-campus

model for NUS appears attractive for a number of reasons.  By

introducing  a multi-campus structure, we can  build  on  the

strengths  of  our  existing universities and  still  promote

diversity.  We can allow each campus to develop strengths  in

different disciplines.  For example, the University of  North

Carolina  (UNC)  system is a state university  comprising  16

campuses.   The UNC at Chapel Hill is a centre of  excellence

in liberal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1934</b></font><br><br>



arts  and  professional disciplines, while the North Carolina

State  University has a strong engineering  school,  with  an

emphasis on industrial engagement and entrepreneurship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the scenario of a multi-campus NUS, we can

imagine  the  campus  at  Kent Ridge focusing  more  on  R&D,

together  with research institutions in engineering, medicine

and  the  sciences.   NUS at Outram could  house  a  graduate

medical  school  and  expand  into  biomedical  sciences  and

nursing.    NUS  (X)  would  excel  in  industrially-oriented

engineering  and  info-communications technology.   We  could

also   create   a  creative  cluster  within   NUS   (X)   by

incorporating the Arts Faculty, Architecture and a School  of

Design,  Media and Visual Arts.  Mr Iswaran asked  if  multi-campuses would drag down the flagship campus.  It did not  in

the UNC system.  We do not think it would in ours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the form, the over-arching mission for

universities  to  bring wealth to Singapore will  remain  the

raison  d'etre.   My committee will need  to  study  all  the

options of expansion carefully and examine which will  create

a university sector that is best for Singapore.  We target to

complete our study by the end of 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a final note, I could not agree more with Mr Zainul

Abidin when he says that we must inculcate a sense of bonding

and  social  responsibility in our graduates  from  ITE,  the

polytechnics and the universities.  We have chosen to  invest

heavily in their education for a brighter future.  It  is  up

to  each of them to determine how he or she repays that  debt

to society.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> On a point of clarification,

Sir.   In  my speech, when I was referring to people,  I  was

referring  to  those  who deserve a second  chance  at  being

admitted  to  university, those from  the  polytechnics,  for

instance, who have been admitted to overseas universities and

who have done well.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> Sir, we are aware that we are all

quick,  some  are naturally intelligent, but  some  are  born

inherently  with  learning disabilities.  In  view  of  these

realities, I am proud and glad to know that MOE has  started,

for  several years now, a special scheme called the  Learning

Support  Programme  (LSP)  to  assist  students  with  innate

learning problems.  I was told that the LSP programme  covers

only two subjects, ie, Mathematics and English.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this matter, I have several questions for the

Minister.  Could the Minister give the House an update on the

progress  of  the programme and its effectiveness  since  its

inception?  Secondly, can the Minister also give the House an

insight   on  the  plans  and  future  development  of   this

programme?  Thirdly, are there other similar programmes  that

are  being considered to assist our students who are hindered

in their learning due to one reason or another?

<br>4.54 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Madam, the Learning Support Programme

provides  useful  guidance to help students  facing  learning

difficulties in schools.  This problem arises partly  due  to

the   different   qualities  of  pre-school   programmes   in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to seek the following clarifications from

the  Minister.  How many students are undergoing the Learning

Support  Programme, and what is the success rate?   What  are

the  plans  of the Ministry to extend this programme  to  all

schools  and at all levels?  What are the resources specially

set aside to conduct this programme?

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Madam, I read with interest recently

that  the old boys of Raffles Institution are going to invest

more  than a million dollars in the school's rugby programme.

They  want to recapture RI's past glory as the leading  rugby

school in Singapore.  In recent years, RI is not the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1936</b></font><br><br>



school we used to fear in the 1970s, when I was a school boy,

and they have since lost the crown to ACS, which has not only

consistently won the school's championship for all divisions,

but  has moved on to international competitions and won those

competitions as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I am not raising this because as an ex-ACS boy I

am  afraid that we will lose the crown to RI, although  I  do

not  think it is likely, not in the next few years at  least.

I  feel  that this report touches on an even deeper issue  on

hand,  ie,  how much money should we allow schools to  invest

for the sake of medals and glory?  Should there be a limit?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school's sports scene, I believe, is premised on the

principle  of bringing out the best endeavours of our  school

boys and girls through amateur sports.  It is founded on  the

spirit competition that seeks to rely as much as possible  on

their  own ability and resources in order to achieve sporting

glory.  This spirit of self-reliance is important in that  it

helps  to build and bring out the character and determination

of  the  sportsmen  and  sportswomen through  hard  work  and

training.   This  spirit is in keeping  with  the  ideals  of

education, of which sports is a necessary part.  With limited

resources  in  our  schools, we have a level  playing  field.

Hard  work  and training will allow every school to  stand  a

chance   of   attaining  national  glory   through   sporting

achievement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, enlisting outside help for massive resources may

lead  to  adverse consequences.  First, not every  school  in

Singapore   has  a  rich  alumni  to  generously  fund   such

programmes.   If such funding was allowed, it would  rob  the

incentive  of the other schools, which are not so  generously

endowed, to compete or participate in competition where  they

know the playing field is not level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if we allow generous funding for selected

sports, it would be possible for the schools to bring in top-grade  sportsmen  or foreign talent, and  leverage  on  these

sportsmen  to  win  national glory.  A friend  of  mine  once

remarked to me that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1937</b></font><br><br>



with that level of funding, there is no need for the boys  to

train  hard.  All they need to do, for example, is  to  bring

the top Fijian or New Zealand boys team to play for them.  If

that were so, would our boys and girls find the incentive  to

want to train hard for competition?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, sports in school have the objective of instilling

character   and  discipline  in  our  children.    I   would,

therefore,  like  to  ask the Minister whether  the  Ministry

would  consider  regulating  the  extent  to  which  external

funding may be provided for sports in schools.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> Madam, we all agree and know that

many  parents  are  very  concerned  about  their  children's

future.   Speaking as a parent myself, we worry  whether  our

children  can  cope with the extremely competitive  education

system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we parents are more concerned than our children.

We  are  so  afraid of our children not having the best  and,

whenever possible, many would try their best to assist  their

children.  This feeling is so strong that even in the  choice

of  the  co-curricular activity or the CCA choice,  we  would

like  to  tell our kids what they should choose.   I  believe

this is one area where we should let our children decide  and

choose for themselves.  This choice should be based on  their

personal  interest and talent.  And this is one area  outside

of  the  academic  field that I feel we can choose  to  groom

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we want the education system to prepare the

future  generations  for  the rapid changes  and  to  produce

nimble, creative and innovative minds.  This should not  only

be  done in classrooms.  We must use the CCA and exploit  its

potential  to  educate our students on the other  aspects  of

life.   CCA  should  not  be seen as a  chore  or  burden  to

schools,  parents  and  staff but, rather,  as  an  important

extension to education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through CCA, we can inculcate important values on

discipline,  leadership,  social  interaction,   sports   and

healthy lifestyle.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1938</b></font><br><br>



We should invest in CCA and improve the programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Madam, as we grow as a young nation and

further  improve  our education system, we should  strive  to

have  a  more holistic approach towards education.   Academic

excellence  should not be the only thrust  of  education.   A

child   should  be  nurtured  on  values,  such  as  national

education, community spirit, social services, voluntarism and

sports.   This  will nurture a well-rounded  individual  with

strong  community  ties.  Ultimately,  our  education  system

should  aim to develop citizens who are able to put Singapore

and  community  before self.  And I believe the co-curricular

activity is an important aspect of such a system.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Madam, with the pressure of living

mounting in every facet of life, including in our schools, it

is important for us to continually build confidence and self-esteem,  particularly in our young.  The  Prime  Minister  is

sensing  the erosion of Singaporeans' confidence as a  result

of  the  economic downturn and has, in fact,  asked  us,  his

fellow MPs, to lift the spirit and inject a greater degree of

confidence in our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, while he is seeing this in an economic context,

similar  confidence  building should  also  be  done  in  our

schools.    I   officiated  at  a  school  ceremony   in   my

constituency  recently where the National  Youth  Achievement

Award  (NYAA)  scheme has been used to maximum  advantage  to

inculcate  excellence and develop its students to their  full

potential.

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of over 300 students who participated in the scheme, 99%

of  them received at least a Bronze Award.  This is no  small

feat considering the amount of time and effort the school has

to  put in to make sure that all the students go through  the

rigour of the entire course.  The students I met appeared  to

be very confident of themselves and are highly motivated.   I

would  like  to suggest that MOE adopt a strategy to  require

all schools to send a certain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1939</b></font><br><br>



minimum  number of their students to participate in the  NYAA

Scheme  so that these students could be role models  for  the

rest of their school counterparts.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Mdm Chairman, we have always taken

pride  in  our academic achievements.  Our children  have  in

general  performed much better than students  in  many  other

countries,  even  some  of  the  developed  countries.    The

Education  Ministry must be given credit for  doing  a  great

job,  especially  so in view of Singapore's small  population

base.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, education is not just about academic

achievements.  Academic development is only one component  of

a  person's  development.  We must aim to provide a  holistic

education  for  our children which aims to strike  a  balance

among   academic,  physical,  emotional,  mental  and  social

developments.  In particular, I think there may be a need for

us  to re-look at our curriculum to strengthen our efforts in

character building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three specific aspects need to be emphasised: moral

values, social responsibility and capacity for failure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moral values: it is most crucial to teach our children

the  sense  of  right and wrong.  If we  fail  in  this,  the

society  will  degenerate into lawlessness.   Our  basis  for

justice  and  equality will disintegrate,  and  our  academic

achievement will mean nothing in the end.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social responsibility: we must inculcate in our youths

that they have a responsibility towards the society that they

live  in.   They are not just individuals striving for  their

own success at the expense of others.  Instead, they need  to

recognise the needs of the society and see themselves as part

of the solution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capacity for failure: our own failures as well as those

of others.  We must learn to be tolerant of failures.  We can

then be willing to take risks and venture out.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1940</b></font><br><br>



This is the beginning of nurturing entrepreneurs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Chairman, character building is a difficult

subject  to  teach, as it is a rather abstract  concept.   It

cannot  be  taught through classroom lessons.  It has  to  be

nurtured through life experiences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, in this regard, the community involvement

programme (CIP) is an excellent initiative in building up the

character  of  our  students by involving them  in  community

projects.    However,   the   current   programme   has   its

limitations.  For example, the requisite hours of CIP is only

six  hours a year.  Hardly anything can be done in six hours.

Some  schools  end up visiting old folk homes,  much  to  the

annoyance  of the homes.  But do not get me wrong.   This  is

still  good effort.  However, I think the impact is  somewhat

unlikely to be lasting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Ministry could consider providing some

guidelines on the CIP programme, without stifling creativity.

I  would also like to suggest to the Minister that we  should

encourage schools to partner maybe selected voluntary welfare

organisations  in designing and implementing CIP  programmes.

This  way, it will inject greater professionalism in the  CIP

programmes  while at the same time reduce  the  load  of  the

teachers.   Students may also find real life programmes  more

enriching and more meaningful.  They may even grow  up  later

on to become volunteers.  For example, I know that NJC runs a

partnership programme with the private hospitals to allow its

students to be attached to the hospitals as assistants during

their holidays.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, character building is the key to building a

progressive,  committed  and  caring  people.   This  is  the

cornerstone  of  our  nation building.  There  is  a  Chinese

saying, "Shi nian shu mu, ba nian shu ren", which means  that

it  takes  10 years to grow a tree but it takes 100 years  to

grow a man.  I would like to urge the Minister to review  the

curriculum programmes of our schools and our kindergartens to

ensure  sufficient attention is given to character  building.

We must start early, as early as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1941</b></font><br><br>



pre-schools, as character building is a lifelong process.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mdm Chairman, I recently

talked  to  an  overseas scholar who told me  that  he  never

really understood what "brilliant" meant until he went to MIT

in  Boston.   He  went  on to explain,   "Brilliance  is  the

ability  to  think on your feet and deliver a very  confident

and  eloquent argument when called upon."  According to  him,

there  are  many  brilliant  students  in  these  prestigious

universities  who are highly eloquent and very  confident  in

their presentation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I do not have the privilege of an overseas

education  but  I  do agree with this understanding.   To  be

considered  brilliant,  one of the  key  ingredients  is  the

ability  to think on our feet, stand and deliver -  with  the

confidence and eloquence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidence and eloquence are something that can be built

and  trained.  Although not every child will grow up to score

100  marks  for  eloquence, or become  super-confident,  they

should  at  least score an A or a B+ with more  training  and

more practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly speaking, I do not see this being emphasised in

our  schools.   The  current  education  system  expects  our

children to sit quietly and listen to the teachers in a class

setting.  When children make any noise, they are told to keep

quiet  and shut up, or stand up and get out.  These acts  are

not  helpful  in  the  building of  confidence  and  speaking

skills.   They  will all learn to keep their  mouths  tightly

shut  like  the fishes in Jack Neo's movie, "I  Not  Stupid".

This will be at society's loss.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I hope the Education Minister can see this point

of  view and look into implementing greater emphasis to  help

build  the confidence of our children and students in  public

speaking,  encouraging them to speak up and  build  up  their

eloquence.  Together with the current curriculum and emphasis

on  knowledge  and  skills,  we will  have  developed  a  new

generation  of  future leaders for Singapore - brilliant  and

talented.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1942</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Madam, the number of

juvenile delinquency cases has dropped from 3,400 in 1999  to

2,500  in 2001.  The number of cases involving students  also

dropped  from 2,200 in 1999 to 1,500 in 2001.  In Singapore's

context, these figures are still high.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My main concern is about the problem faced by students

in  the  neighbourhood schools.  I notice that many of  these

students  have  been recruited by street gangs  to  be  their

members.  The  street gangs make use of them to sell  pirated

CDs  in the  neighbourhood.  I am worried about their future.

I  often  wonder  what  else  can these  young  and  innocent

students do?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Street gang members who come from low-income families

probably  were  forced by circumstances to  join  the  gangs.

Perhaps,  they wanted more income.  It may well be that  they

are under the illusion that these street gangs can offer them

more  protection and care than what their families could give

them!  Their parents have to work the whole day, and probably

even at night, to make ends meet. They are unable  to monitor

the activities of their children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those coming from middle and upper-income

families  they  probably  join them  because  they  want  the

company  of  these "friends". Perhaps they are the  neglected

ones. Although their parents can offer them material comfort,

they lack the concern, guidance and support of their parents.

Very often, the gang leaders are normally those who have  the

most pocket money to spend.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must consider ourselves lucky that in Singapore,

possession and carrying of  guns and other dangerous  weapons

are  prohibited.  Otherwise, incidents like the  shooting  in

the  school campuses in the United States may well happen  in

Singapore too.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong, can you please ask your

questions?  You have half a minute more.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng:</b> (In Mandarin) Because of this concern,

I hope that the Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1943</b></font><br><br>



Education  and the schools will think of some  ways  to  save

these wayward students. No doubt, it is the responsibility of

parents  to  see to it that their children are  well-behaved.

But, more often than not, the parents are too busy working to

earn  their livelihood.  The schools can help by paying  more

attention  to the conduct of their students. Give  them  more

healthy and wholesome extra-curricular activities, and  teach

them how to behave, so that they can become good citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the birth rate is low in Singapore. Even

the  Prime  Minister is worried about this trend.   With  the

families  having just a couple of children each, the  parents

should be more focused in bringing up their children.  If the

children  are not properly brought up, they may turn wayward,

and their future will be very bleak indeed!

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> Madam, we all are well aware of the

problem of teen-gangs in Singapore and our schools.   In  one

of  my  recent block visits, I spoke to a gentleman  who  was

very  concerned for his nephew whom he said was involved with

teen-gangs.  He was upset and said that more should  be  done

and  could  be done between schools and the police to  reduce

the problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that schools could work closely with the police

to eradicate this menace.  He is upset and understandably so,

because  he  has a nephew that he loves who is involved  with

these  gangs  and his life and future could  be  affected  by

their  unruly and illegal activities.  I am sure  that  there

are  more  parents  out  there who  are  faced  with  similar

problems.   We have also read and seen reports  on  how  bold

these  gangs  have  become.  And if we do  not  address  this

early, they will become bolder and more daring.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, may I ask the Minister the following

questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What are the steps that have been taken to curb

these teen-gang problems?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1944</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Are enough resources in place to assist students to

quit the teen-gangs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What are the common traits, if any, among the

students that are involved in gangs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Is there a task force at national level to tackle

this issue?

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Mr Zainudin and Dr Teo Ho Pin spoke

about the Learning Support Programme (LSP).  Both Mr Zainudin

and  Dr Teo asked if LSP could be extended to Primary  3  and

beyond.   Mr Zainudin asked whether the LSP would be expanded

to include more subjects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Learning Support Programme is an early intervention

language and literacy programme, first introduced in  primary

schools in 1992, to provide additional support to students in

Primary  1  and Primary 2 who are educationally `at-risk'  of

failing in school.  Each year, about 10% to 15% of Primary  1

and  Primary 2 students are supported in the Learning Support

Programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LSP is implemented in all primary schools. The

schools  are  provided with an additional  teacher  and  this

allows  students in the LSP to be taught in small  groups  of

eight to 12.  Where the school cohort is large or has a  high

proportion of `at-risk' students, a second additional teacher

has  been  provided.  A purpose-built classroom for  LSP  has

also  been factored into all new schools and those undergoing

PRIME.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On average, Learning Support Programme students start

school  at  P1  with  limited reading skills,  equivalent  to

children  of less than five years of age.  In 2001, after  10

months of intervention in LSP, the average reading age of LSP

students  increased  to  seven  years  of  age.   They   were

therefore almost on par with the rest of the Primary 1 cohort

in  terms  of their reading skills.  Improvements in  reading

carry  over  to  the  classroom, and increase  the  students'

ability  to  learn new materials.  This is reflected  in  the

improvement  in  pass  rates of students  in  the  LSP.   For

example, in 2001, less than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1945</b></font><br><br>



half  (45%) of Primary 1 LSP students passed English  at  SA1

(or   mid-year   examination).   By  the   second   semestral

examination at the end of the year, the pass rate was 65%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of Primary 1, 60% of the LSP students are

discharged  from  the  programme.   The  remaining   students

continue  to  receive  support  in  Primary  2.   These   are

typically  students who have failed the semestral examination

at  the  end  of Primary 1, or whose reading ages  are  still

below their chronological age.  Given another year of support

in   Primary   2,   the  majority  of  these  students   will

successfully  bridge the gap with their peers,  in  terms  of

literacy and language skills.

<br>5.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LSP is now in its 11th year of implementation. Over

the years, the programme has developed and improved such that

we  are currently obtaining results that are close to optimal

levels.  MOE allocates resources according to what will  work

effectively  in meeting the different needs of our  students.

Instead of extending the LSP to Primary 3, we will focus  our

resources on introducing an LSP for Mathematics, as this  has

been identified as an area of need by schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LSP for Mathematics is currently implemented in 50

schools  for  this year on a pilot basis.  These schools  are

provided   with  an  additional  teacher  to  implement   the

programme.   A  two-year study is underway to  determine  the

optimal level of implementation for LSP for Mathematics.   If

proven  successful, the programme will be rolled out  to  all

schools in phases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, other than the LSP, we have another programme to

help  students at lower primary level who have problems  with

their  work.   We  call  it the Encouraging  Achievement  and

Better  Learning programme (ENABLE).  Started  in  1989,  the

ENABLE  programme is a focused diagnostic remedial  programme

that  caters to the underachievers in Primary 1 to Primary  3

with at least average ability.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1946</b></font><br><br>



Each school has an ENABLE coordinator and teachers trained to

provide  systematic remediation for identified underachieving

pupils.   Trained  teachers provide  remediation  in  English

and/or Mathematics with an emphasis on diagnostic teaching to

underachievers   twice   a   week  after   curriculum   time.

Approximately  13%  to 17% of P1 to P3 students  are  in  the

ENABLE programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On co-curricular activities, Mr Zainudin asked about

plans  to  enhance  the  CCA programme.   He  also  spoke  of

parents'  concerns about the children spending too much  time

on  CCA.   Mr  Zainudin urged that parents let  the  children

decide on the CCA that the children would like to participate

in.   I  think  we should leave it to parents to decide  with

their  children what best suits the children.  I do not think

MOE  would want to meddle in what parents and students should

best decide for themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong spoke of the importance of character

building   and  national  education.   Schools  place   great

importance  on character development and national  education.

We  actively promote character development through the  Civic

and Moral Education programme, CCA programme and the pastoral

care   programme.   The  CCA  programme  forms  an   integral

component  of  our  education system.  Sports  is  one  major

component  of  the school's CCA programme.  The  other  areas

include  the  uniformed groups, music and dance, and  various

clubs  and  societies.  CCA engages students in a  meaningful

way,  provide  opportunities  for  character  and  leadership

development,  and promote the acquisition and application  of

social and cooperative skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Gan's remark that schools should partner with

community  development, I think I fully agree with  him.   In

fact,   schools   are  already  partnering   with   community

organisations  in  implementing  the  Community   Improvement

Programme (CIP).  I think we can encourage more schools to do

that  so that not only would their partners benefit, but  our

students   too  would  benefit  from  learning  in  providing

service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1947</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage innovation, independent schools have been

given the autonomy to decide on the niche it wants to develop

in.   I  would like to inform Mr Sin Boon Ann that MOE  funds

Independent  Schools  on  the  same  per  capita   basis   as

Government  secondary  schools.   MOE  has  no  objection  if

independent  schools can acquire additional funding,  whether

through  sponsorship or fund raising activities,  to  put  in

place  various  schemes  in order to provide  a  well-rounded

education for their students.  MOE will not disallow ACS  for

building  its own swimming pool, even though it may give  ACS

an  unfair advantage over other schools in swimming.   So  we

are even-handed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Mr Gan for highlighting the

importance of character building.  As I mentioned earlier, we

have  also  developed and implemented the National  Education

programme  since 1997.  National Education,  which  places  a

premium on responsible citizenship, has been integrated  into

the  different  subjects  and  incorporated  in  many  school

activities.   Besides  these, each  student  is  required  to

perform a minimum of six hours of community service under the

Community Involvement Programme and go on a Learning  Journey

each  per  year.  Through the CIP, we help to instil  in  our

students  a  conscience to give back to society  and  develop

them  into  socially  responsible adults.   Through  Learning

Journeys,  we  hope our students will be able  to  complement

their learning in the classroom of what makes Singapore tick,

and foster bonding among themselves as they observe and learn

about Singapore's vulnerabilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, because of the vast range of co-curricular

activities   in   schools,   MOE  developed   the   Character

Development  Programme in 2001 to guide schools in  providing

for  a  balanced programme for each student in three domains:

(1)  leadership, (2) citizenship, and (3) personal and social

development.   Activities  in  the  leadership   domain   are

designed  to provide opportunities for students  to  lead  as

they serve, and to serve as they lead.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1948</b></font><br><br>



Under  the  citizenship domain, activities are  organised  to

help  students acquire values, such as loyalty and commitment

to  nation.  In the social and personal domain, students  are

exposed  to  activities  that  heighten  their  awareness  of

oneself and their relationship with others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the average, students attend CCAs once a week with

some  doing it twice a week.  Generally, students  find  CCAs

manageable, fun and enjoyable, and therefore do not  consider

it  as a burden, or source of stress.  In many instances, the

interest  acquired through participation in a particular  CCA

becomes  a  life-long  pursuit  and  the  friendships  formed

lasting ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the academic development of children is important,

parents   should  not  overlook  the  fact  that   purposeful

participation  in  CCAs provides a good balance  to  academic

pursuits  in schools.  It also provides our students  with  a

well-balanced  life  and  holistic  education.   Parents  and

schools should help children manage their time well, so  that

they can cope with both school work and CCAs.  So we will not

meddle  but  we  hope parents will be able  to  advise  their

children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad would be pleased to note that MOE

recognises  students'  involvement  in  the  National   Youth

Achievement  Award (NYAA) scheme as part  of  their  CCA  and

awards  them CCA points.  Since the NYAA's inception in  1992

and  up  to  January  this  year,  34,000  youths  have  been

registered  in  the  scheme and, of this, 90%  are  secondary

school students.  To date, 10,000 students from 171 secondary

schools,  junior  colleges  and centralised  institutes  have

received   the  various  NYAA  awards.   This  is  a   strong

indication  that  students  in  our  secondary  schools   are

actively  involved in the NYAA scheme.  In fact,  the  scheme

has been so successful and well received by secondary schools

that it will now be extended to 10 primary schools on a pilot

basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia spoke about the need for students to

develop confidence and eloquence.  The building of confidence

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1949</b></font><br><br>



eloquence   requires  a  combination  of  verbal  competence,

critical  thinking,  emotional control  and  opportunity  for

practice.   The development of verbal competence is  provided

for  in  the academic curriculum, which emphasises crititical

thinking  and  the acquisition of language and  communication

skills.  Schools provide students with life skills lessons to

equip  students  with  tools for personal  and  interpersonal

effectiveness.    Schools  also  provide  opportunities   for

students  to  develop  self-confidence through  co-curricular

activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, on school discipline, Mr Zainudin and Mr Ong Ah

Heng  raised  some concerns regarding school  discipline  and

gangsterism.  I would like to assure Mr Zainudin and  Mr  Ong

that  the overall state of discipline in our schools is good.

Serious  cases  of  breach of discipline are  infrequent  and

gangsterism is not a problem in school.  The Ministry of Home

Affairs' statistics indicate that the number of students aged

12  to  19 years who are dealt with for involvement in  gang-related  activities is low.  There were 142 in 1999,  154  in

year  2000, and 139 in year 2001.  So I am not sure  what  is

the  source  of information that Mr Ong had given  the  House

earlier.   These form less than 0.06% of the students  within

this age range.  Girls account for a small proportion of  the

cases of gangsterism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding, schools are mindful of the need to be

vigilant   against  the  development  of  gangsterism   among

students.   Schools have formal structures to  actively  deal

with  discipline problems.  When students are  identified  as

being involved in gang-related activities, schools take steps

to counsel them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1997, MOE has been collaborating with the Police

to  set  up as one of the Inter-Ministry Committee  on  Youth

Crime    initiatives,   the   Honorary   Voluntary    Special

Constabulary  Scheme  (Hon  VSC  Scheme).   More   than   200

Discipline  Masters, Operations Managers  and  teachers  have

since been trained and appointed as Honorary VSC officers  in

schools.   This serves as an extension of police presence  to

keep youth-gang influence away from our schools.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1950</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools cannot be solely responsible for the discipline

of  our  young.  Parents, schools and the  community  have  a

shared responsibility in ensuring the proper behaviour of our

children.  Schools work closely with parents to involve  them

in educating their children and to provide the necessary home

support  to  sustain  the  changes in  behaviour.   MOE  will

continue  to  work  with other Ministries  and  agencies  and

community  to  coordinate and develop initiatives  to  arrest

disciplinary problems and further improve school discipline.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Madam, the Compulsory Education Act

has  two  specific objectives.  The first is to  provide  our

children  with a common core of knowledge, and the second  is

to  ensure that they share a common experience.  Seen in this

light,  the  Act  is therefore an important piece  of  social

legislation.   Its key objective is to change  behaviour  and

mindset towards education so that education is given the  top

priority which it deserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of this Act is timely, as the number of

children who fails to register for Primary 1 has been  rising

steadily.   According to a newspaper report,  1,677  children

did  not register for Primary 1 in 1997.  It went up to 1,708

in  1998 and, in 1999, it was 1,921, which is about 3% of the

cohort.  In 2000 and 2001, it was estimated that about  2,000

children  a year did not make it to school.  However,  in  my

view,  legislating a problem alone will not make the  problem

go  away.   I  am  quite sure that even when the  MOE  starts

enforcing  the  Act  next year, there  will  continue  to  be

parents who will not register their children for Primary 1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to legislation, we need to identify what are

the  underlying  causes which prevent  parents  from  sending

their  children to school and address them.  I am  aware  the

reasons could include children who are sent to madrasahs,  or

are  overseas, or are being taught at home.  Other than  this

group,  other children could be kept away from school because

of  their  parents'  ignorance,  poor  priority  accorded  to

education   and,   perhaps   a   major   concern,   financial

difficulties.  I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1951</b></font><br><br>



would like to ask the Minister what measures have been put in

place  to identify and reach out to such children who are  at

risk, to render assistance to their families and to regularly

monitor them so that once they are attracted to school,  they

will not drop out of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point, under this Act also, all students

of  madrasahs are required to sit for the PSLE examination in

the  year  2011.   Madrasahs  suffer  from  a  constraint  of

manpower and other resources compared to the national schools

and  they  will face difficulties in meeting the requirements

of the Compulsory Education Act, if nothing is done to assist

them.   In  this  respect,  may  I  ask  the  Ministry   what

assistance  is  being  rendered to  madrasahs  to  help  them

prepare  their  students to sit for the PSLE examinations  in

2001?

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Madam Chairman, the Ministry's

continued  effort  to  provide education  for  children  with

special  disabilities, together with the VWOs,  and  NCSS  is

indeed  commendable.   Despite these  improvements  made  and

resources  committed to special education, there remain  some

areas  of  concern, especially to parents  of  children  with

special  needs.   I  would  like to highlight  two  of  these

concerns.

<br>5.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first concern refers to the high staff turnover and

low  morale  of  special school teachers.  I understand  that

special schools are plagued by high staff turnover and  often

low  morale  among the teachers due to less attractive  terms

and  conditions  of employment and poorer career  advancement

prospects  compared  to  teachers in the  mainstream  school.

This  is  an  anomaly  because it  is,  without  doubt,  more

difficult  and  challenging to teach  children  with  special

needs  than  it is to teach mainstream pupils.   It  requires

special training, a different set of skills, and a love  that

transcends  physical handicap.  Those who  continue  in  this

calling despite such odds, exhibit a spirit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1952</b></font><br><br>



of  noble self-sacrifice, and their life should not  be  made

harder  by poor rewards and lack of recognition.  They should

not  be  made  to  feel  that teaching in  special  education

schools belong to the realm of social welfare and it is not a

legitimate  profession and, therefore, can be  paid  a  lower

salary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second concern refers to integration into mainstream

schools.   Madam,  children  with  special  needs  should  be

integrated  into mainstream schools where possible,  as  this

would help in the intellectual and social development of high-functioning  special-needs children.  Other children  in  the

school  can also benefit enormously by interacting  with  the

special-needs   children  and  learn   that   they   have   a

responsibility towards these less fortunate kids.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, in this respect, I am pleased to note that the

Ministry  currently  has six designated mainstream  secondary

schools   that  admit  the  hearing-impaired  and   visually-handicapped  children.  I would like to urge the Minister  to

consider  extending  this  programme  to  mainstream  primary

schools.   Designated  primary  schools  in  each  region  of

Singapore could be equipped to cater to children with special

needs  who  have  been assessed to be capable of  integrating

into mainstream schools.  This could take place, say, at  the

upper  primary level, from Primary 4.  I understand that  the

Canossian School for the Hearing Impaired already offers such

opportunities.   However, there is a need for  more  of  such

schools,  to  allow  as many children  as  possible  who  are

capable  of  integrating  into the mainstream  to  enrol  and

benefit  from the system.  Early intervention has been  found

by  experts  to  be  of great importance  in  the  successful

rehabilitation  of children with special  needs.   Hence,  we

should  provide such facilities at primary schools  that  can

maximise  the  chance of successful rehabilitation  of  these

children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I feel that it is now time for us to work harder

on  building  our  social  capital and  accord  every  child,

including those with special needs, a chance to develop their

potential to the fullest.  I,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1953</b></font><br><br>



therefore,  urge the Minister to consider the issues  I  have

raised to further improve our special education system.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Khor, would you like to continue with

the next cut?

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Madam, I wish to withdraw my

amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> OK. Mr Gan Kim Yong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Madam, there have been recent studies

pointing to the value of pre-school education.  These studies

suggest  that  much  of  a child's capacity  to  learn  self-confidence, self-respect, his ability to communicate and  his

attitude towards learning are determined during the first six

years   of  a  child's  life,  before  the  start  of  formal

education.  There have been some suggestions in the past that

the  benefits  of  pre-school education may not  be  lasting.

However,  long-term  studies have now been  done,  and  these

studies  show that children who have had pre-school education

tend  to do better later in life, even as late as age 27,  at

which  the  study  was done.  These are in  terms  of  social

responsibility,   educational   performance   and    economic

achievement.   By  that,  it  means  how  much   they   earn.

Obviously,  these  studies have their  limitations,  but  the

results  warrant a serious review of our policy towards  pre-school education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the Ministry of Education spends $16,600 per

university  student at the top of the scale, and  $3,200  per

primary  school  student  at  the  other  end.   I   am   not

questioning  the basis of this ratio.  However, I  am  rather

sad  that  we spend little or almost nothing at all  on  pre-school  education.  A total of 98,000 children are  attending

kindergartens  today.  A significant number of  our  children

either  do not go to kindergartens or they drop out  after  a

short  while.   Based on my discussions with  some  self-help

groups,  most  of these tend to be the lower income  families

who  could  not  afford  the  unsubsidised  fees.   As  these

children  move  on  to  primary level,  they  would  find  it

difficult  to  compete  with those who  have  had  pre-school

education.  Yet, the same families would again find it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1954</b></font><br><br>



difficult to provide added help, such as tuition classes,  to

help them catch up.  It is, therefore, a double jeopardy  for

these  families.  Pre-school education cannot equalise  every

child, but it certainly can at least narrow the gap.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Government to consider

providing  more resources to pre-school education.   I  would

like  to suggest that at least the following areas should  be

looked  into.   Firstly, providing funding for selected  non-profit  kindergartens; secondly, provide guidelines on  basic

curriculum;  and, thirdly, specify minimum qualifications  of

teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For funding, the Government should not subsidise

kindergartens which are profit-oriented, but should  consider

helping those which are being run purely as social service to

the community.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Gan, you will have to wrap up your

speech.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Madam, other than providing funding,

we believe that the Government should also provide guidelines

on  basic curriculum that are broad enough to leave room  for

creative teaching.  There is also a critical need to  upgrade

the  quality of our kindergarten teachers, not just providing

the funding, but also to provide the teaching facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we have gone a long way in our formal education.

Many  of  us  are proud of our achievements.  It is  time  we

looked  at  pre-school  education in  a  more  intensive  and

focused  manner so that it becomes an integral  part  of  our

total  education  policy.  It will then  make  our  education

policy complete.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> At the risk of sounding like a

spoilt  recorder, I would like to propose to the Ministry  of

Education  to seriously consider bringing the early childhood

education into the formal education system.  Put it  directly

under  the  purview of MOE.  This portion  of  our  education

system  has mostly been left to  community organisations  and

the  private sector.  We know that the Ministry of  Education

has some initiatives and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1955</b></font><br><br>



programmes in this area.  Are these enough?  Can we do more?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I honestly believe we can and we should do more in the

area  of  pre-school education.  As the pressure for economic

excellence  continues, we will see more  dual-income  earning

families.   Parents  need support to cope  with  the  growing

trends and phenomena.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many developed countries that have

incorporated  pre-school  education into  primary  education.

There must be many reasons that compelled them to do so.   As

we  progress and more of our female citizens go out  to  join

the  workforce, we will encounter more demands for  a  better

and  structured  pre-school system existing under  mainstream

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passing of the compulsory education law is a

landmark  decision  and,  I  believe,  the  next  significant

decision,  and  a  more important one, is to incorporate  the

foundation years into mainstream education provided by MOE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we must provide our children the equal

opportunity to education at the earliest age possible.   Many

experts  have deliberated on the importance of the foundation

years, and many have agreed.  There are many parents in  this

House and, if we, as parents, sincerely believe otherwise, we

would  not have sent our kids to nurseries and kindergartens.

Instead, we are sending them to the best possible nursery and

kindergartens.  Why is that so?  Does it mean that pre-school

is  not important?  On the contrary, we know deep down in our

hearts  that  it  is  important.  If so, I  still  could  not

understand  why the Ministry of Education, which is  supposed

to  be  the protector and torch-bearer of education  in  this

country,  takes  a laissez faire attitude towards  pre-school

education when it can play a more decisive role.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more senior Members of this House would probably be

able to recall that in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1956</b></font><br><br>



1979, the pre-primary system was implemented in some schools.

The purpose was for bilingual education, ie, to give students

equal  exposure  to  both Mandarin and  English.   It  was  a

worthwhile  exercise and the Ministry of Education  then  had

the   motivation,  the  vision  and  boldness   to   see   it

implemented.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Zainudin, can you please ask your

questions?

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> It was discontinued in 1989. Now,

in  the  year 2002, we should ask ourselves: are the  reasons

more compelling?  The answer is yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Madam, for the pre-school system, the

terrain is characterised by a bewildering array of choice  by

any  parameter.  If we look at fees, we have a  few  tens  of

dollars  of monthly fees to over a thousand dollars.   If  we

look  at  pedagogic methods, we have the whole range  -  from

Montessori  to  all  forms  of  experimental  and  the   very

traditional classroom-based methods.  If we look at  it  from

the  angle of the sort of emphasis it has on language and  so

on,  again, there are some that are specialist or  known  for

their English, and others for their Mandarin and so on.  This

is  a diversity that ought to be celebrated and welcomed,  if

it   were   underpinned   by  a  few   key   parameters   and

considerations, and I would like to outline them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is quality assurance. We can have diversity

in  teaching methods, classroom style and so on but,  at  the

end  of  the  day,  parents want to be assured  that  a  core

curriculum  that  is  necessary in preparing  the  child  for

Primary 1 is being delivered.  And this is one area  in which

MOE  could make a difference.  The Ministry has said that  it

does  not want to get involved in pre-school education.   But

it  can  play the role of a quality assurer or, at  least,  a

quality prescriber.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is in the area of teacher training. Several

colleagues  have mentioned this.  I just want to  stress  the

point  that  we need to professionalise pre-school  teaching,

and that means training is essential and the Ministry must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1957</b></font><br><br>



play  a catalytic role in this regard, because the output  of

the PSE system is the input of the primary school system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the issue of access, it would be desirable

for  us to create a situation where every child would be able

to  get access to at least two years of pre-school education.

Cost is an inhibitor and there are other factors as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago, Dr Aline Wong told this House - she was

then  the  Senior Minister of State for Education - that  MOE

was  embarking on a pilot research programme to establish the

long-term  cognitive and non-cognitive benefits of pre-school

education  so  that  the Ministry can assess  what  level  of

Government investment is justifiable in pre-school education.

The  longitudinal study was expected to take seven years, but

Dr Wong did give the assurance that after two to three years,

if  the preliminary result of the study were convincing,  the

Ministry would act.  I would like to know what is the  status

of this study and what actions the Ministry is contemplating.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Madam, I have only one question for

the  Minister, and that is about the innovative  kindergarten

in  Denmark.   I  read in the papers that  a  team  from  the

Ministry of Education has visited Denmark and that they  have

also seen the innovative kindergartens there.  I believe  the

members  of  that  team have found that Denmark's  innovative

kindergartens have some relevance to Singapore at this  point

of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denmark, although a very small country with only five

million people, slightly more than Singapore, has produced 11

Nobel  Prize  winners.  That speaks a lot for  the  education

system  in  Denmark.  I think it is good for us to study  the

education  system  there.  I certainly  would  like  to  know

whether  the  Minister  shall  be  introducing  some  of  the

important features of the innovative kindergartens  that  the

Singapore  team  saw in Denmark.  Perhaps the Minister  could

enlighten us.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Madam, I will answer the

questions that have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1958</b></font><br><br>



been  raised on pre-school education.  Mr Zainudin has  asked

about  the  Ministry's policy towards the pre-school  sector,

and   whether   the  Ministry  should  not   in   fact   take

responsibility  for the pre-school sector,  as  it  does  for

schools.  Mr Gan Kim Yong spoke of the benefits of pre-school

education, and asked that the Government provide funding  and

curriculum  guidelines for pre-school education.  Mr  Iswaran

spoke  about  the  ways  in  which we  could  raise  quality,

curriculum  standards and teacher training.   He  also  asked

about the progress of the Pre-school Steering Committee.  And

I will come to Mr Chiam's point later on.



<br>5.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start by saying that the Ministry does not view

pre-school  education as providing children with a simplified

primary school curriculum in preparation for formal education

at  Primary 1.  Pre-school education should aim to  meet  the

distinct  development needs of the child in his early  years.

It   should   aim   to  help  the  child  develop   socially,

emotionally,  physically, and not just provide  literacy  and

numeracy skills to prepare the child for Primary 1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE has no intention of taking over the provision of pre-school education. Various community and private

organisations  are providing a range of pre-school  education

programmes  to cater to different needs.  It is important  to

preserve this diversity for the very reason that there is  no

single  model  for developing children at an  early  age.   I

agree  fully  with  Mr Iswaran's comments in  this  regard  - diversity  is important, especially at the pre-school  stage.

Parents  should have a choice of pre-school models to  select

from,  according  to their preferences and  their  children's

needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of becoming a provider of pre-school education,

MOE  is  therefore putting resources into areas  which  would

have  the  greatest  leverage on the  quality  of  pre-school

education.    The  Pre-School Steering Committee,  which  was

chaired  by Dr Aline Wong, and which I now chair, is  an  on-going  Committee.  It has implemented a number of initiatives

which are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1959</b></font><br><br>



focused on key areas of leverage.  These include drawing up a

set of Desired Outcomes of Pre-School Education, developing a

curriculum  framework,  setting standards  for  teachers  and

accrediting teacher-training programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE is also putting in place a licensing scheme to

regulate kindergartens and to help ensure that standards  are

maintained.  However, MOE has to regulate with a light touch.

We  can  set the requirements for teacher qualifications,  we

can encourage kindergartens to develop coherent curricula and

we  can  help  them to achieve good standards in delivery  of

that  curricula, but we cannot intrude to the extent that  we

effectively run the kindergartens.  This licensing scheme  is

being  developed.   It  will  be  introduced  soon.   It   is

essentially  modelled on the scheme that MCDS has  for  child

care centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way to leverage up the quality of pre-school

education  is by better training of principals and  teachers,

and  by  attracting  and retaining well-qualified  personnel.

That  is why the Government has provided, beginning from this

year,  annual  recurrent grants to eligible kindergartens  so

that they can structure attractive pay schemes to incentivise

training and to attract better qualified personnel.  Most pre-school  education  providers are  on  track  in  meeting  the

targets  that  have been set for training of  principals  and

teachers.    The   Joint  MOE-MCDS  Pre-school  Qualification

Accreditation Committee, which was set up last year,  has  to

date   accredited  33  courses  from  15  training  agencies,

including  the  National  Institute of  Education,  Ngee  Ann

Polytechnic and other private training organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran asked about the pilot study that was

mentioned  a  while ago as part of the work of  the  Steering

Committee.   First, let me say that international studies  on

the benefits of pre-school education are varied.  That is why

we  are  embarking on a pilot study of our own, in the  first

instance to test the effectiveness of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1960</b></font><br><br>



new  curriculum  design and teaching methodologies  that  are

being  put in place.  And in the longer term, to look at  the

benefits of improved pre-school education  -  the benefits in

terms of cognitive development, social skills and so on.  The

initial  two-year  phase  of  this  longitudinal  study   was

implemented last year, and would be completed at the  end  of

this  year.  The results will be made known at the  beginning

of next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran had also asked if there will be a skills

benchmark of sorts for different subjects that are taught  at

pre-schools for students who are entering Primary 1.  MOE has

considered  this  earlier  and decided  that  the  pre-school

curriculum framework will not benchmark skills for  different

subjects  in  relation  to  the  Primary  1  syllabus.    The

framework  instead  emphasises the  holistic  development  of

children  -  their  social skills, values, communicative  and

motor  skills,  self-concept and confidence, and  of  course,

cognitive skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE is encouraging kindergartens to move away from the

current pre-dominantly academic focus towards a more balanced

curriculum  aimed at the all-round development of the  child.

There  are two reasons for this.  The first is that cognitive

development of a child in these early years proceeds hand  in

hand  with  the  development  of these  other  basic  skills,

including social and communicative skills that enable a child

to  listen  with  understanding, to express  himself,  to  be

curious, and to explore.  A second reason relates to what  Mr

Gan  Kim Yong mentioned, which is the importance of character

development, and the fact that the building of the  character

has  to  begin  in  the  early  years.   The  new  curriculum

framework will be disseminated at the end of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam had commented on the need for kindergartens to

be more innovative and interesting and referred to the Danish

experience.   One  objective  of  developing  the  pre-school

curriculum framework is to help kindergartens in planning and

implementing more innovative programmes.  Currently, there is

a range of approaches adopted in the kindergartens.  Some of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1961</b></font><br><br>



them  are  quite  innovative.  Some  kindergartens  emphasise

child-directed learning.  Others have adopted approaches such

as  project work, real life situations, field trips, interest

corners,   dramatisation  and  role-playing,  and  fun-filled

language  activities.  More kindergartens are also  involving

parents  in learning activities during curriculum time.   The

Danish  experience is interesting and so are the  experiences

of  some other countries which we intend to study.  There  is

something to be learned.  The Danish experience is, in  fact,

one  which focused, at an initial stage, principally  on  the

training of teachers. This is what we are seeking to do  now.

This  is  the first and most important step in leveraging  up

the  quality  of  pre-school education. We will  continue  to

study  these overseas experiences and learn what we can  from

their strengths, as well as their weaknesses, as we go along.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On compulsory education, Mdm Halimah raised the issue of

parents  who  may  not  register their children  for  primary

school, even though compulsory education will be coming  into

effect  next  year.  Compulsory education will be implemented

from  next  year.  Registration for  Primary  1  in  national

primary schools will take place in July and August this year.

There  will  be  media  announcements and  publicity  on  the

exercise.  Parents will be reminded that compulsory education

will  be implemented from 2003, what this means and how  this

can  help  their  child. The extent of  non-registration  for

Primary 1 for 2003 will only be known in September this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE does try to visit all cases of non-registration

where  they  are  contactable.  We will be  deploying  people

after this year's exercise to visit homes to counsel families

to register their children for school. If they have financial

problems,  we will get the community to help them and  advise

them   that  the  school  can  help  them  after  they   have

registered.   Financial difficulties are not a reason  for  a

child not attending school. They can be attended to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah also asked about the preparedness of the

madrasahs for compulsory education. The Acting Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1962</b></font><br><br>



Community  Development  and Sports and Minister-in-charge  of

Muslim   Affairs,  Assoc.  Prof.  Yaacob  Ibrahim,  will   be

addressing this issue during MCDS' debate in the Committee of

Supply.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Let me respond to Dr Amy Khor's question

on  children with special education needs (SPED). First,  let

me thank her for her encouragement and positive remarks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has asked regarding the possibility of integrating

special  schools  with normal schools.  We have,  already  in

place,  a  multi-tier system to provide for the education  of

special  needs  children.  Those who are able to  follow  the

mainstream  curriculum study in the mainstream  schools.   In

certain designated schools, special facilities and additional

resources  are  provided to help them in their learning.  For

example, we have about 502 pupils with hearing impairment and

61  with visual impairment in our mainstream schools.   Other

children  who  need  specialised programmes  and  paramedical

support  are  better  served  in  the  19  special  education

schools.  The key word is capability.  If they can cope  with

the  mainstream  curriculum,  we  will  expand  the  capacity

required.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1999, MOE has increased its provision of

facilities and resources for disabled children, both  in  the

mainstream  and  SPED schools.  These include one  mainstream

school per cluster to be fitted with full facilities for  the

physically handicapped, learning equipment for the mainstream

schools   with  hearing  impaired  and  visually  handicapped

pupils, computer-related facilities for the SPED schools  for

sensory-impaired   children  and   purchase   of   IT-related

facilities  and  maintenance  of  equipment  for  other  SPED

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCSS has also put into place a structured socialisation

programme  to help mainstream schools and SPED school  pupils

integrate. The programme is working well and has proven to be

effective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards her comment that there is low morale and high

staff  turnover in these schools, first of all,  these  staff

are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1963</b></font><br><br>



under  NCSS, they are not under MOE.  Part of the problem  is

that  these VWOs are disparate, many of them individually  do

not  have  the  economies of scale to  provide  a  structured

career programme.  We will continue to work with NCSS to  try

to  address this problem.  We will continue to look after the

education of children with special needs.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In the interest of time, I will allow one

clarification.  Dr Khor.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Thank you, Madam. Just one

clarification.   That refers to integration of  schools  into

mainstream  schools.  My understanding is, currently,  it  is

only  for  designated secondary schools.  What about  primary

schools?    Are   there   designated  primary   schools   for

integration?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Part of the problem is a practical one.

If you are talking about putting a primary school child, with

special education needs, with one in the mainstream, I  think

a  period  of  time is required to assess the  capability  of

bringing  up the capability of the child with special  needs.

It is only after a few years that one can assess whether that

child  with  special needs can integrate  in  the  mainstream

curriculum.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Wang, would you like to withdraw your

amendment?

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Madam, I thank the Minister, the two

Ministers of State and the Parliamentary Secretary for  their

well-reasoned replies. Judging by the answers, some of what I

thought  were mere boulders turned out to be the outcroppings

of a mountain range.  I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Mdm Chairman, I beg to move,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1964</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head K of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code KB 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, on 26th April this year, the TIMES Higher

Education Supplement, a UK publication, ran a report "A  Hard

Sell  For Easy Money".  According to the report, the root  of

the  problem  of commercial schools here is that  Singapore's

three universities provide places for no more than 15% of 18-year  olds.  The alternative of going overseas to be educated

is  expensive.  The remaining option is thus to  enrol  at  a

commercial  school  offering an  overseas  degree  backed  by

overseas institutions. The writer said, "All you need to open

up  a  school  in Singapore is approval from the Ministry  of

Education (although you can call yourself a "consultant"  and

get  away  without registering)."  It seems so easy like  "bo

jeng hu" .

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask what is the Ministry's criterion in

approving the registration of commercial schools.  Are  these

schools  monitored  after  registration?  Does  the  Ministry

monitor  the  number  of  students taking  lessons  in  these

commercial schools?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, another issue I wish to raise is that there have

been   many  suggestions  that  Singapore  universities   can

collaborate with Chinese universities to provide joint degree

or  Chinese MBA programmes.  These suggestions are sound,  as

it  will  not  only help establish networking,  it  can  also

potentially  help more Singaporeans understand  China  better

and strengthen our ability to ride on the China growth train.

However,  I was told that the NUS has decided not to continue

its  Chinese MBA programme.  I would like to ask whether  the

Ministry will review this.

<br>6.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> In the interest of time, Madam, I will

just  go  straight to the questions.  May  I  urge  that  the

Ministry  accredit  and  regulate  all  the  external  degree

courses  offered  in Singapore, to protect  the  interest  of

Singaporeans, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1965</b></font><br><br>



well  as  those foreigners who come here to study.   This  is

also to protect the image of Singapore as an education hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would also like to urge that the Ministry

and the Public Service Commission (PSC) make public a list of

universities, which they deem as reputable, when  considering

an  application  for a public service job.  This  would  also

help  Singaporeans  to make informed choices  when  selecting

self-improvement courses.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Chong is not here.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Let me thank the Members for their

comments.   In my answer regarding the university  sector,  I

spoke that many proceeded in terms of fulfilling aspirations.

We  have kept that to a minimum in our public universities by

maintaining   high   standards.    Therefore,   the   private

commercial schools have now responded to their need.   Do  we

want  to keep an arm's length from it?  We would like to tell

the  public that they would very much have to investigate the

schools  for  themselves.  We do not want to enter  into  the

fray  to  decide which schools can.  It is not exactly  a  bo

jeng hu situation, as Mr Yeo Guat Kwang suggests.  We do have

criteria    in    registering   commercial   schools.     For

registration, we require private schools to demonstrate  that

they  have  adequate space and facilities  to  conduct  their

courses.  They are also required to report to MOE any changes

to  the composition of their management committee, as well as

appointment and termination of teachers.  For external degree

programmes,  the degrees need to be granted by  a  bona  fide

overseas  university, and should have minimum disparity  with

what  is  offered by the same on campus in terms of  academic

programmes.    However,  we  do  not  accredit   nor   accord

recognition to these external degree programmes,  as  it  may

take many forms, covering different disciplines, and can even

be delivered by correspondence, or over the Internet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more practical approach for such programmes is to

subject themselves to the test of the market.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1966</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo also asked about the NUS Chinese MBA programme.

NUS  is  doing  exactly  what he  has  suggested.   They  are

collaborating  with the Bei Tah University.   Students  would

spend  one  year in Bei Tah, and one year in  NUS,  taking  a

total  of  22  modules  in  both  English  and  Chinese.   In

addition,  the programme includes Student Exchange Programmes

with  some Chinese universities, such as the Xin Hua, Fu Tan,

and  Xian  Jiau Dong University.  There are plans  to  expand

this  list  of  universities to include Nanjing and  Jongshan

universities.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): The Ministry of Education has a long-standing policy where stalls in school canteens are allocated

to  needy Singaporeans so that they can earn a decent living.

This is a good policy that kills two birds with one stone  as

it  serves to provide good and affordable food to the  school

children  and,  at the same time, help the  poor  and  needy.

However, this kind of arrangement seems to have stopped.  Has

the Ministry changed its policy? If so, why?  As it is today,

we  are  seeing more and more schools shifting to the  tender

system,  and  the  successful bidders  then  subcontract  the

canteen  stalls out to third party stallholders.  The  stalls

are no longer being allocated to the poor and needy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a large number of schools coming under the

Programme  for  Rebuilding  and  Improving  Existing  Schools

(PRIME)  and the merger of schools, I am concerned about  the

plight  of affected stallholders.  What assistance  does  the

Ministry  extend to them?  What arrangements have  been  made

for those who have been dropped?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1967</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many parents have also an additional worry as school

canteens are increasingly being run by contractors,  or  when

new  technology such as smart cards are introduced, would the

level  of  food prices be maintained or increased?  Does  the

Ministry monitor the prices regularly and try to prevent  the

prices from being inflated?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mdm Chairman, I am

raising the same issue.  Many a time when I met my residents,

I received complaints that when the schools are upgraded, the

prices of food at the canteen are also upgraded.  A plate  of

chicken rice which used to be sold for 50 cents is now  being

sold  at  $1, a 100% increase!  Last night, I met a  resident

who  is a hawker at the Ahmad Ibrahim School. He told me that

the  school would be upgraded next month, and an open  tender

will  be called for the operation of the school canteen. With

these canteens being operated on an open tender system,  soon

we will have "Million Dollar Canteens" just like the "Million

Dollar Coffeeshop" that we are having now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being the case, how are the students going to

afford the food at the "Million Dollar Canteen"?  If you  are

outside, you can say, "Well, the food here  is too expensive,

I  do  not  want  to  buy from here as  I  can  get  my  food

elsewhere."  But,  if  you are in a  school,  you  cannot  go

outside  to buy your food. If you do not buy from the  school

canteen,  you will just starve to death.  So, if a  plate  of

chicken  rice is now being sold at $1 or $2 and even a  glass

of soft-drink will cost 60 cents, I believe children from the

lower  income group will not be able to afford  it.   If  the

poor  family has three children studying in school, then  the

burden  will be very heavy for the parents.  I hope that  the

Minister for Education would reconsider this matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should have control over the prices. The canteen

should  be  let out to the operators at a nominal price.   We

should look after the children so that they have healthy food

to eat.  As such, the school



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1968</b></font><br><br>



canteen  should be charged just a nominal rent,  and  not  an

open  tender price.  There must also be stipulations  on  how

much they can charge for each food item.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the Adviser to the National Transport Workers'

Union.   We  have  some food kiosks at the bus  terminals  to

serve our bus drivers. There, they charge 25 cents for a  cup

of  coffee, and nothing more. A plate of fried noodle is  $1,

and  that  is  it.  Of course, the food kiosk  operators  are

charged  very  nominal rents to operate at the bus  terminus.

We should look after the interest of the lower income people.

We must review this open tender system for school canteens.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Madam, the school tuckshops exist

primarily  to  serve  the  needs  of  students.   Hence,  the

cornerstone  of  MOE's tuckshop policy  is  the  welfare  and

interest of the students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools are committed to ensure that tuckshop

stallholders are able to provide not only good services,  but

also cater to the nutritional needs of students and that  the

food  sold  in  the tuckshop is wholesome, and at  reasonable

prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary consideration for the selection of

stallholders  is, therefore, the ability and  suitability  of

the applicants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The single tender system introduced in 1987 provides an

alternative  for  the  provision  of  tuckshop  services   to

schools.  In line with MOE's policy of giving principals more

autonomy in the administration of their schools, the existing

practice  is that new schools, or schools to be relocated  to

new  buildings, can opt for the single tender system, as long

as students get good value for their money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, a total of 16 Government schools, or 6% of the

total  number of 253 Government schools, have opted for  this

system.   The  number is quite small.  The  majority  of  the

existing  Government  schools are  still  on  the  individual

stallholders'  system.   Under  the  single  tender   system,

schools  call a tender to invite a single operator to  manage

all the foodstalls in the tuckshop at controlled prices.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1969</b></font><br><br>



The  bidding  rental  ranges from $320-$2,000  per  month  at

Government  schools.   Irrespective  of  whichever   tuckshop

systems, schools are required to evaluate the food prices and

quality proposed by the contractor or stallholder before they

are awarded the right to run the stalls.  The single operator

also  would need to seek approval from schools to sublet  the

stalls.   Schools  would need to ensure  that  this  approach

would not increase food pricing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On food prices, one perception of the single tender

system  is that it may result in higher food prices.  Indeed,

Mr  Ong and Mr Yeo have raised this concern, and I am sure  a

lot of Members here are concerned about that possibility.   A

survey  conducted in September 1998 showed that  the  average

price  of food and drink items sold in school tuckshop  under

the  single  tender  system and those  under  the  individual

stallholder  system,  was  of  little  difference.   Feedback

received  from  schools  under the single  tender  system  in

February  2000 also showed that food quality and prices  were

maintained at reasonable level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, it will take me probably until 7.00 pm if I were

to  read  out the details of the difference in prices between

those  at  single  stall and individual  stallholder  system.

But, let me just give some examples.  Under the single tender

system  (STS), at primary school level for cooked  food,  the

average  price  is  88  cents, whereas under  the  individual

stallholder system is 81 cents.  So the difference is only  7

cents.  For hot drinks, 44 cents at single tender system  and

49  cents  at normal stall.  Cold drinks, 60 cents at  single

tender  stall and 61 cents at individual stall.   So  on  the

average,  the  price is about 64 cents at the  single  tender

system stall and 63 cents at the normal school stall.  So the

price difference is really marginal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each school has a school tuckshop committee to manage

its  tuckshop.   This committee is chaired by the  Principal,

and  comprises  representatives of the  school  staff.   This

committee  monitors  the  food  quality  and  prices  in  the

tuckshop  regularly to ensure compliance, and for consistency

of the service quality.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1970</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has reduced the tuckshop fees for the

individual stallholder system in January 2002.  Under the new

scheme,  individual stallholders pay only  a  nominal  rental

ranging  from  $5-$15  per  month,  depending  on  the  pupil

enrolment in the school.  The previous rates ranged from $50-$60,  in  return  stallholders are to pay  utilities  charges

directly  to  Power Supply.  Under PRIME,  about  90  schools

would be merged or relocated.  Schools which are affected  by

merger  would  have to go through a re-selection  process  of

stallholders  since  the  number of stalls  available,  after

merger,  will be reduced.  The relocating schools can  either

retain  their existing individual tuckshop stallholders,  opt

for the re-selection process or for the single tender system.

Existing   stallholders  who  are  affected  by   merger   or

relocation of schools would be automatically shortlisted  for

interview, if they apply for a tuckshop stall, either in  the

current  school, or in the new school.  Their past experience

will be give due consideration during the selection process.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Is it not expensive to pay for an

average  of  60  cents for a cold drink, and if  I  heard  it

correctly,  the Parliamentary Secretary said the  survey  was

conducted  in September 1998?  Is there any survey  conducted

recently?   Whichever system the school adopts,  how  are  we

going to ensure that they really charge reasonable pricing?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng:</b> I do not quite agree with what the

Parliamentary Secretary said.  I will give him  the  name  of

the  school that has increased the cost of a plate of chicken

rice  from  50  cents to $1 tomorrow.  What the Parliamentary

Secretary said about the increase being in terms of cents,  I

do  not  think  is  concrete  proof.   I  am  not  convinced.

Sometimes maybe the feedback  ---

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong, do you want the Parliamentary

Secretary to give you a reply?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng:</b> According to the Parliamentary

Secretary, the single tenderer has to get permission from the

principal in order to sublet.  The principal has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1971</b></font><br><br>



no choice but to approve, because if I were a Chinese, and  I

want to sell Muslim food, the principal cannot say, "I do not

allow you to sublet."  He has to allow him to sublet because,

even  if  he  knows how to cook Muslim food, MUIS  would  not

agree.   So  the  question  here is when  a  single  tenderer

sublets  to  an individual tenderer, what is the price?   How

many  percent do they add on to the sub-rental?  So, in order

to  pay  the sub-rental, he has to sell the food at a  higher

price.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong, do you want the Parliamentary

Secretary to give you a reply?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng:</b> I want him to reply whether the

Ministry has a close supervision on that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> I explained earlier that the school,

through the canteen committee, does supervise the price.  The

single  tender  operator cannot determine the  price  or  the

rental  fee for the individual stall as he likes.  He has  to

get  the approval of the principal and the canteen committee.

If Mr Ong Ah Heng has ---

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Green Plan 2012 is the environmental master plan for

the  next  10 years for Singapore.  It sets out key strategic

directions in balancing sustainable development and having  a

quality   living  environment  in  Singapore.   As  Singapore

restructures  its economy, the composition of its  industries

may  change  drastically  from one of manufacturing-based  to

healthcare  and life sciences.  This poses new challenges  to

our environmental management efforts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides adopting the existing principle of planning,

monitoring and enforcement, I would like to propose that  the

Environment  Ministry conduct environmental  impact  analysis

for projects with high impact on the environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I wish to seek the following clarifications from

the Minister:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What are the key performance indicators for Green

Plan 2012?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What are the key strategies to promote sustainable

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;development?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What are the key plans to manage solid waste in

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;land scarce Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) How can the Ministry promote the development of

environmental conscience among Singaporeans?

<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> The Singapore Green Plan 2012 in a way

encapsulates  certain balances that have to be  made  in  the

context  of  the  dilemma of development.   As  Singapore  is

scaling   up   the   economic  ladder,   there   is   growing

international  expectation that we will do our  part  in  not

just  setting  a  good example in environment management  but

also  promulgating  and propagating it.  At  the  same  time,

Singaporeans' own expectation of environmental issues and our

compliance  to them is rising.  And, yet, we have  to  assess

the  economic  impact  of  onerous  environmental  standards,

especially in this economic environment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1973</b></font><br><br>



which is very competitive and cost pressures are great.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the Green Plan 2012 as an effort to address this

challenge  to meet Singaporeans' aspirations, to live  up  to

our  responsibilities within the international community and,

at  the  same time, trying to balance our economic and social

interests.   I do have, however, some specific questions  and

proposals which I would like the Minister to respond to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that the plan outlines some very specific

targets that are to be attained over a 10-year period.   This

pertains  to  recycling rate where the target is  an  overall

60%, that is, where 67% of land is to be water catchment  and

60%  of  electricity generated is to be from natural gas.   I

would like to ask how realistic are these targets, given  our

city  state environment.  How do they compare with  developed

countries and are we over-stretching or keeping pace?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to ask the Minister what is the

potential  impact  of such targets, and  the  Green  Plan  in

general,  on  businesses.  I am particularly concerned  about

small  businesses, and whether compliance to some of the  new

initiatives that are being considered by the Ministry of  the

Environment  might have an adverse effect on  business  cost,

particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Green Plan envisages the people, private

and  public  sector  involvement in the  realisation  of  its

vision.  I would like to ask the Minister how the Ministry of

the  Environment proposes to educate and enthuse Singaporeans

around  the goal of the Green Plan.  Singaporeans  have  been

somewhat apathetic to various efforts like recyling and other

environment-friendly  measures.   How  can  we  ignite  their

enthusiasm  and  get it going, so that the intention  becomes

action?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in the Green Plan, I have not come across any

specific  proposal to promote Singapore as a  venue  for  the

environment business.  There are many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1974</b></font><br><br>



initiatives  today around the world, through  technology  and

other  measures,  to  come  out  with  environmental-friendly

solutions to conventional problems.  The question is  whether

Singapore can position itself well in that spectrum.  I would

like  to ask the Minister what plans his Ministry has in that

regard.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Mdm

Chairman, Singapore today is clean and green.  However, if we

look into the future, with a growing population and expanding

economy, we are going to see more people on the street,  more

cars on the road, more air-conditioners at homes, and at  the

same  time  we  are  going  to see ourselves  consuming  more

energy,   maybe  producing  more  wastes.   It  is  therefore

important that we do not take for granted that the clean  and

green environment in Singapore will last forever.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chairman, just about 18 months ago, the World

Economic  Forum  commissioned  a  study  to  look  into   the

environmental  sustainability of  various  countries  in  the

world.   This  study came out with a ranking of  the  various

countries   along   the   line  of  an   ESI   (Environmental

Sustainability  Index).  122 countries were covered  by  this

study.   When  the report came out, we found ourselves  being

ranked  tenth.   Not tenth from the top, but tenth  from  the

bottom,  meaning that the study concluded that  Singapore  is

among  the worst 10 countries in the world, in terms  of  our

ability to stay away from environmental disaster.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion of this study is that Singapore, sooner

rather  than  later, is going to face with a serious  problem

with  the  environment.  The ENV was taken by  surprise.   We

studied the report carefully.  We disagreed with the findings

of  the  report.   So  we approached the research  group  and

explained to them that the sustainability of environment went

beyond  just natural endowment.  Because, at the end  of  the

day,  there  are  still  these things  known  as  technology,

innovation,  discipline and determination.  Our point to them

was that Singapore because of our ability to make use of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1975</b></font><br><br>



technology,  our ability to come up with new  ideas  all  the

time,   our   willingness   to  be   disciplined,   and   our

determination to ensure that the clean and green  environment

of  Singapore  can be sustained over the long term,  we  have

made Singapore what it is today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some exchanges, the study team was half convinced.

Two months later, when they released the formal report at the

World Economic Forum, we looked at the top of the report,  we

were not there; we looked at the bottom 10, we were no longer

there.  In fact, we came in  65th, in the middle of the table

of  122 countries.  So it shows that the study team was  half

convinced  by our argument.  One year later, in January  this

year, the same study team produced a second annual report  on

ESI  ranking again.  This time round, the report was released

in  New York city, because the World Economic Forum was  held

in  New York City.  When the report was out, we looked at the

bottom 10.  No, we were not there.  We looked at the top  10.

We  were  not there.  We looked at the middle 10.  Again,  we

were  not  there.  So we thought, what happened to Singapore?

We   went   through  the  whole  list.   In  fact,  Singapore

"disappeared"  from the list.  What happened  was  the  study

team,  after one year of analysis, of looking at  the  model,

came  to  the  conclusion that Singapore is in a very  unique

situation.   Because there is no way they could  explain  the

performance of Singapore  -  based on the model  they come up

with,   they  decided to call Singapore  "an  outlier".   But

there  are two types of outlier - the positive type  and  the

negative  type.  Fortunately, in our case, they have  decided

that  we  were  a positive outlier.  Meaning that,  based  on

their  model,  we  should  be living  closer  to  environment

disaster.   They do not know why Singapore is different  from

that particular model.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I relate this particular episode to convey the

point  that environmental sustainability is something not  to

be taken for granted.  Singapore is clean and green today not

because  we have all the natural endowment to make  us  clean

and green,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1976</b></font><br><br>



but  because  we,  as  Singaporeans, as  Government,  as  one

people, work together all these years to ensure that  we  are

clean,  we  are  green.   We created this  environment.   Our

challenge  is  to  continue  with  this  determination,  this

creativity,  this innovation, to ensure that we  can  sustain

our clean and green environment for a long time to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, I fully agree with Dr Teo Ho Pin on his

point  that  we need to balance sustainable development  with

quality  living environment.  This is exactly the  vision  we

have  in the SGP 2012.  Our vision for the SGP 2012 is to  go

beyond  clean  and  green,  to strive  towards  environmental

sustainability.   In other words, we are  not  talking  about

improving  our environmental performance in the  short  term.

Rather,  we  are  talking  about  how  we  can  sustain   our

environment  for the long term.  This change  in  mindset  is

very  important  because  the only way  we  can  sustain  our

environment   is   to  harness  the  full   commitment,   the

participation  of  the 3P sectors - the  people  sector,  the

private sector and the public sector - on an on-going basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran asked whether the targets we set under the

SGP  2012  are  realistic  and whether  we  have  taken  into

consideration  the  cost to the industry.   This  is  a  very

important point.  I want to assure Mr Iswaran that the  whole

review exercise of the SGP 2012 is spearheaded by three focus

groups, with 51 members coming from the 3P sectors.   The  3P

partners  together identified the challenges, formulated  the

strategies  and,  together,  they  set  the  targets.   These

targets  are not set by the ENV alone.  Rather, they are  set

by  the 3P partners collectively.  Therefore, Mr Iswaran  can

be  rest  assured  that,  with the private  sector  being  an

integral  part of the exercise, the targets we set under  the

SGP  2012  are realistic and pragmatic.  Further,  after  the

targets  were set, we put all the information on the Internet

for  the public to give their feedback over a 3-month period.

The  feedback period is over. We are now reviewing the draft,

based on the feedback we received from members of the public.

With the involvement of the 3P sectors, we now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1977</b></font><br><br>



have  a  shared  vision in the SGP 2012.  We now  have  joint

ownership of the SGP 2012.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin asked what are the key performance

indicators  we  have under the SGP 2012.  Mdm  Chairman,  the

first  key thrust of the SGP 2012 is to ensure the innovative

and efficient use of scarce resources to ensure that we would

be  able  to achieve environmental sustainability.   When  we

talk   about  innovative  use,  we  are  not  talking   about

innovation for the sake of innovation.  We are talking  about

innovation  with  a  specific  purpose  in  mind.   And  this

specific purpose in mind is to ensure that we would  be  able

to  sustain environmental performance over the long term.  At

the same time, be able to reinvent the environmental industry

in  Singapore.   There are various key targets set  regarding

the innovative and efficient use of scarce resources.  Let me

start with solid waste.

<br>6.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall recycling rate of solid waste in Singapore

reached  44% last year, after stabilising at 40% since  1996.

Our aim under the SGP 2010 is to increase this recycling rate

to  60% by year 2012.  At the same time, we aim to double the

life-span of Pulau Semakau from the 25-30 years today  to  at

least  50  years.   Mr  Iswaran asked how  does  this  target

compare  to the developed countries.  The target  of  60%  is

comparable  to  the best practices in the world.   Take,  for

example,  the Netherlands, the Number 1 country in  recycling

today.   They  have the highest recycling rate in  the  world

today,  and it is about 65%.  In other words, if we are  able

to  achieve  60%,  it will put us at least above  average  by

global  standing.  We are also going beyond the 60% recycling

rate.  We are going to adopt the best practice of Netherlands

and  strive towards zero landfill.  This means as we  promote

recycling, we hope  the day will come when we do not need  to

landfill any refuse or waste.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second target we have set is regarding our

water  supply.   Our  target for the  next  10  years  is  to

diversify and increase water supply in Singapore, so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1978</b></font><br><br>



that  we  can become more self-sufficient.  Today, we  depend

entirely on the conventional sources of supply, meaning local

catchment  water  as  well as the river water  imported  from

Malaysia.   Over the next 10 years, our target is to  develop

non-conventional sources of supply, namely, desalination  and

water reclamation, so that these non-conventional sources  of

supply   will  complement  and  supplement  the  conventional

sources  of  supply to account for about  25%  of  our  water

demand by the year 2012.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third target we have set is regarding the air

quality in Singapore.  Over the next 10 years, we aim to keep

the  ambient air quality in Singapore to within the standards

set by the World Health Organisation and the USEPA, and to be

comparable with the best cities in the world.  In the past 5-10  years, if we look at our PSI performance,  the PSI is  in

the  "good" range for about 60-80% of the year, except during

those  periods  when we were affected by the  regional  haze.

Our aim for the next 10 years is to maintain this level of 60-80%  in the "good" range and, if possible, to strive for 85%,

with  the  remaining 15% in the moderate  range.   What  this

means  is  that  we  need to make more use of  clean  energy,

strive  for greater energy efficiency and, at the same  time,

to adopt best practices in pollution control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, all these strategies must cut across

all  sectors  of  the economy and society, from  industry  to

power  generation, to vehicular emission, to  the  commercial

sector  and  to the public consumers.  Lastly,  we  recognise

that  air  pollution knows no boundary.  Therefore,  we  will

continue  to  strengthen our regional effort to  prevent  the

return of the regional haze.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fourth target we set is relating to public

health.   Singapore  is  located in a region  where  tropical

diseases  are  endemic.  We aim to ensure the  low  incidence

rate of food borne, water borne, vector borne and indoor  air

borne  diseases.   We  have  to strengthen  our  surveillance

system,  invest in applied research, collaborate with  public

health



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1979</b></font><br><br>



institutions and work in partnership with the community.  Our

aim  over the next 10 years is to transform Singapore into  a

leading  regional  centre  in the  research  and  control  of

communicable  diseases that are transmitted by  food,  water,

vector or indoor air.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Iswaran asked whether ENV could do

more  to  promote environmental awareness among Singaporeans,

in  particular, the younger Singaporeans.  This is indeed the

second  key  thrust of the SGP 2012, which is to promote  the

active   participation  of  all  to  sustain  quality  living

environment  in Singapore.  In this regard, we are  going  to

promote  3P  participation  in all  our  major  environmental

initiatives.   We  are  also going  to  step  up  efforts  to

increase   public   awareness,  public  education,   and   to

strengthen joint ownership in the 3P sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENV is going to put our money where our mouth is. In

this  regard,  I am pleased to share with you  that  ENV  has

decided to set up a 3P Partnership Fund.  We have decided  to

set  aside  $750,000 for collaboration with the 3P  partners,

and  this money will come from our existing budget.  In other

words,  instead  of  spending the money  conducting  our  own

programmes, we have decided to set aside some of our existing

resources to undertake programmes jointly with the 3P sector,

and get it done through the 3P sector.  We hope that, through

such  initiatives, we will be able to promote joint ownership

in recycling and in various key environmental programmes.  In

this regard, we welcome any ideas and any proposals from  our

3P partners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran also asked what are the initiatives in SGP

2012  to  promote environmental related industry.   He  asked

whether we have any intention to turn Singapore into a centre

of  environment technology and to come out with environmental

friendly  solutions.  This is a very good  point  because  we

look at the environmental industry as an integral part of the

3P partnership.  As we promote 3P



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1980</b></font><br><br>



partnership,  as we engage the people sector in  our  various

programmes,  it  is very important that  we  make  sure   the

environmental  industry  is  able  to  offer  the   effective

solutions to solve our environmental challenges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ENV has embarked on an exercise, for more than

six months now, to re-invent the environmental industry.   We

are  now  working towards upgrading the capabilities  in  our

environmental industry, so that the industry will  make  more

use  of technology.  The jobs should be redefined, the skills

of  the workers should be redeveloped so that, over time,  we

will be able to professionalise the industry and enhance  the

image  of the industry.  The ENV is now working very  closely

with  the  Waste  Management  and  Recycling  Association  of

Singapore, which is the industry body.  At the same time,  we

are  drawing  on  the  support of the various  public  sector

organisations.  For example, the JTC is working  with  us  to

create  an  eco-recycling park, with 19 hectares of  land  in

Tuas.  Our intention is to turn the eco-recycling park into a

showcase  of the environmental industry of the future,  where

the  deployment of technology, the redefinition of jobs,  the

redefinition  of skills would be done in a concerted  manner.

We  will  also involve the unions to ensure that  Singaporean

workers will be able to benefit from this re-invention of the

environmental  industry.  At the end of the day,  we  believe

that only by having a capable industry, an active people  and

a  responsive Government, can we have a strong 3P partnership

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third key thrust of SGP 2012 is to do our part for

the  global community.  We will continue to play a pro-active

role  in  the  regional  effort to  stamp  out  transboundary

pollution  threats, such as the regional haze.  At  the  same

time,  we are committed to fulfill our obligations to various

international  agreements  that  we  are  party   to.    More

importantly,  we  are going to do more for the  international

community by supporting capacity building efforts.   Many  of

the  developing  countries  are now  pursuing  the  ideal  of

sustainable development.  However, capacity building is a key



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1981</b></font><br><br>



challenge faced by many of these developing countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ENV will continue to provide training to these

developing countries,  including the ASEAN neighbours and the

small  island developing states.  We intend to  step  up  our

training efforts and offer training not just in the technical

area, but also in environmental management.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the SGP 2012 will be formally launched in

August.  It will be presented in World Summit for Sustainable

Development in September.  SGP 2012 is jointly formulated  by

the 3P partners, and it will require the joint efforts of the

3P  partners for us to turn our vision of going beyond  clean

and   green  towards  sustainability  into  reality.   I   am

confident  that,  as long as 3P partners  work  together,  we

will  be able to go beyond clean and green, and put Singapore

firmly on a path towards environmental sustainability.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Madam, I am indeed glad to learn from

the  Environment  Minister  that Singapore  has  been  tested

positive  for the environment sustainability index.   Let  us

now discuss how can we sustain the water supply in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent press reports regarding the water agreement

between Singapore and Malaysia have raised much concern among

Singaporeans.  Many Singaporeans now recognise that water  is

a  strategic  resource,  and would  like  the  Government  to

explore ways to make Singapore self-sufficient in water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of ways Singapore can be self-sufficient in our water needs. Essentially, three key

strategies  can be adopted, namely, (1) increase  sources  of

water supply; (2) conserve water consumption; and (3) recycle

used  water.  For example, we can reclaim land to form  water

catchment, explore underground water or desalinate  seawater.

At  the same time, we should embark on a nation-wide campaign

to  conserve  water.   Today,  we  are  still  using  potable

drinking water for washing our corridors and watering plants.

Finally, we can explore innovative



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1982</b></font><br><br>



techniques of water recycling used in many other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I wish to ask the Minister the following

questions:  (1) What is the long-term plan to increase  water

self-sufficiency in Singapore?  Is it possible for  Singapore

to  be  completely self-sufficient in water one day?  (2)  Is

water recycling applicable in Singapore?  What is the cost of

recycled  water?  (3) What are the plans to further encourage

water conservation among businesses and consumers?

<br>6.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Madam, as

we   move  towards  less  dependency  on  water  supply  from

Malaysia,  we  have to look for  a diversity of water  supply

sources.  At present, half of our water supply depends on our

rainfall  catchment,  the  other  half  from  the  two  water

agreements  with Malaysia.  The NEWater project is  promising

and  could  be  one of the important sources of water  supply

upon  the  expiry of the first water agreement with Malaysia.

The  first,  and it could be the last, seawater  desalination

plant  will  be  on stream by the year 2005,  supplying  one-seventh of Singapore's water needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long term, the water agreement with Malaysia is

highly uncertain.  We may disagree with the terms due to  the

price,  or  the  quality of the water,  because  there  is  a

growing  trend  of water pollution.  We must take  this  time

available  now  to find viable alternatives  if  we  fail  to

extend the water agreement in the future.  What we need to do

is  to  explore reliable fresh water sources in  the  region,

like  Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand and Kalimantan, which

are  actually not very far away from Singapore.   The  common

thought  of  lay persons on the high transportation  cost  of

water  from  these countries is misleading.  When we  compare

the transportation cost with the price of water from brackish

water  (RO)  and seawater desalination, it is very affordable

and very cheap.  Just take an official quotation of US$20,000

to  charter an oil tanker of 200,000 tonnes from Australia to

Singapore, it works out to less than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1983</b></font><br><br>



US10 cents per cubic metre.  Therefore, this is a viable  way

of  transporting water from a nearby country in the region to

Singapore  if  the raw water price charged is reasonable.   I

would like to urge the Ministry not to abandon the concept of

exploring  the shipping of fresh water from the  region.   It

could  be one of the very viable means of fresh water  supply

in  the  future, at least in case of an emergency.   Five-six

tankers will be sufficient to supply Singapore with one day's

water  needs.   I would like to ask the Minister  whether  he

would  consider this particular idea of shipping  water  from

the nearby countries to Singapore, as one of the alternatives

for fresh water supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEWater is one of the very promising areas.

Technically, NEWater is much cleaner than normal  water.   If

we  take  the Chua Chu Kang Water Treatment Plant, the  water

quality contains about 350 parts per million in terms of  the

total dissolved salt, whereas the NEWater only contains  less

than 50 parts per million.  This is why the NEWater is a very

attractive water to the wafer fab industry, because it  costs

them  much  less  to convert it into ultra-pure  water.   The

question now is:  how do we market the NEWater?  Are we going

to  charge  a cheap price and make it look like poor  quality

water,  or should we market it as a branded product and  only

people  who  need  high  quality water  will  be  allowed  to

purchase  this  water at a high price?  If  we  are  able  to

market  the NEWater in this particular manner, we could  tell

the  people  that it is high quality water, and there  is  no

reason why people would think that it is dirty and refuse  to

consume it.  So, I would like to ask the Minister whether  he

has  any  plan  to  promote the use of NEWater  in  the  near

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we are talking about a potential ---

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Low, can you please wrap up your

speech?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Yes. I would also like to

ask the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1984</b></font><br><br>



whether we have any plans to capture storm water, which is  a

potential source of fresh water supply.  This is important if

we  have  a shortage of water in future, and if the agreement

is not renewed with Malaysia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe:</b> Mdm Chairman, I will be very

brief.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister what plans his Ministry

has  to commence the supply of NEWater for domestic use.   In

some countries - I am told Orange County in California, USA - water produced or reclaimed, using the same technique used in

our  NEWater plant, is supplied for domestic consumption.   I

understand  that the quality of our NEWater is  safe  and  is

very  good.   So, I want to ask the Minister whether  he  has

plans to take on this potential supply of NEWater, which is a

more  reliable source of water supply, to fulfill  our  water

requirements.  If so, when can this happen?

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Khor is not in the House. Dr Michael

Lim  is  also  not around.  Mr Iswaran is not  speaking.   Mr

Ahmad Magad.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Madam, my topic is also on

NEWater.   First,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  that  the

Minister  for the Environment had spoken at length last  year

in  this  House about the potential use of NEWater, and  that

priority of its use will be for the wafer fab industry, which

demands  ultra-pure and very clean water.   However,  in  the

light of the changed situation, where the Prime Minister  has

said in Parliament recently that we are gradually moving away

from and decreasing our dependence on Malaysia for the supply

of  water, I would like to know from the Minister what is his

Ministry's revised plan in domesticating the use of NEWater.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, is the NEWater Visitor Centre at Bedok

ready  and open to members of the public?  Beyond its use  in

industry,  I  think  there  is a need  to  accelerate  public

education  on domesticating the use of NEWater for  the  home

environment, particularly if it is meant for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1985</b></font><br><br>



drinking.  For the many of us who have visited the plant,  we

are   convinced  that  NEWater  is  clean  and  suitable  for

consumption.   But members of the public need  to  understand

what we are doing to purify recycled water, and the resultant

quality  from  this  process,  so  that  they  too  can  feel

comfortable  of  its  cleanliness and suitability  for  human

consumption,  if  we  have to move in this  direction  sooner

rather than later.  Perhaps laying down a time-table for  the

domestic use of NEWater would be useful, so that we can adopt

a  phased  approach of its application for both industry,  as

well as for domestic consumption.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Madam, it is getting late,

and I will try to be brief.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on, Mr Steve Chia spoke about the need to create

brilliance  in  our kids in school, and then Mr  Chiam  spoke

about Sweden and Nobel prize winners, but I am afraid I  will

be talking about bottom-lines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government's plan to dig deep for our bottom-line

sewerage  needs says a lot about our Government's  foresight.

They  not only think far, but also deep.  As the saying goes,

"we  leave  no stone, or is it earth, unturned."   For  land-scarce Singapore, we have understood the need to go skywards.

We know why we need to reach for the sky, while our feet must

firmly be on the ground, and now even going underground.   We

are  also  going  seawards,  with reclamation,  but  that  is

another story.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new area of sewerage development is all the more

critical, as we are now turning to NEWater, as mentioned by a

few  Members earlier on, as an alternative source  of  water.

So  these deep tunnel sewerage projects are going to be  very

important for our NEWater project too.  We are not only land-scarce  but water-scarce, and thus Singaporeans must be  made

conscious of the importance of the deep tunnel projects.  Can

the  Minister share with us Environment Ministry's  plans  to

inform  the  public  about the importance  of  the  projects?

Nevertheless,  these  projects, deep they  may  be,  are  not

cheap.  Can the Minister explain what are the cost



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1986</b></font><br><br>



implications for our water and utilities charges in the  long

term?   Also,  will the Minister look into other needs  which

could  be  synergised with the building of the deep  tunnels?

It is well known in Singapore that one digging always follows

another  when it comes to utilities work, leaving  the  roads

messy  and traffic inconvenienced.  So with the deep tunnels,

the  opportunity comes once, and thus must be used for  other

needs,  eg,  if there are other needs to be met in  terms  of

electricity  or  other  utilities.  Madam,  the  deep  tunnel

sewerage project is innovative, and I hope the Minister  will

not be cursive and shallow in his answer to my questions.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Madam, I am speaking on the

recycling of waste.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People may be aware of the fire outbreaks at companies

collecting  wood  wastes.  These cases happened  in  Lim  Chu

Kang,  and also the recent case in Tuas.  It took a few  days

for the Fire Department to put out the fire.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collection of wood wastes without the need to

recycle is a very lucrative business.  For every ton of  wood

wastes, they charge more than $40.  Some waste collectors dig

a  big  hole in the ground and they try to bury as much waste

as possible in a limited collector's site.  Some of them also

pile  up  all  the wood wastes to the height of  a  mountain.

Today,  after  the fire in Lim Chu Kang, the  black  hill  is

still  standing high and is an eyesore object.  This  reminds

people  of  the misuse of the waste collection for recycling.

Such  potential  fire  hazards due to wood  waste  stockpiles

still  exist in Lim Chu Kang, Sungei Kadut Industrial Estate,

and also in Tuas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether there is a plan

to  ensure  that the recycling company is genuinely  carrying

out recycle work.  If their products do not have a market, or

the market is smaller than what they can recycle, they should

be  honest  and stop collecting the wastes.  They should  let

the  incinerator take over the wastes, instead of piling them

up,  and  waiting for a time when the fire would solve  their

problem.  It will endanger the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1987</b></font><br><br>



lives of the people and also endanger the properties near the

stockpile  area.  It will also cause air and water pollution,

if such uncontrolled fire incidents take place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry should look into the matter and see whether

the  recycling  companies  are  genuine,  and  whether  their

stockpiles are beyond the capacity of what they can  recycle.

The  Minister should also take tough punitive actions against

anyone  who does not comply with the original conditions  for

the setting up of a wood recycling company.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now the Minister

mentioned that we have been progressing well in the recycling

of waste materials, but this is only for paper and plastics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a garden city. Over the years, many, many

trees have been planted all over the island.  A lot has  been

done to keep these trees in good shape and good health.   The

National  Parks Board carries out maintenance work  on  these

trees, by pruning them every now and then.  In the process, a

lot of branches are being cut off everyday.  Can the Minister

enlighten  us  as  to  whether  these  cut  branches  can  be

recycled?  If so, have they been recycled?  I understand that

a  certain company has been recycling the husks of durian  to

produce flower pots.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For recycling to be successful in Singapore, we need the

support  of the grassroots organisations and the people,  and

we should step up the education campaign in recycling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also promised some rebates on our

garbage disposal fees, if a certain percentage of our  wastes

could  be  recycled.  With the advancement in  technology,  I

would  imagine  that  more of our waste  materials  could  be

recycled,  and  hence  our garbage  disposal  fees  could  be

lowered.   But  instead we find that the fees are  increased.

Can  the  Minister  tell  us how much  more  we  must  do  in

recycling in order to claim the said rebates?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1988</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Madam, in the midst of the current

economic  downturn, another increase that would  add  to  the

cost  of  living  has been announced.  The  Ministry  of  the

Environment  announced the increase in the  fees  for  refuse

disposal.    The  increase  was  passed  on  to   households,

shopkeepers, shopowners, market and stallholders  immediately

by  the  waste  collection company.   The  Ministry,  in  its

announcement, also stated that by raising the refuse disposal

fees  to  the  actual  cost recovery  level,  will  encourage

recycling, something which is very funny to me.  I would like

to know:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Whether it is the Ministry's intention to

eventually pass on the full cost of refuse disposal  fees  to

the  households.   If so, will the increases  ultimately  add

burden to the average household?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What efforts has the Ministry made to encourage

recycling,   in  the  context  of  keeping  waste  collection

company's  fees  down?   They  did  not  pass  the  cost   to

consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) I understand the Minister said that the target for

recycling  is  60%. Is this 60% going to be achieved  by  his

Ministry's increase in refuse disposal fees?  That  was  what

he said in the statement.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Recently, the refuse

disposal  fee was increased by about 15% for private housing.

So,  I would like to ask the Minister a few questions.  First

of  all,  why is there a need to increase the refuse disposal

fee  by  15%?  Is it not better to increase the fee when  the

economy  improves in future?  The other question  is  whether

the  refuse collector is over-charging.  Because the increase

in incinerator fees may not necessarily be transferred to the

increase  in  fees  for  refuse collection.   So,  could  the

Minister respond to my question, whether the refuse collector

is actually over-charging?

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof Low, do you want to move on to your

next cut?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, there is no time. I
