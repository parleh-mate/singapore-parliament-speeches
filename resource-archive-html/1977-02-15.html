<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion* standing in my name as it appears on the Order Paper.



<hr noshade>

* The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of

the Foreshores Act (chapter 270). approves the

reclamation by Government of those portions of the

foreshore and seabed off the Town of Singapore

containing the respective areas of about 234 hectares

and 126 hectares as shown edged in red on the plan

marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO 1/77" which

is deposited in the Land Office. Singapore.

<hr noshade>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my colleague, the Minister for National

Development when announcing Government's decision  to

proceed  with reclamation under Phase VI and  VII  of

the  East Coast Reclamation, outlined the development

potential which the addition of 360 hectares  to  our

land  area will present. The proposals are a  seaward

extension  of existing reclamation works off  Tanjong

Rhu  and Collyer Quay and the additional area  to  be

reclaimed  is shown edged in red on the  plan  marked

"LAND  OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 1/77", a  copy  of

which is displayed in the Library of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this reclamation together with the adjoining

218  hectares reclaimed under the earlier Phases will

give  a  total area of 578 hectares or 1441 acres  of

unencumbered  land  -  large  enough  to  enable  the

development  of  a new city for the  future.  Careful

planning and extensive studies will be made to ensure

maximum  utilization of what can be a valuable  piece

of  real  estate. Mr Speaker, Sir, the motion  before

this  House  seeks approval under section  4  of  the

Foreshores Act to carry out this reclamation work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reclamation will be undertaken by the Housing

and  Development Board as agent of the Government and

the  fill for the reclamation will be taken from  the

Tampines worksite of the Housing Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

114th February, 1977.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore, express our thanks to

the President for the Speech which he delivered on

behalf of the Government at the opening of the First

Session of this Parliament"', - [Dr Chiang Hai Ding].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Chong Tee (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the

close of yesterday's sitting, I was speaking on  drug

abuses by unscrupulous elements. Their indulgence  in

such  unlawful  activities affect the  good  name  of

Singapore,  and  I  would now like to  continue.  The

public  must  be  effectively  urged  and  encouraged

through the mass media and the cinemas to be vigilant

and to give their fullest cooperation in this matter,

without  which success in the enforcement  of  severe

punishment  of offenders will be very minima).  There

is  no  doubt  that  there is a need  to  extend  our

sympathy to the innocent who for some reason has been

associated  with anti-social elements, thus  exposing

themselves  to evil influences. Nevertheless,  it  is

clearly essential to ensure that the penalty fits the

crime  of drug offences, be they traffickers, pushers

or peddlers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Addendum on the Ministry of National

Development in regard to resettlement has prompted me

to    highlight   certain   anomalies    that    need

rectification. The rapid development and expansion of

public  amenities has made resettlement of the people

inevitable.  Today most of the people  have  accepted

the  Government's  policy of  mass  resettlement  for

national   development.  However,  such   a   massive

movement  of  people from their familiar surroundings

and mode of life as well as their means of livelihood

has not been carried out with as little suffering  as

possible   to  the  people  affected.  Many  affected

constituents have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>



been    greatly   inconvenienced   by   unsympathetic

bureaucratic  Government  officers  who  show  little

patience  and  concern  to the people  affected.  The

Resettlement Department has not actually  taken  into

consideration the livelihood of the affected  elderly

farmers,  in particular those who have been  in  this

occupation  for  many years. It is  conceivable  that

they  cannot adapt themselves easily to the  assembly

lines  of  factories or building sites. It should  be

the  policy  of the Resettlement Department  to  show

concern   for   the  livelihood  of   these   people.

Admittedly, it is not possible to provide alternative

sites  for  all  farmers  affected  by  resettlement.

Perhaps the Primary Production Department can  assist

in  alleviating  their plight by  teaching  them  the

hydroponic  method of growing vegetables and  fruits,

which requires less land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, being uprooted from the villages and kampongs

is  already a great sacrifice for national  progress,

but  to  be deprived of their means of livelihood  is

too high a price for them to pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monetary compensation awards in lieu of

alternative  farm  sites are  not  adequate.  It  is,

however,  difficult to establish the authenticity  of

their  complaints. Nevertheless, true or false,  they

are    dissatisfied   and   unhappy.   The   relevant

authorities  should look into the matter and  rectify

any  anomaly that may exist, or make every effort  to

dispel  any  dissatisfaction in  their  minds.  There

seems to be no standard rates of compensation for the

loss  of  fruit  trees,  pig sties,  etc.  There  are

complaints   that  the  affected   people   are   not

compensated  with  the  amount originally  quoted  in

writing by the resettlement officers. When discussing

resettlement terms, these unsympathetic officers show

little  patience  with the affected  people  who  are

illiterate and who are often hurriedly made  to  sign

statements or documents without first being  given  a

clear  explanation. They ~re also told in writing  to

report  to  the  resettlement  officers  who  do  not

indicate  where  they should go. When  they  call  at

Maxwell Road Office, they are redirected to Toa Payoh

Office, without



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>



apology. This happens time and again. They should  be

specifically told where to go and what to do so  that

they  need not be inconvenienced or waste unnecessary

travelling expenses, valuable time and energy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, providing them with alternative accommodation

at  concessional  rentals for a certain  period  will

certainly  help,  but unfortunately these  small-time

farmers  who  pay  only  a few  dollars  a  year  for

occupying  land will definitely find it difficult  to

pay  even  the concessionary rent unless in  addition

they  can  be  given priority of suitable employment.

They should be given preference when they apply for a

hawker   licence.  In  Changi  Village  business   is

practically  bad  for all the shopkeepers.  They  are

finding  it difficult to pay their rent, even  though

they  are  given special concessions at  the  moment.

Perhaps   the  Housing  and  Development  Board   can

consider deferring the annual increase in their  rent

until  their business improves with the operation  of

the new Changi International Airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Housing and Development Board, on the

other  hand, must be complimented for its achievement

in  having completed about a quarter million  housing

units   for  55%  of  our  population.  It  is   most

gratifying to note that the HDB is doing a very  fine

job and will further accelerate the implementation of

its  fourth five-year Building Programme for  another

150,000 units by 1980. This is absolutely encouraging

as  it  reduces  the  waiting period  for  applicants

wanting to buy or rent HDB flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this pace of development, the quality

aspect  should  not be sacrificed for quantity.  More

emphasis must be laid on the quality of construction.

Presently,  there have been numerous complaints  from

flat  owners  about  the poor  finish.  Fixtures  and

fittings  are  haphazardly  completed.  This   merely

proves  that  there  has been a lack  of  proper  and

vigilant  supervision by HDB which takes over  blocks

of flats from contractors without first conducting  a

full inspection of the flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the problem does not end there. The HDB does

not spell out its instructions clearly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>



to  tenants  in  regard to regulations governing  the

renovation  of  flats. Usually  after  a  tenant  has

completed  renovation  works,  the  bureaucratic  HDB

officers  will  then come to give  a  notice  to  the

tenant  ordering him to reduce the thickness  of  the

flooring  because  the thickness of  the  screed  has

exceeded the maximum allowed by the Board. But at the

time  when application for renovation of the flat  is

made  to  the  Board, the tenant is not  informed  of

certain  restrictions.  However,  when  tenants  make

complaints to the Board about the slipshod work  done

by  the contractors, the HDB officers show no concern

at   all,  except  remarking  that  the  defects  are

minimal. One wonders sometimes why slipshod  work  on

the part of contractors is condoned by the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of the shortcomings of the HDB are

causing  concern  among tenants as well  as  would-be

tenants of H DB accommodation. All these shortcomings

should  not  be  thrusted down  the  throats  of  the

tenants.  Nevertheless, we are proud that  the  HDB's

achievement is second to none in other parts  of  the

world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Chong Tee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Addendum on

the  Ministry of National Development further  states

the emphasis on planning and improving the social and

recreational  facilities, better  infrastructure  and

public amenities in pleasant and gracious environment

in  the  next five years. These are positive measures

which  go  along with the building of  HDB  and  HUDC

flats.  However, we must not forget that  the  rising

cost of leisure is now borne by the general public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the general public, the Government has

established   parks,  swimming  pools  and   lagoons,

zoological  gardens and other scenic spots  like  the

Japanese  and  Chinese gardens  and  have,  at  most,

levied a small fee far within the reach of the common

citizen.  The fee is to cover operating costs.  There

are  some  other places where no fees are  levied  at

all. These exceptions should not be taken for granted

without  regard  to  the funds and  effort  put  into

realizing   these   facilities.  Private   enterprise

establishments which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>



provide entertainment for the general public, such as

the  cinemas, have kept their prices within the reach

of the general public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a fact that nothing is for free, and that all

needs  will  have  to compete with  one  another  for

resources to realise them. Leisure establishments set

up  by  private  enterprises are  required  by  their

owners   to  cover  costs  and  eventually   make   a

reasonable  return on the capital invested.  Citizens

who  wish to patronise these establishments, such  as

nightclubs,  bowling alleys and golf clubs,  must  be

prepared  to  pay for these facilities. In  order  to

take  a  lead in the leisure business, the Government

has  invested  in  leisure enterprises  such  as  the

Sentosa  Golf Club and the Jurong Golf Club  -  these

enterprises are expected to cover not only costs  but

also   to   yield  a  reasonable  return  on  capital

invested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The takeover of the chalets at Sentosa by a local

hotel  has invited comments from the general  public.

According  to the plans of the hotel, the area  will,

be   further  developed  involving  a  large  capital

outlay.  Members of the public have anticipated  that

the  present high rentals of these chalets will  rise

even   further,  beyond  the  reach  of  the   common

Singaporean  who  wishes to  spend  his  vacation  or

weekend there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxurious leisure will always be expensive and

exclusive to those who can and wish to pay for  them.

Simple leisure has yet to be priced out of the  reach

of the common Singaporean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the proliferation of unlicensed

hawkers has been brought under control. Nevertheless,

there  are still hawkers who for some reason are  not

being issued with licences, As a result of this, they

are   constantly  harassed  by  inspectors  from  the

Hawkers  Department. These inspectors swoop  down  on

them  in  the most inhuman way, raiding them  like  a

police  party  raiding a gangster  hideout.  Hawkers,

young and old, have to leave behind their wares,  and

sometimes even their money is scattered all over  the

place, and to run for their lives.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>



Conveniently, the goods are carted away  as  if  they

are contrabands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Chong Tee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these people are

not  criminals  in the true sense of  the  word.  The

hawker  inspectors  are over-zealous  in  discharging

their  duties  in constituencies where  MPs  are  not

Ministers.  [Laughter] Indeed it is  not  a  pleasant

sight  to  watch. One just wonders where  the  seized

goods  have  gone  to thereafter, and  how  are  they

accounted for and disposed of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure my colleagues in this

House    who   face   similar   problems   in   their

constituencies will fully agree with  me  that  there

are  shortcomings  in the Hawkers  Department, which

have caused some aberration and defects that need  to

be   improved.  The  personnel  concerned   must   be

educated, particularly in improving their attitude in

dealing with the public with respect to their work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Motion in the name of the Member

for UIu Pandan.



<br><br>2.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the President in his  speech  at  the

opening  of  this Parliament said that  the  People's

Action  Party has once more been returned  to  power,

securing  some 72.4% of the votes, the  highest  ever

recorded.  With  this overwhelming support,  the  PAP

Government   has   to   exercise   its   power   with

circumspection  and  moderation. The  President  also

said  that  all  major policies and legislation  will

have to be closely scrutinised before implementation.

This  is  quite  to the point, and it  expresses  the

desire  of  the  people.  In fact,  other  than  some

statutory  boards, the legislation of most government

departments  has  been brought up to  Parliament  for

scrutiny and debate. But the problem arises after its

debate  in  Parliament when it is put into  practice.

There will be certain aberrations and inconsistencies

in   the   administrative  process,  where   officers

concerned usually shirk their duty, thinking that  by

doing less fewer mistakes will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>



made,  and  that if they did nothing they  would  not

commit any mistakes at all. So in the end, the voters

will  get nowhere. They would have wasted their  time

and money in dealing with the Government departments.

Officers  in  some  Government departments  are  just

nonchalant in their attitude and keep themselves away

from  their  post.  They make no attempt  to  try  to

understand the problems and the needs of the  people.

Instead    they   cause   the   people    unnecessary

inconvenience. Let me quote some examples. In October

last year, the newspapers stated that one, Chou Tieng

Shiang, living in a HDB flat was suffering from  some

chronic  illness  and could not  work  and  therefore

could not pay his rental. He was subsequently evicted

by  the HDB. When this appeared in the press, members

of the public rallied round to help him. When the HDB

heard  about this, they finally allowed him to return

to  his  flat. The HDB could have been more  tolerant

and  liaised  with the Social Welfare Department  for

help. This illustrates the unsympathetic attitude  on

the part of the HDB.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another occasion, in September last year it was

reported  in  the  newspapers  that  the  HDB  issued

notices to applicants of flats inquiring whether they

would be carrying out renovation works to the kitchen

and  toilet with mosaic. The notice asked for a reply

within 10 days failing which their right to apply for

the  flat would be cancelled. Sir, this is too  harsh

on  them. Many applicants receive the notice late, as

the  date  for  a  reply stamped on  the  notice  has

expired;  if  not,  only a few days  left  to  reply.

Moreover,  the notice `does not state how  much  more

price  they have to pay after such renovation  works.

In  the  end, the applicants are confounded over  the

whole thing and do not know what to do. So they blame

the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our meet-the-people sessions in the various

constituencies  we  find  a  great  number  of   such

complaints.  The attitude of the HDB in dealing  with

such  cases  is  really  too  harsh.  It  should   be

rectified    and    improved.   All    notices    and

administrative action formulated by the HDB should be

considered by Government leaders before promulgation.

We are told that by 1980



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>



about 75% of the population of Singapore, namely  two

million  people,  will be housed in HDB  flats.  They

will  decide in future which Party should be returned

to  power, who will form the government. If we do not

think  about these matters, the consequences  may  be

unsavoury.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps we need not dwell too much on the

efficiency  and ability of Government  officers.  For

instance,  in  January this year a  family  in  Bukit

Merah  was hard-pressed financially. The householder,

an  elderly widow, was a hawker but she was not given

a  licence  to hawk. Being unable to make ends  meet,

the  mother and daughter shut themselves in the  flat

and  burned  themselves to death. This  very  pitiful

incident calls for our attention, however rare it may

be  in  our  society. When the officers  come  across

cases   of  extenuating  circumstances, they  should

inquire  into them and lend a helping hand in getting

them  a  hawker's  licence or  liaising  with  Social

Welfare Department. The people concerned should  also

get  in touch with the MP or the CCC in that area  so

as  to avail themselves of better means to help solve

their problems. However, it is a pity that out of  so

many  thousands of officers in the various Government

departments such as the Hawkers Department, the  HDB,

and  the PUB there was hardly any one who ever  tried

to  come out to study the problems of the unfortunate

people  and to render help to such people who are  in

difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is correct to stress in the Presidential

Address that we must get from each his best and  give

to each according to his performance, since Singapore

is  a tiny island without any natural resources.  Our

only  resource is manpower in spite of our  excellent

geographical  position and rewarding entrepot  trade.

Even the footpath is formed by constant trodding.  So

everything  has to depend on our human resources.  As

we  have  no  other  resources,  our  able  political

leadership  has to mobilise the whole population  and

consolidate their boundless energy and strength  into

a  concerted  effort in nation building and  economic

progress of our country.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a new country. Since her

foundation,  upon  which strenuous efforts  had  been

made, education has been spread quite widely and  the

general  level  of education of the  people  is  also

rising,  hopefully  to a high standard.  But  with  a

short  history  and  a  limited  economy,  we  cannot

produce a greater number of people with a high  level

of  education. Differences in level of education make

for    differences   in   life-style    and    career

expectations,  resulting in  the  fortunate  and  the

unfortunate. The few fortunate people can  enjoy  the

benefits of higher education and reap greater wealth.

They  are  the ones who are better able  to  give  of

their  best  with higher performance, and of  course,

they  get higher rewards. The others, however, those

unfortunate  ones with poor education  and  who  come

from  poorer families who have been toiling hard  all

their lives contributing their best, because of their

circumstances  and  without  the  benefit  of  higher

education,  still cannot reach the higher bracket  of

reward  according to their performance, however  hard

they exert themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, so far we have issued hundreds of thousands of

work  permits  to foreign labourers to  work  in  our

industries.  In  the long run, are  we  sure  whether

foreign  labour will serve our national interest,  or

will  they  not bring about more social problems  and

other  burden  to us? There is a saying  that  rather

than  depend  on  others, we  should  depend  on  our

ownselves. For long term social security and  in  the

interest  of our nationals, we should look  into  the

reasons why our own citizens do not want to join  the

labour  force. Perhaps we should improve the  working

conditions of the workers. Why should certain workers

be  required  to work 30 days a month,  while  others

only 24 days? Why can we not allow certain categories

of  workers to be paid monthly and to let them  enjoy

the  same working conditions as others? There  should

not  be any discrimination in the labour force.  Sir,

each  one of us must contribute our best in order  to

get the reward according to our worth. We should also

try our best for rewards



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>



according  to our labour, so that better  recognition

may  be given to the importance of the labourers, who

are  the  less fortunate lot, in our nation building.

We  should  create an amiable environment and  better

working  conditions for all workers so that they  may

enjoy  a  better  livelihood and the good  things  in

life,  so  that  they can be proud of themselves.  We

should  enable all our nationals who are contributing

to  the  Central  Provident  Fund  to  utilise  their

contributions to buy their own flats and be contented

with   their  lot,  so  that  they  could  think   of

themselves  as  part-owners  of  Singapore  and  feel

secure  and  happy living in Singapore.  Perhaps, we

should go a step further by making a survey of  their

monthly  needs,  how much they spend  a  month  on  a

family  of  four or five members so as  to  determine

their  cost  of  living.  On  this  basis  we  should

formulate  their monthly wages so that they  may  get

the  necessary  means for their basic livelihood  and

survival, adapting themselves to the environment  and

be happy and contented in their career and their lot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on behalf of my constituents, I thank the

President for his Address.



<br><br>3.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Encik Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ahmad Haleem (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Motion

moved  by  the  Member for Ulu Pandan expressing  our

thanks  to  the  President for the  speech  which  he

delivered on behalf of the Government at the  opening

of the First Session of this Parliament.



The  world is currently experiencing an energy crisis

and  governments  are greatly concerned  with  energy

resources  and  their management.  Unfortunately,  in

Singapore, we  have no coal, oil, timber  or  hydro-electrical

energy; therefore, we have to be extremely

careful  not  to  waste these increasingly  expensive

resources.  From  time  to  time  there   have   been

campaigns over the press, radio and television urging

the  public to save power and electricity. We  should

look  for  as  many ways as possible to reduce  power

consumption,  whilst still meeting the needs  of  our

citizens. I believe. Sir, that there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>



is  a  way to do this. It is simple and the  cost  is

minimal.  I  am, Sir, talking about Daylight  Saving.

This  easy-to-implement device could be brought  into

effect by advancing the clock by one hour at midnight

on  a  chosen  day.  It  will cause  the  minimum  of

inconvenience as, apart from advancing the  clock  by

one  hour, there will be no other changes in our time

schedule.  Dawn  will then be at six o'clock  in  the

morning instead of at five o'clock and sunset at 7.30

in  the evening instead of at 6.30. These are some of

the areas where power consumption would be reduced by

the  introduction of Daylight Saving - in our  homes,

in   public   places,   sports  facilities,   lighted

advertisements, and in industries running a two-shift

system.  Side benefits from implementing this  scheme

are  many.  Our  people, who are being encouraged  to

take   part  in  all  forms  of  sports  and  outdoor

activities,  would have an extra hour of daylight  in

the  evenings,  in  which to better  enjoy  the  many

excellent facilities which are being set up for  this

purpose. One benefit that I foresee and which, to  my

mind,  is  very important is that parents  and  their

children will have an additional hour of daylight  in

which they can enjoy family games and recreation  out

of  doors, to kick a ball or like one Member  of  the

House  told  me. "to fly a kite", and so do  much  to

further good parent/child relationship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internationally, our advancing the clock by one

hour  should  be  just  a minor  adjustment  for  our

trading  partners to make. With the  introduction  of

Daylight Saving, all school fields could be opened up

after  school, and football fields and all the  games

courts  would  be better used. Even if  these  spaces

were made available to our people they would still be

insufficient to meet our needs. I, therefore, welcome

the  Sports  Council Master Plan for the building  of

squash  and  tennis courts, swimming pools,  football

pitches,  fitness parks and the multi-purpose  indoor

stadia.  Unfortunately, I feel that the Master  Plan,

for  the  most  part,  caters for  the  "have's"  and

neglects  the "have-not's". You will notice  most  of

the    facilities   are   revenue-generating.    This

immediately  eliminates  our  younger  citizens   who

cannot pay but whose needs for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>



open  fields  and games courts should be  recognised.

They  need  more facilities where team games  can  be

played,  spontaneously, and  where  easy  mixing  and

integration  of  our  people will  be  encouraged.  I

disagree with the Sports Council's rationale in their

Sports  for All policy where the emphasis is on  mass

participation and they do not feel the need to aim at

producing champions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is human nature that the presence of a champion

leader  encourages  others to  follow.  The  case  of

badminton is a good example of this. In the 50's when

the  standard of our players then taking part in  the

Thomas Cup and the All England Championship was  very

high, badminton was extremely popular. The popularity

of  badminton has greatly waned, now that we  are  no

longer  producing champions. In the same way,  if  we

wish   to  popularise  other  sports  and  get   more

participants, we must also produce champions  in  all

fields. Every schoolboy wants to be a Pele or a  Mark

Spitz.  Our constituency games also are not  popular.

For  many constituencies the reasons they are  unable

to   produce  good  teams  are  lack  of  money   and

facilities.  I am not advocating paying  participants

to  take  part in sports. Far from it. I am  entirely

against this policy, but in order to produce  a  good

side   it   is  necessary  to  hold  regular   intra-constituency

tournaments and to arrange many practice

sessions. All these require facilities and money.  It

is  unfair and undesirable for the constituency to go

around   asking  their  constituents   for   frequent

donations. Therefore, I suggest that the constituency

sports  rules be amended to allow for sponsorship  by

business  firms.  Of course, when a company  sponsors

the  sports in the constituency, they would  like  to

see a return for their money. We should allow players

to  use  the firm's logos on their jerseys.  In  this

way,  both parties will benefit. I would still expect

the  grant  from  the  Sports  Council  to  continue.

because  every  cent that can be gathered  will  help

immensely towards the promotion of sports.  I  should

also like to see our champions and gold medal winners

who  represent  Singapore and  bring  honour  to  our

country, rewarded by giving them priority



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>



allocation for housing. Anyone who knows and sees the

long hours of practice a winner must put in, will not

begrudge him this privilege.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board should build more

sports   facilities  in  their  estates.   When   the

Government  was first considering how to  tackle  the

problem of' resettling large numbers of our citizens,

their  primary concern, and rightly so, was to  build

housing  units  as  fast  as possible.  We  have  now

reached   a  stage  where  quantity  alone   is   not

sufficient  to  meet the total needs of  our  people.

Their physical needs are well catered for in spacious

and  sanitary housing, shops and markets, clinics and

other services. Now is the time to consider how  best

to  meet  their  emotional needs  to  bring  about  a

healthy   sense   of   integration   in   their   new

environment,  Open  spaces in the estates  should  be

converted  into  children's  playgrounds,  games  and

family  recreation  areas.  It  is  insufficient   to

provide  new parks in selected areas because  parents

would much prefer their children to play nearer their

homes,  to  kick a ball around, scream and shout  and

allow healthy daily outlets for their natural drives.

If  immediate  provision is not found for  expressing

these drives, they will be suppressed, and we will be

facing a generation of maladjusted young citizens  in

the  near  future. Drug problems and other  unhealthy

manifestations of this repression will most certainly

increase  by  leaps and bounds. Apart from  providing

play  areas,  all  housing  estates  should  have   a

community  centre  built at  the  same  time  as  the

housing units. Citizens should not have to wait until

sufficient   money   has  been  accumulated   through

donations and fund raising. Of course, improvement to

community centres should be borne by the constituents

but  the basic structure of a community centre  which

would  cost in the region of $400,000 should be borne

by  the  Government,  and this should  be  given  top

priority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1980 the estimated number of people who will

live  in HDB flats will be two million. We do have  a

Zoo where our children can see



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



animals,  both wild and domesticated, but because  of

the  HDB  rule that no pets are allowed and  together

with  the high cost of going to the Zoo, we will very

soon  have  a generation of children who  will  think

that  a chicken comes in a plastic bag. Therefore,  I

strongly  suggest  that  an area,  perhaps  near  the

community  centre,  be  set  aside  where   a   small

menagerie  of  domesticated animals  could  be  kept.

People  moving  into flats for the first  time  often

have  to abandon pets because they can no longer keep

them. This is hard on both pets and their owners. How

much  better  if  they could bring their  pets  to  a

centre  where they could be adopted and looked  after

by  the children of the estate, thereby instilling in

the  young  a  respect and understanding of  animals.

Valuable lessons and attitudes will be inculcated and

will  influence  the  kind of environment  which  our

children will produce in time to come. This would  be

complementary  to our design for a clean,  green  and

healthy Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we build new estates, immediate consideration

should be given to the provision of bus services.  In

the  past, bus services to housing estates only begin

after  the  majority of people have  moved  in.  This

means  that  the  early occupants may  have  to  wait

months,  perhaps years, before adequate bus  services

are provided. This situation should be remedied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the Area Licensing Scheme has

done  much  to reduce road congestion but  a  further

measure  which  should be looked  into  concerns  the

maintenance  of lane discipline. One  only  needs  to

take an hour's drive on Singapore roads to be able to

pick out more than 50 offenders against the rules  of

lane discipline.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe our highway code rule does state that all

motorists should keep left unless overtaking. At  the

moment,  slow moving traffic is seen keeping  to  the

right-hand  lane,  forcing faster moving  traffic  to

overtake  on  the left. No doubt our system  of  road

traffic  management has met with considerable  praise

internationally, but I feel that tighter  control  of

lane   discipline   would  bring  about   even   more

improvement and fast, safer traffic flow.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the situation on our roads is steadily

improving  a  problem has arisen in another  area  of

communications  because of the  transfer  of  lighter

operations from Telok Ayer Basin to Pasir Panjang. At

certain times of the year when the sea there is  very

rough,  our  lightermen experience great difficulties

in  loading and unloading. It would be desirable  and

less  hazardous to have a bigger breakwater at  Pasir

Panjang  wharves to allow our lighters  to  load  and

unload in calmer waters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for security in our ports is unquestioned

but  the  very strict ruling applied by the  Port  of

Singapore  Authority  for  the  issue  of  passes  is

causing  hardship  to a number of people.  These  are

people  whose livelihood depends upon going into  the

port  area  and who have suddenly found their  passes

cancelled  because  of some minor  offence  committed

many  years earlier for which they have already  been

punished. They should not be punished again. I  would

therefore  urge  the Port of Singapore  Authority  to

review  their ruling and to reinstate the  passes  of

these  people if they have committed only  one  minor

offence,  not  less than five years  prior  to  their

application. In this way our petty offender  who  has

been going straight will not feel persecuted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point was touched upon by the Member for

Kallang  but  I feel that we do have a  situation  in

Singapore where there are many stateless persons  who

are   blue  identity  card  holders.  In  the   final

analysis, the Singapore Government is responsible for

these  people;  so our objective must  surely  be  to

integrate  and  educate them and to eventually  grant

them  citizenship. When this happens, our  dependence

upon  guest  workers would be less.  At  the  moment,

however,  in  order  to obtain  work,  our  permanent

residents have to obtain a work permit. This  creates

a   situation   where   small   employers   find   it

inconvenient  to employ them and larger  firms  often

cannot  be  bothered.  There  are  also  unscrupulous

employers  who  exploit  the  situation.  I  strongly

suggest  that the Ministry look into the  feasibility

of abolishing work permit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>



requirements  for  our permanent  residents  who  are

stateless persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our citizens have now grown to accept the

desirability of National Service and I know  of  many

young  people who are looking forward to doing  their

duty for their country. There are, however, many  who

are  frustrated because they are not selected  to  do

either full-time or part-time National Service.  They

feel doubly frustrated because not only are they  not

able to discharge their duty, but employers also  are

reluctant to employ them. It is unlikely that  youths

not  selected within one year of attaining their 18th

birthday  will  be selected at a later  date  because

there will be a new batch of eligible young men  each

subsequent  year. I therefore urge the Government  to

look  into  this  question  and  to  consider  either

calling them up for some other form of service or, if

they  are  not  called up by their 19th birthday,  to

grant them deferment, subject to recall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Motion moved by the Member for

Ulu Pandan.



<br><br>3.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the

Motion  moved by the Member for Ulu Pandan expressing

our  thanks to the President for his Speech delivered

at the opening of this Fourth Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President, in his speech, enunciated the

policies  which will be carried out in the next  five

years.  The  people  are enabled  to  understand  the

various  programmes for action and reforms, the  most

important  being  the new measures contained  in  the

various Addenda of the various ministries, which  are

for  the benefit of the people and the nation,  meant

to  inspire  the people to contribute  their  efforts

towards nation building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the general elections last year the people

elected  all  the 69 PAP candidates into this  House.

This  is  a  massive support and trust given  by  the

people  to  the People's Action Party and  they  know

that  although  we have a one-party  Parliament,  the

Members  of Parliament will not do things recklessly.

This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



has also enhanced our responsibility as Backbenchers.

As   Backbenchers,  although  we  are  part  of   the

governing  Party, we have to play  the  role  of  the

opposition  and exercise our right to  criticise  and

supervise  the work of the Government and to  reflect

the  views  of  our constituents so as to  serve  the

people and the nation with dedication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the main feature of the policy

speech  is that in the next five years the Government

will  give  priority to looking after and  developing

the   less   privileged  areas  as  they  need   more

attention. Such policy is both correct and  laudable,

because  to help the well to-do is well and good  but

to  do  some  good  to the poor  and  needy  is  more

significant   of   good  government   and   will   be

appreciated  by the people. Sir, it is gratifying  to

note  that  more  money  will  be  provided  for  the

developmental  needs of the rural areas.  This  means

that  more  laterite  roads will  be  metalled,  more

wooden  bridges will be replaced by concrete  bridges

and  more  country tracks and roads will be  lighted.

Although  the  rural  area has  shrunk  it  is  still

extensive in area and so it needs more money for  the

amelioration of the living environment of the country

folk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what the people in the rural areas find most

distressing  is  the  question  of  resettlement,  as

touched  upon by the Member for Changi. We  all  know

that because of the scarcity of land and the need for

industrialisation,   housing   etc, we   have    to

requisition more land from the rural areas. There  is

nothing wrong with this. Generally, the people in the

rural areas understand this and they are prepared  to

sacrifice  for the long-term interest of the  nation.

Those  who  are  affected by the resettlement  scheme

would  have  to suffer inconvenience as  their  homes

built over the decades have to be abandoned and  they

will  have  to  move to new surroundings.  Everything

will  have  to  start from scratch and afresh.  Those

departments  and  officers involved in  resettlement.

whether  it  be  the Resettlement Department  or  the

Primary  Production Department, must  understand  the

plight of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>



the  people and try, on the one hand, to minimise the

hardship and inconvenience caused to the people  and,

on  the  other  hand,  by  all  means  give  adequate

compensation to the affected people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past few years, at my meet-the-people

sessions  I received  various  complaints

from  the villagers and I have found that there is  a

lack  of  sympathy  on  the part  of  those  who  are

involved  with resettlement affairs. In  most  cases,

the  question  centres on whether  a  person  who  is

engaged in farming activity is a bona fide farmer  or

not.  Those  who are adjudged bona fide  farmers  are

entitled to the allocation of land or alternatively a

free  three-room flat and their compensation rate  is

much  higher.  Those  similarly  engaged  in  farming

activities  who  are not adjudged bona  fide  farmers

will  have to blame their bad luck and look for their

MP  for  help. The officers who wield such peremptory

power  are  not from the Resettlement Department  but

from  the Primary Production Department which has  no

direct connection with the resettlement scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my understanding, the Primary

Production Department goes about adjudging those  who

are  affected, whether they are bona tide farmers  or

not,  not  according to their actual rural  situation

but  superficially on a certain formula  and  certain

figures. If the data provided by a person,  be  he  a

farmer  or not, do not fit into the formula, then  he

is  not  considered a bona fide farmer. It  is  quite

common  to see people in the rural areas engaging  in

farming  activities.  Some of them  are  small  scale

farmers  and  whatever  they  get  is  sufficient  to

support  their  family. Other  families,  because  of

insufficient  income will have to engage  in  certain

farming  activity  to supplement family  income.  But

many  of the younger generation of such families when

they  grow  up  do not intend to remain  farmers  but

would like to go outside to work or join the national

service. Whatever they earn outside is seldom brought

back to support the family. However, their income  is

also  taken  as  a  factor in determining  whether  a

family is a farming family or not. Thus, through such

circumstances, certain village



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



farmers  have  lost their status as farmers,  thereby

losing their right as farmers to such compensation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another general situation is this. When

certain  farmers are given the notice of  acquisition

of  land,  they are also advised to gradually  reduce

their farming activity. Sometimes the census is taken

months afterwards, while actual resettlement may take

place  one to two years later. During this transition

period,  in order to minimise their loss, the farmers

naturally  reduce  their farming activity  gradually.

Other  farmers, having failed in agricultural career,

now  because of lack of capital, have to  stop  their

farming activity for the time being. However, after a

long  wait the notice to quit has still not  arrived,

and  so  because of family livelihood they are forced

to  go  outside to work in order to make  ends  meet.

Such  unlucky farmers will certainly be  adjudged  by

the  Primary  Production Department as non-bona  fide

farmers, the compensation for whom will of course  be

very little



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our society should be a rational and a caring

society. We should be sympathetic to the plight of  a

section  of  the population when they  have  to  make

sacrifices  and are inconvenienced for the  sake of

the  nation  We  should help them  to  restore  their

capacity  to  earn and make a living. High  officials

sitting  in  air-conditioned  rooms  of  the  Primary

Production  Department make decisions  affecting  the

farmers'   fate  mainly  on  the  report   of   their

subordinate officers This causes a slur to the  truth

and clouds the issue. Therefore, to adjudge whether a

farmer  is  bona fide or not, the Primary  Production

Department should base its consideration on  detailed

investigation of the actual circumstances.  Also  the

views  of  the MP of the particular constituency  and

the   Citizens'  Consultative  Committee  should   be

observed before any decision is made. Only then, will

it  be in keeping with the fundamental spirit of  the

policy of the present Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to  express  the  gratitude  of  the  Khe  Bong

electorate to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>



President  for his policy speech on the 8th  February

this year After reading the speech again and again, I

strongly feel that the policy outlined therein  is  a

"universally  acceptable" policy that  provides  100%

safeguard and security for the livelihood of the  two

million  people  of Singapore. In  this  context,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, when the Singapore electorate returned

our  party  to  power, what they want is,  in  short,

security and safeguard for their livelihood. This  is

the only thing they expect of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the President has stated in his policy

speech, there are numerous important problems  facing

our  country,  such as those concerning the  economy,

education, communications, finance, the judiciary and

so  on  and  so  forth, but none more important  than

internal  security.  This  is  because  our   present

situation is at a very critical juncture, and  if  we

do  not  handle it properly, this ship of  ours  will

capsize immediately with all of us swallowed  by  the

huge  waves  when it will be too late to  talk  about

anything, and all of us will not be here,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship I refer to is the present Government of

the  party-in-power; the huge waves are  the  Malayan

Communists and their fellow travellers. They are  our

archenemies.  They jeopardize the peace and  security

of  Singapore  and attempt to seize  power  by  armed

force.  They are the public enemies of the people  of

Singapore -elements who must not be allowed to  exist

for internal security's sake.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, the party-in-power, are not unaware of this

internal danger. For this reason, we have been paying

particular  attention  to the  question  of  internal

security  However,  to be honest about  ourselves.  I

think  what  we  have  done  is  inadequate  and  not

thorough enough either.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The communists are like the all-permeating mercury.

For instance, now only we have found that G. Raman, a

lawyer, is an out-and-out communist; now only  do  we

know  that he has colluded with European and  Malayan

communists in their attempt to overthrow the  elected

Government of Singapore. He became a communist long.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>



long  ago  when he was studying at the University  of

Singapore. At that time he harped on the same  string

as the Malayan communists, but why did he not come to

the  notice of our security authorities then? Why has

our institution of higher learning cultivated such  a

high  level communist intellectual? I wonder if there

is anything wrong with our education system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have friends who teach in the secondary

schools, They told me that today, there are communist

elements  even  in the government secondary  schools.

Such   a  phenomenon  did  not  exist  in  the  past.

Formerly,  communist elements were  found  mostly  in

private  secondary schools. They invariably  did  not

study well. However, the communist students today are

good  in  their  studies. They sport  long  hair  and

pretend to be hippies. They are, in fact, members  of

the  so-called  branch committees of the  underground

Malayan communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend told me two true stories. One happened in

Shanghai  in  1949, when the Nationalist Party,  that

is,  the  Kuo  Mm  Tang, was about to  withdraw  from

Shanghai.  Lo  Lung Chi, an important member  of  the

Democratic League, was arrested by the KMT agent  for

sympathising with the communists. However, as soon as

Shanghai was liberated, the agent who interrogated Lo

immediately invited him out of the prison. Lo was  so

frightened  that his face turned pale.  But  the  man

said,  "Comrade Lo, you have been invited  to  go  to

Peking."  Only  then did the agent disclose  that  he

was,  in fact, a communist underground agent. Do  you

think  we  also have such dangerous elements  in  our

security set-ups?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second story tells about the pre-liberation

Saigon  where the Income Tax Department  was  already

infiltrated  by a Vietcong agent. At that  time,  the

Nguyen  Van Thieu Government did not know about  him.

This  Vietcong agent, who managed to infiltrate  into

the  government department, made use of his  official

position  to make secret attacks on the rightists  so

as to weaken the anti-communist force of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



Saigon  Government. As soon as Saigon was  liberated,

except  for  those  who escaped, those  who  remained

behind  were  arrested  one  by  one  on  information

supplied by this Vietcong agent. Do you think we have

any  Communist  infiltrators in our  tax  department,

postal  service  or  the churches,  particularly  the

choirs?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such is the important work of internal security on

the  lives and properties of the people of Singapore.

We  must, therefore, make sure that the work is  done

well and thoroughly and that there is no loophole  in

it.  Any loophole will mean that all previous efforts

will  have  been wasted. I do not mean to praise  the

communists.  Any communist regime, be it  the  Soviet

Union or China, will carry out a purge every now  and

then.   They   eliminate  undesirable  elements   and

strengthen their regime through purges. If we want to

seek  permanent security and safeguard for the people

of  Singapore, if we wish to ensure that  the  people

enjoy  their rights and happiness, to seek peace  and

progress for society and stability and prosperity for

the  country,  it  is necessary,  I  think,  for  the

Ministry   of  Home  Affairs  to  introduce  measures

whereby  information  can be  gathered  from  various

Government departments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore have once again elected us

to form the government. As has been said by the Prime

Minister,   and  I  quote,  "The  people  are   anti-communist;

they do not want communists." One  danger

facing   Singapore   today  is   internal   communist

subversion against the government. It is in  response

to  the request of the electorate that such a measure

is introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the "Spring and Autumn" period in China

(period  of  feudal  warlords), there  was  a  great

statesman  by the name of Kuan Chung who  once  said,

"Expelling foreign invasion should be preceded by the

maintenance  of internal security." In  other  words,

there   must  be  internal  security  before  foreign

invasion can be checked. Without security what  other

things can we talk about, even saving daylight?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to support the Motion moved

by the Member for Ulu Pandan.



<br><br>3.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok (Boon Teck):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

to  support the Motion of Thanks moved by the  Member

for Ulu Pandan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's speech clearly outlines the

prospects  and  problems  facing  us  today  and  the

framework  of  the general policies and measures  the

Government  intends  to pursue during  the  five-year

term  of  the Fourth Parliament which has  the  solid

support  of the people of Singapore. All of  us  know

that   "soft-options"  must  go  overboard  and  that

realism  must  be the cornerstone of the Government's

policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, three areas on which I would

like  to comment. Firstly, I would like to point  out

that the last 1 2 years have not been easy ones. In 1

965  the  economic and labour climate  was  extremely

distressing. But Labour realised that the  only  road

to  economic  salvation and national  prosperity  was

joint  endeavour  by  the  three  major  partners   -

Government,  Labour and Management - for  the  common

interest of the country; and that none could progress

unless  everyone progressed. By and large, this  has

come  to pass, thanks to the Government's initiatives

and Labour's positive response.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last few years were decidedly difficult years,

particularly  on  the  economic  front,  with  global

inflation  accompanied by a slowdown of the  economy.

The labour movement and the workers responded well to

the  call of the country and contributed, in no small

measure,  to cushion the deleterious effects  of  the

times, unlike trade unions elsewhere, particularly  a

few  of  those in the developed countries where  they

ignored  national  interests and pursued  destructive

policies which generated economic disarray and  heavy

unemployment. Our realism averted such a situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I, at this stage, be

permitted, to quote Dr Goh Keng Swee, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>



Deputy  Prime  Minister and Minister of defence,  who

states  in  his  article  "A Socialist  Economy  that

Works"  published in the book Socialism  that  Works:

The Singapore Way, at page 837 thus:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Collectively, workers formed the most important

organised social group. This must be so in  any  free

society  in which every citizen enjoys voting rights.

Organised  labour  is  important  simply  because  it

represents  the  majority  of  the  electorate.   The

response  of  organised labour to the challenges  and

opportunities in the newly independent  Republic  are

described in detail elsewhere ... Here it suffices to

say that the labour movement took an enlightened long-term

view of their group interests. They were willing

to give the growth policy a chance to succeed."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so we will, Mr Speaker, Sir. What I would like to

stress  here  is that the contributions of  organised

labour, in the past, and in the coming years must not

be forgotten.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area I would like to comment upon, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  is  the Addendum to the  Presidential

Address  on the Ministry of Labour, In the matter  of

industrial  relations. I am glad  to  note  that  the

Ministry  will  take  steps to  further  improve  its

industrial   relations  services   and   set   up   a

departmental  service  to  build  up   a   corps   of

experienced labour and industrial relations officers.

Prevention and settlement of industrial disputes  are

not  just  matters of law and forms.  It  requires  a

deeper   insight  of  the  philosophy  of  industrial

relations,  of winning the confidence of the  parties

involved  and  producing eventually,  acceptable  and

reasonable  settlements. Not only experience  but  an

attitude  of  equanimity must be developed.  I  would

like  to  cite an example to underscore what  I  have

said. The recent NWC recommendations gave rise  to  a

welter  of  interpretations,  counter-interpretations

and  misinterpretations and confusion ran galore,  so

much  so that a call had to be made to reconvene  the

National  Wages  Council. It  is  true,  Sir,  Labour

representatives    were    signatories     to     the

recommendations which, in any case, could only  spell

out   broad   guidelines.  But  the  rub   was   that

implementing  them  became  a  problem  because   the

present  officials, most of whom had, as I would  put

it, no previous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



"labour  background", could not differentiate between

the  wood  and the tree, or more precisely  were  and

still  are  unable to reconcile practice with  policy

and  to  translate  policy into practice  justly  and

equitably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area I would like to touch on is

productivity.  There  are  disparate  views  on  what

productivity is, how productivity measurements are to

be  worked  out and who should carry the productivity

"baby".  A  clear indication of lopsided concepts  is

the editorial in The Manufacturer, of January 1977, a

publication    of    the   Singapore   Manufacturer's

Association.    This   editorial   illustrates    the

inadequate   perception   of   Singapore's   economic

intricacies  and  the  complexities  surrounding  the

productivity   issue.  The  basic  premise   of   the

editorial  is  that  "there appears  to  be  a  basic

assumption   that   manufacturing   productivity   in

Singapore  has  already reached optimum  levels".  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  as  far  as  the  trade  unions   are

concerned, no such assumption has ever been  made  by

them,  On  the  contrary, Labour leaders consistently

emphasise the need to help our industries reach  full

production capacity. They know that it is  only  when

industries  are strong the workers will benefit.  The

SMA  editorial was, therefore, an assumption  of  the

existence of another assumption which in fact was not

there at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the National Productivity Board

should  not just continue, as in the past, to promote

the   concept  of  productivity.  The  Board   should

concentrate   more   on  working   out   productivity

measurement  techniques  for  industries  and   show,

plainly  to those faltering minds in our midst,  that

tangible results are achievable.

<br><br><!-- Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to associate

myself with my colleagues in supporting the Motion of

Thanks  to the President for his speech delivered  at

the  opening  of  the  First Session  of  the  Fourth

Parliament.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the policy speech, I wish to dwell on the

subject of redevelopment projects carried out by  the

Government which affect many kampongs. I am convinced

that  the  Government's intention is  extremely  good

because it affords an opportunity to a great majority

of people in Singapore to own their own homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is a minority group of people in

Singapore who are deprived of this opportunity on the

ground  that they hold Singapore blue identity cards.

Although they claim birth in Singapore, as stated  on

their  identity cards, however, they  are  unable  to

produce documentary evidence as they have lost  their

birth  certificates  and neither  can  they  remember

their  birth  dates. This is one of the  reasons  why

they have failed to obtain extracts from the Registry

of  Births. Subsequently, they were advised to  apply

for  citizenship. Unfortunately, amongst  them  there

are  people who have waited three to four  years  for

approval  and  yet their applications have  not  been

approved,  even  until the time when  their  dwelling

houses   are  affected  by  Government  redevelopment

projects. They have inherited these houses from their

parents,  and  they have been in physical  occupation

from  time immemorial. Upon acquisition by Government

for   redevelopment   they  were   paid   ex   gratia

compensation   only  but  they   were   not   offered

alternative accommodation. May I ask: where are these

families going to stay? Can we just sit tight and see

these  people  made  homeless?  They  were  born   in

Singapore  and they have no other country  to  go  to

where  they can take up permanent residence. Can  the

Government   not   give  special   consideration   to

clearance  families that I have cited?  Although  the

number  of  families is small, we  must  nevertheless

show  justice to these people whose living conditions

have  been  adversely  affected  in  consequence   of

Government policies.

Member for Ulu Pandan.



<br><br>3.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

in support of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



the  Motion moved by the hon. Member for Ulu  Pandan,

expressing our thanks to the President for the speech

he  delivered  on  behalf of the  Government  at  the

opening of the First Session of this Parliament  last

week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The much-awaited 1976 General Elections have come

and  gone. The PAP's overwhelming victory in all  the

69  constituencies has proved beyond  any  doubt  the

sophistication and growing political awareness of our

people.   The   fantasy-peddling   tactics   of   the

opposition  parties  just did not  work.  Present-day

Singaporeans  are not easily beguiled  by  the  false

pretences   and  empty  promises  of  the  opposition

parties.  The disclosures of pro-communist activities

in  Singapore  underline the  need  for  a  political

leadership  that is vigilant and discriminating  when

dealing  with communist subversion. This, the  people

know, can be found only in the PAP Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the General Elections are over, the

opposition  parties have gone into  hibernation  once

again - only to be awakened, perhaps, in 1981 by  the

fanfare  of the next General Elections. No one  hears

from   the  rather  pitiful  Harbans  Singh  anymore!

Perhaps his inglorious defeat in Tanjong Pagar by  Mr

Lee  Kuan Yew has rendered him speechless - a  defeat

which  was  not unexpected even to his own  daughter.

Where  is J.B. Jeyaretnam now! Silenced too,  perhaps

by:

<pre>

 `Rat-catcher Fong Sip Chee

  Whose "good catch" on Dec 23

  Led PAP to victory

  In the fight at Kampong Chai Chee.'

</pre>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  it has been 22  years  since  the

People's Action Party was founded and 17 years  since

the   PAP  was  first  voted  into  office   as   the

Government.  A great deal has happened,  both  inside

and outside Singapore, since then.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is still too early in the year to talk

of 1977. But certainly the world of 1976 was a vastly

different  place from what it was 22 years  ago.  The

leaders in the PAP were right in believing that a non-Communist

democratic socialist party could  win  the

hearts and minds of the masses. History has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



proved  them  right. The results  of  the  last  five

General  Elections  in  Singapore  since  1959   bear

testimony to this belief. They were equally right  in

their  belief that there could be no long-term social

cohesion in a multi-racial society except by building

a    national    identity   based   on   non-communal

nationalism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our independence in 1965, we have all strived

to  ensure that Singapore survives and prospers.  Our

past  12  years  and  indeed our  future  prospects

confirm that what makes a nation thrive is more  than

just the total sum of natural resources. What makes a

people into a nation is a sense of common purpose and

shared destiny.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While much has been achieved by Singapore in the

last 12 years, much more still remains to be done. We

must  continue  to  strive  with  enormous  capacity,

pragmatism,  and energy to bring further improvements

into the quality of human life in the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent events in the region and in Singapore have

indicated   that  the  Communists  were   insidiously

working   for  a  possible  take-over  of  Peninsular

Malaysia  and  Singapore. These  incidents  show  the

extent   of   the  danger  we  face  from  subversive

activities of the Communists, We glimpsed the  spread

of  their  network, here and abroad, the machinations

of   their   strategies,  and  the  depth  of   their

penetrations  into every sector and racial  group  of

our society. This chilling evidence of their presence

and activity must strengthen our resolve to fight the

Communist threat with every means in our power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communists would resort to whatever means

available to further their ends. The change of regime

in  Indo-China has undoubtedly inspired them further,

At  the  Non-Aligned Summit Conference in  Sri  Lanka

last year, Laos backed by Vietnam openly declared its

support  for communist insurgency in Southeast  Asia.

Prince  Souphanouvong, in his public attack on  ASEAN

at    this   Conference,   reiterated   the   Laotian

determination to work in solidarity with Vietnam  and

Cambodia " .., to contribute to the struggles to make

the  countries  of Southeast Asia truly  independent,

peaceful,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>



and  non-aligned"  - implying, therefore,  that  only

those  countries  in Southeast Asia  under  Communist

rule  are "truly" independent or peaceful; the others

are  not!  One  has  only  to  look  around,  at  the

escalation  of Thailand's border problems  with  Laos

and Cambodia and the recent intrusions by Khmer Rouge

into  Thailand in which 30 Thai civilians,  including

women and children, were massacred by the Cambodians,

to  see  Souphanouvong's words dissolve in a pool  of

blood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, because of our political stability,

social   development,  and  economic  progress,   the

Communists  have  found it exceedingly  difficult  to

manoeuvre. But it would be naive to believe that  the

Communists would not resort to other means  in  their

efforts to grab power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> may still recall that some time in

1976,  the  Government exposed a  Communist  plot  to

infiltrate and exploit top intellectuals of the upper-middle

echelon. And indeed as the President  pointed

out, the Communists would continue to manipulate  our

misguided  student leaders, like Tan  Wah  Plow,  and

equally  misguided professionals like "Euro-red  link

man"  G.  Raman  who,  as  hon.  Members  know,   was

responsible  for supplying distorted  information  on

the  political and social conditions in Singapore  to

justify  the  expulsion of the People's Action  Party

from the Socialist International.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here I would like to correct, if I may, the

hon.  Member  for  Khe  Bong G.  Raman  received  his

communist indoctrination when he was reading  law  in

one  of  the  Inns in London. There  he  met  Malcolm

Caldwell, Amir Dastan and Utrecht. He did not receive

his  university  education  from  the  University  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another attempt which came to light last year,

the  Communists  embarked on  a  scheme  designed  to

create  discontentment and despair among  the  Malays

and  to  influence  them  towards  Communism  as   an

acceptable   solution   to  the   so-called   "Malay"

problems. To achieve this, the Communists



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>



adopted  a  strategy which included the softening  of

the   Malay  ground  for  Communist  ideas  and   the

diminishing of their faith in Islam.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to protect the Singapore that we

have  built  for  ourselves, our  children, and  our

children's  children founded on justice and  equality

for all irrespective of race and religion, we must by

resolute  action,  safeguard  the  interests  of  the

nation,  people, and society. Let us, as  all  loyal

Singaporeans should do, rally behind and  extend  our

full cooperation to the Government.



<br><br>4.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng San (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion

thanking  the  President for his speech delivered  on

8th February, 1977.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Presidential address points out that the

Government  holds firm the simple truth that  to  get

from  each his best, rewards and recognition must  go

to  those who consistently excel in high performance.

This   will  encourage  the  workers  to  work   more

diligently  and to lead better lives.  On  the  other

hand,  it will also stimulate our economic growth  so

that   our  products  can  be  more  competitive   on

international  market. The Government  will  allocate

more funds for the setting up of training centres  to

train  our workers in higher skills so as to  prepare

them  for precision work. This will directly  improve

the  skills and standard of our workers so  that  the

quality  of  our  products will be  better  and  more

sophisticated. In the end, our products will be  more

competitive in the international market. The training

of our workers should ensure that it will achieve the

objects  envisaged.  That  is,  the  workers   should

acquire  higher skill to enable them to do  precision

work.  On  the  other  hand we should  look  out  for

employers  who  abuse the name  of  training  by  not

actually giving adequate training to the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is stated in the Presidential address that the

Ministry of Labour:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`will continue to work with unions and employers to

contribute  to economic growth through the  promotion

of  a  stable  and peaceful industrial  climate, the

fostering of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>



a   disciplined  and  productive  workforce  and  the

safeguarding of the welfare, safety and health of our

workers.'



<br><br>This  is  good news to our workers as it will  enable

our  workers to have a better and more stable  living

and  to  enjoy their family life. This will  lead  to

industrial   peace  thus  encouraging  our   economic

development  and advancing us towards the  target  of

tripartism.  With  tripartite  co-operation  of   the

Government, Employer and Labour, we shall be able  to

struggle  for  our  economic  development  so  as  to

realise   our  objectives  of  nation  building.   In

addition  to giving protection and safeguard  to  the

well-being,  security and health of  our  workers.  I

feel  that  if the facilities and measures  could  be

extended  to cover also the fields of recreation  and

sports, then our workers will be able to lead  better

lives and be more contented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Productivity Board will strengthen its work to

promote   the  productivity  of  workers, and   will

formulate  programmes  for such  purpose.  Generally,

employers always regard higher productivity as a duty

on  the  part of the workers. They expect workers  to

work  harder and still harder, but neglect to improve

the  method of work and the tools of production.  The

Productivity Board should therefore get the employers

to   improve  the  method  of  work  and   tools   of

production. The Board should also formulate incentive

schemes for the workers to raise their productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years bus transport has improved

significantly. We must thank the Government  for  its

effort.  It is also the result of sincere cooperation

between capital and labour. In the past few years the

Singapore Industrial Labour Organisation has improved

the  working  conditions of bus workers.  As  we  all

know,  the bus workers have to get up very early  for

the  morning shift duties. Usually they will have  to

get  up at 4.00 or 5.00 am. They will have to retire,

if  on night shift, in the small hours of the day  at

one   or  two  o'clock.  Their  duty  is  to  provide

commuters  with  safe and comfortable service.  Until

the   mass  rapid  transit  system  is  set  up,  the

Singapore  Bus Service Ltd, will continue to  be  the

mainstay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>



of our public transport system. In order to raise the

standard  of service, the Government should therefore

consider  setting  up canteens  and  toilets  at  bus

terminals for the convenience of bus workers. Also to

facilitate  industrial workers and to encourage  more

blue  collar workers, the Government should  consider

asking   the  Company  to  provide  more   buses   in

industrial   areas   during  peak   hours   for   the

convenience  of  the workers to travel  to  and  from

work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to encourage more women to join the labour

force, all  private organisations and  trade  unions

should not shirk the responsibility of building their

own  creches for the care of children to help working

mothers. The NTUC has been negotiating to take over a

creche  in  Toa  Payoh, while SILO has already  taken

over a creche at Kallang Bahru for this purpose.  The

other  organisations, whether private, industrial  or

employers,  should  also  contribute  to  our  social

welfare   undertakings.  Therefore,  the   Government

should   encourage  these  organisations  to  respond

actively  in  supporting, taking over or establishing

creches.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I would like to join my colleagues  in

this  House  to  thank the President for  his  speech

delivered at the opening of the First Session of  the

Tuesday, 8th February, 1977



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the People's Action Party again won all the 69

seats  in the recent General Elections held  on  23rd

December. 1976. This clearly shows that the people of

Singapore will only vote for the party that cares for

them  and  has the capability to solve all political,

economic,  industrial and employment  problems.  They

know  that the PAP's leadership is honest, dedicated,

efficient, incorruptible, and has the experience  and

capacity   to   maintain   political   and   economic

stability. The PAP will ensure industrial peace  with

justice.  It  will  do its best  to  attract  foreign

investors   to  build  new  factories   and   further

expansion  of their industries. It will  create  more

jobs for the young people and to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



better the standard of living. So long as there is co-operation

and  understanding  between   Government,

Labour  and  Management, we can achieve  success  and

solve many problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I touch on the Addendum to the

Presidential Address on the Ministry of  Labour.  The

NTUC,  the Union leaders and the workers fully  agree

that  future  wage increases have to be  orderly  and

related  to higher productivity and economic  growth.

Also  fringe  benefits  which  are  bizarre  or   not

conducive  to  economic  progress  will  have  to  be

discontinued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since 1968 the workers of Singapore have been

very  reasonable in their wage demand and  they  only

improve   some   of  the  fringe  benefits   whenever

necessary.  The workers in Singapore have been  under

the  good  leadership  of Mr.  CV.  Devan  Nair,  the

Secretary-General  of  NTUC,  and  through  his  wise

guidance, the workers fully appreciate the importance

of   national  interest  rather  than  individual  or

sectional interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the negotiations for new collective

agreements  have been negotiated with the  spirit  of

"give-and-take"  with  mutual understanding  and  co-operation.

Industrial relations between employers and

labour  have  been  good. The number  of  strikes  in

Singapore for several years has been a few only.  The

workers   in   Singapore  have  gone   through   many

sacrifices,  such  as  wage restraint,  reduction  of

fringe  benefits,  limitation  of  bonus  payment  or

Annual   Wage  Supplement,  etc.  However,   whenever

employers   manage  to  expand  their  business   and

increase production with better profits, they  should

not   forget  to  give  better  bonus  or  reasonable

incentive payment to the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on December 30th, Mr Ong Pang Boon, the

Minister  for Labour, said that the next  session  of

the  National  Wages Council would probably  have  to

consider and deliberate that offsetting, now confined

to  salary  increases,  should  cover  all  forms  of

remuneration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the workers are quite concerned with the NWC's

intention   to   offset  to  cover   all   forms   of

remuneration.  In other words, the  workers  have  to

make   a   sacrifice   again.  Workers   are   asking

themselves:  how  many times more have  they  got  to

sacrifice.  There  has to be a limit  in  asking  the

workers to sacrifice. In fact, the wages they get are

just  enough to feed their families. Married  workers

who  earn  less than $400 a month find difficulty  in

making  both ends meet, and there is hardly  anything

left  for them to save. I hope the NWC will take note

of  this important point when they come to the  final

decision on offsetting which may include all forms of

remuneration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, Sir, instead of always looking to the

direction  of the workers who are in the  middle  and

lower  income  brackets, the Government  should  also

request the higher income bracket of workers who  are

in  the Managerial, and Executive levels to make some

sacrifice and follow the good examples of the workers

who earn much less.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is necessary that an amendment be

made  to  the  Employment (Amendment) Act,  1975,  in

respect of the payment of the annual wage supplement.

The  employers are paying the annual wage  supplement

allowable  by  law, but they have  to  apply  to  the

Minister  for Finance to pay an amount in  excess  of

that  allowed by law to make up the total  amount  of

annual  wage  supplement.  In  other  words,  if  the

employers refuse to apply to the Minister for Finance

to  approve the payment of the annual wage supplement

in  excess  of  what is allowed by the law,  although

they  have  negotiated with the  unions  on  the  new

quantum  of  the annual wage supplement,  the  Labour

Ministry will be powerless to compel them to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to prevent some employers from

abusing the law, and some have already done so, may I

suggest   that  the  payment  of  the   annual   wage

supplement  should  be based on  the  quantum  agreed

between the employers and the unions during the  year

1976, subject to a maximum amount equivalent to three

months'  wages of the employees. This will also  save

the trouble and inconvenience to the Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>



Finance to approve so many cases of this nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in the event an employer finds that the

trading  results are lacking in a significant degree,

he  may  invite the union to negotiate  for  a  lower

quantum  of the annual wage supplement to be paid  to

the  employees.  May I suggest that an  amendment  be

made  so that if the trading results of the employers

are  good and show substantial profit, the union  has

the right to invite the employers to pay for a higher

quantum of the annual wage supplement. This should be

done in fairness to the workers. The employers should

not  be  given the privilege to enjoy two  pieces  of

cake,  while  the workers have no choice  of  picking

except  to  keep on sacrificing. I believe  sacrifice

for the national interest should be a two-way traffic

between  the employers and the workers, and not  just

on the workers all the time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now refer to the Addendum on the Ministry of

National Development. I am glad that it will plan and

work towards better housing with improved social  and

recreational  facilities, better  infrastructure  and

public amenities in pleasant and gracious environment

in the next five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy that under the fourth Five-Year Building

Programme another 150,000 units will be completed  by

1980.  An additional 10,000 flats will be built  in

the Central Area to help reverse the population drift

to  the  new towns. Also applicants will not have  to

wait  longer than 1 to 1 1/2 years to buy or  rent  HDB

flats.  I  am  sure applicants of HDB flats  will  be

happy  to know that they have to wait for 1  to  1 1/2

years instead of two to three years as at present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Addendum on the Prime Minister's Office

truly  stated that the people of Singapore  have  the

will to succeed and they support the Government in  a

national  effort to solve the apparently  unsolvable.

In  the  last General Elections in Singapore on  23rd

December,  1976,  the  workers  of  Singapore   fully

supported the PAP Government. The workers have agreed

to   subordinate  individual  interest  to   national

interest and to ensure that Singapore will not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>



go down. The present industrial peace with only a few

strikes  a  year  and the tripartite  cooperation  of

labour,  management  and government  will  definitely

help  Singapore  to  solve various  problems  and  to

succeed in everything we do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the Addendum on the Ministry of

Finance,  I fully agree that we should make Singapore

grow  fast again, more manufacturing as well  and  no

extravagance  in public sector expenditure.  However,

it  is necessary to spend more money in training  the

young  workers to acquire higher skills for delicate,

precision  work. Also, I hope all the ASEAN countries

will  concentrate  on rapid economic  growth  through

mutual  economic  cooperation to  implement  all  the

agreed major industrial projects as soon as possible.

These industrial projects for all the ASEAN countries

will  give  more jobs to the people and better  their

standard  of  living  and will  bring  political  and

economic  stability in the ASEAN  region  which  will

convince  the ASEAN people that the ASEAN  democratic

way  of  life  is  just  as  good  as  the  communist

countries  or  even  better than  theirs.  We  always

believe  and  treasure the importance of  freedom  of

speech; freedom to learn and use whatever language we

like;   freedom   to   enjoy  the  various   cultural

activities of several countries; freedom of  worship;

and the freedom to be a multi-millionaire if you have

the  capacity  to do so. I can assure the  people  of

Singapore  that  those  who  have  been  to   various

countries in Asia, Europe and America will  say  that

life  in  Singapore  is very good  and  just  like  a

paradise. This is my personal opinion after  visiting

these countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I comment on the Addendum on the Ministry

of  Defence.  There is no doubt that  the  people  of

Singapore  fully endorse the policy of the  Singapore

Government to carry on national service for our young

people.  To  preserve our independence,  we  must  be

prepared to defend our own country by our own people.

The  lesson the people of Singapore should understand

is  that even America could not defend South Vietnam.

If the people of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  are  well  trained  to  defend  their  own

country  and  have the courage and will to  fight  to

win,  should there be any foreign aggression, we will

definitely win.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the fall of South Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos

to   the   communists,  all  ASEAN   countries   must

strengthen   their   own  defence   and   have   full

cooperation. I fully support the ASEAN philosophy  to

be  friends to all countries in the world,  including

the  communist  countries and not to  let  any  great

power  make use of ASEAN countries as a pawn and,  if

possible, to have no enemies at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully agree with the views expressed in the

Addendum  on the Ministry of Communications  on  road

transport. I travel by bus daily and I wish to record

my appreciation and satisfaction of the Singapore Bus

Service  Ltd, for their improved service  during  the

last  two years. Of course, there is room for further

improvement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest that more female bus drivers be

trained and put into the service, I observe that  the

male  bus  drivers  are  more impatient  than  female

drivers.  Also,  it is a fact that conductresses  are

doing  just  as good as the conductors. However,  all

the  employees of the Singapore Bus Service are doing

their best and my thanks and appreciation go to  most

of the bus workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the Addendum on the Ministry of

Social Affairs, I am glad that priority will be given

to  the  welfare  of  the young, the  aged  and  the

strengthening  of the family unit. I  would  like  to

urge  the Government to be more generous and to allot

more  money  in  the  next Budget  to  this  Ministry

although it is not a money-making one, like  the  PUB

or  the  Income  Tax Department. Most  of  the  young

people   become  delinquents  as  a  result  of   the

negligence  of their parents who simply do  not  care

for  them, The rich father is interested in  business

and  making  more money whereby he has  to  entertain

business  friends in night clubs, cabarets or  having

the maximum enjoyment. The rich mother plays mahjong,

gambles and goes shopping. The poor father and mother

who earn small



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



wages  and who have no means of enjoying any kind  of

entertainment, however, would maintain their capacity

in  human production by bringing in a new baby  every

year. For such irresponsible parents, they bring more

suffering  and  misery  to themselves  and  to  their

children.  Rich  and  poor parents,  therefore,  must

spare  some time to guide their children to  be  good

and  useful  citizens, and also  to  practise  family

planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish I could have more time to

speak  on  the  other  Addenda  to  the  Presidential

Address,  but  in fairness to my colleagues  in  this

House, they should be given an opportunity to express

their views and opinions. I would like to end here by

saying  that  the  people  of  Singapore  are   fully

satisfied with the programmes and policies of the PAP

Government  which are set out in the Addenda  to  the

Presidential. Address to Parliament on  Tuesday,  8th

February,  1977.  The  Addenda  spell  out  what  the

Government  proposes to do in the fields  of  finance

and economics, social and medical services, education

and  defence. I am sure we will be able to fulfil all

the  programmes and policies by 1981 or earlier which

means that in the next General Elections in 1981, the

so-called  opposition parties will have no chance  to

win   a  seat  in  Parliament.  They  can  come  into

Parliament  provided  they  can  do  what   the   PAP

Government  has been doing or if they can  do  better

than us. I believe it is not possible for them to  do

so  and the people of Singapore have no confidence in

them.  So  there  will be no MP from  the  opposition

parties again.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, I suspend the Sitting now and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I

sit and listen to my learned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>



colleagues here these two days, I could not but  feel

and see the difference in the Backbenches as compared

to  my  last two terms as a Backbencher.  We  have  a

number of new faces and we also have an unprecedented

number  of  Ph.Ds.  I  counted and  found  there  are

altogether seven of them; a line up which I  am  sure

compares  most favourably with any other  legislature

in  the  world. However, it is perhaps  pertinent  to

remind  hon. Members that the reason all of  us  from

the  same party are here today is not because of  the

number of Ph.Ds, or doctors that we have been able to

parade  before our people but because for  1  7  long

years  the  first  generation  of  PAP  leaders  have

dedicated the best part of their lives to working for

the  well-being of the people of Singapore, and they,

the  people  of Singapore, have in turn  shown  their

confidence,  if  not appreciation,  in  no  uncertain

manner by voting solidly for the PAP.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By entrusting the entire Parliament to us, our

people  have demonstrated once again their  faith  in

our  ability to continue to exercise self-control and

self-discipline both as a political party  and  as  a

government. They have demonstrated that they  believe

in  our  ability to continue to work for a more  just

and equal society, to maintain law and order, and  to

ensure social, economic and political stability. What

we say here, will, I feel sure, be followed with ever

greater   interest,  as  the  constituents  that   we

represent  today  are much better educated,  informed

and more sophisticated politically than say, five  or

10  years  ago.  They are keenly conscious  of  their

rights.   At  the  slightest  suggestion  of   unjust

exploitation or unfair treatment, they expect  us  to

come  to  their defence. As Backbenchers we shall  be

failing  in  our  duty if we are insensitive  to  the

feelings on the ground. Let us voice the opinions  of

the  people without constraint or inhibition. Let  us

not  treat  this  Chamber as a place  for  expounding

academic theories which are best suited for scholarly

seminars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years ahead we have been reminded that it is

our  duty  at the Backbench to ensure that  no  major

policy or legislation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>



be  passed without the closest scrutiny and the  most

thorough debate at this House. It is, I submit,  also

our  duty  to watch out most carefully the manner  in

which   our  civil  servants  go  about  implementing

Government policies. We should always make sure  that

all  administrative measures taken are both just  and

humane  and that quality of service is not sacrificed

for expediency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is accepted that for the long-term benefit of

our  people, unpopular measures may have to be  taken

from  time  to  time. It falls upon us, however,  to

question  whether  on  all such  occasions  the  most

thorough  consideration has been given to  minimising

the  degree  of hardship and inconvenience  to  those

affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last Parliament, we often talked about

the   growing   tendency  towards  bureaucracy,   the

rudeness  and  callousness  of  some  of  our   civil

servants, the lack of coordination between Government

departments, the apparent changeability of Government

policies  and  measures  in  certain  areas  and  the

unhealthy  inclination towards commercialism  of  the

civil  service.  There  is  sufficient  evidence   to

indicate that much of what we complained of,  remains

with us today. As Backbenchers we may at times feel a

little   tedious  or  frustrated  having  to   repeat

ourselves,  but we are duty bound to go  on  pointing

out  all such anomalies and shortcomings for as  many

times  as may be necessary so long as they appear  to

us remain unrectified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's speech, together with the Addenda,

illustrate once again the practical and down-to-earth

approach  of our leadership. There are no  empty  and

fanciful promises. The objectives that all Ministries

have  set  for  themselves are realistic  enough  and

perhaps,  typical of our traditional style of  "deeds

and  not  words", the descriptions of such objectives

are  generally brief in words. However, for the words

to  be  translated  into deeds,  the  continued  good

service  of  hon. Ministers is to my mind  absolutely

vital.  In this connection, I am confident  that  all

Members in the Backbenches will gladly take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



on  the challenge of the Leader of the House, when on

the   first   Sitting   of   Parliament,   he   urged

Backbenchers to speak freely with open minds.  I  can

assure  hon.  Ministers that if it is frankness  they

want,  they will certainly not be disappointed.  They

can  look  forward to some exciting moments  and  may

never have to complain of the lack of debate in  this

House.  To  do our job well, we may have to  take  to

task  without fear or favour any hon. Minister  found

to  be wanting in his duties because he delegates  or

depends  too  much  on  civil servants,  and  in  the

process  fails  to  exercise sufficient  control  and

supervision  upon the formulation and  implementation

of policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All too often. Backbenchers have been accused of

using  civil servants as convenient "whipping  boys".

There is perhaps some truth in the accusation as many

of  the  sins,  major as well as minor ones,  of  the

civil  service were allowed to be perpetrated because

of  the  lack  of  timely  intervention  or  wrongful

intervention on the part of hon. Ministers.  We  also

spoke of "buck-passing" in the past. Let us hope that

we will have no cause for complaint in this regard in

the   coming  months.  Let  us  hope  that  all  hon.

Ministers  will work collectively and conscientiously

as  a  team  and  will  lose none  of  the  political

awareness  and sensitivity that are the  hallmark  of

the  PAP. It is, Sir, this exceptional quality of our

entire  Cabinet  under the leadership  of  the  Prime

Minister  that has enabled the party to  continue  to

inspire confidence in our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road ahead may not be as smooth as the distance

that has been covered so far. The hazards that we are

likely  to  face are numerous and have  been  clearly

pointed out by the President. Suffice it here to  add

that  our continued survival as a nation will  depend

on  the collective determination, ingenuity and  hard

work  of all parties concerned, namely, the political

leadership,   civil  servants  and  the   people   of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I join my colleagues in thanking the

President for his gracious speech to the House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>5.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Alexandra):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one

of the great men of our times, Sir Winston Churchill,

once said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Life is a test and this world a place of trial.

Always the problems - or it may be the same problem -

will  be  presented to every generation in  different

forms."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing could be more appropriate to the Singapore

context.  Our test has been basically a  question  of

survival  first, then growth. And as we  moved  along

the  path  of progress we have had to face  seemingly

insurmountable obstacles. But bold and tough policies

of  the  PAP  Government, coupled with the resilience

and the strong will of a unified people determined to

do  their  best helped us to prove wrong the  pundits

who  wrote us off in 1965. But that is not to say our

test  is  over for the problems are still here.  Some

similar to those in the past, some different, but  no

doubt  our ability to solve them will be critical  to

our continued survival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two important events have occurred during the past

five years that have shaped and changed the destinies

of  nations, big and small. The sudden upset  in  the

balance  of  political forces in Southeast  Asia  has

lent  encouragement  to  a  vigorous  resurgence   of

communist  activities that threaten the  security  of

our   neighbouring  countries.  It  has  also   given

stimulus  to communist forces to mount a new strategy

of  slow  infiltration  into various  strata  of  our

society.  Secondly, the oil crisis which unleashed  a

new economic weapon that proved politically potent in

undermining the great industrial nations of the  West

brought  about the worst economic crisis in  decades,

and  for  us  it  brought about  problems  of  trade,

unemployment and inflation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of these, Singapore has weathered the

storm.  But  bad  weather and  dark  clouds  are  now

gathering  on  the  horizon  again.  The  people   of

Singapore  have once again expressed their confidence

that   the  PAP  Government  can  pull  them  through

difficult  waters. But although the PAP won  all  the

seats in the general elections, it would be naive for

us  to  believe that the people are 100%  behind  us.

For, as we steer the ship of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>



state  and  navigate the course  for  the  next  five

years,  let  us  not forget that people  have  become

politically more mature, as shown by their  rejection

of the false pretences of the opposition parties, and

at  the same time this means that they will grow more

critical of our policies and decisions. It is in this

context   of   an   increasingly  more  sophisticated

electorate,  more volatile in their reaction  to  the

policies  we make and implement, that we welcome  the

President's  call  for  a  more  thorough  debate  in

Parliament.  There  are  the  different  "shades   of

opinions"  that have to be "vigorously  voiced".  But

not   for  us  the  vociferation  of  the  opposition

parties, or that minority of liberals who cloak their

academic  exposition  in the name  of  democracy  and

human  rights. For us it is a question of determining

the  bread and butter issues, the issues that  affect

the  rice bowl, issues that concern our economic  and

industrial well-being, our jobs, better education for

our children, improved social and health amenities  -

all  of  which  are measures intended to  better  the

quality of life in our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in our efforts to seek a better life for our

people  we  have to differentiate between  those  who

genuinely  want to improve themselves and  those  who

have   been  given  their  inch  but  ask  for   that

additional  yard  without putting in  that  necessary

extra  effort. The latter category is that  group  of

people who believe the nation owes them a living, who

do  not believe that reward is equated to performance

but  subscribe to a premise that higher rewards  must

come  with increasing haste and as a matter of right.

Such  an  attitude,  far from  being  latent  in  our

society, is becoming evident and widespread with  the

younger generation and must be checked if we are  not

to  go  the way of many countries in Western  Europe.

The  objective of improving and bettering one's  life

has   been  misconstrued  as  a  desire  to   achieve

immediate material gains, and this desire is in  turn

catalytic  in  generating an  impatience  with  one's

immobility   up   the   organisational   ladder    or

dissatisfaction with even the slightest quirk in  the

working  environment. The resultant is the  perennial

situation  of  one  type of intense  labour  mobility

which in times



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



of  conducive economic circumstances rears  its  head

under  the synonym of "job-hopping". The announcement

by  the  Minister for Labour that the National  Wages

Council  will consider whether job-hoppers  would  be

granted recommended full wage increases would to some

extent  discourage job-hopping. But it is hoped  that

the  NWC will clearly define "job-hopping", and  that

nothing  is  done to discriminate against  those  who

move  not  through mere fickleness, but who  find  it

necessary  to  do so because of a genuine  desire  to

upgrade  one's skills or because he has incurred  the

displeasure  of  those to whom he is subordinate  to.

More often than not we have called upon employees  to

make  sacrifices.  It would not be untimely  at  this

stage also to remind employers that they too have  to

make their contributions as a partner in the economy.

When  we  talk of increasing productivity we tend  to

forget   that   employers  must   also   make   their

contribution in terms of proper incentive schemes and

the  provision of more efficient plant and equipment.

Lest  we  forget,  ours  is a  system  of  tripartite

partnership  of labour, employer, and Government  and

no  one  partner  subjugates the  other  and  no  one

partner can shirk his responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the English press lamented on the

lack of female representation in Parliament when  the

PAP  announced  its  candidates  for  the  elections.

Perhaps  that is why unwittingly to them the Minister

of  Defence has been thinking of drafting them. While

it  is  not my intention to champion their cause  and

risk  the  wrath of those in this Chamber  who  would

label  me  a `ladies' man', I would like to  raise  a

point  concerning working women who  constitute  half

our work force. Women today want to be recognised  in

their   own  right,  and  have  been,  at  least   in

Singapore.  They  want and have the right  to  pursue

their  careers, whether it is a job at the  executive

level  or  along the production line. But more  often

than not the pursuit of a career ends after marriage,

that  is  to  say, many are unable to  reconcile  the

objective of carrying on working with that of raising

and  looking after a family. And we have therefore  a

situation where those who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



have acquired skills for years have to stop utilising

what  they have learned. And we also have a situation

where  foreign workers have to be employed  when  our

married  mothers  could well have fitted  into  their

places.  But they are not to blame for no woman,  not

least  any  man, would like to face the trauma  of  a

broken  home, and of delinquent children as a  result

of  neglect  of  the family all for  the  sake  of  a

career.  But the cost to society, in terms of wastage

of  learned  skills,  of having to  rely  on  foreign

labour, of not being able to make their contributions

as  citizens  to  our  economy, of  being  unable  to

contribute to the family income, is high. It  is  not

suffice  to  say  that creches have been  established

where working mothers can leave their children and to

carry  on working, for it is obvious that these  have

not  proved to be popular enough to encourage mothers

to  do  so and concentrate on increasing their family

income and to contribute to the economy. I call  upon

the  Ministry  of Labour and the Ministry  of  Social

Affairs to work closely, perhaps in consultation with

various  women's  organisations  to  scrutinise  this

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I come now to the Addendum on the

Ministry of Finance. It is encouraging to note that a

special  effort will be made to encourage industries,

particularly  those  that  supply  parts   to   other

manufacturers, We have to be blunt enough  to  admit,

as  the  Member  for  Kallang has implied,  that  our

present tax system has been a contributory factor  in

many investors shying away from Singapore. That there

are  many  incentives given by the EDB  is  not  good

enough  for such incentives have been aimed  more  at

the  `giants' and the pioneers of industries.  It  is

time  for us now to give emphasis to small industries

particularly those which are classified as supporting

industries,  that  is, those which  supply  parts  to

others who put these parts together to constitute the

finished   product.  And  when  there  are   adequate

`supporters'  in  a  particular industry,  this  will

encourage   manufacturers  of  the   finished   goods

requiring the parts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>



made  by  these `supporters', to set up their  plants

here,  for  easy  access of  supply  of  parts  is  a

fundamental factor in determining plant location. The

spiralling  effect is obvious: more manufacturers  of

the  finished  product means more  factories  in  the

supporting   industry.   But   which   comes   first?

Supporting  industries would not  start  here  unless

they  are  assured also of a ready market  for  their

products.  The `chicken-and-egg' question then  comes

into play.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The call to encourage industries that seek wider

and newer markets overseas is also a good one and the

steps  being  taken by the Ministry of Communications

to  develop  airfreighting facilities at our  airport

will  be  timely and will contribute  vastly  to  the

efforts of our export-oriented industries. For it  is

an undeniable fact of marketing that one's ability to

move  one's products to the market place  at  a  fast

pace  and  at  the  lowest possible  cost  determines

whether one is successful or not. I do not doubt that

we  have enough airlines coming through Singapore  to

carry  our products to all corners of the world.  But

what  I  doubt is the ability to do so at  low  cost.

Singapore exporters do not enjoy the cheap  rates  of

air  charter  cargo services going out of  Singapore.

Hong Kong offers such services to its industries  for

air charter cargo services can give rates that are as

low   as  a  quarter  of  rates  offered  by  regular

scheduled  airlines,  It  is  in  this  question   of

transportation  cost that Singapore  industries  have

often   lost   that   competitive   edge   to   their

counterparts   in   Hong   Kong.   At   the   moment,

consolidated air cargo services are allowed to  bring

in  cargo  to  Singapore at low  rates  but  are  not

allowed to operate similarly out of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, lastly I would like to dwell on a

topic which has been raised on many occasions in this

Chamber  and  no doubt would continue to  do  so.  It

concerns  attitudes  adopted  by  civil  servants  in

dealing  with members of the public. More often  than

not,  civil servants, perhaps in their desire to show

their efficiency and perhaps to show nice figures  to

their  Ministers  at the end of each financial  year,

follow  every  rule to the letter, even when  unusual

and unexpected



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>



circumstances    do   arise   that   merit    special

consideration. A story appeared in the  Sunday  Times

last  Sunday  about the case of a  family  which  was

asked  by  the HDB to return the 13th month allowance

already   paid  to  an  employee  but  who  had   the

misfortune to die just a few days before 1976  ended.

While  it  is not my intention to go into  the  legal

aspects  of  the  case, I cannot but agree  with  the

person who wrote the article that there could not  be

a   more   glaring  example  than   this   of   rigid

unimaginative adherence to rules and regulations, and

of    an   insensitive,   inflexible   and   mindless

bureaucracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> It is this human element that is

often   sadly  missing  in  our  civil  service   and

statutory  boards. Abrupt replies to  inquiries  from

members  of the public, a straight `no' in  the  face

instead  of  a  proper explanation  of  the  decision

implemented,  a deliberate display of high-handedness

-these are all acts that give the impression, whether

rightly  or  wrongly,  that  requests  are  sometimes

turned  down  without  a  detailed  scrutiny  of  the

surrounding  circumstances. Those who have  forgotten

could  do  well  to  remember  that  kindness  begets

kindness,  courtesy imparted means courtesy returned,

and a little smile goes a long way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.



<br><br>5.26 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to  add my support to the Motion moved  by  the

Member for Ulu Pandan to thank the President for  his

speech. In his speech to the House on the 8th of this

month, the President has charted the path of progress

for  the  nation in the next few years.  We  owe  our

present well-being to hard work in the past,  and  we

have to continue with it to maintain our progress for

future  prosperity. As we become  more  affluent,  we

shall have more to spend and to save.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst spending is a relatively simple matter and

although some people seem to have difficulty spending

within their means,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



saving can pose quite a considerable problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President in his speech has indicated that we

have now to be prepared for slower growth rates,  and

therefore we have to adjust accordingly our  spending

habits  both as a Government and as individuals.  But

then  to  maintain a low spending habit, the cost  of

living should be checked seriously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people living in flats face very high costs and

their battle against inflation never ends. Since  the

home-ownership  scheme  was introduced,  flat  owners

have  to pay housing instalments, conservancy charges

and  many  other  indirect  expenditure.  Though  the

citizens  are encouraged to purchase HDB  flats,  the

maintenance of these flats is too high for the  lower

income  group. For instance, a new flat may have  two

toilet bowls which would automatically cost the owner

$6 in sewer fees. The bills for other appliances like

the cooker, heater, etc, which are necessities, would

be a bigger burden for the lower income group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides this, the PUB does not help to alleviate

the  plight of the flat owner. The PUB levies tax  on

the  total bill which includes the rental of cookers,

heaters,  etc. This surcharge should be reviewed.  Is

this  surcharge really necessary? We should be paying

tax  on  rates  and  not on rentals.  This  surcharge

should  only  be  levied where there is  evidence  of

indiscriminate use of utilities and not on rentals of

appliances,  which are necessities. The  Addendum  on

the Public Utilities Board states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`69% of the Board's annual recurrent expenditure

before  depreciation and interest charges is on  fuel

oil  for  electricity generation. Continuous  efforts

are being made to increase operational efficiency  of

generators to conserve the consumption of  fuel  oil.

As  a result of increasing efficiency, the Board has,

so  far, been able to absorb the 10% increase .., in

the  price  of  fuel oil since October 1975,  without

increasing the price of electricity to consumers.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board now says that the latest increase in oil

prices will necessitate an upward revision of the

tariffs. Is this really necessary? Can it not be

avoided? Here again, in general, the people are most

unhappy about the present rates and charges of the

PUB and if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



the   tariffs  are  raised  there  will  be   greater

discontent among the masses. Perhaps the reserve fund

could  be used as a subsidy to undercut the inflation

or  perhaps the interest on the reserve fund could be

used  as a subsidy. On the other hand, we should  not

only  depend on fuel oil as our source of energy.  We

should  seriously think of other alternative  sources

of energy; like coal, etc. If rising oil prices is  a

great  threat  to  our country, it is  time  that  we

should  import coal as a standby or as  a  substitute

for  fuel, During the Occupation Period there was  no

oil.  Everyone had to use coal. Why do we not try  to

use coal again instead of oil?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past too many schemes have been

introduced  on a trial and error basis  without  much

proper  pre-planning, consultation or even debate  in

Parliament. As such, some of them had complicated  or

confused the people as to what they were all about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the fringe car parks and the shuttle

bus service which cost the Government some $7 million

had  an  initial disastrous result. Fortunately,  the

Government  had  an alternative plan to  salvage  the

scheme  from total failure. The point which  I  would

like  to  stress here is that in future thorough  and

proper pre-planning should be conducted prior to  any

implementation of projects or schemes.  Otherwise  if

the  plans turn out to be a failure, the people  will

be  confused or Government funds wasted. In line with

this,  any  amendments  to taxes,  rates  or  tariffs

introduced  by the Government or any statutory  body,

should be first brought to Parliament for debate  and

approval before implementing it, and it should  never

be like in the past where some taxes and amendment to

rates  were  introduced overnight,  which  eventually

resulted in comments here and there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Environment Ministry says that the present

28,750  licensed hawkers in Singapore are  sufficient

to  cater  for  our  population.  I  agree  with  it.

Therefore, no new licence will be issued because of a

diversion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



of   manpower  to  more  productive  sectors  of  the

economy.  If  this  is the case, a review  should  be

conducted   on  the  existing  hawkers  to  determine

whether  the licensed persons themselves are managing

the  stalls,  because at the moment many stalls  have

been  illegally sub-let to other people. Furthermore,

the  envisaged upward revision of hawker licence fees

in  stages,  in view of the escalation  of  costs  of

building and maintenance of markets and food centres,

may  be  a  blow  to consumers. If you  increase  the

licence  fee,  they will increase the  price  of  the

food.  Is this necessary? Can it not be avoided?  Has

any  thought been given to the repercussion that will

follow?  I personally feel that hawkers will transfer

the  extra cost to the consumers. An alternative plan

should  be  conceived to ensure that  the  additional

costs will not be borne by the consumers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking about the civil service, many officers

have  reached the top of their salary scale and their

pay  has  been  stagnated  for  many  years.  If   an

officer's pay is stagnated for many years, he  cannot

work hard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study should be made of all these officers to

assess  their  capabilities  and  potentialities  and

emplace them on an adjusted wage scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the past, in promotion exercises, there were

many   instances   of  dissatisfaction   in   certain

quarters, the reasons for which may be genuine. As an

example,   a  matured  person  with  many  years   of

experience  and paper qualification, finds  a  young

graduate   who  had  at  one  time  been  under   his

supervision is now promoted and takes over  from  his

previous  superior. Is this promotion not a  mockery?

Again  there are certain jobs where the wrong sex  is

put  in charge. Something should be done to this sort

of  promotion.  Otherwise you may get a  dissatisfied

civil  service which may affect the quality of  work.

Obviously  you  will  find some experienced  officers

sticking  to  their job and passing time  because  of

their many years' service. Others may be looking  for

greener  pastures  in  the  private  sector.   Proper

instructions  should be outlined to the  effect  that

the right officer who has the experience



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>



and  qualification should be in the right  place  and

not a green-horn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some years ago certain statutory bodies gave

their  employees who were in the Pension  Scheme  the

opportunity to opt for the CPF scheme. This, in fact,

was a wise move and many officers made use of the CPF

to purchase HDB flats. However, those who did not opt

at  that time had some reservations for many personal

reasons.  Perhaps a second offer of an option  should

be  considered because now that some time has  passed

the  majority have already made up their mind  either

to stay on in the Pension Scheme or to opt for CPF in

order to get help in the purchase of HDB flats.  This

option  would  also  help in the computation  of  the

benefits when a person retires from service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of CPF, I wonder whether consideration

could  be given for employees to utilise their  funds

in the CPF to buy flats built by statutory bodies. If

this  service is extended to them the occupancy  rate

of  flats  built  by the statutory bodies  for  their

employees would be far better than what it is at  the

moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of late there has been a lot of exposure of

traitors  in  our midst, Although some of  them  have

been detected, detained and released, there seems  to

be  some  hard-cores who do not repent. Is there  any

proper reeducation programme being carried out?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ISD is doing a good job in tracking these

elements, many of whom have been brought to book. But

what  about those not detected or those who  will  be

misled by the hardcore? The Home Affairs, Defence and

Education  Ministries  should work  very  closely  to

check these anti-national elements at the grass-roots

level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the main aim in education is to

strengthen  moral and civic education.  Whilst  every

effort  is  being  done  to  raise  the  quality   of

education  in the Republic, a close watch  should  be

made  at  our schools where there are too many  drop-outs,

drug   addicts,  gangsters  and   all   those

undesirable  acts. These schools require a  cleansing

operation. I received a complaint from a father  that

every



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



day  his son has been asking for money and if he does

not  give him any money, his son would beat him.  The

father  reported this to the police and his  son  was

arrested. The son was locked up for one day  but  was

released  on  the next day. I feel that a  proper  re

education programme must be carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Prime Minister has to be praised for

his   fruitful  visits  to  different  countries   on

goodwill  tours. He has done a great deal to  promote

trade  and international understanding for Singapore.

It  is welcoming to hear that we are encouraging  and

expecting more tourists to visit Singapore.  However,

the  transportation service that is required to  cope

with  an  increased influx of tourists  seems  rather

inadequate.  Taxis and tour buses  should  be  easily

available for the tours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on behalf of the people of Anson Constituency,

I  would  like  to express our high  esteem  for  the

President's Speech delivered at the opening  of  this

Parliament.



<br><br>5.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin (Bedok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise in support of the motion moved by the Member for

Ulu Pandan to thank the President for his address  at

the  Opening  of  the  First Session  of  the  Fourth

Parliament.  It was an inspiring speech which  should

constitute   the   main   guiding   factor   in   our

deliberations in this new session of Parliament. Many

of my colleagues have already spoken on various vital

issues ranging from PUB charges to Communist threats.

All the 11 new Members have already made their maiden

speeches, touching upon matters of bread and  butter

issues which are of common concern to the common  man

-  the  man-in-the-street. For it is the  man-in-the-street

who  ultimately matters most. His  life,  his

livelihood, his well-being, his problems, his family,

his happiness

- these are issues which should be our prime concern.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have therefore chosen to speak, on a subject

which  is first and foremost of great concern  to  us

all Singaporeans and which, at the same time, is very

close to my own heart.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>



I speak not only in my new role as a Backbencher and

educationist but as a parent as well. The  subject  I

shall  speak  on will concern all parents,  that  is,

Education,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, I believe, the responsibility of the

Government to provide the right kind of education for

our  children, as the right kind of education is  the

key  to  a  good  life,  a good  conduct,  a  correct

attitude,  a key to the world, both our own  and  the

bigger  one  outside. Education being  a  process  of

living  and  an  inseparable part of  one's  personal

development, as one journeys through life's  maze  of

problems and pressures, its importance cannot be over-stressed.

This,  I  think, is  recognized.  However,

while  we  have  all  recognized its  importance  and

implications,   have   we  been   mapping   out   and

implementing the right policies in education? It is a

difficult task, rio doubt. And upon the shoulders  of

the  Ministry of Education has fallen this  difficult

task.   The  Ministry  of  Education  is   not   only

responsible  for  the  formulation  of  our   present

educational  policies, it should also be  responsible

for  their  successful implementation and  to  ensure

their practicality and usefulness. Has this been  the

case? This is the question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past few years have seen a great deal of debate

on  and discussion of our education system, not  only

within  this  House but also without. In some  cases,

the  deliberations have been very intense, mainly  in

the  problem areas. Much has also been printed on the

subject. One particular newspaper published a  series

of  articles, based on surveys it conducted.  Parents

and  teachers  joined in the fray with their  letters

and articles in the Mentor, the official organ of the

Singapore Teachers' Union. Much of the statements has

been  critical.  Some  of the  utterances  have  been

evaluative and useful. There have also been instances

of  angry and contemptuous comment. All these  go  to

show  the immense concern our people in general  have

over  the education of their children, in the  future

of their children. The questions that follow are: How

much have we who are in Government taken note of all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



these?  How much of the useful points raised have  we

used  in  our  reviews and reevaluation of  policies?

There appears to be a continuing discontent over  our

educational policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me touch upon a few areas in our

educational  policies and our education system  which

have  brought  about a great deal of unhappiness  and

not a little confusion. The unhappiness and confusion

apparently cut across the entire score board

-  principals,  teachers,  parents  and  pupils.  The

general  feeling during the past few years  has  been

that  students  have been made the  "guinea-pigs"  of

what  appeared  to  be a series of  rather  haphazard

experiments  formulated totally on an ad  hoc  basis,

without  any  prior research nor any  in-depth  study

done.    Principals   and   teachers   are    equally

apprehensive  and concerned over the frequent  "chops

and  changes". But most concerned of all are parents,

naturally. They are often heard complaining about the

frequent  implementation of short-lived policies  and

new  ideas, only to be aborted before they have  time

to  take  root.  New  experiments  are  abandoned  as

swiftly  as  they are implemented. Can we wonder  the

concern expressed all around? The recent Ministry  of

Education  announcement of its decision to  impose  a

second  language  requirement  for  entry  into  pre-university

classes in 1979 and 1980 is an example  of

what has generated much concern among parents. It has

also  aroused anger and annoyance. Students begin  to

feel  insecure all over again, unsure of their future

and what is actually to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is needed now is to convince all concerned,

especially parents whose children are, in  the  final

analysis,  the  ones to benefit or  to  suffer,  that

there   is   every  justification  for   this   fresh

imposition.  There may be, as there should  be,  very

good  grounds for the move. But if there are, we have

not  heard  them in clear terms, in simple  language,

and  in convincing tone. What parents and pupils  are

uneasy  about is that this may yet be another one  of

those many new experiments and new ideas that crop up

in the minds of Ministry officials. What they wish to

know is whether



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



this  new  decision is the result of a careful  study

and  survey  of  the  real  needs  of  pre-university

students.  And would this really create a new  thirst

for  the  learning of a second or third language?  Or

would   students  do  it  simply  because  they   are

compelled  to  and not because they  are  interested?

There  are, too, numerous other attendant aspects  of

the   second  language  learning  process  that  must

necessarily  be  looked  into before  a  far-reaching

change of this nature is implemented. We must presume

that  the  situation  has  been  fully  assessed  and

evaluated. But has it? Factual and forthright answers

to  these  various questions would go a long  way  to

dispel  the doubts lingering in the minds of  parents

and  pupils.  I  think  we  need  these  answers  and

assurances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Addendum to the

Presidential Address on the Ministry of Education, it

says, amongst other things, that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Moral and civics education is mainly taught through

the   subject  Education  For  Living  which   is   a

combination of Civics. History and Geography) in  the

pupils' mother tongue'



<br><br>Sir,  as far as I know, when the Education For Living

idea was introduced, it was aimed to give exposure to

pupils  doing  a  second  language,  which  may   not

necessarily  be  the mother tongue. Let  me  give  an

example. To many children who go to an English-medium

school,  English  is  a foreign  language.  Even  for

children  of  Chinese  ethnic origin  who  come  from

English-speaking  homes,  they  will  find  that  the

learning  of  Mandarin is not an easy  task  to  cope

with, Mandarin not being their mother tongue. In such

homes,  it  is  probable  that  other  than  English,

Cantonese, or Hokkien or Teochew would be spoken. But

Malay  children  attending an  English-medium  school

would  find it easy enough to learn Malay as a second

language  because  they speak  Malay  at  home.  Then

again,  the Education For Living idea is carried  Out

only in the primary schools, but not in the secondary

schools, where  Civics, History  and  Geography  are

required  to  be  offered separately.  Where  is  the

continuity?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is the feeling that the problems in education

today are traceable to the primary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



schools,  where all kinds of what must have  appeared

to  parents and pupils alike, very ad hoc  ideas  and

decisions  -  like  the Primary  Pilot  Project,  the

Education  For Living, and what have you!  While  the

number  of these new-fangled ideas introduced in  the

recent  years  has been disconcerting, the  frequency

with   which  they  have  been  introduced  has  been

astounding.  Where have all these ideas  so  suddenly

come from? The answer would be enlightening.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resulting frustration is inevitable. The

resulting feeling of insecurity rears its ugly  head.

The resulting position can be most damaging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take what took place a few years back when almost

equal  weightage  was  given to the  second  language

because of a policy change. Many pupils attempting to

achieve  equal proficiency in languages at  the  same

time   actually  ended  up  achieving  neither.  They

finished "half baked" in both languages What was, for

example, the rationale behind this policy change? Was

there any attempt made to assess the damage done as a

result?  Our  education system, with its  examination

and   achievement  oriented  characteristics,  places

demands and pressures upon our children to an  extent

of  daily harassment with hardly any let-up. Language

learning capacity differs from person to person. This

must  be  realised.  To expect everyone  and  all  to

progress   similarly  together  in   this   difficult

learning  process is to expect too much. It would  be

unrealistic, and it would be impractical.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current wave of social ills prevalent all

around us is another aspect of education I would like

to  touch upon. For the ills of society are traceable

to  the  schools.  I  feel that  there  should  be  a

spiritual  balance too in our education system.  This

would  certainly  combat the making  of  future  drug

addicts,  drug traffickers, gangsters and other  such

like men of menace in society. A touch of religion is

always   good.  Any  moral  value,  strengthened   by

religious belief, at once becomes a matter of greater

conviction and a better sense. Otherwise, the  trend

towards a money-minded and materialistic society



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>



would  continue unabated. Proper, correct  all  round

education should provide for the development  of  the

intellectual,   physical,  social,   aesthetic,   and

spiritual, areas of a growing person. One need not be

a  fanatic  in any of these areas. A balance  of  all

these   aspects  of  the  growing  process  is   most

desirable.  This  should be our aim  and  purpose  in

teaching the young.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a last point, may I now turn my attention to the

area  of  Extra-Curricular  Activities, or  ECA  for

short.  The aims and objectives are laudable  enough.

We  do  want  the rugged Singaporean more  than  just

bookworms, As they say, a sound mind in a sound  body

is  the  best thing in the world. Games are made  for

health. Debates and the like are made for intelligent

enjoyment.  Uniformed  organisations  are  made   for

smartness   and  discipline.  Other  ,extracurricular

activities are made for leisure. These are all  fine,

until  their  implementation goes  wrong,  until  the

importance  becomes lopsided, until the real  purpose

goes   cockeyed.  The  over-stress  placed   on   ECA

activities  in  the  recent  years  has  turned   the

original aim and purpose more than a little awry. The

result? Pupils participate in ECA activities  not  so

much to better themselves physically or to better the

correct  enjoyment  of  their leisure,  but  to  gain

points  to  add  to  their academic achievements, in

order  to  gain admission to pre.-university classes.

This  is  true in countless instances in schools  all

over  the island. All this again has been the  result

of  over-emphasis placed on a "new idea" - I say "new

idea"   because  the  idea  of  physical   well-being

complementing  mental and intellectual well-being  is

as old as the hills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my purpose in bringing up all these various

points  is  not  so much to be unduly  critical,  but

merely to express the general feeling prevalent among

principals,  teachers, parents and pupils  like.  But

more  importantly, to urge the authorities  concerned

to  make  a careful and an in-depth study -  a  real,

genuine survey - of a situation before making  policy

changes which in the ultimate analysis affect our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



citizens as a whole, for today's school children  are

tomorrow's  citizens of the State, who  will  have  a

hand  in  the running of the government, the business

world  and  society. The implications  of  a  drastic

change  is  often lost sight of in the enthusiasm  of

implementing a new idea. The frequency of changes can

also  be  bewildering. But these would  be  quite  in

order  if  they are made after a careful  study,  not

just  because a few principals happen to  agree  with

the  changes. I do not think I need elaborate on  the

importance  of  a  good survey and  the  value  of  a

thorough  study before one embarks upon  a  new  idea

which is to be implemented and which will affect  the

lives   of  hundreds  of  thousands  of  our   future

citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the question of making the reasons

for  far-reaching  changes  widely  known.  This   is

equally   important  for  general   information   and

acceptance.  Otherwise  the  unhealthy   feeling   of

"throat-ramming"  will, rightly or wrongly,  persist.

Needless  to say, a policy change in .education  that

has the acceptance and support of the people - parents

in  particular - is certainly bound to have a greater

chance  of  success  than otherwise.  Any  successful

policy  change is also bound to be easier to maintain

and sustain upon implementation, thereby avoiding the

rather  unpleasant task of having  to  make  frequent

"chops   and   changes"   and   to   offer   repeated

explanations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Addendum to the President's Speech the Prime

Minister, amongst other things, correctly pointed out

that  our  youth  "take  the relative  prosperity  of

Singapore as the norm" and everything else that  goes

with  it, like "high expectations, the desire to seek

jobs  in  comfortable surroundings". Sir,  the  young

that  we  are much concerned about are, in fact,  the

products  of  our  educational  policy  -   the   PAP

Government's   educational  policy   based   on   the

acceptance  of  the  1956  Report  of  the  All-Party

Committee  of the Singapore Legislative  Assembly  on

Chinese  education which provided,  inter  alia,  the

introduction  of  bilingual  education   in   primary

schools   and   trilingual  education  in   secondary

schools.  Our  present  educational  system  was  the

result of the Prof. Lim Tay Boh Education



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



Commission of Inquiry which was set up in  1962  when

we  were  part  of Malaysia. Its Final  Report  which

embodied  the  unanimous findings and recommendations

was submitted in 1963. Since then, more than a decade

ago,  our  educational system has undergone  so  many

changes  not  only in terms of the  frequent  ad  hoc

policy  changes  that have caused  a  great  deal  of

confusion, irritation and frustration among teachers,

principals,  pupils and parents alike, but  in  that

period of seven years there have been six changes  of

Ministers.  In  the  Addendum  on  the  Ministry   of

Education much stress has been laid on the Ministry's

plans to reduce drastically the "enormous wastage  in

terms of pupils not benefiting from the system". This

may  appear  to be fine on paper but I do  not  think

that  some of those measures that will be taken could

produce the desired results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid further "mistakes" and in the light of

what  I have already mentioned, Sir, I would like  to

urge the Government to set up a Commission of Inquiry

to  review the present Government educational policy.

Its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



contents and administration in all fields and to make

recommendations  to  the  Government.  I  feel   very

strongly, Sir, that whilst we have done very well  in

the  field of technical and vocational education, the

implementation of our bilingual policy and the method

of  second  language  teaching and  learning  need  a

thorough study and, if need be, a general overhaul.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have tried to be both critical and

constructive.  I hope my comments will  not  fall  on

deaf ears - as so many comments on education have  in

the past.
