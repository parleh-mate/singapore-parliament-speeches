                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join this debate.
I support our President in advocating an inclusive approach in discussing
Singapore's future. While we can pride ourselves with having a safe,
secure and prosperous Singapore, we cannot ignore the fact that
there is still a large segment of our fellow Singaporeans earning
low wages. Based on 2011 WIS recipients, it is estimated that we
have more than 400,000 workers earning a salary below $1,700.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-fb9b3e83-3117-4822-84cb-324908202bda">
                  <a name="president-address__id-fb9b3e83-3117-4822-84cb-324908202bda"><!--a--></a>I have met many low-wage
workers through my work with the NTUC, and at Meet-the-People sessions.
There are employers that take advantage of their vulnerable position.
For example, many cleaners, not only do they earn low salaries,
a major component of it will be in the form of reimbursements such
as transport, laundry or mobile phone allowances that do not attract
CPF payments or included in overtime work calculations. Many struggle
to meet the basic needs of their family members, and may not have
job security, and may be afraid to speak up for their rights as
they may feel worried about losing their jobs, especially if they
are older workers. Rising costs have made their daily struggles
even harder. Although the Singapore economy has performed well over
the years, there is an increasing wealth divide.</p>

the life of our low-wage workers. Several Members of Parliament
yesterday have made several suggestions on what could be done to
help needy families or low-wage workers. I fully support their suggestions.
While I acknowledge that a lot has been done to help low-wage workers,
we can still do more. Recently, it was reported in the papers that
the real income growth for low-wage workers for the past 10 years
has been flat. Sir, I would like to urge the Government to ensure
that the push to increase real wages by 30% in the next 10 years
will be felt by low- wage workers as they are the ones who are most
in need of higher salaries. In fact, I would like to suggest revising
the target for low-wage workers' salaries to increase in real terms
by 50% in the next decade so that there will be an even greater
impact on these workers. </p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-e08e0a41-4368-475a-8d99-63dc40dd95d3"><!--a--></a>Last Monday, NTUC together
with our tripartite partners reviewed and discussed our efforts
to help low-wage workers. NTUC has been championing the Workfare
Income Supplement, Workfare Training Scheme, and Inclusive Growth
Programme and encouraging companies to embark on "Best Sourcing"
instead of "Cheap Sourcing". We do have many success stories to
show how these schemes helped boost productivity and led to wage
increases for low-wage workers and NTUC fully support such initiatives. Personally,
I have two questions. First, are the salary increments given to
these more productive workers equivalent to the productivity gains?
Second, is the impact from NTUC's efforts alone, widespread enough
to make a real difference to the 400,000 low-wage workers out there?</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-14255296-c793-42bd-bad5-8c45db78be55"><!--a--></a> Sir, as a labour MP, I
would like to urge that the drive towards achieving sustained real
wage growth for low-wage workers be a Key Performance Indicator
for every Ministry, Government agency, statutory board and social
enterprise. We must do this as a shared national initiative to help
our fellow Singaporeans. We cannot afford to have any Ministry or
organisation to take a "<em class="ph i">bo-chap</em>" attitude in ensuring better
wages and better working conditions for their workers. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f1884980-1f7b-4bff-89bd-6d0074196633">
                  <a name="president-address__id-f1884980-1f7b-4bff-89bd-6d0074196633"><!--a--></a>Sir, for a start, every
Ministry and Government-related organisation must take ownership
of the Inclusive Growth Programme. NTUC has been driving the Inclusive Growth
Programme (IGP) to help companies boost their productivity and share
the productivity gains with the low-wage workers but, there is an
urgent need for this programme to be ramped up quickly for a greater
widespread impact. Unless, Government agencies take the lead in
implementing IGP, we may not realise the full impact of IGP in helping
low-wage workers. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9efcfdaf-785d-4673-bdbd-ebf4884ead64">
                  <a name="president-address__id-9efcfdaf-785d-4673-bdbd-ebf4884ead64"><!--a--></a>In my conversation with
union leaders on the plight of low-wage workers, many have lamented
that the strategy of outsourcing manual or blue-collar jobs in many organisations,
including Government bodies, has partly contributed to the current situation
of depressed wages for these workers. While outsourcing has many
benefits – such as saving operational costs, keeping companies economically
nimble and allowing them to focus on their core businesses – it
has its drawbacks, too. Competition amongst service providers inadvertently
leads to cost-cutting and this manifests itself in the form of low
salaries for their workers. To make matters worse, contractual obligations spanning
a few years at fixed contract price means that the salary of these
low-wage workers will stagnate. Sir, we should ask ourselves this
question, is it morally justifiable to save cost through outsourcing
at the expense of workers' salary?</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-756bb3ce-a262-4406-9605-a2d99e01202d"><!--a--></a>Sir, I would like our Government
Ministries and statutory boards to re-look at the strategy of outsourcing
jobs that are needed on a daily basis. I recall when I was a child, my
father was a civil servant as he worked as a daily-rated worker
with PWD. As a result, my whole family had medical benefits that
covered public clinic consultations. We did not have a lot of comforts
but our basic needs were met. I wish this can be the case for all
low-wage workers working in Government bodies to be direct employees
so that they are protected from the bluntness of the economic system.</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-312c2c66-9339-4a90-8933-0c317883d6d8"><!--a--></a>Sir, I do understand having
these workers as direct employees will lead to higher expenditure
for Ministries and public institutions, and this seems to go against
the principle of exercising prudence in spending public funds. However,
we should ask ourselves even if we can quantify the savings made
from outsourcing, what is the social cost to it? If we spend more
of public funds to have low-wage workers as direct employees of
the public sector, while ensuring that they have higher salaries
and better benefits, would it not translate to looking after the
needs and welfare of Singapore workers? Moreover, having workers
as direct employees will increase the worker's sense of belonging
to the public service and they will feel that the Government is
taking care of their interests. </p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-b4b6fb33-97f8-4def-9045-751ada1f8ca7"><!--a--></a>Sir, if employing these
low-wage workers as direct employees is not viable for whatever
reasons, I would propose then for Ministries and Government bodies
to practise "Best Sourcing" according to its rationale and intent.
Based on our sense on the ground, there will be less resistance
from the Ministries if the Ministry of Finance reviews the financial
compliance guidelines in the Government's Instruction Manual to be
more explicitly in supporting "Best Sourcing". NTUC, as the champion
for workers, is willing to work with the MOF on this and work with
other Ministries on its implementation.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9799859d-6301-4d13-8a5a-de4b4980e811">
                  <a name="president-address__id-9799859d-6301-4d13-8a5a-de4b4980e811"><!--a--></a> Sir, "Best Sourcing" is
not new to NTUC which has been actively championing "Best Sourcing"
as an initiative to help low-wage workers earn better salaries and employment
terms. This year, the Tripartite Committee on Low-Wage Workers will
be pushing for companies to practise "Best Sourcing" so that the
basic rights of low-wage workers are protected and they receive
fair wages. I support this call and would like to suggest that MOM
and NTUC work on a list of good service providers that give fair wages
and employment terms to their workers. Ministries and public institutions
should then consider only tenders put up by these companies recognised
by the unions. Again, NTUC is willing to work with any Ministry
to ensure that the workers are being paid a fair salary.</p>

the nature of the contractual obligation between Ministries and
the service providers will make it difficult for low-wage workers
to get salary increases annually. Let me give an example. Currently,
there is a Ministry with a cleaning contract that is a term for
three years with a three-year extension and the contract price remains
throughout. Workers under this contract will typically have stagnant
wages for six years. I think this is totally unacceptable. I would
like to encourage Ministries to relook their existing contract with
service providers to enable that these workers do enjoy wage increments
instead of earning the same salary for the duration of the fixed price
contract. This is something that must be done if the Government
is serious in helping low-wage workers earn sustainable real wage
increases of 30% – or was it 50% – in 10 years.</p>

not sufficiently address the issue, then we might have to think
about introducing a law to make service buyers legally accountable
for the welfare of these workers. Sir, please allow me to speak

The Malay community in Singapore has attained many achievements
in education and employment. There are more outstanding students
who managed to win awards and many successfully continued their
studies to the post-secondary level in the ITEs, polytechnics and
universities. </p>

are now more Malay professionals with an increase in the number
of graduates having diplomas, bachelor's degrees, Master's degrees
and PhDs. These achievements were due to the efforts and the hard
work of our community members who contribute to the Malay-Muslim
bodies to improve the social situation of the community. But even
though these achievements bring pride, our community now faces new
issues. I will make an effort to highlight important issues related
to the Malay-Muslim community throughout my term as a Member of
Parliament. However, for today's Parliament sitting, I will focus
on two issues: the issue of low-wage workers, and the issue of drug
addiction, which are still affecting segments of our community. </p>

I spoke about many issues that are faced by low-wage workers in
Singapore. This group faces many challenges, and financial problems
can be one of the factors causing a cycle of problems for the worker
and his family. Some have problems in paying their housing arrears
and are forced to rent a flat; some also have problems in their
families and in disciplining their children. It is not easy to solve
these problems because they need help at many levels, like upgrading
the workers' skills, finding ways to enable the workers to get a
higher salary, providing support for their children's education,
and giving focus to solve the problem of dysfunctional families. Due
to the various problems that they face, I have urged the Government
and employers to find ways to create the real wage increase of 50%
for low-wage workers within the next 10 years. I hope this can materialise. </p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-3521d4c8-c93c-4e2e-9886-16f4cf505e3c"><!--a--></a>However, the effort to upgrade
the status of workers is not only the job of the Government. Workers
also play a big part in this effort. Malay workers must continue
to monitor news on the development of the major global economies
because if the world dips into recession, it will have an impact
on Singapore's economy. If Singapore's economy is affected, it will
have an impact on workers and some may be affected and retrenched
due to companies closing down. In order to try to avoid this negative
impact on us, each worker must find or grab opportunities to upgrade
their skills at their workplace. A skilled worker may be able to
ride through the impact of an economic recession when it happens.
Do not wait until something bad happens before realisation dawns
on you. If there is an opportunity, grab it and do not waste it.</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-0794942c-56fa-4419-9233-218986c79954"><!--a--></a>Next, the problem of drug
addiction. Sir, I have personally seen among my own acquaintances
the painful suffering inflicted on the family of a drug addict.
It causes many family problems and the ones worst affected are the
children of the addict because they have to live without a mother
or a father all because of drugs. Sir, much effort has been made
to reduce the number of Malay drug addicts. The community will surely remember
the good deeds of the late Mr Harun Ghani who worked tirelessly
to solve the problem of drug addiction when he was the Political
Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs. Success was achieved
but we must continue to work hard in ensuring that our community
members do not fall into the drug trap. This includes ensuring that
there is no problem of relapse, especially with the advent of new
drugs. As a member of a steering committee on the problem of drug
addiction, I hope to be able to work with Malay bodies like Mendaki,
Jamiyah and Pertapis and others to further understand this problem
and try to solve it together. I hope that the Malay bodies can work
hand-in-hand with the Government and relevant agencies like SANA,
NCADA and SCORE to eliminate this problem. If it is not prevented
effectively, it will result in a vicious cycle because the children
of drug addicts may be influenced by the behaviour of their parents
and can be trapped by the same problem when they grow up. Therefore,
I would like to urge the Malay bodies to work hand-in-hand so that
we can find ways together to overcome this problem and ensure that
the Malay children do not fall into the drug trap.</p>

I end, Sir, allow me to share my thoughts on Mr Chen Show Mao's views,
please. Yesterday, in his maiden speech, Mr Chen shared his views
on the importance of investment in human capital. Fundamentally,
our Government is and has always been aware of its importance and
a substantial amount of investment was made in areas of transport
infrastructure, qualities, opportunities in education, healthcare
and housing. I was surprised that he opined that Singaporeans have
been under-served in recent years in these areas. I have lived and
worked in Singapore for 46 years and over the years, undeniably,
we have made much improvements and progress in these key areas.
While I acknowledge that there are areas for improvement, I would
not go to the extent to say Singaporeans have been under-served.
In education, for instance, which I have been part of for the past
20 years, I have seen and experienced the transformation of the
education service designed to mould the future of the nation. In
every undertaking we did, we are constantly guided in providing
the best for our children for we believe this would be best for
Singapore. Our education system has been acknowledged by many independent
international bodies to be among the best in the world. Mr Chen,
let me assure you that Singaporeans have not been under-served in
terms of investment in education. However, I would like to give
Mr Chen the benefit of doubt in his view and look forward to hearing
his alternative proposal to better our education system. Sir, I support
the motion.</p>

Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would just like to draw our attention to
some figures which, on their own, do not tell the whole story. If
we were to look at education expenditure as part of our GDP, whether
it is in comparison – these are 2008 numbers based on UNESCO Institute
of Statistics as cited by the World Bank – with East Asian developing
nations or whether it is with higher income OECD countries or the
world generally, we cannot say that our spending is at the top of
the range. Now, it does not mean that our spending or our education
expenditure needs to be at the top end of all these rankings but
when it is below, for example, 3.2% for East Asia developing, 5.4%
for higher income OECD countries, or 4.4% for the world and it stands at
2.6%, I think there is room for us to think about what sort of additional
investments we can make in the human capital of our young people.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to rise in support
of the motion of thanks to the President for his Address. In the
six months that I have been with Bukit Gombak residents, I have
met Singaporeans in different circumstances. One common thing binds
us all, that is our hope and desire for a better future. We aspire
for the best for our children and families. Many of us work hard
to improve our lot, like our forefathers. The traits of diligence
and determination to realise our aspirations are part of our Singapore
DNA. Today, this Singapore "DNA" is being challenged and re-shaped
by new forces and changes in the global economy. Technology is also
transforming the way we work. There are now higher and more complex
demands on education. In my speech, I will cover three broad points:</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b9c6a0b1-a8da-47bc-a0f2-e67ef2ace872">
                  <a name="president-address__id-b9c6a0b1-a8da-47bc-a0f2-e67ef2ace872"><!--a--></a>First, future-proofing PMETs
above 40 years old for lifelong employability. Second, strengthening
our bilingual advantage. And, finally, identifying the "Invisible
Children". I call them "Invisible Children" because these are children
not exactly with special needs but with learning difficulties.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a096134d-f814-4af3-b9e8-7f628b763a4d">
                  <a name="president-address__id-a096134d-f814-4af3-b9e8-7f628b763a4d"><!--a--></a>Let me first kick off with
the first topic of PMETs (Professionals, Managers, Executives and
Technicians). Many Members in this House in the past two days have
talked about how the nature of employment has been transformed due
to rapid globalisation, technology advancement and shorter business
cycles. Jobs can now be easily outsourced, "offshored" and even
disaggregated into tasks for virtual and temporary or even contract
labour. This means that jobs essentially come easily under threat.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e50a17e2-07ce-43a5-aade-9123293620c1">
                  <a name="president-address__id-e50a17e2-07ce-43a5-aade-9123293620c1"><!--a--></a>The 3 September issue of <em class="ph i">The
Economist</em> highlighted this problem by citing several economists,
including Mr Paul Krugman, who argued that post-industrial societies would
be characterised not by a relentless rise in demand for the educated
but, interestingly, by a great "hollowing out". Smart machines are
eroding mid-level jobs. High-level job growth will eventually slow
down. The article described how even some jobs in professions like
law and medicine are being undermined by computer-search specialists
and online medical advice.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d0526106-38a0-444e-8e7d-86d6aa408160">
                  <a name="president-address__id-d0526106-38a0-444e-8e7d-86d6aa408160"><!--a--></a>In the face of such challenges,
there is a growing urgency for us to future-proof our PMETs above
40 years old for lifelong employability. They form a key cornerstone
of our workforce. According to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) Labour
Report in November 2010, the share of PMETs in our resident workforce
grew from 42% in 1999 to 52% in 2010.</p>

over 40 years old was highlighted by several of my residents during
my interactions with them in the past six months. Many of them are well
educated PMETs above 50 years old, worried about their jobs as well
as family and mortgage commitments. Sir, please allow me to read
an email extract from one of my residents, whom I will address as
Evan.</p>

to contribute to the workforce and all I need is a good opportunity from
some employers who believe in me. Although I am 50 this year, I
am still capable of running 2.4 km under 13 minutes, swim at least
10 laps and have been practising yoga for the past 10 over years.
I did all these to be healthy and employable and yet I am now facing
the harsh reality of not even securing an interview despite months
of job searching."</p>

six months that I interacted with my residents I realise, is not
uncommon. In Gombak where we are home to 32 condominium developments, there
are many middle-income families with the sole or even joint breadwinners
as PMETs. Now, according to MOM's 2010 Redundancy and Re-employment
Report indicated that a third of those who were made redundant were
PMETs. And of the resident workforce made redundant, 61% were above
40 years old. MOM's recent Labour Market Report for Second Quarter
2011 observed that PMETs and those above 40 had the lowest rate
of re-entry into employment. In my opinion, the number of older PMETs
who will find it harder to re-enter their existing industry will
continue to grow due to industry transformation arising from global
competition. Just this month, MOM's Singaporeans in the Workforce
Report showed that the employment rate of our population between
55 and 64 years old has fallen behind that of Japan, South Korea and
the US.</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-3db520ac-33ad-4393-bf38-3a77acd0bd9f"><!--a--></a>I sincerely urge the Government
to continue to review how we can further future-proof our PMETs
above 40 years old for lifelong employability. Currently, we have strong
supply-driven training programmes and infrastructure. We have the
e2i and CDCs providing help to workers and PMETs, as well as programmes
such as STEP (Skills Training for Excellence Programme) and EDGE
(Executive Development and Growth for Excellence). In 2011, we will
welcome the opening of the two CET (Continuing Education and Training)
campuses. I understand $5 billion will go into the Lifelong Learning Endowment
Fund. There will be a $150 million fund for PMET training that will
train up to 60,000 PMETs.</p>

we also catalyse a robust demand for the know-how and skill-sets
of these valuable and well-trained PMETs? These supply-driven training programmes
and sources of workforce need to be matched by a corresponding demand from
employers, be it private or public sector.</p>

points of action for the Government to consider? First, we can seek
to foster greater demand and jobs for PMETs above 40 years old.
We need to encourage employers to have a mindset that positively
values employees of 40 years old and above. With more people living
well into their 80s, 60 has become the new 40. Those above 40 years

into practical ways of increasing the pipeline of fulfiling jobs

Perhaps, we can complement this by enhancing EDB's Strategic Attachment

the external wing of our economy. The benefit that PMETs can bring
to SMEs, in fact, is illustrated by one of my residents whom I will
call Jason. Jason is 53 years old, married with two teenage children.
He was a General Manager of a multi-national corporation where he
worked for more than 25 years. In March this year, he left the company
due to ill health and spent a couple of months looking for a job.
I met Jason in June and roped in CDC, WDA and e2i to help him. He
went for some networking sessions and just last month, we were all
very glad that he was hired to be a Service Manager of a listed
local company that is in the marine industry. He now oversees more
than 40 engineers and technicians. His company also draws upon his
extensive experience to deal with the company's MNC clients.</p>

a good chance of successfully tapping PMETs for the future growth
of our SMEs. We can do more in this area – whether to provide job
matching for PMETs above 40 years old to the SMEs, or to help these
PMETs gain "T-shaped competencies". With that, they will be able
to move into adjacent growth industries more easily when their industry
strengths are coupled with a broad knowledge of horizontal strengths

Singapore's bilingual policy created people like us today, and it
has also laid the foundation for future development. We all know
English is an international language and a must in the global business
world. Our bilingual policy in the early years gave us an edge over
other Asian countries. We can use Chinese fluently to communicate
with entrepreneurs from China and benefit from it. I personally
know many entrepreneurs from China. They tell me that they can see
the advantage of our bilingual policy that has trained many bilingual talents.
We can communicate at ease with various parties in the international
arena and have meaningful discussions with them. The rise of China
and India and the shift of economic centre to Asia will bring boundless
opportunities to this region.</p>

bilingual advantage, more countries in the world are realising the
importance of being bilingual. People are eagerly learning Chinese
or English, and one day they will become bilingual elites too. These
people are making fast progress. We cannot ignore these competitors.
We should implement more effective education policies to educate
the next generation so they can maintain our bilingual advantage.
In fact, while studying mother tongue, we can also gain deeper understanding
of Chinese cultural values, the root of being Chinese. We must pass
on these values to the next generation.</p>

                  <em class="ph i">Zaobao</em> reported that
many parents worry that their children cannot study and be good
at two languages. As a parent of two children, I feel the same.
Schools and homes, where English is the dominant means of communication,
may not be the ideal environment of Chinese learning. Minister Heng
Swee Keat has said that, according to the latest data, 61% of Primary
1 students come from English speaking families. Hence, we can start
from family influence and to study how to help parents to create
a relaxed and happy Chinese learning environment. As the saying
goes, "The highest towers begin from the ground". Pre-school education
is a crucial stage. I hope a creative and interesting pedagogy and
a conducive environment will lay a solid foundation for their learning. </p>

and media to teach the children, such as interesting Internet platforms,
interactive whiteboards, cartoons, manga books, music, theatre and games.
Through listening, watching, reading, writing and playing, the children
can master the language in a fun way. We all know learning Chinese
is a lifetime endeavour, I hope MOE and MCYS can jointly create
a conducive Chinese learning environment for our next generation.
If this learning environment is related to their daily life, they
are unlikely to forget how to use Chinese after they graduate.</p>

brings me to another issue that has been close to my heart. They are
our "Invisible Children". Who are these "Invisible Children"? They
are children who may appear outwardly normal, but actually suffer
from learning difficulties and development lags. While their intellectual
capabilities can be within the normal range, they struggle with
speech and language, writing and reading as well as other motor skills
disorders.</p>

cohort of pre-schoolers have developmental needs that could impact
their learning, according to Prof Ho Lai Yun, Senior Consultant
at the Department of Child Development in KK Hospital and Director
of MOH's Child Development Programme. Prof Ho advised that early
identification, followed by timely early intervention, is the key
to helping these children and preparing them for mainstream education.</p>

that the number of children with developmental needs seen by KK
Hospital and NUH grew by 30% in 2010. Both hospitals saw more than
9,000 children last year. Although MOH is working at reducing the
wait, a child may need to wait between one and 3.5 months to see
a psychologist or therapist.</p>

why the PAP Community Foundation (PCF) embarked on a pilot programme
with the KK Hospital and Lien Foundation called "Mission I'mpossible"
in 2009. It covered 25 PCF centres in the Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC.
The programme aimed to provide early detection, intervention and
therapy for children with learning difficulties. It not only allowed
parents' involvement in the child's therapy, it also brought the
therapists into the PCF classrooms. Senior pre-school teachers were also
trained to become Learning Support Educators to support the children
and their parents. On 29 August this year, <em class="ph i">Lianhe Zaobao</em> highlighted
how a K2 PCF child, called Vicki Liu, had improved. She had difficulty
focusing and communicating with teachers and friends. After counselling
and several occupational therapy sessions, Vicki's behaviour became
much better. To her mother's amazement, Vicki did very, very well
in the Primary 1 English test this year.</p>

There are no cures for learning difficulties. These children need
help to develop relevant skills to cope with lifelong development
and learning. Through this pilot programme, PCF screened 3,600 children
over two years. And out of these 3,600 children, 200 children showed
significant progress in their development and learning after intervention
and therapy.</p>

Children" out there whom we are not aware of. If 5% to 6% of each
cohort has learning difficulties every year, it translates to about
2,000 "Invisible Children". Can we look into ways of extending this
programme nationally to even more pre-schools? We cannot lose any
child due to lack of assistance. As Vicki has shown, it takes just
a little help to make a huge difference in her life at this early
stage.</p>

environment more inclusive and supportive for these children. The
outcomes for these children can be improved with early detection
and help. By narrowing the gap before they enter Primary 1, they
can have a better chance of coping and succeeding within mainstream
schools. To do this, we need to build up our pool of therapists
and experts in this area. As of last year, there were 32 public
sector therapists and psychologists working with special needs children.
I understand MOH plans to double this number in two years' time.
However, we need many more of such professionals to serve children
with learning difficulties. To meet this shortage, we can also train
senior pre-school teachers to be Learning Support Educators. This
new job scope and function can also enhance the career choice and
development of our pre-school teachers.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion. Our President
opened the Twelfth Parliament with a most assuring promise that

critical of authority. </p>

Singaporeans are loyal and would put their lives down for the country,
I urge the Government to do their utmost not to let the current
discontent go further than an express wish to become a better people,
a better nation. The danger of our country's peace and prosperity
being destroyed is a real one because discontent, left to brew unattended,
can be easily fuelled by those whose interest lies not in Singapore's
continued success but for their own mischievous ends. </p>

carefully why our people's satisfaction with life, instead of increasing
with Singapore's undisputed economic growth, has dropped swiftly
as if weighed down by a big boulder. Top on the list of grouses
is that the cost of living has gone up and housing has become unaffordable.
The recent measures to cool the property market have brought results
in some measure but resale flat prices continue to increase, presenting
difficulties to diverse groups such as young couples who wish to live
near their parents and in-laws. Another grouse is how certain housing
policies are inflexible, making it difficult for Singaporeans in
need to either buy a flat within their means or to rent one. </p>

is transport related – train congestion and irregular bus service.
Singaporeans note the big contrast between the service that they
received in the past and what they have to put up with every day
as they travel to work and back to their homes in the evening. The
dissatisfaction runs deep and I shall illustrate with an anecdote.
An elderly lady, who lost the dash into a train, turned to another
similarly disappointed passenger, and started blaming it on the
Government for allowing too many foreigners to come to Singapore.
She was carrying food to her loved one in the hospital and worried
that the food would be cold whilst she waits for the next train. </p>

is mirrored daily not just anecdotally but in the media, both mainstream
and non-mainstream. Although Singaporeans know that the Government
gathers feedback 24 x 7 x 365 through various channels, they perceive
that the feedback is not acted on decisively. An example of this
is my residents' feedback on irregular bus service that has tested
their patience sorely because the requested change took very long
to happen. Residents are now telling me that our trains are overcrowded and
they fear the situation will worsen when COE prices continue their
upward climb next year. Mr Speaker, Sir, I will speak in Mandarin.</p>

Mr Speaker, I mentioned earlier about the the people's dissatisfaction
in three areas: one, housing; two, transport; and, third, healthcare.
Singaporeans complain about high healthcare costs, crowded polyclinics
and poor service. To address these issues, the Ministry of Health
intends to involve more GPs rather than building more polyclinics
which takes up precious land resources. One new idea is to allow
GPs to form Family Medical Centres (FMCs) where subsidised patients
can receive treatment, thus reducing the queue at polyclinics. But
GPs have told me that having a group of GPs work together will achieve its
intended goal only if they are equally competent and attract roughly
the same number of patients. If FMCs become the preferred healthcare
provider and GPs earn more as a result of many more subsidised patients,
more well-off patients who are not subsidised will turn to polyclinics
and join the long queues there. Would this motivate more doctors
to join the private sector? If this happens, overcrowding at polyclinics
will remain. So will patients' dissatisfaction.</p>

as a more pertinent contributor to unhappiness. The growth-based
national vision which appealed to newly independent Singapore no
longer holds as much charm for a better educated people who start
to have higher expectations of life in all its aspects. Many demand
freedom to pursue personal goals which they feel was the trade-off
in the past. John Kampfner, former editor of <em class="ph i">The New Statesman</em>,
describes the typical Singaporean as someone who traded freedom
for prosperity and security in his book "Freedom for Sale". Such
a simplistic view of Singaporean society, if left alone, will create
even more unhappiness. We need to question the facile equation of
freedom to pursue individual goals with democracy or happiness.</p>

that we pay more attention to what goes on in schools from now on.
To solve long-term problems, we will have to start with our education
system. I asked a 16-year-old young man on attachment with me in
my law firm his views of Singapore. Mr Tan Jia Xin has just completed
his Harvard Summer School and he is waiting to start his IB programme
at Hwa Chong International next year. He said that the first difference
was having the opportunity to discover his strength. In Singapore,
he could not be a player on his school's basketball team because
it only accepted members who could play well and by implication,
win competitions. In the United States, all students were put on
a debate team which allowed him to discover his passion for law. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-58b6d811-299a-4410-8210-37442c99ddf1">

the passion with which his teachers taught which left a deep impression
on him. Finally, he was impressed by the willingness of high net
worth parents who willingly helped out as coaches and mentors in
his school. In his Google search, he discovered that one parent
was a CEO overseeing a company valued at a few million US dollars.
His wish list seems reasonable enough for passion is a great motivator
for both learning and teaching. If our parents show passion for
education, it will rub off on the students too. Thus, our schools
should consider how we can, within our constraints, infuse the learning
environment with passion for both teaching and learning. I am all
for the new emphasis on Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), but
I agree with the view that unless our people feel passionately for
the subject, the perception many will have is that it is merely
another piece of "propaganda".</p>

the importance of promoting family bonding which was more evident
to him in the US. For many youths in Singapore, communication with parents
is usually restricted to school work because their parents are busy
providing for the family's needs. Hence, I urge MCYS to consider
offering parenting workshops at all community centres or clubs to
promote family bonding, conduct sharing sessions on how to bond
with children, make them aware of the importance of being rooted
in family values. </p>

gave a talk at a school where he told the audience that their parents
did not use to be so boring but that they got to be that way by
paying bills that keep their children in school, buying food to
provide them with meals, washing their clothes to keep them clean,
and so on. Parents need to teach the lesson of appreciation at home
and this has to be reinforced at school by CCE in our children's
formative years. If our children learn the lesson of appreciation
well, they will grow up to be compassionate citizens who shoulder
the responsibility of looking after the old and the disabled. They
would have learnt that they should not just pay back what they have received
but that they should also pay it forward so others will benefit
from their actions and create a virtuous circle of kindness. Paying
it forward is what we have to do to stay united as one people, one
nation, regardless of race, language or religion. In the next five
years, our education system must focus on the right values for our
young if we want to achieve our vision of an inclusive society that
will last a long time.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, MP Chen Show Mao used the analogy of Emperor Tang
Tai Zong and Wei Zhen to describe the relationship between the ruling
party and the Workers' Party. I think it is not very appropriate.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 253</p>

wise and benevolent. Wei Zhen risked his life to see him and voice
his views. Both of them are historical figures who deserve our respect. However,
no matter how wise Emperor Tang Tai Zong was, he was still an Emperor
in the feudal system, an authoritarian ruler. On the other hand,
we are a modern democratic society. The ruling party just wants
to be a political party that serves the people responsibly, one
that is un-corrupt and has integrity. It has nothing to do with emperors. </p>

everybody has the right to express his views, and he does not have
to risk his life. This analogy sounds very romantic, but upon thinking carefully,
it would appear inappropriate.</p>

views and to criticise is not the exclusive right of opposition parties.
If MP Chen continues to listen to the speeches made by many MPs
in Parliament, he will find that there are many MPs in the ruling
party with suggestions to improve existing policies and they often
express their views fearlessly.</p>

to first address the concerns many working Singaporeans have about
our foreign manpower policy. I read in <em class="ph i">The Straits Time</em> on
Saturday that there is "a rare show of disagreement" between NTUC
and SNEF. We have noted this new development from the NTUC and are
pleased that the NTUC is now in line with the Workers' Party's position
on manpower policy which we described in our Labour Day message
in 2008 as "putting Singaporeans first". The Workers' Party is pro-Singaporean and
recognises that immigrants and foreign workers have an important
role to play in our nation's progress. We do not see this as a contradiction.
Our goal should be to strike the right balance between an efficient
system of manpower supply and to achieve the best outcome for employers,
employees and above all, Singaporeans.</p>

three areas we need to work on to achieve this balance. First, we
need more transparency and accountability in our Employment and
S Pass system. Second, we need to further tighten the Work Pass
system by adjusting the inflow of foreign manpower by industry.
Third, we need to enhance the current workforce training in order
to increase productivity. </p>

system needs to be more transparent. Figures showing a breakdown
of the different categories of passes issued and across different
industries are not released to the public. Why this secrecy? We
need regular reports showing the relative standing of Singaporeans
and Pass holders. Singaporeans have expressed their concerns about
losing their jobs to foreign workers. With the release of such detailed figures,
it will help us better understand the need for foreign manpower
across various industries. Analysis of these figures will help us
calibrate foreign manpower recruitment across employment segments.
Transparency will also go far in removing insecurity on the part
of Singaporean workers and cool unwarranted anti-immigration sentiments. Transparency
begets accountability.</p>

of labour supply are not made clear to us, it is evident that Singaporeans

worker costs more to employ. The need for Singaporean males to serve National

for Singaporeans and permanent residents but not for Pass holders. </p>

amount does not level the playing field for Singaporeans as employers

its focus from employer-based training programmes to worker-based

the Skills Development Fund that assistance is to be given to employers
as incentives, and not as subsidies. It is time to move towards
giving assistance in terms of both subsidies and incentives to workers.
Payroll subsidies should be provided to help workers bear the costs
of training for worker-based programmes. This is especially important,
as workers may not have employer sponsorship and employers will
naturally be reluctant to let workers select their own training
programmes and take no-pay leave to complete them. </p>

foreign workers cost less. Let us make sure the odds are not further

protection from involuntary unemployment. Singapore has a small
open economy, susceptible to external forces of globalisation. The
current sovereign debt crisis in the US and Europe and the problems
faced by the Euro-zone affect us too. Our economy is maturing and
growth is moderating in the context of the current prolonged global
economic crisis. Cyclical and structural unemployment is a reality
and our people are facing increasing risks of retrenchment.</p>

rate for the second quarter of 2011 has crept back to 3.9%, very
close to 2010 levels. Since the height of the financial crisis in
2008, only 50% to 58% of residents have been re-employed within
six months of having made redundant, compared with 66% to 78% before
the crisis. Yet, the Government let in more Employment and S Pass
professionals, increasing the number from 188,000 foreign skilled
workers in 2008 to 240,000 in 2010. This is a 27% increase, as half
of our laid-off resident workers struggled to find work.</p>

the combined weight of financial commitments for laid-off workers
− be it rent, mortgage repayments, utility bills, medical bills
and educational expenses − can be considerable. There must be some
level of support for the unemployed to continue to live a decent
and dignified life. It is also important that the involuntarily
unemployed be provided with peace of mind to retrain, upskill and
to look for employment.</p>

to push our workers into the vicious cycle of poverty. We note that
there are ComCare Work Support and Transition programmes for the unemployed
to tide them over periods of unemployment. The stringent criteria
for these programmes include a household income of not more than
$1,500. This will not help the unemployed from the sandwiched middle
class with a household income that exceeds this ceiling; they too
have bills as well as mouths to feed and elderly to take care of.</p>

to temporary and involuntary unemployment, we should very carefully

reduce competitiveness.</p>

conditions have changed and the risk of unemployment faced by our
workers has risen considerably. However, we now have the benefit
of seeing mixed results from many unemployment insurance schemes
around the world, particularly after they have been put through
the crucible of the global financial crisis. Some schemes are costly
and cannot be sustained, but there are also schemes that appear
to have been successfully implemented. Not all unemployment insurance
schemes provide income without work. Unemployment insurance can encourage
the unemployed to find work or even to retrain, for example, by
tying payouts to participation in WDA job placement and training
programmes. We must therefore study international best practices
and consider whether they could be adapted to our context. We cannot
dismiss it out of hand without due consideration and research, especially
now that we are facing challenging economic conditions ahead.</p>

address the adequacy of our CPF in providing for Singaporeans' retirement
needs. The Australian Centre for Financial Studies and Mercer have
just released their Mercer Melbourne Global Pension Index report
for 2011. Among 16 countries (which include developed countries
and fast developing countries such as Brazil, India, China and Chile),
Singapore is ranked 11 and received a "C" grade. In terms of the
three dimensions of the Index, our CPF is doing well in terms of
sustainability and integrity, but we fared badly for adequacy. In
other words, our CPF is at risk of not delivering adequate retirement
benefits for Singaporeans. We ranked second from the bottom for
the adequacy index, scoring only 41.9 points when the average is
63 points. We scored 51.7 points in 2009 and have dropped nearly
10 points in just two years. This is very worrying.</p>

six ways for us to improve our CPF system. I want to highlight three
of them which echo what the Workers' Party has proposed.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c9b5b58a-7c60-4d52-96bc-98bb3085b36b">
                  <a name="president-address__id-c9b5b58a-7c60-4d52-96bc-98bb3085b36b"><!--a--></a>Firstly, our CPF should
raise "the minimum level of support available to the poorest pensioners".
We have a duty to protect our senior citizens who have spent the
better part of their lives contributing to Singapore's growth. Not
everyone turning 55 in 2013 will be covered by CPF LIFE, as only
those with $40,000 or more in their Retirement Account will be automatically
included in the scheme. The CPF Board estimates that 70% of the
cohort will be auto-included, while the rest with less than $40,000
in their Retirement Accounts will have to opt in. Ironically, the
bottom 30% are the ones who need better support.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-41d08002-a33b-4212-b950-4eb61c132a9c">

that the CPF Minimum Sum or CPF LIFE monthly payouts can be less
than the prevailing Public Assistance allowance of $400 per month for
a one-person household. Those who are receiving less can therefore
apply for Public Assistance. Even so, is $400 a month enough, in
the words of MCYS, to "sustain basic living"? I note, too, that
CPF LIFE is not inflation indexed. If core inflation continues above
2% each year, and headline inflation is above 5%, the purchasing
power of each monthly payout will have eroded by 25% to 50% in 15
years. </p>

longevity? The Government should consider setting up a Longevity
Fund to supplement the income of our senior citizens inadequately
covered by the CPF Minimum Sum or CPF LIFE schemes. The Fund could
be built up through transfers from budget surpluses. This small
but significant step by the Government will go a long way in our
goal to ensure that all our senior citizens will have adequate means to
enjoy their golden years after spending their prime years contributing
towards nation building.</p>

points together, the report states that our CPF should "invest a
portion of the CPF in growth assets and reduce the barrier to establishing
tax-approved group corporate retirement plans". We welcome the recent
announcement that the SMRA interest rate will continue to be fixed
at 4%. The extension of the 4% rate is only a temporary solution.
In the first place, the aim of the 10-year Singapore Government
Security (SGS) floating rate policy is to improve returns for Singaporeans beyond
the 4% rate. It is cold comfort when the Minister of State for Manpower
recently boasted that the 10-year average real rate of return is
2.6% for the Special Account in 2010, when the 10-year average real
GDP growth is 5.6%. Singaporeans deserve fair returns for what we
work for.</p>

this portfolio is largely risk-free. It is only risk-free insofar
as the Government will pay out the amounts that have flown into
the fund. The Minister should be reminded that risk includes present
and future inflation risk, past real returns notwithstanding, and
inflation risk has grown significantly in the past few years. Past performances
are not indicative of future ones. The time has come for a comprehensive study
drawing on international best practices to assess the feasibility
of a pension fund model tailored to Singapore's own circumstances
to enhance CPF returns. </p>

by saying that the issues I have highlighted above are very real
and pressing concerns for my constituents and also for the people
of Singapore, as we fight to find our footing in an ever-volatile
and challenging environment. It is my hope that in carrying out
the business of this House, we will work together towards a better
life for each and every single Singaporean. On the cusp of what
we are constantly told is a new era in our young country's political
development, I am energised by what I have seen in the past decade:
the development and the gradual maturity of our political landscape.
I look forward with much anticipation to my part in ensuring that
reasoned, alternative voices continue to make ourselves heard in
this honourable institution. It is an honour and a privilege that
I will preserve while serving the people of Hougang Constituency

Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion to thank the President for
his Address. There has been much discussion about the "new norm"
in governance. Singaporeans are demanding more engagement, consultation
and transparency. We are expressing ourselves assertively and freely
on the Internet and through social media. President Tony Tan himself
had acknowledged the importance of new media as a platform for citizen
engagement. Nonetheless, I perceive a degree of reservation and
apprehension among the Government agencies due to inherent challenges
presented by the social media.</p>

to 1927. It was the year when "talkies", that is, movies with sound,
were introduced. It was a technological break-through and audiences
enjoyed a new level of entertainment, but many movie stars lost
their jobs. They had dominated the silent screen but did not manage
to make the transition to the new world of moving pictures with
sound. These actors included Emil Jannings, the first winner of
the Oscar for Best Actor whose heavy German accent did not go well
on American screens. On the other hand, actors like Charlie Chaplin
was able to thrive on both sides of the sound divide, which is one
of the reasons why he is still remembered today.</p>

are neutral and social media is no exception. It is just another
milestone in the evolution of the media landscape. It is up to us
to adapt and to leverage on them. Even as the establishment is proceeding
with caution and perhaps, with some trepidation, our younger generation
has taken to social media like ducks to water. </p>

Facebook and Twitter very useful in engaging the public. I give
updates on what I do in the community, share my thoughts and sometimes snippets
of my personal life, and I also receive very good feedback and suggestions.
I ask for opinions and even call for volunteers and help. In July,
I asked for volunteers via Facebook to help distribute rice packets
to needy families in Tampines North. In just two days, more than
20 people turned up that Saturday morning. There were both young and
old people, both residents and otherwise, and one even came all
the way from Teban Gardens.</p>

my Facebook friends even though I have not met most of them personally.
Many have become familiar names and profile photos. There are of
course a few "friends" who are not so friendly and choose to be
critical about everything. But if I keep myself out of social media
just because of these few characters, I will be missing out on the
diversity and richness of views and comments offered by the majority. </p>

offer the Government some food for thought in its mode of engagement.
On social media, the Government does not have to rebut every single rumour
or set the record straight for every misrepresentation made, even
on the platforms it chooses to engage. Sometimes, it is better to
leave the discussion open and not jump to defence too quickly or
even at all. Firstly, it is not possible. Secondly, the time, effort
and money expended would not be justified. Thirdly, the Government should
also trust in the public's ability to make logical assessment of
the information they encounter online. The Government has to accept
that it cannot and should not try to have the last word on every
debate.</p>

civic engagement in cyberspace has to be treated with the same level
of respect and care, planned and delivered with the same competence
we wish to achieve in our physical domain. Netizens expect their
Government to engage with finesse, diplomacy and sincerity. This
is no different from face-to-face interactions. The Government must
be able to differentiate among different areas in cyberspace, customise
its communications strategies and apply the appropriate treatment. </p>

analogies – mainstream media sites like <em class="ph i">ST</em> Online and <em class="ph i">channelnewsasia.com</em> are
the newspapers of the city. Facebook, LinkedIn and other social
networking sites are the virtual cocktail parties. Chat rooms and
forums are the coffee shops of the online world, and Twitter contains
casual exchanges similar to housewives comparing notes on what is
fresh and cheap at the market. If the Government posts on Facebook
the same official statements or press releases it sends to the mainstream
media, the message will be lost. This is where an understanding
of the respective media and creativity in repackaging the same message
is needed. The housewife is unlikely to worry too much about global
food crisis and diversification of food sources, but will flock
to buy more apples if her neighbours tell her that they are sweet,
juicy and on promotion. </p>

and the presentation format, the content and core of each Government
message must be consistent. More importantly, the Government must
be able to demonstrate that it is objective, transparent, open-minded
and sincere about addressing the issue at hand. </p>

media is that because of its interactivity, it can build a community.
Netizens will frequent certain forums, follow certain blogs, like
certain Facebook fan pages because of similar interests and through
them, they recruit the like-minded. Just like one cannot just gatecrash
a cocktail party and expect to be welcomed, the Government cannot
just intrude into a social media space and expect to be listened to.
It needs to build the comfort level and develop the relationships. </p>

rejected a recommendation by the Government-appointed Advisory Council
on New Media to respond to posts at blogs and online forums. It
asserted that such engagement would be "extremely difficult" and
better facilitated on REACH, its own feedback portal. Obviously,
the Government is not able to engage in all social media platforms.
As a member of the REACH Supervisory Panel, I do know that REACH
has done a lot in reaching out to the public in the digital media,
via Facebook, Twitter, webchats, forums, and so on. The Government
can choose to stay put at its own cocktail party. However, why limit
ourselves to just one cocktail party? Why does the Government not
tap on other forums and reach out to different demographics? We
can tap on the following that others have developed and reach out to
them in a sustainable manner.</p>

many people perceive social media to be a contributor of "noise"
to the media landscape. Is the voice of our people really getting
louder only now? I do not think so. Singaporeans were not necessarily
more docile in the past. It is the ubiquity of the Internet, along
with the rise of social media, which has allowed the perennial opinions,
including those of the Government, to be heard through new platforms.
As each generation becomes better educated, more will utilise social
media. Whatever chatter and rumours which used to float around coffee
shops and markets or exchanged between taxi drivers and passengers
can now be heard online. The Government can go to new media to listen
to the ground and gauge the sentiment.</p>

should not under-estimate the impact of social media, we should
not over-estimate it either. During the Presidential Election, according
to online polls, certain candidates enjoyed extremely high levels
of support but, in the end, they did not win. This outcome suggests
that the rise of new digital platforms had merely enabled certain
opinions to be articulated and amplified rather than reflect real
changes in public opinion. For me, I cannot assume that just because
more than 80% of the comments on my Facebook have largely been supportive
and encouraging, I will achieve similar levels of support at the
General Elections. </p>

Traits and Media Use" last year, the Institute of Policy Studies found
that people on social media are politically more knowledgeable,
interested and liberal. They also tend to be more politically engaged
online and offline, be it posting a comment on a blog or speaking
to politicians. Dr Zhang Weiyu, an Assistant Professor at the National
University of Singapore's Department of Communications and New Media,
urged the Government and policymakers to take advantage of the online platforms
to reach this group directly as "interpersonal talk has a big influence
on political psychology". </p>

the "social media crowd" including bloggers such as Mr Brown and
The Online Citizen team during his campaign. How will this be continued, or

relationship?</p>

How can a consistent message be conveyed by the Government where
there is no framework for the rules of engagement, where efforts
are very much individually driven, appear <em class="ph i">ad hoc</em> and are
neither organised nor uniformly applied through the Government or
civil service. On the other hand, if online engagement is conducted
in a very systematic or uniform fashion, would the discourse become
very impersonal? </p>

be a very good vehicle to set the agenda for our nation for the
day. Once set, the conversation may be continued online. It is natural
for us to consume information with an inherent bias. If we come
across information that seemingly contradicts our own experiences,
we will want to address it, and the Internet is an excellent platform
for such discourse.</p>

mainstream media be held in high regard by the public. It can only
maintain credibility if it is perceived to be neutral and objective.
Ideally, mainstream media should be the benchmark for quality of
information, and the reference point against which information on
new media is compared and analysed. </p>

to the Government to relax regulations for traditional media. I
believe the Government can afford to loosen up more. Former <em class="ph i">Straits

the Government tried "to set the tone and form of media coverage".
The Editor of the <em class="ph i">Review</em> section at <em class="ph i">The Straits Times</em>,
Chua Mui Hoong, subsequently clarified that it was only natural

Government to reduce its effort to remove or correct what it perceives
to be negative reports. The relevant departments should take them
as constructive feedback, a form of check-and-balance, and work
on rectifying the situation. If the Government were to persist on
keeping a tight rein on the mainstream media, it would lose credibility
and people will rely even more on social media and the Internet for
alternative news and views. And over time, they may feel that these
news and views are the mainstream ones. As a Public Relations professional,
I know that we can only participate in, shape and influence what

seek to achieve is to maintain balanced and healthy discussions
on all forms of media. The world portrayed in our newspapers and
TV and the world in our blogs and online forums should not appear
too different. As it is, we are already seeing a better balance
of views on the Internet. Netizens have set up sites to debunk negative
myths about the PAP. Facebook pages like "Fabrications About the PAP"

YouTube as the closest to the heading "Trust" and the government
somewhere near "Distrust". When the students performed searches
for information on Google, a significant number "believed the first answer
that came up" is the right answer. To them, "Google is like a trusted
website". The students did not verify sources, had poor understanding
of how search engines work, and were not good at differentiating
between propaganda and facts. The think tank recommended that "digital

to my analogy of the movie world. The cinematic experience has come
a long way since sound was introduced to film. Every other movie is
now made in 3D, or has a 3D version. However, CGI effects do not
guarantee a blockbuster, nor is a low-budget independent film not
able to win awards or be a box office hit. Good story-telling is
still fundamental. Likewise, whether the engagement is via the newspapers,
TV, radio, Facebook, Twitter or face-to-face dialogue sessions,
the right message in the right tone will reach and touch the hearts
of people. The Government must continue its efforts with sincerity,
transparency, magnanimity and willingness to accept differences
and failure. Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now make a final point in Mandarin.</p>

Yesterday, MP for Aljunied GRC, Mr Chen Show Mao, talked about the
Zhenguan era during the Tang Dynasty, which is indeed a role model
for good governance throughout history. It was a time when the country's
economy was prosperous and the country was under the rule of a clean
and un-corrupt government. Emperor Li Shimin and his officials led
the country to unprecedented prosperity within 20 years. Coincidentally,
the Singapore Government is also famous for being un-corrupt, an
achievement that is acknowledged and praised by the entire world.
We cannot compare ourselves with the Zhenguan era, but we constantly
remind ourselves to learn from the Zhenguan period.</p>

Li Shimin knew how to make good use of talent and listen to suggestions
with an open mind, and this created conditions for clean politics
and peaceful lives for everyone. He also realised that the relationship
between the ruler and his people was very much like water and boat.
That was why he paid much attention to people's views and was willing
to accept criticism. What I want to say is, it is exactly because
he knew that "water can carry the boat, as well as topple the boat",
and things could work both ways, that he could make the right judgement
and decisions.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, allow
me to seek three points of clarification from the hon. Member for
Hougang. Is Mr Yaw aware that the Government training subsidies
for our workers in Singapore are only extended to Singaporeans?
So, I am not sure what is the basis for him to assume that when
we suggested that foreign workers must also go for certification
and training, the costs will be borne by the Government and not
the employers. If he is really concerned that the Singaporean workers
are more expensive and the foreign workers are cheaper, is it not
a contradiction when he said that employers need not ensure that
the foreign workers that they brought in have to have the right
competency and their skills certified?</p>

point of clarification. Is Mr Yaw aware of the efforts by the Employment
and Employability Institute (e2i) and the CDC's assistance to all
the unemployed workers in Singapore, and that ComCare has been giving
"three plus three months" financial assistance to workers when they
are unemployed, when he made such a suggestion for unemployment
insurance? Is it necessary? </p>

is Mr Yaw trying to brush aside the efforts of the Labour Movement,
union leaders and the tripartite partners and what they have been
doing for Singapore and Singaporean workers over the last decade,
and helping everyone to cope with the challenges that we are facing?
I think that is important to note and not just brush it aside and
claim it under the Workers' Party's agenda. I would like to say
that real help really requires a hands-on approach and not lip service. </p>

I am only asking for a thorough study of its feasibility and not
for a knee-jerk implementation. If a knee-jerk implementation is something
which the Member thought that I have mentioned, it is not. Let me
assure him. Because it is important that in both good and bad economic
times, we should not dismiss this idea just like this. We should

to the idea of compulsory training of foreign workers, this is what

know what to do to meet the skills and productivity of our foreign
workers and not using taxpayers' money to achieve this objective,
I think that is fine and we are in agreement. </p>

in this House. I visited Bhutan a few years ago, and met a good cross
section of the people, from the Prime Minister, the Ministers, the
Chief Monk to civil servants and ordinary folks. I am, of course,
not an expert on Bhutan but the westerners' romanticised version

is a learned man, an enlightened monk and passionate about saving
lives in the spiritual sense. He knows Singapore well, visiting
us regularly to meet up with his devotees and friends. I asked him
what brought him to Singapore on his first trip. He explained that
Singapore had cropped up during one of his deep meditations. He
was, at that time, planning to build a Buddhist university. He was
very concerned with negative influences that inevitably would come
with globalisation, and he felt very deeply that the only way out
was to imbue his people with traditional values, religious practices
and cultural norms. To build his university, he needed money. He conceived
a plan to build a big Buddha statue, to draw in paying tourists
and visitors and hence funds. The Bhutan government allocated a
good piece of land on a hill overlooking the capital but said that
he would have to raise the funds for construction. </p>

forward, and this was in one of those deep meditation sessions,
he apparently saw glimpses of Singapore, a country he had then not
known much of. He took his first flight to Singapore and landed
at Changi Airport at midnight. What followed was quite incredible.
He left the departure hall, jumped into the first taxi that came
along. So, the driver asked for his destination. He said "a clean,
cheap hotel". The driver seemed to know where to send him to and
he checked in for a three-day stay, as that was the amount of money
he had in his pocket. </p>

a group of people seated next to his table went up to him and posed
some questions on Buddhism. He must have given a good reply because
they ended up with a very long chat. As it turned out, the owner
of the hotel was among this group of people. He offered the monk
free hotel accommodation for as long as his visa permitted, and
asked him to give dharma talk to a group of devotees who were his
friends. That started the series of the monk's subsequent visits
to Singapore. In time, this group of devotees grew and many in gratitude
supported the Buddha statue project. </p>

check out the Buddha statue project. The Chief Monk was gracious
and kept me company throughout. We visited several ancient temples,
in the city and in the villages. Although a strictly private visit,
the Prime Minister, who knew of my visit from the Chief Monk, spent
some time with me. Over several days, I met up with most of his
Ministers, including my counterpart at that time, the Health Minister. </p>

deep impressions. First, the plight of a tiny nation. How to make
yourself relevant in the harsh world of big nation politics? Or
simply making their voice heard? <em class="ph i">Straits Times' </em>Europe correspondent,
Jonathan Eyal, wrote a perceptive piece just today on the plight
of small countries. He quoted the example of how tiny Slovakia,
with a population of 5.5 million, was currently being unfairly treated
by their big EU allies. They are being told to contribute to the
bailout fund and to "bail out countries which are far richer, and
which have only themselves to blame for their current predicament".
As Jonathan put it, "small countries are supposed to know when to
shut up and simply do as they are told".</p>

of living next to giant neighbours. I spoke to the Cabinet Secretary
to understand their economic structure: what were their revenue
sources, how did they make a living? Most of the government income
was aid and handouts from a giant neighbour next door. The second
largest income item was sale of hydroelectric power to the neighbour.
I asked if they were paid international market rate. From his body
language, I gathered that altruism or even fairness did not feature
much in government-to-government relations. </p>

making yourself relevant in a globalised world. Being landlocked
between India and China, they know their options are limited. The
talented are leaving for opportunities elsewhere. The economic opportunities
at home are few. The tradition is for the first son in the family
to be a monk; the second son, a civil servant. The rest of the children
will just have to fend for themselves, mostly in the farms. Tourism
is a possible engine of growth. But they have seen how mass tourism
has ruined their neighbouring countries environmentally and culturally.
They are determined not to go that route. </p>

spoke about happiness and the foundation of happiness. I recall

the river like all children do. They had no sandals in their hands
because they could not afford any. But they seemed happy, with angelic
innocence without any worry. I met and heard about foreigners who

Singaporeans, both in the current and future generations. They are
not perfect, but they are not bad. We do however need to adjust

in the light of experience. For example, against the current environment
of rising costs, I see the need to make major policy adjustments
to help the low and the middle classes cope better with a higher
cost of living. But we must be mindful that we do not mindlessly
slip down the welfare route which has now plagued Greece and which

own their homes. This is the highest home ownership rate in the
world. Why then was housing such a hot issue? In the last two years,
home prices shot up by 30% in the HDB resale market and 50% in the
private housing market. Naturally, this has alarmed many Singaporeans.
Parents are concerned about their children's situation in the future.
Newlyweds worry that they will never be able to afford their own
homes. HDB upgraders fret that they will never be able to upgrade
to a private property. Their Singapore Dream seems to be slipping

causing the sudden rise in home prices. Globally, the capital market
was flushed with cash, resulting in very low interest rates for
mortgages. In an effort to fix the 2008 banking crisis, central
banks loosened their monetary policy, resulting in global liquidity
overflows. Mr Vikram Nair described it as "a sea of money", actually
more like an ocean. Much of this excess liquidity went into properties
and other capital assets, especially in Asia. An exuberant property
market was not unique to Singapore. It was hot in China and Hong
Kong too. Domestically, a sharp increase in residential population
pushed demand up faster than the supply of housing units. Dealing
with the uncertainties post-SARS, we had opened up the labour market
so that we could seize the opportunities that came along for our
economy to survive. It was on the back of this growth that we were
able to come out of the 2008 financial crisis very quickly. Minister
of State Lawrence Wong gave a good account of this policy trade-off just
yesterday. </p>

in housing supply and demand drove home prices up. The solution
to an imbalance problem seems straightforward enough: reduce demand and
increase supply until the desired balance is struck. Then the price
will return to a sustainable and affordable level. However, there
are practical difficulties as not all factors are within the Government's
control. For example, with the ongoing euro crisis and the risk
of another US recession looming, global interest rates are likely
to stay very low for quite some time. Low mortgage rates tend to
boost demand to an abnormal level. But we do have considerable influence
especially over the HDB market. We are proactively tackling the
problem but we need time to allow the measures to work. We cannot
create new flats overnight. But I am confident that we can tackle
this problem within four years. </p>

many segments, from HDB rental flats to various types of HDB sold
flats to Executive Condominiums (ECs), private condominiums and landed
properties. It is one giant inter-linked market, with different
segments being subjected to different pressures. Consumers of the
housing market also cover a wide range, from newlyweds, singles,
divorcees, upgraders, downgraders, Permanent Residents (PRs) and
foreigners. Their needs are diverse. Some are desperate; others
are eyeing their next property for investment. Some wish for the
prices to drop; others wish for the prices to go up. I cannot meet
all their needs, some of which are conflicting and certainly not
immediately. I would attend to all these buyer groups over the next
five years. But for the immediate two years, I need to set priorities
and I have focused on the newlywed HDB first-timers and the vulnerable
families. </p>

all newlywed first-timers earning below $10,000 per month, to get
their first HDB home as soon as possible. This will help make an
important social objective of helping them to settle down and start
their families. We are building 50,000 units of HDB flats in the
first two years, as you have already read. This is equivalent to building
one whole new Ang Mo Kio Town. Beyond 2012, we have not decided
yet on the scale of the BTO programme. If the demand remains strong,
we have the resources and the capacity to build more than 100,000
HDB flats during this term of Government. And this may include starting
BTO project launches in the proposed Bidadari Estate. Bidadari Estate
can potentially house up to 12,000 units. Further afield, we will
start planning the Tengah Town. This will be a new HDB Town with
possibility of housing 56,000 units when fully developed. We will
not launch any BTO project in Tengah during this term of Government
but we will begin to put in the infrastructure like earthworks, roads,
drains, sewers and other facilities. We are building infrastructure
ahead of demand. It will cost us money but the social cost of infrastructure
too drastically behind demand, as currently experienced, is not
trivial either. </p>

the issue of affordability head-on. The worry out there is that the
HDB prices will continue to rise. This led to alarm and some panic
demand. I have now participated in three BTO launches, involving
13,000 HDB units and since May, we have stabilised the prices of
these BTO flats. We have moderated price changes such that after
adjusting for differences in location, amenities and other physical
attributes, the May, July and September BTO prices were roughly
comparable to the prices of similar units in the April BTO launch.
The upcoming BTO launch next month will repeat this pattern. Newlyweds
eyeing new HDB flats do not need to worry that BTO price will run
ahead of their income. As long as construction costs do not rise
dramatically, the BTO prices will stabilise. In this way, new HDB
flats will always be affordable to the newlywed first-timers, provided
that their expectation is realistic. </p>

types, across different towns, precisely in order to offer a range
of options for different income groups. Let me provide some illustrations. In
last month's BTO launch, the typical price of a 3-room flat in Sengkang
was $170,000. A newlywed couple earning $2,500 will get an Additional
Housing Grant of $30,000, so the new flat will cost them $140,000.
This is less than five years of their annual income. A typical 25-year
HDB loan for such a couple will see their monthly repayments fully covered
by their CPF contributions. No cash needed. Another couple earning,
say, $4,500 could be eyeing a 4-room flat in Sengkang, where the
typical price is $280,000. They will get an Additional Housing Grant
of $10,000. The flat will cost them $270,000, about five years of
their annual income. A 25-year HDB loan will see their CPF contributions
covering most of the monthly mortgage repayments, with an out-of-pocket
payment of about $60 a month. Another couple earning $6,000 could
be eyeing a 5-room flat in Sengkang, where the typical price is
$350,000. This is also about five years of their annual income.
A 25-year HDB loan will see their monthly repayments almost fully
covered by their CPF, with an out-of-pocket payment of about $50
a month. </p>

quoting statistics of typical buyers of our HDB flats. HDB flats
are affordable to all newlyweds, provided they are prudent in their
choice. And the vast majority are. Let me reiterate that every newlywed
first-timers earning below $10,000 can afford their first BTO flat. </p>

to address the housing needs of families with household income below
$1,500 per month. Home ownership is out of their reach, at least
for the moment. They need subsidised rental flats. We are currently
housing 44,000 such families in HDB rental flats. They make up about
5% of all HDB households. But another 1,600 families are waiting
in the queue; one in five of these households is made up of divorcees
or single parents with young children. </p>

blocks. We are speeding up the building programme and using interim
facilities which come along, including delaying the demolition of
the blocks placed under the Selective En-Bloc Redevelopment Scheme
(SERS), an idea suggested by Mr Inderjit Singh. We took other opportunities
like when the Malayan Railway moved out of Tanjong Pagar, Deputy
Prime Minister Teo alerted me to two blocks of dormitories, so we
quickly moved in. We are cleaning them up; we can use them again
as rental units. </p>

Since May, we have housed an additional 1,400 families. We have
reduced the waiting time for a rental unit to six months, still
longer than I hope I can achieve. We can expect further improvement
in the next couple of years, as new rental blocks become available.
Separately, I am reviewing the rental structure. Rentals are heavily
subsidised for the needy. For those earning $800 or below, they
pay a nominal rent of about $30 a month. Emeritus Senior Minister
Goh told me about tenants who worked to raise their income, only
to see their extra income going mostly to HDB through higher rental.
And he has a point. I think we can consider introducing more rental
tiers, with smaller increments in rental adjustments so that the incentive
to work harder and earn more is not unwittingly diminished. </p>

that rental housing can only be a part of the solution for the larger
social problem of marriage failure, financial mismanagement and
the failure in family relationship. What HDB can do is to give them
a helping hand, while they get on their feet again. We are working
with MCYS and VWOs to tackle this larger social problem upstream.</p>

problem which MND has a strong interest in. In many of these vulnerable
families, we see that they got into financial difficulties, sold
their flats, spent the cash proceeds and then turned to HDB again
for another flat, but this time with even less cash savings than
before and, being older, have fewer years to build up their savings.
Mayor Teo Ho Pin raised this point yesterday. We must try to find
an effective and humane way to prevent such a tragedy.</p>

my attention on the newlyweds and the vulnerable families because
these are the two groups that I can help most during my first two
years in MND. But I am aware that there are other groups of home
buyers: the singles, the second-timers, the upgraders, the downgraders.
I will attend to them more fully in due course.</p>

housing segments are inter-linked, our solutions to help the newlywed
first-timers will also help to moderate the other market segments.
For example, since we started the larger BTO launches, the number
and the proportion of first-timers in the HDB resale market have
declined significantly. This has reduced the competition among the
buyers in the HDB resale market. More importantly, as we progressively
clear the outstanding demand from the first-timers, we will be able
to move to the next step of addressing the needs of the second-timers.
We estimate that there are about 16,000 first-timer families still
waiting to buy a new HDB flat, and each year brings in 15,000 new
applicants.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-20e78b5b-1df5-40b1-9e87-76326077c72b">
                  <a name="president-address__id-20e78b5b-1df5-40b1-9e87-76326077c72b"><!--a--></a>If the estimates are correct,
then at some time next year, we can begin to better meet the needs
of the HDB second-timers. Currently, only 5% of BTO flats are kept
for second-timers, even though they make up 40% of BTO applicants.
It is my hope that in a year's time, we can raise the percentage
allocation for second-timers to improve their chances of getting
a flat. In turn, this will further reduce the demand in the HDB
resale market. By reducing the demand on the HDB resale market,
resale prices should also begin to moderate, benefiting other home
buyers, like the singles. </p>

they make up 23% of the housing market. They meet the upgrading
aspiration of higher income Singaporeans, besides housing the PRs
and foreigners who come here to work and live. URA will continue
to release land parcels to meet the demand. Four rounds of cooling
measures have also had their effect. There have been some calls
for their removal but I do not think it is time yet. The global economic
uncertainties have also tempered exuberance. Price escalation has
moderated for eight consecutive quarters, with the latest URA data
showing the lowest rate of increase (1.3%) over the last two years.
We will continue to monitor market conditions closely and, if need
be, we will take further measures.</p>

complex matter, and there are no instant solutions. But I am confident
that we can address the temporary problem of supply-demand imbalance, with
clear improvements for the newlyweds and the vulnerable families
within two years. This will bring happiness to many families. The
other housing segments will take a longer time to fix, and I seek
Singaporeans' understanding and patience. [Applause.]</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">The Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating
Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr
Teo Chee Hean):</strong>
                  </span> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for letting
me join the debate. I rise to support the motion. In the past three
days, we have debated many issues to do with the well-being of Singaporeans.
I would like to address now an issue that provides the underlying
foundation for us to pursue progress – the safety and security of
Singapore. And, specifically, how the Internal Security Act (ISA) has
allowed us to deal swiftly and effectively with threats to Singapore
and keep us secure. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d6abd4af-b8ac-4240-b060-74957c9f2806">
                  <a name="president-address__id-d6abd4af-b8ac-4240-b060-74957c9f2806"><!--a--></a>The Singapore Internal Security
Act (ISA) has its roots in preventive detention laws introduced
by the British colonial government to tackle serious threats to
social and political security in Malaya. After Independence, the
ISA remained a law in a sovereign Singapore and was important in
enabling the Government to continue to counter national security
threats to our young nation. The ISA empowers the Government to address
threats to national security not just through preventive detention,
but also other measures like the imposition of curfews to deal with
civil disorder.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c53ec03a-24bb-4121-8cc1-9a4ba34e858f">
                  <a name="president-address__id-c53ec03a-24bb-4121-8cc1-9a4ba34e858f"><!--a--></a>While the ISA provides considerable
powers to deal with threats to security, it also contains important
safeguards which have been enhanced over time. An Advisory Board
chaired by a Supreme Court Judge reviews all detentions under the
ISA. In 1991, the ISA was amended to give the Elected President
veto powers such that where the Advisory Board recommends the release
of any person, that person cannot be detained or further detained
by the Government without the President's concurrence. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-422100d1-98c6-4526-9c29-7f9d190709d5">
                  <a name="president-address__id-422100d1-98c6-4526-9c29-7f9d190709d5"><!--a--></a>Determining what is a security
threat to Singapore that requires the use of the ISA is a judgement.
This judgement must be made by the elected Government of the day,
at the given time and based on the situation at hand. The ISA allows
an overall assessment of the threat posed by a person to be presented
and considered in totality, unlike a criminal case that is tried
before the courts which consider only specific acts directly related
to that charge. The ISA thus allows the Government to act quickly
to prevent a threat from developing into something very serious
such as a bombing; or to stem an organised pattern of subversion
which promotes civil disturbances and disorder. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-96b984e2-ef3b-4d16-bff8-5e2b4d58455e">
                  <a name="president-address__id-96b984e2-ef3b-4d16-bff8-5e2b4d58455e"><!--a--></a>The Government needed to
use the ISA from the 1960s till the late 1980s to counter the Communist
Party of Malaya (CPM). In the 1990s it was rarely used, except in
a handful of espionage cases. But the ISA proved critical after
11 September 2001 to protect us from global Jihadist terrorism.
Let me take Members briefly through these three periods to illustrate
how the ISA has safeguarded our security against the evolving security
threats. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6280865b-301b-4464-9ebb-b2d5b456c175">
                  <a name="president-address__id-6280865b-301b-4464-9ebb-b2d5b456c175"><!--a--></a>From the 1960s right through
to the late 1980s, the ISA was used mainly to counter the serious
threat posed by the CPM and the underground satellites or fraternal organisations
of the CPM. The CPM was determined to violently overthrow the democratically
elected governments of the day. Communism was on the march world-wide.
In South East Asia, every country faced a communist insurgency;
and in Indo-China, countries fell like dominoes under communist
regimes. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 271</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c75db0b2-e921-4e4d-8964-c1c6ecd90388">
                  <a name="president-address__id-c75db0b2-e921-4e4d-8964-c1c6ecd90388"><!--a--></a>For the CPM, Singapore and
West Malaysia were always one entity called "Malaya". The CPM's
revolutionary strategy had two tactical prongs, with priority being
given to one or the other at different times. One prong was armed
struggle by an insurgent CPM guerrilla army hiding in the jungle.
The other prong was mass struggle relying on covert infiltration
and subversion of open and legal organisations to create a communist "united
front" (CUF). This "united front" would incite and stage illegal
strikes, riots and civil strife, to de-stabilise the Government
and the State. Given Singapore's urban geography, the preferred
tactic was the "united front". Even then we were not spared deadly
terrorist incidents by CPM elements.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-198c3c6d-ee99-4a09-a212-6fd445970453">
                  <a name="president-address__id-198c3c6d-ee99-4a09-a212-6fd445970453"><!--a--></a>In the 1960s, when its armed
insurgency failed to achieve success, the CPM stepped up its united
front activities, aggressively infiltrating political parties, trade
unions and schools in Singapore. This led to rising labour and student
unrest, strikes, demonstrations, boycotts and even riots. Attacks
on the Police were common.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0c04fe50-c8c1-47b0-b6c8-1fbe59714fc4">
                  <a name="president-address__id-0c04fe50-c8c1-47b0-b6c8-1fbe59714fc4"><!--a--></a>In such a situation where
the subversive threat was hiding in legal organisations, the Government
needed the ISA to flush out and neutralise these CPM elements, separating them
from those who were not involved. Several of the CPM elements escaped
and fled to re-join the CPM insurgents in the Malayan jungles, including
two PAP Members and elected parliamentarians, who were deployed
by the CPM to its 12th Assault Unit in south Thailand. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-39738387-1b52-42be-acee-9f6049cdafd7">
                  <a name="president-address__id-39738387-1b52-42be-acee-9f6049cdafd7"><!--a--></a>Following these security
operations, ISD's assessment was that the CPM underground network
was neutralised. The Government foresaw a more peaceful decade ahead
in the 1970s, but was proven wrong. ISD later learnt that in 1968,
the CPM had issued a policy to return to armed struggle. Numerous
new CPM satellite organisations were formed. Between 1970 and 1974,
they were behind at least 35 arson and bomb incidents in Singapore.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-01657127-45f2-49bd-a5a6-bfa2bf3ef6ea">
                  <a name="president-address__id-01657127-45f2-49bd-a5a6-bfa2bf3ef6ea"><!--a--></a>In April 1970, a young girl
was killed by a CPM booby-trapped bomb in Changi. In another incident
in December 1974, the CPM elements targeted the Managing Director of
the Nanyang Manufacturing Co. Members may refer to the more detailed
accounts in the documents I have distributed [<em class="ph i">handouts distributed
to hon. Members</em>]. However, the bomb exploded prematurely in
their car at Still Road, killing two of the bombers. A third bomber
survived and fled. He was given refuge by the CPM underground who
smuggled him to Johor. While in hiding, he received assistance from
CPM supporters.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-89ae12d6-f2f5-4bb5-b54d-b953ef830259">

bomb was the Malayan National Liberation Front (MNLF) which managed
to recruit a few hundred Singaporeans from infiltrated organisations
like trade unions, Old Boys Associations, drama and cultural groups,
the Barisan Sosialis, Nantah and Singapore Polytechnic. Another
CPM organisation assassinated the Malaysian Inspector-General of
Police and the Chief Police Officer of Perak. In Singapore, the
plot against the then Commissioner of Police narrowly failed. </p>

remember the 1970s as a peaceful time and largely went about their
lives, intense security operations were continually being undertaken
to preserve that peace. More than 800 people were arrested under
the ISA in the 1970s of whom 235 were issued with Orders of Detention.
Most were detained because they were more than just sympathisers
and had provided financial, logistical and manpower support to the
CPM insurgents.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e9078d37-5532-41db-8c70-0569f7099a3c">

did not mean an end to "united front" activities which carried on
in parallel, actively radicalising local and foreign workers. A
number of these activists in the 1970s were university and polytechnic
students. Some of them also penetrated a religion-based student
group. Several of the student radicals eventually worked in the
CPM radio station, the "Voice of Malayan Revolution" in Changsha,
in China, to produce English-language broadcasts.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3c4790a2-7be3-4c80-b948-53aad23d38e7">

grievances of workers and sought to radicalise them. Their confrontational
approach resulted in strikes and even a demonstration in front of the
US Embassy in 1973 against multi-national corporations in Singapore.
In 1974, the Government charged several activists who played key
roles in inciting disorder and strife. One of them later emerged
as a key figure in the Marxist group in the 1980s.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-533089a7-a3fb-47fe-9ff3-89647efcfbde">
                  <a name="president-address__id-533089a7-a3fb-47fe-9ff3-89647efcfbde"><!--a--></a>In 1979, the CPM issued
a directive calling for higher priority to be placed on penetrating
and subverting open social and political organisations. There was
thus renewed energy to get involved in social and political activism.
Certain CPM-linked elements and their supporters infiltrated legally-registered
organisations, including some linked to the Catholic Church. Some
of these infiltrators had connections with one of those charged
in the 1970s. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ff6cf550-a0ab-4d00-90de-1711c3d775c6">

move against this group in the mid-1980s, it made clear that it
was not acting against genuine social activists or members of the
clergy, but only those who were covertly pursuing their subversive
Marxist political agenda by hiding within the church organisations.
Appreciating the sensitivities involved, the Government made every
effort to explain to the Church leadership that this was not targeted
at the Church. The Church leaders and the Vatican itself acknowledged
this publicly. Following this episode, the Maintenance of Religious
Harmony Act was passed as an additional legal instrument to keep
politics and religion separate in Singapore. </p>

the CPM laid down arms with the signing of the Peace Agreements
in Hadyai with the Thai and Malaysian governments, finally ending
the four-decade struggle against the CPM and its manifestations.
The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and the opening up of other
communist countries also eroded the credibility and appeal of communism.
Some members of the CPM armed units in the jungle, as well as many
of those who had been detained, were given help to recover their

the communist threat to Singapore was a real and serious one. Without
the resolute steps taken then by the Government, the outcome for Singapore
would have been drastically different. When that era passed, Singapore enjoyed
a period of relative calm and stability. The ISA was used during
the 1990s only to counter isolated episodes of espionage.</p>

serious threat. Al-Qaeda's global Jihadist terrorism, like communism,
is an ideology with a global agenda that advocates the use of violence.
It puts forward a distorted view of Islam and seeks to unite a trans-national
community against the "non-believers" who are viewed as "enemies
of Islam".</p>

to recruit many into its fold, including some Singaporeans who went
to Afghanistan to train and fight as mujahideen. They were so indoctrinated
by the extremist ideology that they were prepared to participate
in a terror plot with the regional Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) group against
targets in Singapore, even knowing that that would mean the loss
of many Singaporean lives. While ISD had previously found Singaporeans
flirting with violent groups like the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) or even the Hizbollah, they had never encountered Singaporeans prepared
to go as far as what the JI members were prepared to do.</p>

could take prompt pre-emptive action to neutralise and disrupt the
network. Otherwise there could have been several truck bombs targeted at
Embassies exploding in Singapore in 2002. Information from those
arrested under the ISA assisted in the arrest of the JI bomb-maker
Fathur Rohman Al-Ghozi in Manila in January 2002. He had already
amassed 1.2 tonnes of TNT and 2.4 km of detonator cord, and was
on the way to Bangkok to obtain funds to complete the purchase of
explosives for the attack in Singapore. Singapore also narrowly
missed an attack in early 2002 against Changi Airport: Mas Selamat
and his team backed off boarding the plane in Bangkok to Singapore
when their identities were exposed in the Thai newspapers. Singapore
had a third narrow miss when JI's master bomb-maker, Dr Azahari
Husin, gave up trying to stage an attack in Singapore after failing
to connect with the local JI network which had been disrupted by
ISD. Azahari then went from Johor to Indonesia to join the JI team
planning the Bali bombing.</p>

that the use of the ISA against the JI group was warranted. At the
time though, there were many sceptical voices. Some thought the
Government had deliberately exaggerated the JI threat. Others called
for those arrested to be released or openly prosecuted in court.
Court proceedings would have focused on those involved in the plot,
but stalled the investigations which uncovered the broader network. Only
after the Bali bombings 10 months later in October 2002, were the
sceptics silenced.</p>

been detained for involvement in terrorism-related activities. Although
the original JI organisation is disrupted, the regional network
has morphed into different forms – splintered groups but connected
to one another in the larger extremist network. In addition, there
is a new self-radicalisation threat which is even more difficult
to anticipate and detect.</p>

ISA continues to be relevant for Singapore, why a specific Terrorism
Act would not be adequate, and how the ISA allows a small country like
Singapore to protect itself in the face of our challenging security
threats and needs. </p>

not the only national security threat Singapore has faced or will
face in the future. The ISA has been used, for instance, against
foreign subversion and espionage as well as racial agitation. Between
1991 and 2010, there were a total of seven cases of detentions for
espionage. One case was subsequently charged under the Official
Secrets Act. Wherever possible we have prosecuted espionage cases
in court, but this is not always practicable when the danger from
compromising confidentiality of the intelligence involved outweighs
any advantage from open prosecution and conviction.</p>

security can take various forms. For example, the CPM and its affiliates
used not just terrorist violence but also covert subversion and
infiltration by an unseen network behind open and even religious
organisations in a united front to subvert the Government and the
State. They incited civil disorder and disturbances and defiance
of the law to threaten stability, order and security. </p>

the ISA as a last resort when there is a significant threat, and
other laws are not adequate to deal with the situation. Investigations
provide useful information to map out subversive organisations,
and identify key leaders, members and their roles. In many cases
a person arrested is not eventually detained; he can be released
on a Restriction Order or unconditionally, once he is no longer
a threat.</p>

activities, all were eventually released, and most have re-integrated
into society. A few were detained for longer periods because they
adamantly refused to renounce the use of violence. They were eventually
also released when communism lost its appeal, and they were assessed
to be no longer a threat.</p>

arrested post 9/11 were detained. In the first phase of the JI investigation
in December 2001, 23 people were called in for questioning. Of these,
16 were arrested under the ISA, of whom 13 were eventually detained.
Of the 60 who have been detained for terrorism-related activities
over the past decade, 43 have been released, some on Restriction
Orders. They and their families continue to receive counselling
and assistance to re-integrate back into society. Some, however,
have to remain in detention as they are assessed to continue to
pose a threat to security.</p>

is always tied to prevailing circumstances, vulnerabilities and consequences.
For example, the ISA has been used to deal with racial and religious extremism
over the decades, but calibrated to the circumstances of the time.
In the years following the race riots of 1964 and 1969, the risk
of renewed ethnic violence was high and the Government needed to
deal quickly and firmly with extremists and communalists. In current
times, those who provoke ethnic violence will still be prosecuted.
However, those who are insensitive or offensive but are unlikely
to provoke ethnic violence, may be interviewed by ISD and warned,
but they are not usually detained. Where terrorism takes on the
cloak of religion, this becomes a particularly dangerous threat,
and the Government has acted firmly and decisively. </p>

to abolish the ISA and replace it with a specific Terrorism Act.
A Terrorism Act would not allow pre-emptive action against those
who have not yet committed overt deeds that warrant prosecution,
but nevertheless belong to a wider terrorist network, unless the
Act is very broad in scope and provides for preventive detention
just like the ISA. For example, we now have a Terrorism (Suppression
of Bombings) Act passed in November 2007. But, had it existed in
2001, it could not have been used against most of the JI network.
Based on what was known at the point of arrest, only the cell involved
in taking manifest action in pursuit of the Al-Qaeda bombing plot
would be liable.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-da4e734a-1292-4eb6-b1ec-dc0ccd1f0716">
                  <a name="president-address__id-da4e734a-1292-4eb6-b1ec-dc0ccd1f0716"><!--a--></a>With the ISA, the Government
was able to systematically uncover the network in Singapore even
though not all of them were then actively engaged in terrorist operations.
Then US Attorney General, John Ashcroft speaking at the US Council
of Foreign Relations in 2003 elaborated on the new prevention paradigm:
"In the past our focus has been on traditional law enforcement –
prosecution. Prosecution is retrospective; it re-creates a past
event ... Our new ... goal of terrorism prevention, on the other
hand, involves anticipation and imagination about emerging scenarios,
the puzzle pieces of which have yet to come into alignment." He
also said there is a need to "anticipate these dangerous scenarios
and to identify, intercept and disrupt them before they become tragic
terrorist realities". Sir, when dealing with suicide-attackers, prevention,
as the US discovered post-9/11, becomes a greater imperative, compared
to prosecution after the fact.</p>

say in 2002, would probably not have adequately anticipated new
forms of the terror threat, like the self-radicalised lone-wolf
which has emerged in recent years. A case in point is the full-time
NSman who was self-radicalised through the Internet. He had expressed
intent to conduct <em class="ph i">jihad</em> abroad and had already made online contact
with a suspected Al-Qaeda recruiter and radical ideologue Anwar
al-Awlaki. But that would not have been sufficient grounds to charge
him in court, as under normal criminal legislation, he had not yet
committed an offence. The ISA enabled the Government to detain him
preventively, while he was doing his NS, just before he embarked
on demolition training in his course. We now have time to assess,
counsel and rehabilitate him. This avoided exposing Singapore to
a high, perhaps unacceptable, degree of risk. The consequence may
not just be loss of innocent lives, but also serious damage to inter-communal
relations and trust.</p>

to try the terrorism cases in court. Such trials would expose information
which terrorists could use to pursue their agenda. Sometimes, information
that uncovers security threats comes from painstaking and dangerous efforts
by our security personnel. In other instances, highly secretive
information may come from foreign security agencies, on the understanding
that we will not disclose the sources and details. The disclosure
of such information, which reveals current sources and methods of
intelligence gathering, would compromise ongoing or future counter-terrorism
operations. On the other hand, if the information is not disclosed
in court, the case could be weakened because of evidentiary requirements
in a court of law, the terrorist could be acquitted, and could walk
free to pursue more terrorist activities. </p>

threats deal with issues of race, language or religion, the very
airing of these incendiary issues in a public trial can further
exacerbate an already volatile situation as in the Maria Hertogh
communal riots in Singapore.</p>

issue of judicial review. The process of making a threat assessment
is to anticipate, pre-empt and prevent security incidents in a timely and
effective manner and this is different from our judicial processes.
A judge in court is not equipped to investigate or decide whether
there are suspicious circumstances warranting some restraint. Mischief-makers
engaged in conspiracies or other covert operations, do so in a clandestine,
furtive manner, making it impossible or extremely difficult to get
the kind of evidence that would enable a conviction in court on
a specific charge. This was the main reason why preventive detention
was needed in the first place. The ISA allows an overall assessment
of the threat to be made, based on the best possible information
available, as distinct from proof or evidence in a court for a specific criminal
charge.</p>

the final say on what constitutes a serious threat to national security
to a judge would in effect mean that the judge rather than the Government becomes
responsible for, and answerable for decisions affecting the national
security of Singapore.</p>

and accountability to act to protect national security is placed
in the hands of the Government. This is in accord with long standing
principles since Independence and going even further back to 1948,
where the Executive alone has been responsible for decisions on
national security, including arrests and detention. This matter
has been debated in this House on a number of occasions and been
re-affirmed. This is reflected in the way that the ISA is drafted.
The ISA recognises that it is the elected government which has to
carry the heavy responsibility to assess what constitutes a threat
to security, and to act on this assessment.</p>

makes the final assessment, it cannot act arbitrarily. It can only
act within the powers provided to it by the ISA, and has to follow
the procedures and abide by the safeguards specified – in particular
an Advisory Board chaired by a Supreme Court Judge, and since 1991,
the Elected President's veto powers. Otherwise, the Government can
be challenged in court. It is the Government's view that this framework
is unique and strikes an adequate balance in the present circumstances.</p>

grapple with the issue of what legal powers its government needs
to protect the security of its people, and how to balance the effectiveness
of the powers against the need for safeguards and due process of
law. Every country has to make its own decisions as to the best
approach depending on the threat it faces and its own external and
domestic environment. The Americans too face this dilemma. The US government
decided to build a detention facility at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba
to house foreign terrorists outside their legal system. They have
also had to wrestle with the legality and ethics of military strikes
to kill not just foreign but even American terrorists like Anwar
al-Awlaki, and they have decided that the government has the legal
power to do this. </p>

that a government has to make to protect its people must be made
based on an individual country's context and circumstances at the
time. In Singapore, we have a law called the ISA, which empowers
the Government to act, but it comes with a system of safeguards,
and provides the detainee certain rights which must be accorded
to him. Over the years, the Government has used the ISA in good
faith, and in a measured way in the prevailing security situations
it has had to face, keeping Singapore safe and our people secure.</p>

These include terrorism, subversion, racial and religious extremism

in the future. For the foreseeable future, Singapore will need a
law containing provisions like those in the ISA, including preventive
detention, to empower the Government to pre-empt and prevent serious
threats to our security. The precise form the law takes may evolve
with time and circumstances. But for the present, the ISA is a shield
that we need that protects us against these threats, allowing us
to deal with them swiftly and effectively before they cause us serious
and possibly permanent harm. Sir, I support the motion.</p>

to see me for assistance. She is a young mother of three. She had
to stop work at a fast food outlet suddenly because her older son,
a young teenager, had enough and told her that he was not interested
in helping to look after his younger siblings, both of whom were
very young. The middle child has some psychological problems as
he was traumatised when her husband, his father, was arrested for
drug-related offences. He is jailed for 10 years. The son had fallen
into bad company in the neighbourhood while hanging out at the Internet
cafe. What struck me most about her was how strong spirited she
was. She shared with me her joy in being able to work, to stand
on her own two feet to provide for her family, however simple it may
be. But, now, she was at a loss. As we chatted, she confided that
she had attempted suicide before but she has moved on and, with
steely-eyed determination, she emphasised that she would not go
down that path again. There was none of the griping, grumbling at
the world nor a sense of entitlement. She asked me simply, almost apologetically,
if there was anything I could do to assist her. Mr Speaker, Sir,
these are the reasons why we serve. </p>

to see how best I can help her. As a Government, we need to see
how we organise ourselves both as Government and society to help those
in need and those who are not able to help themselves. We must endeavour
to make their lives better. If possible, to go upstream before these
problems happen. These are lives that matter. As our President put
it right at the start of his speech:</p>

it must be about our sense of purpose. Why are we doing this? Who
is it for? As a Government, there will always be the bigger picture
and the proverbial rainy day to cater for. In fact, I think we are
quite well known for that. We must resolutely, I think, keep this
strength because this is the real world that we live in. This is
the responsibility of a good government – to worry about all our
nightmares so that our people can sleep in peace. But the bigger
picture and the rainy days are not ends in themselves, important
as they may be. They are imperatives but serve our more fundamental
goal and purpose. Without this sense of purpose, they will be just
policies; a collection of initiatives that we can laud about and
tick the box with. Some have shared that we should not be obsessed
with economic growth at all costs. I totally agree.</p>

have been raised by Members of this House in the last day or so.
I have received much feedback, dutifully reading almost all the

− countless emails and, importantly, heard from many a Singaporean
in person. I know there are concerns on affordability of homes,
fair employment opportunities in jobs, being paid a fair wage, adequacy
in retirement and healthcare, and so on. These are real concerns.
Though I believe that we have established systems that work and
that have provided significantly for our people, I would also be
the first to admit that we can and should improve, and we do intend
to.</p>

in the first half of the decade. It seems long ago but, if you remember,
there was the dotcom bust in 2001 and SARS in 2003-2004. Income growth
then did not do very well. Median real income growth from 2001 to
2006 was 0.1% per annum. For those at the 20th percentile (P20),
it was a negative 2.4% per annum. The Government agonised over our
prospects, wondering how we could keep the economy growing so that
we could provide jobs for our people. Opportunities opened up and
we rode the wave. Businesses grew so that jobs were created for
our people. Real incomes went up. And even though the world suffered
an unprecedented recession, from which many countries have not fully
recovered, it was on the back of the foundations laid that we bounced
back to where we are today.</p>

unemployment rate of 3.1% – not 3.9%. 3.1% is seasonally adjusted
in the second quarter. It is one of the lowest in the world. Seventy-seven percent
of Singaporeans aged 25-64 were employed in 2010, that is one of
the highest in the world. Income growth from 2006 to 2010 – the
latter half of the decade – the period where we sought to put the
economy back on track for our people, was 2.6% per annum for the
median, after adjusting for inflation, and 3.1% per annum at the
20th percentile, again, adjusting for inflation. Figures, of course,
when you compile over the decade, are 1.2% and flat, respectively.</p>

saw 1.8% real growth at $1,520 per household member. At the P20
level, it was 0.8% real growth at $750 per member before Government transfers.
Was it a mistake? Are these statistics good? Are they poor? To provide
a perspective and backdrop, let me share the following: in June
this year, the <em class="ph i">Financial Tim</em>es carried an article "Spectre
of Stagnating Incomes Stalks Globe". It basically outlined how median
male real US earnings have not risen since 1975! In Japan and Germany,
average real household incomes have also fallen. </p>

Economist</em> highlighted what the American economy is facing: "€¦
current incomes are at roughly the level of the late 1970s for those
near the bottom of the income spectrum. From a real income perspective,
the American economy has already experienced a lost decade, but
for the median household the picture is one of a generation of stagnation."
US unemployment is about 9.6%, UK's about 7.8%, Sweden 8.4%, Germany
6.9%. The NIEs are not doing too badly at 4% to 5%. Incomes too
are also stagnating. I have shared these not so that we can feel
better, but as a reference point because we do live in a real world
that is connected. I wish we were disconnected, but we are not.</p>

by Singaporeans real? They are. I hear them. All of us in this House
hear them. And just because others are in worse shape does not change the
fact that we need to improve the lot of our Singaporeans, especially
the lot of those in the lower income groups and, indeed, for the
middle incomes. We cannot eat statistics. The numbers in themselves,
while meaningful, will not feed a hungry family. </p>

did on a broader context, I think it is not too bad, but we should
do better. For example, I am not happy that the median monthly wages
for cleaners are $800. I met my resident who told me he works as
a cleaner in Changi Airport purportedly for $650. This is not acceptable.
Ms Denise Phua would be pleased to know that the Ministry of Manpower
(MOM) does have a unit that is looking at improving the incomes
of low-wage workers. In particular, we are looking at the cleaning
and security industries as they employ a large number of low-wage
workers. I believe there are meaningful things that we can do. How
we best source is one way to shape things and I believe that Government
can take the lead. And to my friend, Encik Zainal bin Sapari (<em class="ph i">In

is just part of the bigger picture. We have a whole-of-Government
effort to look at complex socio-economic issues ranging from healthcare, housing,
ageing and, of course, low-wage workers. We worked at keeping things
afloat in the last few years. We introduced Workfare Income Supplement
(WIS) in 2007. We had an unprecedented Jobs Credit Scheme to help
keep workers in employment during the last recession. $4.3 billion
was spent to save jobs by subsidising part of the employers' wage
bills. We have also invested significantly in training to help our workers
stay relevant and be employable. Workfare Training Support was introduced
in 2010.</p>

3Ms (Medisave, MediShield and Medifund). The Government has also
been taking on a greater share of the healthcare burden, with Government

January 2012, where we have announced some of the measures. It is

biodiversity in NUS, I was struck by the passion shown by our young
Singaporeans. I encouraged them to pursue their passion to care
for and fight for the environment because these are a part of our
heritage and history as well. I know that it will create tensions
for us in MND because we need to deal with the development needs
of our people. But I would rather have passionate Singaporeans than
apathetic ones. </p>

on issues like the future of our Rail Corridor, animal welfare matters,
foreign domestic worker issues very early in the policy making process. The
outcomes are still not fully determined. We have broad parameters
but we want our people to co-create these policies. I believe that
this makes sense and we need to see how this evolves over time.
We need to continue to tap on the views of our stakeholders out
there. Singaporeans. We need to co-create our own future in Singapore.
Step forward, walk with us on this journey to build something special
and meaningful for all Singaporeans. </p>

we are also very much playing a part in nation building. Nations
are not built by some big fancy notions of patriotism, but by the
foundations laid when family units are strong, when neighbours look
out for each other. Household by household, floor-by-floor, block-by-block,
as we reach out, we begin to bridge the gaps that exist in society.
I hope Singaporeans can step forward and make a difference to those
in your neighbourhood. Come forward and help us at the MPS sessions,
at our grassroots outreach to see how better we can coordinate our
efforts to help those who are in need. And on my part, I thank many
who have stepped forward, like those who came forward to help us
distribute almost 8,000 kilograms of rice in Chai Chee.</p>

a community grows and a nation is built and it will take time. When
neighbours get to know each other and care for others, we know we
will be getting somewhere. Schools play the most, I think, important
role. Our principals must focus on the true spirit of education.
Can they carry out the CIP programme, for example, in order to fulfil
the full spirit and intent of the programme? I think it is a game
changer. Can they lead, educate and inspire the teachers to do the
same and avoid being overly anxious to score points, notwithstanding
the pressures that come from parents and their expectations? Teachers
can make a tremendous difference to the lives of all their students.
Principals have a tremendous amount of autonomy to do the right
thing and I urge them to be courageous in order to place the right
emphasis.</p>

Army, I was clear that people are at the centre of everything. When
you are able to earn their respect, you win over their hearts and
minds, you nurture them to the best of your abilities, what is there
that you cannot do? As a nation, the same applies, if not more so.
If we get the people part right, I think many things will follow.
After all, what is a nation but a community and society made up
of people? It is about the society we are seeking to build. I call
on Singaporeans to step forward, to decide what Singapore means
to you, and what it means to be a Singaporean. Do not concede that
space to those who may not represent what you believe in.</p>

forward, when we begin to care for different aspects in society,
we will begin to grow as a people. What distinguishes us as humans
is our capacity to love, care and respect. Which is why such avenues,
be it with your cats and dogs, animals, our environment, and indeed
with fellow humans, caring for the less privileged in society, respecting
elders and being there for them in their twilight years after all
their contributions throughout their lives – big or small – are
critical in the building of our nation, and the forging of our heart

and this is important regarding the future of our people, particularly
with regard to CPF. Mr Yaw quoted the Mercer study. We are very
familiar with the Mercer study. They have a slightly different approach.
We have given feedback to them over the years, we do not totally
agree with their approach. It is not about right or wrong, but they
have a different way of assessing.</p>

its methodology, with some adjustments. CPF is very different from
many pension systems internationally. For one, they do not consider
that we do have a large housing component. You could argue whether
that is good or bad. If we did not have the ability to spend using
our CPF monies on housing, I think the adequacy rate would be actually
very good. But what we have is the ability to own a roof over our
heads – something which many cities out there in this world cannot
claim that, and that is important. That remains an option, at the
point of retirement, with whatever you might have left as cash in
your Ordinary Account (OA), Special, Medisave and Retirement Accounts
(SMRA), but you do have a piece of property which is by and large a
decent hedge against inflation and the various schemes to monetise
it, in different shapes and forms. We are working towards that.</p>

when <em class="ph i">The Business Times</em> published it, they did not enquire
nor seek our comments, I think importantly we are quite well aware

Mr Speaker, before I touch on the President's Speech, I would like
to add to the many references about Bhutan, as well as correct misconceptions
that have arisen in this House. I happen to visit Bhutan just before
this year's General Elections and am now involved actively in a
non-profit education project for the country.</p>

Bhutanese are happy because they have only two elected Opposition
Members. Bhutan's concept of happiness was implemented by the fourth King
in the 1970s, long before they had parliamentary democracy in 2008.
On my flight into Bhutan, I picked up this inflight magazine of
Drukair, their national airline. This page [<em class="ph i">hon. Member showed
the page to the House</em>] showed the four most important persons in
Bhutan – His Majesty the King, the Chief Abbot, the Prime Minister
and the Leader of the Opposition. Speaking with Bhutanese, I was
amazed at the respect they accorded to the Opposition, as well as
to the democracy process. </p>

Wan said that developing Bhutan wants to learn from Singapore, I
believe there are certain valuable lessons from Bhutan. The concept
of Gross National Happiness is not some fuzzy feel-good about individual
happiness as some Members alluded to, but about collective happiness
and long-term sustainability. It does measure economic indicators,
like all other countries. It also measures three other important
areas: Preservation of Culture, Preservation of the Environment
and Good Governance. Bhutan chose to do so because it wanted to
leave something for future generations, rather than mine natural
resources for short-term immediate gains or destroy the culture
that made them unique. We have seen measures to prop up our economy,
like liberal immigration and the casinos, that may have brought
immediate benefits but can lead to long-term problems. Are Singaporeans
happy with headline-grabbing economic growth when their jobs have
been impacted; or when they struggle with high cost of living; or
if family members face chronic gambling problems?</p>

my main speech. I thank the President for reminding us to do our

many issues. I will focus on education and the economy. First, I
would like to declare that I have vested interest in the education
space as an owner of several private companies offering education

have "a truly special Singapore, where our children can grow to
be the best they can be".</p>

mainstream education started with the bold 1979 Goh report by the
late Dr Goh Keng Swee, then Minister for Education. It was to address
the challenges of the day. Streaming was introduced. Singapore went
for mass production to raise the overall level of students' performance.
Schools were differentiated progressively from 1988. From 1992,
they were ranked yearly by MOE and the rankings were published.
Next, MOE published schools' actual versus expected performances. Ranking
was later replaced with banding schools of similar range of students'
academic performances together. Today, while schools are appraised
in non-academic areas, they are still banded by academic results.</p>

overall education levels, but they also created excessive anxieties
for parents and students, and widened public's perception of quality
between top and lower ranked schools.</p>

that she had asked parents in workshops to draw their impression
of our education system. One drew prison bars! There were similar
drawings by other parents expressing helplessness at being trapped
in the system. They felt helpless over the many high-stake examinations;
and pressure to get children into good schools, failing which they
deem the future of their children would be compromised.</p>

talkshow, a caller whose daughter was taking the PSLE this year
described how her family relationship became strained while preparing
for the examinations. A friend shared that his daughter in a top
school cries frequently just before examinations. I feel terrible
hearing of children having their confidence crushed and growing
up in fear of education. A former civil servant I met online wrote
that he had migrated to Finland because he did not want to subject
his son to the unhealthy system here. He wanted his son to simply
love learning.</p>

on academic performance as a benchmark of success and meritocracy,
a phenomenon I call hyper-meritocracy. Hyper-meritocracy has seen parents
who could afford it, pack children's schedule with tuition. A good
paper qualification is seen as a guarantee to a successful career.
The safe thing to do in Singapore is to score in examinations, get
a scholarship and land a secure good-paying job. This has led to
a dearth of risk-taking and entrepreneurial spirit in Singapore.</p>

observation that risk aversion will be a key challenge for him to
promote entrepreneurship. The problem of lack of entrepreneurs begins
in school, where students are conditioned not to take risks and
do not learn to handle ambiguity. In this aspect, I am happy to
work with Mr Teo as I have been working with young entrepreneurs
and students for quite some time now.</p>

that MOE is looking into Character and Value-based education. Character
and values are important guiding principles for life and must be
imparted to students. However, schools are supposed to already have
civics and moral education for years. MOE's 21st Century Skills
framework, already included character and values development. Schools,
preoccupied with measurable indicators of success, such as school
ranking and academic grades, are known to have replaced civics period
with mainstream subjects. This sends wrong signals to children that
values are not important.</p>

students and drill them for major examinations. I know of a top
school which had three full-scale preliminary examinations in addition
to mock examinations using preliminary papers of other schools,
in order to prepare students for this year's "O" levels. Principals
feel pressured into delivering academic results over other forms
of holistic development.</p>

with good intents before, but their effects are often muted because
we do not address our examination culture. At the heart of the issue
is what good education should be about. Do we sieve out academic
performers through a series of examinations so that we can concentrate
them together? Is this so because we believe we need to identify
the top 5% of each cohort who will run our country and our top companies
in the future?</p>

different world where what we know can quickly become obsolete.

about the same population size as Singapore, went the opposite direction
with their education reforms, equalising resources in schools and spreading
talents across the system. They stream students only at 15 years
old. Finnish students do well in international assessment benchmark.
Notably, it has the shortest school hours in OECD countries and
the narrowest gap between the high and low scorers, indicating education
equality. Students hardly go for tuition. I feel it is useful to study

However, I am not sure if we are more learned and more innovative,
or we are simply more exam-smart. I would like to share a story
with this House. Recently, I met a Singaporean couple who run an
international school in Bangkok. They shared the experience of their
daughter. Jazlina retained a place in a Singapore school under overseas
leave of absence. She returned in Primary 6, took her PSLE and was
admitted into an autonomous school. She spent her Secondary 2 in Singapore.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d055b57c-ef88-42dc-8d7f-5c986d405076">
                  <a name="president-address__id-d055b57c-ef88-42dc-8d7f-5c986d405076"><!--a--></a>Jazlina is a bright and
self-motivated girl who had thrived in school while in Thailand. But
under our system, she felt constrained trying to conform to a rigid
regime expecting standard answers. With a class size of over 40
students, her mother had to put her through tuition to keep pace
with the class. Jazlina started to lose self-confidence and told
her mother that "maybe I am not so smart after all". At Secondary
3, she was streamed into a subject combination that was not her
passion. After fighting the system for a few more months, the family
put her back into their own school in Thailand. Jazlina blossomed
again. She now represents Thailand in international debating competitions, where
she has won prizes. At this year's iGCSE Examinations, Jazlina aced
all her subjects and scored 100% in two subjects, including for
the subject that she was not selected to take in Singapore. Her
mother shared that had they not brought her back into a more nurturing
environment, her confidence would have plunged further. She felt
that Singapore's system was not bringing out the best in Jazlina,
but was instead drowning her.</p>

call for our children to "grow to be the best that they can be"
is a great ideal. Like Mr Lawrence Wong, I believe that education
should light up fires in children. We have to deal with many like
Jazlina, who are talented and passionate, but constrained by the
system. Instead of being obsessed about picking out winners, education
should make winners out of the ordinary. We may have done well in the
past. Based on that, we entrench our processes further without critically
considering the changing environment or its negative effects. It
has been 32 years since the Goh report. I believe it is time to
make bolder evaluation of our mainstream education.</p>

about the economy. I feel the Government has become small in areas
that it should be big in, and big in areas it should be small in.
In the last decade, Singapore has adopted a free market approach
for many Government services. Some areas like the provision of public
housing, public transport and health care, which are essential social
responsibilities of the Government, have gone this route too. My colleague,
Gerald Giam, had touched extensively on the under-capacity of hospital
beds, public transport and housing as a result of this policy. We
outsource critical areas to the private sector and hence we had
issues, such as DBSS, which had caused unhappiness due to public
housing being pushed to unaffordable levels.</p>

play a smaller role in the provision of essential services. It passed
these responsibilities to the free market. With a free market mindset,
the Government was not prepared to take risks. As a result, Singaporeans
bore the cost of the under-provision. On the other hand, in areas
that the Government should play a bigger role, it has instead grown
smaller.</p>

through the years, instead of letting private enterprises take more
initiative of the economy, our Government's share of the economy
has grown through its participation in Government Linked Companies
(GLCs). This is in contrast to countries like South Korea or Taiwan
whose government also had helped in pioneering some key businesses
but progressively withdrew to let the private sector drive growth thereafter.</p>

                  <em class="ph i">Forum</em> page wrote last week to share his experience
as an entry-level entrepreneur in Chinatown Complex. In May this
year, NEA engaged professional valuers to appraise the value of
the complex. Rent went up by 71% to 100% as a result. Keeping rental
cost manageable is important to the survival of small enterprises.
In the past few years, JTC divested many of its properties to Real
Estate Investment Trusts. I noted that rental cost of former JTC
spaces has gone up as a result, an observation shared by SME leaders
in an article in <em class="ph i">The Straits Times</em> today. Hence, SMEs today
struggle with high rental cost on top of challenging manpower cost.</p>

in tenders due to risk aversion by Government officers who may shun
smaller companies even if the solutions offered have met specifications at
lower costs. To promote the growth of SMEs, the Government could
look at ways to allow GLCs to participate only in tenders above
certain minimum values. Or GLCs and cooperatives should withdraw
totally from non-essential market segments if SMEs are capable of
fulfilling local demands.</p>

in encouraging SMEs to develop themselves further with a mindset

that have succeeded locally could end up as global winners. In Singapore,
we also have our cottage industries. I am happy to note that we
have long-established food brands like Tee Yih Jia, Sin Hwa Dee,
Polar Puffs and others that have been able to scale up globally.
It is imperative that Singapore provides the conditions to develop
more of such local enterprises. As we move forward to strengthen
our economy, I hope the Government can consider right-sizing itself
in the appropriate areas. I like to see it think big in providing
essential social services. I like to see it become small in running
domestic businesses and leave the space to grow our SMEs. With that, Mr
Speaker, I support the motion of thanks. </p>

two small points, Mr Speaker, on the impact of big government, small
government. For HDB public housing, the Member cited the example of

point of clarification.</p>

point on healthcare. We can agree to disagree, but of the total expenditure
on inpatient care for residents in 2009, for example, Medisave and MediShield
financed 23%. About 51% was borne by Government, and the remaining 27%
by employers and patients. We could disagree whether 51% is significant,
big or small, but I think that is something that we are looking

the essence of what I was trying to say is that, basically, over
the last decade, the Government has deliberately chosen a free-market approach.
Now, there are certain merits in whether we use a free-market approach
or a planned, regulated approach as we had done so in the past. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a14144e2-d84c-4acb-9625-915be5fffe0f">
                  <a name="president-address__id-a14144e2-d84c-4acb-9625-915be5fffe0f"><!--a--></a>By allowing the free economy
to dictate things, you will over the long run let demand and supply
sort itself out and things will eventually match up. But we have
seen over the last few years that there are big problems in the
three areas that I have just mentioned: housing, transport and healthcare.
My premise for this is that when you leave things to the free market,
things do not catch up and people may be unwilling to take risks because
having unsold flats, for example, does not look too good, and you
will be questioned by the Auditor-General and so on. So, yes, on
the DBSS, I am aware that it is not a big portion. I am citing it
as a case that when you go too far and let the private economy take
over the running, then there will be at some point in time when
the profit elements from the private developers will set in and
push things up. I do recognise that HDB provides the bulk of housing.
What I am saying is that there is not enough drive by the Government
to take a bigger responsibility, to take bigger risks to absorb
more of these things, to plan the capacity ahead of time, even if
it means that it might not look so good on the books.</p>

Speaker, I think it is important to make this quite clear. Our commitment
is to provide public housing for our people at affordable rates.
We have acknowledged that demand exceeded supply in the last few
years, and we will make that right and, indeed, with huge subsidies.
The Government plays a significant role and I will speak on behalf
of my colleagues in HDB who, I think, have done a fantastic job
of housing the large bulk of our population in good quality housing.
We stepped in to provide a whole range of subsidies for our people.
That is not the market. If we were to leave it to the market, we
should just take a step back, close down HDB, let the market decide
and you pay whatever price you deem fit for our country and city.
That is the basis upon which we are committed to providing for our
people and that is important to clarify. </p>

he cited the case of JTC Industrial Estates going out. He said that
this is negative from the point of view of the SMEs. It seems to
be conflicting because, on the one hand, Mr Yee advocates divestment,
smaller GLCs, but on the other hand, when there are companies that
are divested by the Government, Mr Yee mentions that it is not such
a good thing. Perhaps he would like to clarify on these points. </p>

I thank Mr Lawrence Wong for bringing up the case about JTC. I observed
from JTC's website whom they have divested to. I noticed that it is
mostly to Mapletree. When I checked the shareholding of Mapletree,
I think I would consider it as also a GLC. Some of it may have gone
to Ascendas. So, while we may have moved it off a statutory board,
we have actually moved it into a Government-linked company of some
sort. </p>

mentioned are just not my own observations. As far back as 2002,
there was an Economic Review Committee that made various recommendations and
I was very happy with those recommendations. But over time, I have
not seen many of them implemented, especially in the SME space.
I would like to see more aggressive moves to implement some of these
measures. I am aware that perhaps a competition council has been
set up. But in the areas of, for example, providing more support
for the SMEs, I think that is also quite lacking. And the observation
then in this report was that the GLCs have grown too big and that
is also time for them to divest.</p>

on the question of political education, I think something very simple
that we can start with is, for example, to understand the Constitution.
So, perhaps, at the secondary schools, we can start looking at what
does our Constitution mean, what are the roles of the Parliament,
the Executive and the Judiciary. I am pretty surprised myself, talking
to even students at university level where I used to teach at the
start of my career, that there are actually many people who are totally
politically apathetic about the environment. And one business leader
I met several years back, who gives out scholarships, told me that
he was rather disappointed with the quality of discussion with the
university scholarship holders that his company has given out the
scholarships to, because they cannot hold a proper discussion with him
about ASEAN. So I feel that, yes, we should start. On which level
– at secondary, it would be appropriate; at primary, perhaps, with
some simple introduction. </p>

for two small but vulnerable groups of Singaporeans. They are our
senior citizens who are poor or have no family, and persons with disabilities.
Some of them stand at the fringes of society and they require more
support from the Government and the community. So let me share some
of my Ministry's plans to help them.</p>

our efforts to help our senior citizens. The current Ministerial Committee
on Ageing, chaired by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, is conducting
a review on preparing our society for population ageing. MCYS is
a key Ministry contributing to this work. One of our main tasks
is on enhancing our home care and community-based services. This
is to enable our senior citizens to "age in place" in familiar surroundings and
with their friends. Another key thrust is to promote active ageing,
so that our senior citizens can live healthy and active lives within
the community. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f1b07230-424f-44c2-b504-3ccabae12ce8">
                  <a name="president-address__id-f1b07230-424f-44c2-b504-3ccabae12ce8"><!--a--></a>In addition, we must do
more for senior citizens who are poor, especially those with no
families. Strong social relationships are crucial for the elderly,
especially those who live alone or in poor health. Friendships,
communal routines, simple chit-chat and even occasional mahjong
sessions can actually prevent social isolation, and also encourage them
to become part of the community.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-98204c49-c316-4408-b230-1d7c46328de9">

vulnerable seniors to be closely connected to service providers
and the community. Currently, the Seniors Activity Centres serve
this role. They reach out to vulnerable seniors in HDB rental flats
and encourage them to interact with other seniors. All of them,
whether vulnerable or not, can then bond and support one another.</p>

the funding for these Centres from 50% to 60%. On top of this 60%,
we will introduce performance-based funding in the later part of
next year to incentivise them to perform even better.</p>

our investment in infrastructure. For instance, we are working closely
with HDB to provide additional Seniors Activity Centres to serve
new rental blocks. Within the next three years, we will build 14
new Centres. Our community partners, including VWOs and volunteers,
play a very vital role in caring for our seniors. So, in that respect,
I hope that more Singaporeans will step forward and join our efforts on

final year of the 2007-2011 Enabling Masterplan. We have made some
headway. On caregiver support, we set up the Centre for Enabled
Living as a first-stop information and referral centre for disability
and elderly services. In employment, we introduced the Open Door
Fund with WDA to help employers undertake workplace modification,
job re-design and also to provide apprenticeship opportunities for
the disabled. So far, more than 150 companies have joined the initiative,
providing work opportunities for 480 persons with disabilities.
Their contributions cannot be understated.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, since the end of the General Elections, I often
meet friends, relatives and grassroots leaders who tell me, "Now,
there are nine Opposition MPs in Parliament, the next Parliament
sitting should be very good to watch!" From the short exchanges
that we saw a while ago, it appears to be true.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-49e6d816-7a1d-4cc5-8de2-30b107321e2c">
                  <a name="president-address__id-49e6d816-7a1d-4cc5-8de2-30b107321e2c"><!--a--></a>After listening to such
comments for a few times, I thought more deeply about the issue.
There are two issues that we need to think about. Firstly, what
is the purpose of the opposition in Parliament? Is it to go against
the ruling party? Secondly, why must parliamentary debates be "good
to watch"? What does it mean to be "good to watch"?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-fbb6adb1-f3f2-42fd-8aa7-412243d3eb70">
                  <a name="president-address__id-fbb6adb1-f3f2-42fd-8aa7-412243d3eb70"><!--a--></a>When I asked them these
two questions, majority of the answers are: of course, the opposition
party must oppose the Government! If not, why should they be called opposition
parties? Another answer is, parliamentary debates have always been
boring, with no fireworks. Now, several opposition party members
have been voted in, when they lock horns during debate, it will
definitely be very colourful.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0b054904-5b5b-411e-b2c5-6511d3f7333e">
                  <a name="president-address__id-0b054904-5b5b-411e-b2c5-6511d3f7333e"><!--a--></a>In my opinion, a Parliament
sitting is a very serious business. The purpose is not for it to
be "good to watch", but to discuss important national issues. Hence,
MPs should not be engaged in endless noisy squabbles, just for the
sake of making it interesting. The parliamentary debates have been
ongoing for two days. Indeed, there have been some views that are
more offensive. On the other hand, the response from the other side
has also been clear and animated. Both camps have guarded their
territories firmly, not giving way to the other side.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-37e5d079-7e03-4370-b811-b407366b4ab4">
                  <a name="president-address__id-37e5d079-7e03-4370-b811-b407366b4ab4"><!--a--></a>The views of the opposition
parties are mainly directed at Government policies and directions,
and the side effects of the implementation of these policies. But
we know that there is an ancient saying, "The wise man may have
a thousand worries, but he may make one mistake." There is no perfection
in life. If there is perfection, there will not be so many people
who take up religion and cultivate themselves, with the hope that
they will go to heaven when they die. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1bc2ee88-fed5-404e-94db-ef99fc4590c5">
                  <a name="president-address__id-1bc2ee88-fed5-404e-94db-ef99fc4590c5"><!--a--></a>Since there is no perfect
life, there is no perfect government and no perfect policy. Since
policies are not perfect, the ruling party and the opposition party
MPs have the right to point out the mistakes, make suggestions for
the Government to consider. As the saying goes, "If there are mistakes,
one should correct it; if there are no mistakes, one should be complimented".
It is the responsibility of the Government to listen carefully,
analyse in detail and execute carefully. But I must point out that
criticising policies is not the exclusive right of the opposition
parties. Sometimes, when the backbenchers of the ruling party "scold"
the Government, they are even more "fierce" than opposition party
MPs. It is this principle and attitude of placing "logic before kinship"
that is one of the factors contributing to Singapore's success.
The backbenchers of the ruling party are not merely "yes-men". </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-650ae61d-85cd-4705-a08e-cd2f8201c40a">
                  <a name="president-address__id-650ae61d-85cd-4705-a08e-cd2f8201c40a"><!--a--></a>After listening to the debate
in the last two days, I think the views expressed by MP for Aljunied
GRC, Mr Chen Show Mao, have indeed brought about a fresh style.
Actually, I feel that at the end of his speech, we should give him
warmer applause. He quoted a Confucius saying, "Gentlemen promote
harmony inspite of differences". And he has used another quotation
from Confucius, to encourage the Government to be more tolerant.
These words resound well and I agree. And, in fact, this has always
been the policy of the PAP. "The sea accepts water from a hundred
rivers", the ruling party has left no stone unturned in discovering
new talents, and look for the best with capability to serve our
nation. In the current Government and Parliament, there are Ministers
and MPs who, before entering politics, disagreed with the Government's
directions and policies, and would voice their views openly, for
example, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman, Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,
former Minister Mr Raymond Lim, etc. Furthermore, the Government
amended the Constitution to allow Non-Constituency Members of Parliament
and Nominated MPs to enter Parliament. So, we can see that the Government
has adopted the attitude that "tolerance brings about greatness"
and to "seek common ground while accepting differences". </p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-b77ecfc9-e6ea-43bc-8719-60755c221d7a"><!--a--></a>Mr Chen, besides quoting
from ancient history, has also quoted Mr Chen Duxiu, "if there is
no party outside the party, this is emperor's mentality", to explain
his views. With regard to this quote, I have a different interpretation.
In the literal sense, the meaning of this quote is, "If there is
only one party and no other parties, it is a feudalistic imperial
mindset". In today's Singapore, besides the People's Action Party,
there are more than 20 other political parties. Including Mr Chen
Show Mao, all of them have the right to express a different viewpoint.
In fact, this is a manifestation of our society's tolerance. So
I believe that a better way to describe the political system of
Singapore would be to say, "Parties outside the party, this is democratic
mindset". But, since Mr Chen admired Mr Chen Duxiu, I would like
to share with him some background of Mr Chen Duxiu. Mr Chen Duxiu
was a former party leader in the Chinese Communist Party, but when
his personal view deviated from the party's direction, he sought
out people within the party who sympathised with him and formed
his clique. In the end, he was expelled from his party. As to who
was right and who was wrong, it is difficult for outsiders like
us to know. However, Mr Chen Duxiu and other communist party members,
perhaps, were lacking in tolerance for other views, and this was
the reason why they could not tolerate each other, and this is a
lesson we must learn from. </p>

country, what we have today was achieved due to the combined effort
of all Singaporeans and our willingness to work together, to advance together.
Particularly, with the turbulent and uncertain international political
and economic situation, we need to strengthen our core competitiveness,
instead of having different opinions, and veer away from the objective
of unity, as this may lead to division amongst our people. </p>

the period under Emperor Jiaqing, a governor of Yunnan and Guizhou
by the name of Zhao Shentian wrote a couplet, "To be in politics,
there is no need to talk too much, but you must always examine yourself
and overcome your limitations; As an official, you must be aware
of the big picture and be concerned about the people's livelihood."
Its emphasis is on the fact that those in politics do not need to talk
too much, but must be able to see the big picture.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0cc0ee57-c609-49ce-b84d-449c1c973a52">
                  <a name="president-address__id-0cc0ee57-c609-49ce-b84d-449c1c973a52"><!--a--></a>I really appreciate this
couplet, for the spirit it manifests. The meaning of the couplet is
quite clear: those in politics must always "be diligent, be honest,
be careful in talking", in another words, engage in less empty talk
and do more. Do better things and exercise self-discipline, not
pursue self-interest when considering all matters. Think of the
big picture, and never forget the harmful effects of wrong policies
on people's livelihood. As MP Chen says, the ruling party does not
have special rights to be patriots. For the love of our country,
regardless of whether one is the ruling party or opposition party, everyone
should place national interest above all else, and regard promoting
national cohesiveness as the main priority. Hence, I am most willing
to share this couplet with both ruling party MPs and opposition
party MPs the spirit that it manifests should be the aim that all
of us pursue together.</p>

mentioned that he would like to emulate Wei Zheng of the Tang Dynasty.
Wei Zheng is one of the extraordinary Prime Ministers in the thousand-year
history of China. He helped Emperor Tang Tai Zong create the historically renowned
"era of Zhenguan". MP Chen has great ambition to emulate Wei Zheng
and that is admirable. But I believe that MP Chen should also realise
why Wei Zheng is special. Not only did he have special views, he
was also fearless and he did not work for self-interest. I would
like to talk about a story to illustrate the uniqueness of Wei Zheng.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6cb7b4fb-edb1-4a8c-885a-9a67a6c09830">
                  <a name="president-address__id-6cb7b4fb-edb1-4a8c-885a-9a67a6c09830"><!--a--></a>It is written in classical
Chinese, so I seek your tolerance. In the second year of Zhenguan,
Emperor Tang Tai Zong asked Wei Zheng, "How do you define an enlightened
Emperor? How do you define an ignorant Emperor?". Wei Zheng answered, "The
enlightened Emperor listens to all sides; the ignorant Emperor listens
only to one side." What this story means is, one day, Emperor Tang
Tai Zong asked Wei Zheng, what does it mean to be a wise Emperor?
Wei Zheng replied and said that a wise Emperor is one who is willing
to listen to all views, while the Emperor who listens to only a
small group of close aides is unwise. So there are two principles
here. Although this is advice given to Emperor Tang Tai Zong, Wei
Zheng himself put it into practice as well. As a dutiful and responsible
official, one must ensure that one is fair and does not listen to one
side. </p>

Wei Zheng as an example that he would like to emulate, when his
view is different from that of his party, I hope he will be able
to look at the big picture and express his view, and not be a "yes-men"
to his party.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-64aea9f2-7d7e-4344-b811-63b8b205e7c7">

"Do not do unto others what you do not wish others to do unto you".
Whilst discussing the issue of tolerance, may I be bold enough to amend
this phrase slightly, and say that "what you would wish, do it to
others". If what you wish is other people's desire, then do it for
others, that is real tolerance. So I hope that all of us will be
tolerant and have the same mindset to work for our people, work
for our society, bring about greater benefits to everybody.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, before I start my speech, I want to make reference
to what M<span class="ph hcInline hcMember">r Yee Jenn

NTUC co-operatives, which I feel are rather negative. But certainly
let me declare my interest as the CEO of NTUC FairPrice. </p>

FairPrice. It is a co-operative set up with a social mission. In
fact, all NTUC co-operatives are set up with a social mission. In
the case of NTUC FairPrice, it is to moderate the cost of living.
We employ over 8,000 staff, largely local, nowhere near the foreign
quota that we have. It is a deliberate policy. Our staff − a fair
number of them are mature workers. Again, we are a big supporter
of mature workers. </p>

said, in fact, NTUC FairPrice is a big promoter of local SMEs. Talk
to the farms in Singapore − eggs, vegetables and, more recently,
fish farms. Fish farms which never existed but because two years
ago, we talked to them, and there were a few entrepreneurs who were
there and they formed a co-operative. We guaranteed to buy from
them, and now they are thriving. </p>

respond to crisis that I think NTUC social enterprises make an important
contribution to Singapore. Go back over the years − whether it is
SARS, whether it is Bird Flu, whether it is rising prices in rice,

market, would things have happened the way they have? We were the
first. And we always try to be the last retailer to have to raise
prices but we strive to be the first one to drop prices. </p>

"inclusive growth" sounds new, it, in fact, has a traditional meaning
within Singapore, and I think this meaning serves us well. There
is, however, a way in which its meaning has changed – and by this
I mean that growth now includes foreigners as well. </p>

we know that it is not just growing for Singaporeans. In fact, it
is growing for everyone who has a stake in, and benefits from its
growth. This includes everyone who lives and works here – whatever
the colour of their passports, whatever their accents when they
speak. So we grow and grow and grow, and over the past few years,
this growth has meant more crowded roads, more expensive homes and,
probably, a bit of an exaggeration, less air for Singaporeans to breathe.
At least, this is what it feels like. Sir, this is not a political
rant, but I think we do want some answers. For one, what is the
Government's long-term population policy for Singapore? I believe
there are physical limits to growth, and I think that we are going
to have to hit these limits at some point. </p>

now, I have a more specific point. So, we have grown and will continue
to do so, but is the growth for Singaporeans? The political answer
is always yes, growth is for Singaporeans. But I would like to move
beyond rhetoric and propose three specific ways to make growth real
for Singaporeans from the lower half of the income bracket. </p>

When we say that growth needs to be real for every Singaporean,
we need first to recognise that there is no such thing as a typical Singaporean.
There is a father, struggling to feed his family of five on a salary
of $1,500 a month; there is a single mother, who is angry and depressed
that she cannot get maintenance payments; and then there are elderly
parents, who go to the Tribunal of Maintenance of Parents to get
their children to cough up $50, $100 for them. And then there are
very difficult problems which money cannot solve – sportsmen who
need time off from school or from National Service, young people
who need to be weaned off their TVs, young girls who need help with
eating disorders. </p>

for each one of them does not always require a debate in Parliament.
It requires us to fund and empower the many small and multifarious
groups who are working on the ground. Within the Government Parliamentary
Committee (GPC) for Community Development, Youth and Sports, we
have actually organised ourselves into smaller groups to focus on
certain broad areas covering various issues. </p>

Helping the Needy and Persons at Risk, Caring for the Elderly and
Persons with Disabilities, Strengthening Families, Promoting and
Enabling Many Helping Hands, Strengthening Community, Fostering
a Sporting People, and Developing and Engaging Youth. In each category,
there will be a few of us looking into them in greater detail. </p>

very wide scope and portfolio that the Ministry covers and allows
each member to also pursue the area they are passionate about. Sir,
I would like the Government to identify the groups of people in
most urgent need of help and to announce its targets to make economic
growth real for them.</p>

better. Sir, in the West, the mega rich, led by Warren Buffet, have
asked to be taxed more so that they can help their Government. Here,
we do not see the same, perhaps our rich are not so rich, or our
Government not so poor. But I would like to think that the rich
did feel the same sense of duty to help those less well off than
them, and the Government too feels the same need for fiscal prudence
that some funds ought to come from the community.</p>

Government to give further incentives to the rich who donate. For
example, donations to some institutions currently get double or
2.5 times tax deductions. Recently, the Government announced an
extension of the increase of deductions to 2.5 times till 2015.
Sir, can I ask the Finance Minister what the revenue implications
of this increase is and, correspondingly, what is the increase in
donations? </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 299</p>

deduction has been able to draw in more donations, is it revenue neutral
from the Government's perspective? I suggest that the Finance Minister
consider making this 2.5 times tax deduction a permanent one or
even increase it to three times. This is because not all money is
alike – there is a special effect when public utilities and social
services are produced and provided by the community, and through
self-help, rather than Government funding. There is heart as well
as money in these efforts. </p>

propose that the Government funds sports differently. Yesterday,
Acting Minister Chan Chun Sing said sports will be used as a strategy
to bond communities. I fully support this. In fact, I want to make
specific recommendation and propose that Government funds sports
differently – I think we should care less for medals and more for
heart – for the character development that sports can bring about. We
should shift more funding and resources from sports excellence to
sports for all. </p>

chance to play many sports in school; many pretty badly, one or
two quite well, but I enjoyed them all. Indeed, my favourite subject
in primary school was PE. The lessons I learnt about endurance,
being undaunted by defeat, being humble in victory, the notion of
being "a good sport" is not just for the tennis, squash or badminton
courts, or on the football field or the netball courts or the golf
course but also in the boardroom and in Parliament. </p>

too few opportunities to try out and experience sports that they
are "not good" at. I remember one interview which an MP for Pasir
Ris-Punggol GRC – he is not here now – said that he had to play
in the girls' softball team because he wanted very badly to play
but he was not good enough for the boys' team. But since then, he
has become a very good and active sportsman. I must congratulate
him on this very innovative solution, but I think there are many
other boys who may not have the same ingenuity nor courage. </p>

strengthen the engagement with youths and getting them to take ownership

MCYS and MOE to work together on this front and I am sure they will.

through sports, not counting medals, but counting the healthy, happy and
slightly less myopic kids we will have as a result. </p>

services. Sir, the ageing population has been a challenge for Singapore
for many years. I would like to identify what I believe to be one
possible pressing problem – the lack of affordable and qualified
manpower for nursing homes in Singapore. Up to 70% of the 4,000
formal long-term care workers in Singapore are foreigners – mainly
from the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, and they are doing
a good job. Roughly a third of these foreign workers are registered
nurses while the rest are healthcare attendants and nursing aides.
Currently, not that many Singaporeans take up such jobs. Perhaps,
it has to do with the perception of such jobs and maybe the skills
set. This may take some time to change but we should ensure that
these nursing homes are not under-staffed, especially as I expect
the demand for their services to be higher.</p>

encourage locals to take up these jobs, but if this is not forthcoming,

ageing population is a corollary to the falling fertility rate. Certainly,
there is no silver bullet to solve these critical issues which many
countries are facing. Our strength in the past has been long-term
and integrated planning, as well as a cooperative spirit among our
agencies. But in the past, we sailed in waters that others have
gone before. We worked on the economy and we worked on national infrastructure.
Now, we chart our own course, and we deal with perils that others
have not encountered. Sir, now more than ever, we need to stand
together and row and steer as one united people. Sir, I support

part of my speech to how we should be helping the people to cope
with the rising cost of living. First, cost of food. The recent
announcement by Minister Vivian Balakrishnan on reviving the building
of hawker centres is indeed a welcoming move. As there are more
and more Singaporeans eating out, the addition of more hawker centres
will undoubtedly give Singaporeans more choices and, hopefully, more
economical food. And I hope that out of the 10 new hawker centres,
the Minister will put one in Nee Soon South. I am also heartened
to hear from the Minister that the hawker centres will be non-profit
oriented. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3e1bc75e-a39e-4346-b0c5-842d89bced9a">
                  <a name="president-address__id-3e1bc75e-a39e-4346-b0c5-842d89bced9a"><!--a--></a>I would like to suggest
to the Minister that only hawkers who are Singaporeans and who will
operate the stalls themselves are allowed to lease the stalls. No
subletting is allowed. This will provide Singaporeans with jobs
and give them the opportunity to own their business and, at the
same time, a way to ensure that our authentic dishes will not become
extinct. Besides that, the design of hawker centres should incorporate
the designated place for patrons of hawker centres to return the
used bowls and cutlery. This habit has been practised in schools
and army camps, but why is it not practised when we go out into
the workforce? I would think that it is because of the design of
the hawker centres.</p>

is a hot topic in relation to living costs. Efforts in the past
months to construct more BTO flats as well as raise the income ceiling
for first-time flat buyers are commendable. We know that the queue
is getting shorter and I have full confidence that the demand for
the first timers will be fully met. </p>

the Minister that he will be looking into the needs of the vulnerable
families. Within this group, I would like to urge the Minister to
look into the single parents. Many of them are single not by choice
but circumstances have forced them to get a divorce. For some, this
also means the loss of a roof above their heads, loss of major income
and they have to take care of the children by themselves. Sometimes,
they are also stressed by fierce contests in courts. To many parents,
a roof for them and their children can help them to take off some
stress. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-047fd29c-c14f-41d4-9d24-5cef8e5fdfdf">

is very compassionate. You were elected on 7 May. But very often,
the civil servants follow very closely according to the book. Many
of my residents tell me that for those who are involved in divorces,
they are allowed to buy flats only upon completion of the divorce
proceedings and normally this can take up to about a year or even
longer. So, I hope the Minister will cut their waiting time.</p>

to consider making housing loans available for all first-time buyers.
This will also take the stress off their parents. Otherwise, they
may have to spend their lifetime savings to buy a new home for their
children, instead of saving for their retirement.</p>

re-focus its efforts on its mission, that is, to make readily available
basic affordable housing for the people, that is, the working class
families. There is no need for HDB to do iconic projects like Pinnacle@Duxton
and Dawson, and these are the projects that I am very sure private
sector developers are capable of doing it. </p>

The healthcare sector can expect greater demands on medical services.
The Health Ministry has done a good job in some areas like awareness about
mental health, making treatment for mental health problems more
readily available and affordable. </p>

that we allow pregnant women to use their Baby Bonus for their pre-natal
care as this will lighten their financial burden. It is not cheap
to give birth in Singapore. The several thousand dollars can be
several months of salary for some.</p>

pensioners and their spouses are entitled to medical benefits for
working in the civil service sector. When the pensioner passes on,
the spouse is no longer entitled to the benefit. A big group of
these are aged women. I hope the Government can be more sympathetic
by extending to the surviving spouse a lifetime enjoyment of medical
benefits. I believe this group is not big.</p>

of transport. First, I would like to thank the Minister for reducing
the hours of evening ERP for north bound CTE. I had spoken on this
several times in Parliament in the past. I am glad that now, my
residents can go home earlier.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a14a4add-2186-44e6-a9b0-9e63fdb77021">

Minister to further consider cancelling the evening ERP and the
ERP on Saturdays. As most people spend weekdays at work or at school,
the only time to do family visitations and bonding activities is
over the weekend. I think a little bit of traffic jam in the evening
or weekend is acceptable.</p>

appealing to the Minister to grant polytechnic students the same
transport concession benefits as the junior college (JC) students.
As more youths are turning to polytechnic as an alternative route
to higher education, the transport concession can lighten the financial
load of the parents. </p>

I would also like to see that MOE change its system to ensure that
all pre-tertiary students can enjoy equal opportunities to go to
university. Recently, I met a student who went to do "N" level,
ITE and then polytechnic. He applied to a local university. He told
me that his classmate in the polytechnic got a place in the local
university, but not him, and they have exactly the same score. So
I contacted the local university. To my surprise, I was told that
the polytechnic GPA only contributes 80% of the total grades. Another
20% is the "O" level results. For the student who did not do "O"
level, this is really unfair to them. These are the students who
are late bloomers and if they can do equally well in the polytechnic,
they should be given the same opportunity to go to university. I
hope the Minister can review this.</p>

the Minister to create more university places for the polytechnic
graduates as there are more and more students who choose to go to
the polytechnics, instead of JCs. Yesterday, I am very happy to
hear from Minister of State Lawrence Wong that there will be thousand
more places in Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)
next year. I would like to know how many places would be allocated
to the polytechnic students.</p>

times the call for supporting Singaporeans, that is, Singaporeans
first. I also support that. I would like to let you know the concern
of another group of Singaporeans, that is, the SME employers whom
we normally call them small <em class="ph i">towkays</em>. Many businessmen have
told me that the MOM's attempt to ensure employment of Singaporeans
by increasing the costs of hiring foreign workers and reject many
Work Pass renewal applications has caused a lot of hardship to the
SMEs. They have trained up the workers and they have to send them
back when their Work Pass renewal is rejected and then they have
to hire more expensive, fresh foreign workers for those sectors
that they really cannot find Singaporeans. There are also cases that
businesses are facing the danger of closing down because their application
for new foreign workers is not approved. I think we need to strike
a balance. Yes, we need to be stringent for the applications of
new foreign workers. However, when it comes to renewal of existing
workers − they have to be in Singapore working for the last few years,
have been trained and are familiar with the company operations −
I think we need to be more helpful to these SMEs.</p>

Although the casinos provided many job opportunities during our
last economic recession and boosted our tourism revenues, there
has been an increase in cases such as illegal moneylending, problem
gambling and cheating. </p>

from residents in consecutive day. They were being harassed by loansharks.
So, I went to find out from the Police on the recent happenings in
Nee Soon South. According to the Police, from January to September
2011, there were 113 cases of illegal moneylending activities in
Nee Soon South. During the same period in 2010, there were 112 cases.
From January to June, there were more than 6,000 cases in the whole
of Singapore. This is an alarming figure. It means that every other day,
there is one case involving loansharks.</p>

repercussions brought about by the casinos also include family violence,
broken families and emotional and mental stress brought upon both adults
and children. Temptation is always difficult to resist when it is
within reach. </p>

to see me. She is a young female resident, married with a seven-year-old
son. When she came to see me, she was very depressed. She said three to
four years ago, her husband started gambling. Back then, when there
were no casinos, he was involved in soccer betting. As a result,
he owed a lot of debt. Recently, banks even came to their house
to compile an inventory of their furniture. This made her and her
son very stressed out. She said that she has decided to leave her
husband. This is a real life example of the destructive nature of
gambling.</p>

the casinos should be tourists and tycoons, not Singaporeans. I
hope the Minister can impose more measures to prevent Singaporeans from
gambling at the casinos. I think increasing the entrance levy and
doing away with the annual pass are possible solutions. Perhaps,
the $100 entry levy is not enough to deter Singaporeans from going
to the casino. While others feel that since they have paid for the
annual pass, they should go to the casino more often. In addition,
we need to do more, in terms of education, so that from young, Singaporeans
understand the evils of gambling and how to stay away from it. </p>

from going to the casino, I think we should also restrict foreign
workers from entering too. I heard from employers that their staff
often visit the casinos and their productivity suffer. As some will
feel happy after winning, they will keep thinking of when they can
go to the casino again; while those who lost money will think of
where to find the cash so that they can go back to the casino again
to recoup their losses, to the extent that they lose interest in
their work. </p>

Lastly, I would like to touch on smoking. We have over the years
been trying to bring home the message to smokers as well as the
young people that this habit is bad for their health. Somehow, it seems
to fall on deaf ears. However, we should continue to press this
message home. I would like to urge the Ministry to consider extending
the non-smoking areas to include public parks, pavements, beaches,
lift lobbies and building corridors. But what is important is enforcement.
Otherwise, it will not be effective. </p>

                  </span>:
Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion to express
our thanks to the President for his Speech made on behalf of the Government.
The Government has set as its objective that, "We want to make Singapore the
best home for all Singaporeans. Its goal is to create a better life
for all and the Government will seek inclusive growth that benefits
all citizens." </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-acbde060-7ec1-4824-8ec1-a90c87949ea6">
                  <a name="president-address__id-acbde060-7ec1-4824-8ec1-a90c87949ea6"><!--a--></a>Several of my parliamentary
colleagues have spoken on some of the issues which they would like
the Government to consider. Allow me to add to the issues which
the Government should look into to achieve these objectives.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0e33f062-0823-463a-a9a9-10725f32d2b3">
                  <a name="president-address__id-0e33f062-0823-463a-a9a9-10725f32d2b3"><!--a--></a>Let me first talk about
education. Over the past months, I have met up with many residents
and discussed issues about the education landscape in Singapore.
Many parents have expressed their deep concern about the heavy workload
and high stress level for their children in school. Sir, I know
that Singapore has a highly regarded education system and our students
have performed well in international rankings for Mathematics, Science
and Reading. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-80ffa9a3-8f16-4a41-8f3a-ba03d6b22c6a">
                  <a name="president-address__id-80ffa9a3-8f16-4a41-8f3a-ba03d6b22c6a"><!--a--></a>But many parents are not
concerned about the ranking. Their concern is about the welfare
of their children. They basically want a better life and a less
stressful life for their children. They ask whether MOE is trying
to teach the children too much. Is there too much stress in the
school system? Despite the "Teach less, Learn more" initiative,
many parents feel that the schools are teaching anything but less.
Feedback suggests that students in primary school are learning subjects
which should be taught in secondary schools. The common complaint
is that students are given far too many assignments or homework
at a young age. Are we robbing our children of their childhood?
Taking away their time of leisure and play? </p>

no stress. Some stress is good for students. I look at my 12-year-old
daughter who has just finished her PSLE earlier this month. Some
stress is good to spur her and her classmates on, maybe not their
parents. I think MOE should calibrate to balance having sufficient
joy in learning versus too much stress in school. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-523267d2-7b72-40ac-9c55-6651ea53ae6f">
                  <a name="president-address__id-523267d2-7b72-40ac-9c55-6651ea53ae6f"><!--a--></a>Sir, I urge MOE to review
the school curriculum. We should try to reduce the content of academic
subjects being taught. Surely, some of the academic content can
be taught at a later stage in school. We need to strike a right
balance to ensure that children learn relevant skills in schools
– eg, importance of lifelong learning, ability to be creative, ability
to carry out research as well as learning interpersonal skills.
To me, these are far more relevant than rote learning and accumulation
of information. </p>

a study to find out why is the tuition industry such a million dollar
industry. If our school system is so well regarded, then why are
so many students so reliant on tuition? MOE should assure parents
that whatever is taught by the teachers in schools is adequate.
If the parents are not convinced, then find out why. Are the teachers
teaching too fast; is the school rushing to finish the syllabus?
Do parents feel that their child is not receiving sufficient attention
from the teacher? Why do they need additional help from the tuition
centre? Would teachers be prepared to conduct more remedial classes
for the weaker students? Could MOE set as a goal that no additional tuition
should be required save in exceptional circumstances? Thus, after-school
hours should be a time for children to rest or relax; or to pursue
their own interest and dreams, and not to cramp more school-based
work. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2b3957a7-fefc-4e28-a438-7bdf93531fe0">
                  <a name="president-address__id-2b3957a7-fefc-4e28-a438-7bdf93531fe0"><!--a--></a>Sir, let me talk next about
values. I support the decision of MOE to place more emphasis on
inculcating strong values amongst students. This is an area in which
I had expressed concern over for the past few years. I am always
concerned that schools place more importance on academic achievement
as compared to the importance of inculcating the right values for
our younger generation. Values like kindness, consideration for
others, being grateful and humility – if these values are properly imbibed
in our students, they are demonstrated by our teachers in schools
everyday, then these values will stay with our students for the
rest of their lives. And this would help to make Singapore a more
gracious society, a home that we can all be proud of.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bd07f2af-cadf-4691-992a-7fe567ac476b">
                  <a name="president-address__id-bd07f2af-cadf-4691-992a-7fe567ac476b"><!--a--></a>Sir, let me talk about foreign
students in schools. Many parents whom I spoke to have responded
positively to the call for Singaporeans to build our future together.
However, many have asked for more opportunities to share the fruits
of their labour as they work with the Government to build up the
country. In this regard, I would like to urge MOE to review the
number of foreign students studying in our schools and our universities. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-09b5f6fe-fe9d-4d0a-8c41-0bf1c330b5e1">
                  <a name="president-address__id-09b5f6fe-fe9d-4d0a-8c41-0bf1c330b5e1"><!--a--></a>Singaporeans recognise that
foreign students have a role to play in Singapore. They expand the
Singapore network, they contribute to the diversity of views and,
in many cases, they help to raise the academic standards of the
entire class. But there has been frequent feedback that foreign
students who receive scholarships to study in Singapore take advantage
of the system. Some occupy scarce places in our schools and aim
for a free ride to universities in other countries. In contrast,
Singaporeans have to fight hard for limited places in good schools
and in our local universities. Singaporeans who cannot secure places
in our local universities are naturally unhappy that they have to
pay high fees for overseas university education when there are places
taken up by foreign students who do not appreciate these places.
So, these Singapore students feel that the excessive intake of foreign
students has taken away the limited places that could be given to
them. I urge MOE to gradually reduce the number of foreign students
to not more than 10% of each class in our schools or universities.
And this is especially so for popular faculties like Medical school
and Law school. This would allow entry for more Singaporeans. A
review in this area, Sir, would help build confidence that our policies do
benefit all Singaporeans.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-77964a4e-c9ac-4a7a-a916-968c6643b9e8">
                  <a name="president-address__id-77964a4e-c9ac-4a7a-a916-968c6643b9e8"><!--a--></a>As Singapore becomes more
mature as a society, I urge the Government to consider doing more
for the special needs education sector. I understand that MOE is
conducting a review of the SPED schools and the hon. Member <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">Ms Sim Ann</span> is
heading the MOE Committee on this matter. Sir, this is a step in
the right direction and I urge the Government to devote more financial
resources to this area. Students who have special needs can then
have a better opportunity to share in the well-being of this country.</p>

of seniors. Sir, I applaud the efforts by MOM to ensure that there
is continual training for Singaporeans so that they will remain employed.
However, for certain industries where we have shortfall of trained
staff, eg, teachers and nurses, can the Government promote the re-hiring
of retired staff so as to reduce our dependence on foreign workers.
In fact, my colleague has just stated that 70% of healthcare workers
are foreigners.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b50d37b2-76f8-4d93-9501-be7fc1b7ffd7">

from retired nurses and teachers who feel that their jobs are being
taken away by younger foreign staff who are less experienced but
less expensive. Perhaps, the Government can consider creating more
incentives for hospitals or nursing homes to re-hire retired nurses
rather than allow market forces to dictate. Some of our more experienced
retired staff will be more expensive. But we should send the right signal
that we value our experienced staff by re-hiring them. </p>

centres. Earlier this year during the Committee of Supply debate,
I called on the Government to reconsider its policy not to build
any more hawker centres. And I am indeed happy to hear of MEWR's
recent announcement that they plan to build more hawker centres
over the next 10 years. Minister Vivian is not here but I am not
appealing to him, as I have three hawker centres in my constituency.
But I feel that hawker centres can help to keep costs of living
lower because the cooked food or market produce sold can be priced
lower. May I urge the Government to accelerate the building of the
hawker centres. I also repeat my call to the Government not to tender
these stalls at market prices, instead allocate them at subsidised
rent to the lower income. This can be similar to the way that we
deal with social enterprise. Let us keep the rental of these stalls
low so that we can offer the less skilled, less educated, an opportunity
to run their own business or become financially independent.</p>

A common bugbear from my residents is the irregularity and unreliability
of bus services. To make Singapore the best home for all Singaporeans,
we need to do more to ensure that we have a more efficient, reliable
bus system. I have waited at bus stops to personally experience
the frustration of my residents waiting for a bus to bring them
to work during morning peak hours. And the feedback is that the unreliability
of the service is on a regular basis. </p>

for Transport is monitoring this closely. The Public Transport Operators
(PTOs) are also doing their part to bring in more buses. I urge
the PTOs to make more improvements in an expeditious manner so that
Singaporeans can have access to a world-class standard of public
transport. More buses ought to be provided for each service so that
they can arrive in a timely and predictable manner most of the time. </p>

have asked for new bus routes to be introduced to provide greater
accessibility. I urge LTA to invite other operators to run a full
service for the route if the existing PTOs decline to run the proposed
service. This should not be seen as cherry-picking because the right
of first refusal would have been given to the PTOs to operate the
service.</p>

source of great frustration for many. In particular, I have come across
many singles who complain that they are unable to buy a flat directly
from HDB. I urge a review of this policy. And I am glad the Minister
earlier this afternoon has said that he will address the needs of
this group more fully in due course. Singles contribute to the growth

As the Adviser for the area, I have seen the excellent outreach
by the VWO. It had utilised its resources to carry out plans to

and the appeals by the VWO, MCYS decided that it will reduce funding
because the emphasis on its objectives has changed. The VWO was
asked to concentrate its efforts on a specific group. </p>

by the Ministries have huge impact on the lives of common people.
As a result, the people perceive the Government as lacking in empathy,
more concerned with figures than the impact on human lives. I urge

in a meaningful manner. In this way, together, we can make Singapore

our Government has done well for most of us. A large majority of
Singaporeans – the Minister says 92% − own their own homes; most
are employed with secure and well-paying jobs. The Jobs Credit Scheme
introduced in 2009 cost the Government $4.3 billion, benefited 100,000
employers, enabling them to retain many of their workers. I think
no matter how we see it, we ought to give credit to the Government for
helping to keep unemployment down during those times. Medical care,
whilst not the cheapest, is affordable as long as we manage our
expectation. Can we do more to manage the costs of living, to allow
more Singaporeans to have a better life? Of course! Is there room
for improvement? Definitely! This is what we are all here to do.
There are many more things to be done, policies to be finetuned
and improved upon. And it is incumbent upon us as representatives
of the people to work constructively with the Government to make
the lives of Singaporeans better. </p>

Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion to thank
the President for his Address and his call to rally Singaporeans together
and building on our inclusiveness. Before I begin my speech, I would
like to speak in response to Mr <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">Yaw Shin Leong's speech earlier. My ears opened
when he mentioned the four-letter word, NTUC. He suggested and commented
that NTUC is following the Workers' Party's position and the divisiveness
in opinions</span> between the employers and NTUC in the area
of Singaporeans first. I wish to clarify and state in lucid terms
that NTUC has always been pro-worker and its mission has always
been to help workers earn a better living and live a better life.
NTUC has always been and will always be the voice of our workers
in Singapore. There have been times when we, as a labour movement,
disagree with our tripartite partners, especially when we echo and
advocate the concerns and pains of our workers and unions. In the
past, much of these diversity and differences in opinions have been
the subject behind closed doors. </p>

be transparent and float out debates, diversity and discussions

this diversity in views, the spirit of tripartism and our tripartite

is a unity of purpose and vision because our tripartite partners
– the Government, employers and unions – work in cooperation to shape
Singapore's future together, forging consensus in developing strategies
and taking action to achieve sustainable national growth and development
for the benefit of workers, employers and society.</p>

nine-and-a-half years ago in 2002. As an Industrial Relations Officer,
I had the opportunity to witness for myself two major bouts of retrenchments,
once in 2003 during the SARS outbreak and the other during the subprime
crisis in 2008. During the 2003 downturn, many rank and file workers
lost their jobs. I saw for myself how SIA and SATS staff, and the
hotel and services industries being badly affected during the SARS
outbreak. I saw workers who lost their jobs and had their wages
cut. I recalled NTUC and our affiliated unions helping thousands
to undergo training and many for career switches. I also recalled
NTUC acting as a surrogate employer and helping almost 200 tourist
guides to undergo skills redevelopment programme and upgrading as
tourist arrivals came to a standstill and their incomes halted.
During the end 2008 downturn, we had swift measures from a closely-knit
tripartite effort to manage excess manpower and to upturn the downturn. We
bounced back quickly. Thanks to the resolute efforts and tenacity
of purpose by our tripartite partners from the unions, employers
and Government.</p>

cut costs to save jobs. Unions and workers braced themselves to
persevere and stood by their companies as the Government rolled
out the resilience package tapping into our hard earned reserves.
Although we bounced back very quickly by end 2009, that period also
saw many job losses and institutions like several banks laying off
staff often unannounced, and not reported publicly. During the 2008
downturn, I saw for myself increasingly more professionals, managers
and executives, hereinafter referred to as PMEs for short, facing
retrenchments. With the uncertain global economic conditions and
outlook, we have to brace ourselves. In fact, just two weeks ago,
we saw the first signs of the uncertain market conditions with the laying
off of about 220 workers of United Test and Assembly. I am told
almost 100 of them were PMEs, a group of them are currently undergoing
skills training at Next U, the PME training arm of NTUC Learning
Hub. They are re-skilling in various areas of computing such as
autocad and host of other skills as many of those retrenched have engineering
background. </p>

had released an occasional paper last week and highlighted that
the Singapore workforce has about half who belonged to this category called
the PMETs. I would prefer to use the term "PMEs", as the "T" refers
to technical officers and technicians who are these days generally
considered rank and file workers. Since the Opening of Parliament,
I have also posed several questions to ascertain the extent and
accurate composition of the PME group of workers and the current demographic
and industry profile, including their employment and unemployment
rates which I hope, when answered, will throw more light to this
growing segment of our working population. Based on extrapolation
of the current labour market survey and reports, I am quite sure
we would have about a third of our workers falling within this PME
classification.</p>

educational qualifications and with a large proportion of our people
embarking on tertiary education and entering the jobs in managerial
and executive positions, it would not be long before this group
of PMEs formed the greater majority of our workforce. What this
means is that we need to focus and direct our efforts at all levels
and at all fronts to support their personal growth and advancement, protect
their welfare and interest and assist them when they need help,
often times, well before they start asking for it. Our PME group
of workers' concerns and challenges fall into various categories
according to the life stage they are in and their nature of work.
In the first instance, I share my parliamentary colleague, Ms Low
Yen Ling's concern of those who are aged 40 years and above. From
MOM's data, it has been clearly demonstrated that this segment requires
a much longer period of time before they gain employment after retrenchment.
In fact, I know of a resident who obtained a First Class Honours
in engineering from NUS and worked as an engineer in a large MNC
before he was retrenched during the last downturn in 2008. He was
40 years old at that time. He was out of job for more than nine
months and finally landed a job in the Civil Service at much less
than half his previous pay. He was fortunate in that his wife was
working and that they had no major debts. </p>

concern amongst many Singaporean PMEs. This is regardless of whether
they are earning $3,000, $6,000 or $9,000 per month. Many are already
saddled with mortgages and vehicle loans. Those with families will
be having young children and many have to support aged parents.
To further exacerbate their burdens, many of these PMEs who are
in their 40s would be an only child or have only one other sibling,
and they were born during the time when measures were kicked in
to get families to stop at two. Being retrenched is one thing, finding
a job after that is going to be the next hurdle that we have to
overcome after picking themselves up.</p>

decade, such economic swings are no longer once in 10 years like
traditional economists used to articulate. I worry, and I repeat
again, I worry for this group of PMEs at the next downturn. I am
well aware that the Employment and Employability Institute has already
started regular career fairs for PMEs since the last downturn and
is ramping up on such fairs. Due to a very diverse and often specialised nature
of PME jobs and PME interest, the amount of resources to upskill
and reskill the PME and place him or her in the PME job requires
a significantly larger amount of resources as compared to training
and placing a worker in a rank and file job.</p>

days are equipped with IT certificates, diplomas, degrees and postgraduate
qualifications. Many of them start off their first career or job
as executive or skilled professional. What do you think this segment
of our PMEs is looking for? During a series of focus group discussions
which I had with some PMEs, they are looking for good opportunities,
good jobs, good career advancement, good treatment by employers,
good worklife balance besides good remuneration. They also want
to be well protected against unfair treatment, termination and job
losses. Career progression and reconciling job satisfaction with
personal aspirations have been a common concern. In the recent figures
just released from the Council of Private Education which tracks student
members in private schools, it showed student enrolment had reached
146,000 by the middle of this year for which 113,000 are Singaporeans.
Most of them are aged below 30 years and diploma holders. This is
in comparison to about 45,000 Singaporeans pursuing undergraduate
degrees in our three local universities and the new Singapore Institute
of Technology. With such large numbers graduating from private educational
providers such as Singapore Institute of Management, Management Development
Institute of Singapore, PSB Academy and other well-known providers
in ties-up with foreign universities, the number of potential young
PMEs entering the market or already in the market and upgrading
themselves in the coming years will certainly increase tremendously.
My serious worry for this group of young PMEs is whether there are
good jobs for them to fulfil their aspirations and ambitions. We
are well aware of growth in sectors such as biomedical, research
and development, clean energy and several other professional services.
The question is, whether these young PMEs have a passion or keenness
to enter into some of these industries and whether employers will
accept them with open arms.</p>

willing to upgrade and upskill themselves through such private education
providers, many of whom are those who are unable to afford an overseas
education. Are there other avenues where these young people can
obtain assistance from the Government? I am aware of the Workforce
Development Agency's Skills Training for Excellence Programme (STEP)
which is outcome and industry based. However, many of these SIM
and MDI students I spoke to, including some of my residents, hope
to see the likes of UniSIM type of Government funding, or the likes
of the Edusave Merit Bursary, or scholarships. In fact, last week,
I chatted with one of my union leaders who is in his late 20s. He
works as a technician. He completed an undergraduate programme in
Business Management with one of our top private education providers
last year. I asked him if he had received an enlargement of job
scope or had his salary or job grade adjusted with his new degree
qualification. He told me in a dismal, no. I believe there are many
like him, not just in the private sector but also in the public
sector. This begets the issue of under-employment of our PMEs. Many
like this young union leader may have to move to another job to
be promoted to an Executive. Some stay on bitterly. This is not
a new phenomenon. Countries like the United States face similar
challenges. Lower jobs taken on by highly or over qualified PMEs,
thereby causing severe under-employment. This is an area which I
feel we should take cognisance of despite the fact that we have
relatively low youth unemployment compared to many developed countries.
We should prepare ourselves.</p>

battle with having children and doing well or even keeping up with
their careers at the same time. Whether male or female, they face
a myriad of difficulties. I know of many PMEs who felt apprehensive
and at times awfully guilty, having to leave their young children
and infants at home with a domestic helper, or at the childcare,
or infant care centre. The challenges of having to rush home before 7.00
pm to fetch or see their children; the plight of parents when their
child falls ill; the prospect of the centre being shut down due
to an outbreak of disease and having to make unplanned childcare
arrangements, frighten many. How then can we create a better climate
to mitigate these fears and worries?</p>

who stopped work for a period of time during the formative years
of their children also face their own set of challenges. This includes being
unable to return to jobs which they previously did and also joining
organisations with little or no flexible work arrangements, or having
sufficient family-friendly practices. There have been concerns and
feedback from my union leaders, residents and Facebook friends about
foreign PMEs competing and taking away jobs from Singaporean PMEs.
We do not doubt the need for foreign PMEs in certain specialised and
niche industries. Instead, we cannot and should not fall into a
situation where employers can choose foreigners as an easy option
when they fail to recruit Singaporeans.</p>

union leaders have mooted the idea of a foreign PME dependency ratio

by enhancing the Employment Pass requirements which take effect
in January 2012. I await to see its overall effectiveness next year.</p>

                  </span>:
Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. In general, our Employment Act explicitly
excludes managers and executives in its scope of coverage. The Act
was amended on a few occasions since promulgation and updated to
offer limited protection to lower-level executives. On 1 February
this year, the tripartite mediation process was introduced to cover
union members earning less than $4,500 for specific head of claims.
To date, the tripartite mediation panel has successfully mediated three
cases involving executives with employment-related claims. The Manpower Ministry
also offers PMEs a voluntary mediation route. However, I am concerned
about the ambit and coverage of the Employment Act to PMEs. As our
median salaries increase year after year and PMEs employment terms
and contracts become increasingly complex, sometimes involving transnational
and cross-border issues, I therefore ask this House how effective
our current Employment Act has been in protecting the interest and
providing recourse to aggrieved PMEs. The meaning and intent of
the word "executive", which was provided in the Employment Act when
it was first promulgated in 1968, and the meaning of "executive"
today, 43 years later, I submit, surely, is dissimilar. </p>

increasingly seeing an increase in what is commonly known as "freelancers".
They are independent contractors who do not fall squarely into an
employer/employee relationship and, therefore, not protected by
our labour legislation. We see such workers in various sectors such
as tourist guides, freelance trainers and those in the creative
arts and entertainment industry. They will need help too.</p>

concerns and challenges of PMEs. We have questions to ask ourselves.
What works or does not work for PMEs? Where are the new jobs for
PMEs? What capabilities should we develop? Why do employers prefer
Employment Pass holders than engaging our local employees? We need
to examine our current national programmes, initiatives and capabilities.
Are they effective? What should be the way forward?</p>

and suggestions. PMEs will need adequate support for the "Four Ups"
– up their skills and knowledge, up their marketability and employability,
up their protection and up the spread of jobs and employment opportunities.
I opine that the Government should work closely with tripartite
partners to set up a task force to address PMEs' concerns over and
above those highlighted earlier. Greater research and studies need
to be undertaken to examine the short- and long-term ramifications
and challenges facing this growing segment of the workforce. The
issues are wide ranging and will cover, amongst others, the unemployment,
employment and underemployment of PMEs. We need to find counter
measures and solutions to these issues which may well involve reviewing
the current legislation. And, finally, there is an entire chain
of activities in enhancing the employment and employability of PMEs.</p>

leaders, I often hear them lament that despite the availability
of growth opportunities in Singapore, the key constraint to realising
these opportunities is neither capital nor ideas, but the availability
of talent. This dearth of talent has led companies to curtail their
expansion plans, and some even contemplating taking their business
offshore. </p>

there is a limit to how many foreigners our society and infrastructure

it is important than ever to find ways to tap on the talents of

I would like to speak today on how we can better support and nurture
two groups of Singaporeans. First, I would like to begin with a
subject that is close to my heart, that is how we can better utilise
the potential of women in Singapore. Research has shown a clear
link between gender equality and a country's economic strength.
Indeed, Nordic countries that lead the world in many indicators
of gender equality rank amongst the strongest global competitors
with the highest standards of living. </p>

in Singapore was recognised early on. Back in 1975, our former Prime
Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, said, and I quote, "Societies which do
not educate and use half their potential because they are women,
are those which will be the worse off. Those that do, and face up
to problems of new social and family relationships to help working
wives to bring up the next generation, are those most likely to
provide better lives for their people. We cannot not educate and
use the energy and ability of our women." </p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-b22b79ac-deb7-4340-817b-de4e3965aa39"><!--a--></a>Singaporean women today
have more opportunities than in the past. We have seen more and
more women leading in their respective fields. However, we still
have 58,000 women with university degrees not working, three times
more than men. And despite recent gains, women's labour force participation
remains low at only 57% as compared to that of men at 77%. Amongst
women who work, few make it to leadership positions. Women only
occupy 27% of executive-level positions, and 6% of board-level positions in
Singapore top listed companies. Singapore only ranked 56th out of
134 countries in Global Gender Gap Index by World Economic Forum.</p>

in the workforce contributes far beyond having more pairs of hands,
or achieving egalitarian ideals. Women bring unique – and I emphasise unique
– talents, skill sets, life experiences and perspectives to the
workplace. There is a body of research which suggests that companies
with a strong women representation at board and top management roles
are also the companies that perform best. </p>

work and family demands is the key reason for low women representation
in our workforce as women continue to be the primary caregiver. Close
to 90% of women stop work due to family responsibilities. Over the
years, I myself have counselled many female colleagues who struggle
with the choice of staying at home or continue working, usually
after having children. They are typically at the prime of their
careers. They feel a strong sense of guilt of not having enough
time for the family, yet they feel a strong sense of loss for giving
up the career they have built and the financial security that comes
with it. Juggling work and family can be a delicate balance. I remember
my own days as a young mother, rushing home to see my sons during
lunch break, that was the best reward for my working day, and that
was usually only 15 minutes before I had to dash off again to drive
back to the office for the next meeting. Being away on business
trips was often a very miserable experience.</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-1991fed8-cba3-4ffa-8b96-2d715431db87"><!--a--></a>Sir, in modern Singapore,
women who choose to work should be supported so that they can work
and take care of their families at the same time. But in order for
this to happen, they need ready access to child and eldercare services,
they need their husbands as joint partners in raising their families,
and they also need employers and the Government to adopt family-friendly
policies. We still have some way to go in providing these. For example,
despite the many discussions I followed in this House around flexi-work
arrangements, women here continue to struggle with the painful choice
between full-time work or no work, as flexi-work and part-time work arrangements,
including home-based work, are not readily available. Sixty one
percent of women who are not working have indicated they would work
if flexi- and part-time arrangements were made available. Sir, being
one of the most highly connected, technologically advanced countries,
Singapore has all the natural levers to support flexi-work. Not
leveraging this to enable women to stay in the workforce is truly
a missed opportunity.</p>

done to help women to go back to work, especially those in the lower
income group, as this will mean helping their families with extra
income to improve living standards.</p>

has helped 8,000 women return to the workforce, but there are still
more than 235,000 economically inactive women between the prime ages
of 25-54 that could be re-inducted. I have met a number of female
residents who are frustrated of not being able to even land a job
interview despite pursuing numerous training programmes, having
taken some time off work. The reason is very simple: employers are
not confident about their ability to adapt to the work environment, especially
older women who have stopped work for some time. So, in many cases,
the employer's concerns have less to do with the applicant's relevant
skills, but more about her fitting into the working environment.</p>

from the successful Jobs Credit Scheme, can we not consider a special
grant to encourage employers to offer re-induction to women returning
to the workforce? Under this scheme, which I will call the Re-entry
Scheme for the purposes of this discussion, companies can obtain
a grant from the Government for a limited period of time, perhaps
three to six months, for hiring women returning to the workforce.
This is to ease the re-induction of women into the workplace by
immersing themselves in the operating rhythm and orientating themselves
to the rigour of a new job. The Re-entry Scheme will help offset
the employer's cost for on-the-job training for these women as well
as any redesign of work arrangements necessary. Yes, this will be
an investment by the Government, but this is an investment that
is completely – completely – targeted to developing the vocational
skills of the worker for the task she is already hired to do, rather
than training given in the hope she will find a job. I would further
recommend that this scheme be extended to older workers for the
same purposes.</p>

countries and our own suggests that meaningful changes will not
occur naturally. Instead, they are the result of determined and
sustained Government interventions, regulations and provisions.
We have only seen a mere increase of 5% in women labour force participation
in 20 years. In the meantime, our fertility rate has slid to a historic
low of 1.16. This contrasts starkly with countries such as Norway,
where gender equality and female friendly employment policies make
it easier for women to raise families whilst enjoying successful
careers and financial security. Norway's women labour participation
is at a high of 80%, and not surprisingly, the fertility rate at
a respectable 1.96. Our lack of progress in this field is all the
more conspicuous when stacked up against our many achievements and
progress in many other areas such as the economy, education, environment
and health. </p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-fddbe820-f4fb-4ec2-af0c-0fa06a3cc8c8"><!--a--></a>What does it take to keep
this issue at the top of the political and social agenda, to drive
it to resolute and urgent action? Today, the issues highlighted
are spread across Government agencies co-ordinated by an "office"
within MCYS, which itself oversees a wide range of concerns from
social welfare, youth, sports, community bonding to ageing. Can
women and family not be represented by a dedicated Ministry, as
in the other countries such as Sweden, New Zealand and Malaysia?
There should be enhanced levels of resources, a strong mandate and
authority to prescribe and enforce, rather than be left to the best
efforts of the occasional campaign or promotion by different agencies. The
integration of work and family is a national concern, and deserves
to be addressed with the right policies, and a comprehensive strategy.
Society should be educated and stakeholders should be given clear
targets to aspire to. </p>

it is time for us to give this area the impetus it deserves. Our success
in doing so will mean higher household incomes, more fulfilling
lives and happier families. And very likely, it will mean more babies.
And we will have provided employers in Singapore an enlarged pool
of talent who brings unique skills. Sir, this is a win-win-win scenario

the issues faced by another group, Singapore's professionals, managers
and executives which I should refer as PMEs. Hon. Member Patrick
Tay has spoken at length about their plight. Let me just add to
that speech that has given a lot of insights to what this group
is facing. Riding the wave of our vibrant economy, many professionals
and executives are going to places and I have seen many making the
most of the many opportunities available to them. But I have also
met many of my constituents that are also anxious, as mentioned
by hon. Member Patrick Tay, about their access to quality jobs and
career prospects. Some have shared their concerns of seeing large
numbers of foreigners in their workplace. They fear being marginalised
by the liberal inflow of foreigners and having their wages depressed.</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-ff647ebd-5d33-48bd-86b8-ae8203520af5"><!--a--></a>The reality is that business
is all about pragmatism – given a choice, businesses will tend towards
the most expedient, convenient and cheapest options to fulfil its objectives.
And with the trend of business cycles becoming shorter and more
volatile, business leaders are focusing on immediate opportunities
rather than on investing in long-term solutions. So if there is
an easily accessible pool of well-qualified, low-cost foreigners
to tap into, there is less urgency for employers to invest in grooming Singaporeans
for the same jobs. </p>

by global trends that shift growth drivers from West to East. Whereas
in the past, the competition for jobs had come primarily from lower
cost Asian countries and primarily for lower-skilled opportunities,
Singaporean executives now also encounter competition from developed
but job-scarce nations of the Western hemisphere. Head-hunters tell
me how attractive Singapore has become to qualified candidates from
the US and Europe, willing even to take a pay cut to learn about
Asia from the most cosmopolitan city – that is, Singapore! Sir,
we are a small country with a limited number of jobs on offer, yet
we have become a magnet for talent from all over the world. What
measures do we have in place to ensure Singaporeans remain at the core
of our workforce?</p>

the point I am making. It is not about Singapore's need to access
a diverse, globally competitive pool of talent, about which there
should be no doubt. My point is about (1) how do we ensure employers
sustain a preference to employ "Singaporeans first"? and (2) where
it is not possible, how do we persuade them to invest in developing
Singaporeans with the necessary skills to step up to those jobs? </p>

Employment Pass (EP) scheme will help level the playing field on
pay and increase the overall level in terms of the quality of EP
holders. It is definitely a step in the right direction, but many
asked, can we do more? I must say our Employment Pass system that
is targeted at the executives and managers is one of the more liberal
systems internationally which mainly focuses on qualifying entry
salary and education levels.</p>

my residents often ask me: Will locals remain at the core of our
workforce if employers are not subjected to quotas on their intake
of foreigners? How can we be sure that employers adopt a "Singaporean
first" policy by trying their best to employ local talent before
hiring foreign talent? Where employers claim that it is not possible
to hire a Singaporean because of the nature of the job, how can
we be sure that those particular jobs are correctly specified or
paid? If those skills are indeed so rare, how can we persuade employers
to train Singaporeans to fill those jobs? Sir, I believe these are
very valid and important questions and we must find a solution to
address them in a systematic and thoughtful way. Many countries,
even the Gulf States, which welcome foreigners to supplement locals,
have put in place measures that deal with the issues highlighted.
This allows the admission of high quality foreign talent without adversely
affecting the job opportunities and wages of locals. The possible
introduction of a quota system can also play a key role in protecting
strategic industries and guard against vulnerability from over-reliance
on foreigners in selected sectors.</p>

important we do not take any steps suddenly, as it may shake the
confidence of companies that have invested in Singapore and adversely
impact our global competitiveness. At the same time, we certainly
should not wait till the situation becomes so dire that corrective
action becomes necessary. Instead, the initiatives discussed above
may be introduced in a gradual and phased manner, so as to allow businesses
to adapt to the changes. But the message will be unmistakeable:
That their human resource planning must adopt a "Singaporean first"
policy and cater for the placement of Singaporeans at the core of
their workforce. They can then take the gradual but resolute steps
to systematically prepare Singaporeans for the best jobs.</p>

                  </span>: Okay. Sir,
I wish to also point out that employers stand to benefit significantly
from this. It is a common practice from enlightened employers to groom
local executives in their succession planning. They understand that
having a strong local team enhances business continuity and operational
resilience, as Singaporeans are here for the long term. They possess
a special connection to the local community and a finely nuanced
understanding of the local environment, a key lever for being competitive.</p>

once again, the President's call for us to help all Singaporeans
realise their fullest potential. For the last 46 years, we have
proven time and time again that whenever we put our minds and our
collective will to surmounting a challenge, we can succeed. I believe
that Singapore can also lead the way in realising the full potential
that women can bring to society. I believe that we can, and we should give
Singaporeans the first chance at the best jobs amidst globalisation.
And I believe our best days lie ahead of us, Singapore will be a
city of opportunities, where our people learn and grow, and be the
best they can be. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on that note, I end my
speech by re-affirming my support for the motion. </p>
