<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head W --



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head W be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 1OO4*. (* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs L. P. Rodrigo, Teong Eng Siong, P. Govindaswamy and Dr Ong Leong Boon.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the officials of the Ministry of Finance as

guardians   of  public  funds  are  expected   to   be

meticulous  in processing proposals for the  financing

of public projects. But in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>



process, when the guardians of Government purse become

an  obstruction  to  development,  then  something  is

really, wrong. Let them process the proposals but  let

them not sit on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When querying revotes for a number of items of

Development Estimates in the various Ministries, I  am

told that among other things, some projects could  not

be  proceeded with as a result of the difficulty posed

by  the  Ministry of Finance in respect  of  releasing

funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when budgetary provisions are made for any

financial  year,  before  parliamentary  approval   is

sought, the Budget Division of the Ministry of Finance

would  have  screened the requirements of the  various

Ministries, queried the needs for such  projects  and

having  been satisfied, the provisions would  then  be

tabled in Parliament. Since these provisions have been

approved by the Ministry of Finance and consequently



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>



approval has been obtained from Parliament, I fail  to

see the reason for a delay in releasing funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having made this general remark, can I now turn to a

specific  issue  where there has been  an  unnecessary

delay  in  releasing funds for the construction  of  a

community  centre  in the Telok Blangah  constituency?

For  FY 75, $10.8 million was approved as contribution

to  the People's Association which included provisions

for  building  community centres.  Having  accepted  a

suitable  site in Telok Blangah from the  Housing  and

Development Board, the People's Association approached

the  Ministry of Finance for the release of  funds  in

order  to  purchase the site on 29th September, 1975.

Since  then, six written reminders have been  sent  to

the  Ministry of Finance. A number of telephone  calls

requesting  the  Ministry to expedite processing  have

also  been made. The latest written reminder was  made

on  22nd March, 1976. Six months have passed since  the

first   request  was  made,  and  still  the  People's

Association  is  awaiting release of funds  which  was

approved  by Parliament last year. Meanwhile,  the  MP

for Telok Blangah is pressing the People's Association

to  process the plans and to submit the plans  to  the

Planning  Department. The Housing Board, on the  other

hand,  is  also pressing the People's Association  for

payment. Cost of building is going up and up and Telok

Blangah is without a community centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I concede that the Ministry of Finance should

exercise   sufficient  checks  and   balances   before

releasing  public funds but it should never  become  a

bottle-neck for public development.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Budget speech which was delivered on

1St  March 1 976 announced no tax increases except  on

cigarettes.  This  is  indeed  good  tidings  for  the

people. The increased tax on tobacco should not affect

the  general livelihood of the people except cigarette

smokers. Therefore, for the sake of the health of  the

people  especially the younger generation  who  should

not  be  encouraged to smoke, I believe that such  tax

increase on a non-essential item will receive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>





the  support  of the majority of the people.  What  1s

amusing is that the Minister himself earnestly pleaded

certain   people   including  some  of   his   Cabinet

colleagues to give up smoking. I believe the  Minister

himself  is not a smoker. Mr Speaker himself  is  also

not a smoker because. I believe he is a doctor and  he

knows that smoking is bad for the health. Smokers tend

to  rationalise  their  bad habit  by  saying  that  a

cigarette  after  a  meal  will  induce  a  sense   of

euphoria.  Men of letters say that smoking  will  help

them to think better and will bring richer inspiration

to  them. So they go on smoking for the rest of  their

lives.   Those   who   smoke,   including   Ministers,

Parliamentary Secretaries and Backbenchers, should pay

heed to what the Finance Minister has said and give up

smoking  in  order  to safeguard  their  physical  and

mental   health   so  that  they  may  not   dissipate

themselves away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise four questions under this

amendment. First, on economic growth, as the  Minister

for  Finance  has pointed out, last year was  a  bleak

year  of  economic recession. The major industrialised

countries,  e.g., the United States,  Japan  and  West

Germany, were in the throes of depression resulting in

a  rapid  decline  in industrial production  and  mass

unemployment.  In spite of this adverse  international

economic  recession, we were able to register  a  4.1%

economic  growth which was not as good as in the  year

1975  when the growth rate was 6.8%. However, this  is

still  a  very  creditable performance  compared  with

other  developing  countries. The  fact  that  despite

economic  recession we were able to progress  steadily

and  to  carry  out our various economic developments,

could be attributed to three important factors. First,

the  farsightedness of the Government in carrying  out

various   practical  economic  policies   to   promote

industry  and trade. Secondly, the enormous outlay  on

infrastructure  in  the  public  sector  resulting  in

considerable  success  in  anti-depression   measures.

Thirdly,  our  workers' diligence, and high  level  of

technological  skill  contributing  greatly   to   our

economic   development.  Although  the  Minister   has

criticised our workers saying that they are not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>



as  hardworking as those in Korea and Taiwan  or  Hong

Kong, however,  I  am sure that  by  and  large, our

workers are hardworking and are not inferior to  them.

Now my question is:

When   the   international  economic   situation   has

recovered from the recession, are we well prepared  to

catch up with such a recovery speedily? If so what are

the  prospects of our economic progress this year? Can

the Minister forecast the growth rate for this year?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question relates to the control of

inflation, The rate of inflation is quickly  declining

and  according to the consumers' price index there was

only an increase of 3% last year. This has resulted in

a  definite improvement in the cost of living  of  the

people generally. Compared with Japan, Hong Kong,  and

Taiwan  our  price index here is much  lower  than  in

those  countries. In spite of this, the retail  prices

of  certain  food  items  are  still  very  high,  for

example, the retail price of pork. Although the  price

of  pigs has gone down to $110 or $120 per picul, the

retail price of pork has so far remained unchanged.  I

would like the Minister and the Consumers' Association

as well to take note of this. I believe the Government

should do something to bring about a reduction in  the

price of food. Although the Consumers' Association  of

Singapore  has done well in bringing about a  lowering

of  prices,  it must spare no effort to  monitor  food

prices  and  make  suggestions to  the  Government  to

maintain  a fair level of prices in order to alleviate

the burden and hardship of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third matter is on how to encourage our people

to use local products. The Economic Survey made by the

Ministry  of  Finance says that about 57% of  consumer

goods  were imported, while locally produced  consumer

goods constituted only about 43%. Obviously this is  a

problem that we should pay careful attention.  On  the

one  hand, while our products are very popular abroad,

on  the  other hand our own people do not seem  to  be

interested in our own local products. Thus, large sums

of money will have to be spent on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>



foreign  exchange to import foreign goods. Why  should

our  people pay more for imported goods than  buy  our

own  local goods which are cheaper? I do not think the

quality  of  our  local products is  inferior  to  the

imported products because the popularity of our  goods

abroad  is  a  clear evidence of the good  quality  of

local  products. What then is the reason? I feel  that

the  reason  is  a psychological one and  an  improper

understanding  of the true quality of local  products.

Therefore, the first problem to tackle is to instil  a

confidence in our people in locally produced goods. In

this respect, the Trade Department should get all  the

manufacturers  and  merchants  concerned  together  to

organise trade exhibitions jointly every year in order

to introduce our local products and their good quality

to  the  people and to foster their understanding  and

confidence  in locally produced goods n order  to  buy

more  of  them. Ideologically we should also encourage

the  patriotic consciousness of our people. This  will

not  only  help `the promotion of our local industries

but   also   will   be  conducive  to   our   economic

development.   I   hope   the  Government   department

concerned  would  try to launch such  campaigns  on  a

large scale in order to promote the popularity of  our

locally produced goods and help their development.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Minister for Finance also said that

the  Asian  Dollar Market has achieved  some  progress

last  year.  This could be seen from the  increase  of

investment in our Asian Dollar Market last year, which

totalled some USS 12.6 billion, or 22% more than 1974.

From  the  point  of  view of  our  development  as  a

financial   centre,  our  Asian   Dollar   Market   is

successful.   This  achievement  has   given   greater

confidence  in international circles and  has  induced

them   to  make  large  capital  investments  in   our

financial  market, and this also helps  to  strengthen

our   currency,  The  Minister  has  given  three  tax

concessions  to  further  develop  our  Asian   Dollar

Market. I would like the Minister to give more details

of  the activities of the Asian Dollar Market,  and  I

would  also  like  to suggest four  proposals  to  the

Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong, your time is up.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, before I make my

speech,   I   agree  with  the  Member  for  Sembawang

regarding his comments on smoking. But if he takes too

much meat he will suffer a heart attack. Therefore  he

must  be  careful in not taking too much  meat.  While

advising  other  people,  he  must  also  look   after

himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I notice that we have 2,414

vacancies  in Division I alone, and so many Ministries

are  short  of  these  officers.  Is  this  caused  by

officers  in  the Government sector migrating  to  the

private  sector? Or is it due to their  emigrating  to

other  countries? May I ask what steps are being taken

to  reduce this migration of officers? I suggest  that

further  incentives be introduced to  retain  them  so

that  they will be able to produce work that will best

suit  their ability. Every Ministry has a shortage  of

staff,  so  much so that temporary recruits are  being

taken in. For how long are they going to be temporary?

They  themselves  do  not know.  Why  is  the  Finance

Minister  not taking steps to fill the gap instead  of

relying  on the temporary staff who feel insecure  and

after  some  time would leave for greener pastures  in

the private sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a hint recently that the automatic yearly

wage  increments  would from  now  on  be  subject  to

productivity.  This casts a pessimistic  note  on  the

13th  month allowance and the NWC recommendations  for

this year. May I know what is the position of the  NWC

recommendations? Could the Minister elaborate? I  hope

the  NWC  recommendations are not taken away,  because

the  people's burden of livelihood has been  cushioned

by  these  allowances to meet the  increased  cost  of

living.  But if this is withdrawn, it will affect  the

daily  expenses  of  the  ordinary  worker.  I  wonder

whether   all   the  past  recommendations   will   be

consolidated in the pay chits. At the moment there are

so  many  allowances stated in the pay-slips, such  as

NWC  recommendations for 1973. 1974  and  1975,  leave

allowance, shift allowance, etc. These allowances  are

rather  confusing, when it comes to analysing them.  I

wonder whether the Ministry will consider



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>



consolidating these allowances without any loss to the

wage earners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past many hotels have been built. Tourists

were  encouraged to come to Singapore.  Now  what  has

happened to the occupancy rate of hotels? There  seems

to  be a downturn in the number of tourists coming  to

Singapore.  Despite this the international airport  at

Changi  is  to  be  expanded. Can the Minister  supply

facts and figures on this matter and state whether any

move is being made to raise the occupancy rate of  our

hotels?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the trading section, it seems that ships calling

at  Singapore  are  not as many as  before.  What  has

happened  to our trading missions? How best have  they

been  successful? Our statistics show that trade  with

Japan, America and European countries have gone  down.

Why  is  this so? Is the Government doing anything  to

revive our trade with these countries?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, on Singapore Airlines, how are we faring in

competition  with  the  other airlines?  What  is  our

profit  during the last one year and are we  expanding

the airlines?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, previously there was a tendency to house many

offices  and various departments under one roof.  But,

of  late,  owing to traffic congestion, the Government

tends to decentralise some of the departments all over

the  island. Although this may be a good move to  ease

traffic  congestion,  there may be  difficulty  for  a

member  of  the  public  who  has  to  go  to  several

departments  to  settle a problem.  He  will  have  to

travel  from one area to another. I hope the  Minister

will  see that the departments are not scattered in  a

way that will cause inconvenience to the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of inflation, with the assistance of

the various consumer associations we have been able to

curb profiteering to a great extent. Though the prices

of  many  commodities have gone down,  we  still  find

hawkers quoting exorbitant prices. What is the use  of

having  price  tags  when no one is  checking  on  the

prices quoted? For instance, iced water costs 10 cents

a  glass.  If you buy it in a plastic bag it costs  20

cents. Just imagine, one has to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>



pay  the extra 10 cents for the bag alone. In all  the

hawker  centres too you will find that the prices  are

high.  The  people have no choice but to pay  for  it.

Will  the  Minister see that remedial steps are  taken

against unfair profiteering?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks in Singapore open for business at 10 a.m. and

close at 3 p.m. during weekdays and from 10 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. on  Saturdays. These hours  are  extremely

short,  and the banks are still observing these  times

introduced during the colonial days, though the  work-pattern  and the number of working hours have changed.

Banks, except the POSB, have not adjusted their  hours

of  business  as  far  as service  to  the  public  is

concerned.  It is time the banks were made to  realise

that  it is for their own good and for the convenience

of the public to extend the banking hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the economic policy of 1976 seems to lay

emphasis  on  the growth of the private  sector.  This

emphasis  is on diversifying productivity,  increasing

the  skills of our workmen and to train them in higher

levels  of  technology in skill intensive  industries.

This  is a right move. It is this type of workman that

Singapore needs badly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my hope that the private sector will introduce

a  better  disciplined force of workers  so  that  our

productivity  will increase several fold  and  benefit

Singapore in return.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to comment about the ugly

tendency  that  is  growing  in  certain  departments.

Whenever  a  Member  of  Parliament  requests  certain

matters on behalf of his constituents, a blunt "no" is

given   by   some  officials  who  quote   rules   and

regulations   to   support  their  negative   answers.

However, the same officials are very lax towards other

enquirers who do not go through the MPs, and they seem

to get away with whatever they do. In some cases if an

MP's  request  is  turned down, the same  person  gets

things  worked out through other loopholes.  Something

is drastically wrong somewhere. Why do these loopholes

exist, and why do these officials make use of these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>



loopholes  to oblige certain individuals and  to  turn

down  others according to their whims and  fancies?  I

hope  the Minister will see that no double regulations

are used in all Government departments.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Sir, in this august

chamber where the n-ale sex reigns supreme, it is with

some  trepidation that I seek to raise the subject  of

preferential treatment of the male sex in  respect  of

medical benefits for Government officers, and I should

hope  my  male colleagues will join me to seek redress

for our fair ladies from the Hon. Finance Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, medical attention is given to a Government

officer  and  his family, at all Government  hospitals

and  clinics. This health care is free for  attendance

at  all  outpatients clinics, though  a  nominal  ward

charge  is imposed for in-patient treatment.  This  is

the  mainstay of the medical benefits entitlement  for

civil servants and other Government officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as laid Out in IM No. 2 an officer means.

and   includes,  an  officer  or  pensioner   of   the

Government of Singapore or a woman officer  who  is  a

widow or divorcee or who has been granted a decree  of

judicial separation and is the sole supporter  of  her

family. The term "family" is defined as:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a wife and child (or children) in the case of a

male officer, and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a child or children in the case of a woman

officer  who is a widow or divorcee  or  who  has

been granted a decree of judicial separation  and

who is the sole supporter of her family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what the above amounts to is that male officers

enjoy   medical   benefits  which  are   automatically

extended  to  his  wife and children,  whereas  female

officers  are  entitled  to  such  benefits  only  for

herself.  Her  husband and children are  not  accorded

free medical benefits, and they will have to pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only in exceptional circumstances, and these are

very  unhappy and unfortunate circumstances as  I  had

qualified earlier, is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>



child or children able to receive free health care.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot understand this unequal treatment of the

female officers of the Government who, in almost every

way are equal to men.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are employed like men to various jobs based

essentially on merit. Only in certain situations  such

as  hospitals and public cleansing work do we  see  an

all-female or all-male cast. These situations  are  so

because of different work demands, but facilitated  by

the traits inherent in the X or Y gene.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with the Government's philosophy and

practice  of equal treatment for both sexes,  and  our

avowed  distaste for sex discrimination,  I  shall  be

most  grateful if the Hon. Minister for Finance  could

comment  on  the  anomalous situation  of  less  equal

benefits  for woman officers and to consider  granting

equal medical benefits to all officers, regardless  of

sex,   lest   we   as   a   Government   he   labelled

"practitioners   of  sex  discrimination"   or   male

chauvinists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An Hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like  to  refer to the question  of  policy  in

regard to payroll tax. This subject has an interesting

history.  In  December  1965  the  then  Minister  for

Labour, presently Minister for Culture, described  the

tax  as  one (at that time) foolishly imposed when  we

were in Malaysia. However, it was intended to continue

collecting and to set aside the revenue to form a fund

for  the  social security of workers. It was envisaged

that   a   committee  would  be  set  up  to  put   up

recommendations for the implementation of the scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five years later in 1970 the question of this

payroll  tax  was  again raised,  by  the  Member  for

Kallang.  The then Finance Minister replied  that  to-date  (1970) a total revenue of $51 million  had  been

collected.  He added that the Government had  set  the

question  of  unemployment insurance  and  had  sought

advice from ILO. An ILO expert's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>



view,  it  appeared,  did not favour  an  unemployment

benefits scheme and the Government decided to  abandon

for  the  time  being the introduction of unemployment

insurance  based  on  payroll tax  contributions.  The

Finance Minister stated that Government wanted to  use

payroll tax contributions to offset liabilities  which

employers   incurred  when  they  employed  discharged

national  servicemen  who were  called  up  for  their

annual training exercises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following year in 1971 the present Finance

Minister  announced that he had news  which  employers

should  welcome,  namely, that  the  proceeds  of  the

payroll tax would be used to compensate employers  for

the makeup pay when national servicemen are called  up

for   annual   training   exercises   and   to   allow

reimbursements to industrialists for approved training

or approved apprenticeship schemes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is 1976 and we still have not got a clear idea

of  what we are going to do with the millions we  have

to-date  collected,  including  the  anticipated   $57

million  for  this coming financial  year.  Could  the

Minister  tell us what we have done specifically  with

the  monies that we have collected, and how  much  has

been spent for what? What is the philosophy behind the

collection  of  this tax which actually works  against

the  good employer who has to pay more because he pays

his  workers  better? The idea of using  the  tax  for

incentives to develop skills is a good one because, on

balance,  it  may  be  found that the  inculcation  of

skills  would  make  for  better  returns  than   just

stashing the money away and finding as the years  pass

by  that money value has been eroded. I think a  clear

explanation  of  policy  on  this  subject  would   be

advantageous.  At  the same time, the  Minister  would

surely  know  that  the Auditor-General  has  reported

that,  from  a  statistical sampling  for  the  period

January to June 1973, it was discovered that there was

a  rate of evasion of payment of this tax ranging from

5.5%  to  8.8% Perhaps the Minister  could  care  to

comment on this also.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

refer  to  the  Minister for Finance's observation  on

wages policy in his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>



Budget statement on 1st March, 1976. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The time has come for the National Wages Council to

consider  whether it should not include all  forms  of

wage    increases,   including   annual    increments,

incentive,  allowances and bonuses, in the computation

of  the  annual  NWC wage supplement to  arrive  at  a

single total annual increase.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make reference, Mr Speaker, Sir, to

the  recent statement that "for Singapore workers  the

days  of  automatic increases were over."  Since  this

statement  is  obviously linked  with  the  Minister's

observation  it  would  seem,  therefore,   that   the

Minister  for Finance is suggesting that  we  do  away

with annual increments for workers on the grounds that

the annual increments will by augmenting the NWC wage-hike upset the national economic equilibrium.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I respectfully submit that any attempt to

abolish wage scales would be a retrograde step. Annual

increments  for  workers must be  viewed  against  the

background of their introduction for the lower  income

group.  If  we  disregard the rationale behind  annual

wage increments, we will be doing so at our own peril.

It must be remembered that, generally speaking, annual

increments of wages for workers are comparatively  new

in origin because, briefly, wage scales bring about  a

sense of security for the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me outline the history. In the not so recent

past when the extreme left wing elements dominated the

labour  movement  their tactic was not  to  have  wage

scales but short-term contracts with employers so that

at  regular  intervals they could confront  management

with  new  and unreasonable wage increases  so  as  to

bring about industrial unrest. This also gave the left-wing trade union leaders a firm hold over the rank and

file, because if the workers had not backed them up in

creating  labour  unrest which could  even  wreck  our

economy   they   were  put  at  the   mercy   of   the

unenlightened employer and doomed to no wage increases

whatsoever. It was to remove this sense of  insecurity

which was often the source of labour unrest that  wage

scales were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>



introduced.  Thus being assured of his rice  bowl  the

worker could devote all his efforts and energy on  his

work and productivity without the nagging fear that he

may  be  Out  on  a limbo when the union's  collective

agreement with the management expires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we do away with salary scales and annual

increments, we might well bring back the old  scenario

and  once  again  have  a restive  labour  force,  all

waiting with agony and fear as to what would happen on

expiry of their collective agreements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the NWC's recommendation for wage

increases,  it  must be pointed out that  this  was  a

measure introduced to meet a new phenomenon that of  a

rising cost of living a phenomenon which has made  its

greatest  impact in post-war years. Those  of  us  who

belong  to  the older generation and who were  working

before the war will remember that even after the Great

Depression the term "inflation" was hardly ever  heard

of  in  this  part of the world nor did it  cause  any

social  or  economic problems. It was only after  1939

with  the  outbreak  of war in Europe  was  there  any

appreciable rise in the cost of living for  government

to take cognisance of the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first few years after the end of World War II

there was not really any marked upsurge in prices  and

in  the  cost of living. It was only in the  last  few

years, in the wake of rapid industrialisation and full

employment, did rising prices and the cost  of  living

make  such  an  impact that it has necessitated  state

intervention  to provide remedial act  on  to  contain

rising   prices   since  external  factors   and   the

unrestricted free enterprise could otherwise upset not

only   our  people's  livelihood  but  also  our  very

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recommendation of the National Wages

Council  must be seen in this context to  meet  higher

prices  and  the  rising  cost  of  living.  The  wage

supplement  recommended by the National Wages  Council

is thus the extra quantum of money that has to be made

available  to the employee to augment his remuneration

so  as  to  redress the imbalance between  his  actual

monetary remuneration and the purchasing power of  his

wages.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inflation that we have experienced during the

past  few  years is not the making of the  workers  of

Singapore  but  imported  inflation  due  to  external

factors  which are beyond the control of the  workers.

In  the circumstances, it will be unfair to blame  the

worker  for expecting a wage supplement to enable  him

to  meet  rising  prices. The wage supplement  of  the

National  Wages Council can therefore be viewed  as  a

stop-gap  measure. Wage increases are only recommended

when the situation warrants it. If our statistics show

that  there is no fall in the purchasing power of  the

dollar,  there will undoubtedly be no wage  supplement

recommended by the National Wages Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is clear that

the  National Wages Council's wage supplement is  thus

only  an adjustment to meet the rising cost of living.

If,  therefore,  the  Government  envisages  difficult

times  ahead and a slowdown in our economic growth,  I

have no doubt that the situation will be reflected  in

the  National Wages Council's recommendation. But this

does  not mean that the annual increments provided  in

the  worker's wage scale should be abolished. It  must

not  be forgotten that wage scales were obtained after

hard  bargaining on the part of the unions, very often

at  times when we were fighting the communists, and to

suggest  that  they should be scrapped on  the  ground

that  wage increases should from now on only hinge  on

improved effort and output is most illogical and could

even  be construed as a breach of faith. One does  not

chase the rat by burning the house down.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir.

just  now  the Member for Katong pointed  out  that  I

raised the question of payroll tax a few years ago.  I

am going to raise it once again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose, for the consideration of the Minister for

Finance, that  payroll  tax  collected   should   be

designated  and expended for the purpose  of  approved

courses in industrial joint training centres conducted

by  the  private sector and courses conducted  by  the

Industrial  Training Board, the National  Productivity

Board and the Adult Education



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>



Board.  I consider it quite appropriate that  the  tax

which  has been imposed on employers, based  on  their

payroll,  should  benefit both the employers  and  the

employees. Consideration might also be given to exempt

employers  from  paying payroll tax  if  their  annual

expenditure for their own courses designed to  upgrade

the skills exceeds the payroll tax they are liable  to

pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payroll tax is levied under the Finance Act (Payroll

Tax) (Cap. 139) at the rate of 2% on the total payroll

of  a  trade, business, profession or vocation carried

on  in  Singapore. Payroll tax collected for 1975  was

roughly  $49  million. For 1976,  payroll  tax  to  be

collected  is  an  estimated sum of $57  million.  The

total  amount  of payroll tax collected from  February

1965 to February 1976 was $263 million. If this tax is

utilised  for the purpose I have proposed,  it  should

give  the  incentive for employers to  devise  and  to

conduct suitable training schemes.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance in his Budget statement has

urged  the  workers to upgrade their  skills  and  the

employers  to  improve their personnel management  for

the  sake  of improving productivity. The  workers  at

large  are normally blamed for any high cost in  wages

or payroll. This tax is no exception. This tax has not

been  used  for the general good of the  workers.  How

much  opportunity  and time are  given  to  the  large

number  of  workers to improve their skills when  they

are  limited  to doing routine work? Let us  create  a

climate  where  the  people,  like  the  Germans,  for

example, are incessantly seeking knowledge and wanting

to  improve their skills. In this connection, I  think

the  Adult  Education  Board and  such  like  agencies

should  now  get out of their normal way  in  creating

interests  amongst our adult population in  furthering

their  education.  I do not believe the  Minister  for

Finance will agree with me after he had formulated his

Budget  and  presented it to Parliament. However, who

knows, he might!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

did  propound the need for a Small Claims Court during

the debate on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>



Budget  statement. This needs to be elaborated  on  at

the present juncture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time and time again, complaints by dissatisfied

consumers   against  retailers  find   difficulty   in

obtaining redress because of the small nature  of  the

claims. Either consumers feel that it is not worth  it

to   go  to  all  the  trouble  to  litigate  or  find

litigation  too costly. However, justified  complaints

like  these,  if  accumulated,  could  mean  consumers

losing  large  sums  of  money  and  guilty  retailers

getting  away  with trade malpractices and  ill-gotten

gains,   much   to  the  detriment  of  their   honest

counterparts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of a Small Claims Court could act as a

deterrent  to  undesirable trade  malpractices.  Court

fees would not be too costly and judgment in favour of

a  party would include recovery of fees. The most that

can  he  claimed could be in the region of  sums  less

than $500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievances may be stated in plain words and no legal

jargon need be known. Judges would not normally insist

on formal procedures or strict rules of evidence. Both

parties tell their side of the story and decisions can

usually  be  rendered immediately from  the  Bench  or

within a few days after trial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether a lawyer need be retained or not in a Small

Claims  Court  can  be  discussed  thoroughly  by  all

parties  concerned, once the idea  of  establishing  a

Small  Claims  Court is accepted in  principle.  Other

matters too like possible complications arising when a

case  is  transferred to a civil  court,  need  to  be

discussed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I did also discourse at length on

possible legislation for door-to-door sales during the

debate  on the Budget statement, but I do not  propose

to  repeat what I have said. However. I must emphasise

that  complaints on high pressure sales techniques  by

door-to-door  sales  persons  are  becoming  a  trying

consumer-hazard  in  Singapore,  with  apparently   no

control.  Many  a  time the victim is the  unprotected

member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>



of  the family left at home to do household chores  or

too  old  to  go  to work. A "cooling-off"  period  is

essential to make the sale effective. This will enable

the consumer to discuss the proposed purchase with the

rest  of the family, especially the one who will  bear

the burden of the payment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legislative requirement can easily be in the

form of regulations to the Consumer Protection Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would be most grateful if the Hon. Minister

could make some comments on my suggestions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I have quite a number of  questions  to

answer from the points made by Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point was made by the Member for Telok

Blangah. He spoke on the procedure for the release  of

funds  which have been approved in the Budget Division

and  in  Parliament, and said that there is  rather  a

considerable  delay in releasing funds.  He  mentioned

about  the  community centre for Telok  Blangah  which

apparently  had difficulty in obtaining a  release  of

funds from the Treasury. I am in general sympathy with

what  he  says about the release of funds.  I  am  not

familiar with that particular case, but possibly there

may  be considerations which may not have been brought

to his attention. It is quite possible that funds have

been held up because the People's Association has been

trying to arrange with the Treasury for larger amounts

to  be  granted both in the way of land for  community

centres as well as grants for the community centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the amounts are Iimited. But I have

been   receiving  representations  that   members   of

Management  Committees have had difficulty in  raising

funds and that perhaps the Government ought to bear  a

larger  proportion  of  the  cost  of  building   such

community  centres. Of course, these  matters  require

some  time for consideration. If the request for funds

is  merely  on  the  scale which has  previously  been

approved,  I  can assure the Member for Telok  Blangah

that there will be no difficulty in approving the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>



amount   which  has  already  been  agreed  for   such

Government expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang, after paying a few well

appreciated compliments on smoking and other  matters,

went on to speak on a considerable number of subjects.

I have not taken down all the points in full but I can

take his first question: "Are we prepared for recovery

when the economic situation changes?" I can assure the

Member that we shall have no difficulty in coping with

the  flow  of investments, if recovery takes place  in

the  way  he expects. In the last year or so  we  have

made  considerable  efforts in attracting  investments

and  we shall continue to do so. The EDB has sent many

of its most senior officers overseas and we shall make

further  efforts to seek out investment opportunities.

We  hope that when oil exploration in our region  gets

into  high  gear  the  industries producing  oil-field

equipment will want to be nearer the market and  will,

therefore,  establish themselves in  Singapore.  As  I

have mentioned in my Budget statement, the Jurong Town

Corporation  has had a breather in the preparation  of

lands  and other facilities for the investments  which

should  be  coming. We will be ready in the supply  of

land,  facilities and utilities `and  so  on  for  any

investment which should come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked what will be the growth rate this

year.  I think I have given the figures in the  debate

on  my  Budget statement. For what they are  worth,  I

said  that  the  Ministry  of Finance  computers  gave

figures  of approximately 6%to 8% growth rate  whereas

the  Monetary  Authority of Singapore had  a  somewhat

higher rate as the projected growth rate for 1 976. In

my  reply  I said that we must take all these  figures

with some caution because economic forecasts have gone

wrong  in the past not only in Singapore but  also  in

the  most  sophisticated countries in the world  using

the  most sophisticated models and data fed into their

computers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also spoke on inflation. I

made  very  little comment on inflation in  my  Budget

statement  because I expect the rate of  inflation  to

subside. In fact, in the first two months of the  year

the inflation, if measured against prices over a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>



year ago, is negative. Whilst there are increases,  as

he  has said, in the prices of certain foodstuffs like

pork  or vegetables when there was a drought. I  think

generally  the  prices  have gone  down  considerably.

Members are certainly aware of the lower cost of rice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also suggested that we

should  encourage our citizens to use locally produced

goods. I cannot agree with him more. In fact, we  have

put  some  effort in this direction in the  past,  for

example,  through the "Prosperity through Quality  and

Reliability"  campaign. We have to assure  our  people

that  the products of our industries are equal to  the

best and meet the most rigid standards. The Government

itself  encourages use of local products to the extent

of 5% differential in the purchase of quality products

manufactured  locally and bearing  the  SISIR  quality

stamp.  We  have also encouraged locally  manufactured

goods by giving concessionary rates for advertisements

over  radio and television. A special discount of 12«%

is given so that sales promotion can be intensified to

reach local customers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point mentioned by the Member was the Asian

Dollar  Market.  He has given the size  of  the  Asian

Dollar  Market which nearly reached US$13  billion  at

the  end of last year. The documentation on the  Asian

Dollar Market is quite voluminous and there is no lack

of  information  on this subject. I would  merely  say

that now we are not only a taker of funds from markets

all over the world but we are also lenders of funds to

the   ASEAN   countries,  to  Hong  Kong,  Japan   and

Australasia.   We   have   also   various   areas   of

development. One of them is the Bond Market.  In  1975

we  successfully  launched a number  of  bond  issues,

including  US$15 million for the YS Line issue,  US$15

million  for  the  Keppel Shipyard  issue,  and  US$20

million for the European Investment Bank. I think that

with  the  development of a good primary and secondary

market further issues will be floated in our Singapore

market.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now go on to the Member for Anson's very

lengthy queries on numerous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>



subjects.  First  of  all,  he  spoke  of  the   staff

vacancies.  Vacancies in over 2,000 Division  I  posts

may  appear  to  be  a  high figure  but  among  these

vacancies  are posts of promotional grades which  are,

in   most  instances,  already  filled  in  an  acting

capacity. The number of actual or physically  unfilled

vacancies  in  Division I would, of  course,  be  much

less.  Apart from medical officers, there is no marked

trend  in the number of officers in Government service

who  resign  to join the private sector or migrate  to

other  countries.  Steps  are  being  taken  to   fill

Division  I  vacancies substantively  through  regular

recruitment   exercises.  Until  these   are   filled,

temporary appointments are made to fill vacancies  but

those candidates in the temporary appointments can, if

they have the requisite entry requirements, of course,

apply  for substantive appointment in the posts  which

they are holding on a temporary basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point the Member mentioned was the National

Wages  Council  allowances.  On  this,  I  made   some

comments  in  my Budget statement. I do  not  think  I

should  go  beyond  what I have said  in  my  previous

comments.  We  shall  just  have  to  wait   for   the

deliberations of the National Wages Council and  await

also their recommendations and guidelines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah also spoke at some length

on  this,  especially  on  wage  scales.  I  was  very

interested  to  hear  him say that  if  there  was  no

inflation perhaps the National Wages Council need  not

have to make any recommendations for wage increases. I

do  not want to preclude even wage increases based  on

economic growth. So perhaps I should leave it  to  the

proper forum, i.e, the National Wages Council, to deal

with  the  points  which  have  been  brought  up   in

connection with this matter today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also suggested that there

should  be a consolidation of allowances. I stated  in

Parliament  in  February 1973  that  Government  would

undertake  a full-scale revision of salary  scales  at

the end of every four to five years for the purpose of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>



consolidating NWC allowances into basic salaries.  The

four  to  five years is not quite up yet, but  in  the

proper   time   I   will   certainly   consider    the

implementation of this proposal which I made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also made some comments on tourism,

especially  on  occupancy  rates  in  hotels.  In  the

Economic Survey of Singapore 1975, it was pointed  out

that  the tourism sector continued to enjoy favourable

growth.  In  1975,  the  number of  tourists  visiting

Singapore  rose  by  8%.  The  hotel  occupancy   rate

increased  from 70% in 1974 to 75% in 1975,  which  is

very  good by international standards. I think we  may

expect the tourism sector to maintain its growth  this

year.   With   economic  recovery  in  the   developed

countries,  there should be more tourists  from  those

countries this year. Of course, the Singapore  Tourist

Promotion  Board will continue its promotion programme

while the Sentosa Development Corporation will provide

added tourist facilities and amenities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also spoke of the development of Changi

Airport  in place of Paya Lebar. Singapore, of course,

has  to  prepare for expansion in the  volume  of  air

cargo  as well as for the increase in passengers.  The

Changi  site  has environmental advantages  over  Paya

Lebar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On shipping and trade, the number of ships rose from

36,200  in  1974  to  38,500  in  1975.  The  Member's

impression that many ships do not call at Singapore is

therefore  not  correct. The world recession  in  1975

brought  about  a  global trade  slump.  International

trade declined by 12% in real tern-s over 1974. But we

were  slightly  more  fortunate than  others  to  have

experienced  only  a  5% drop in real  terms.  As  the

American,  Japanese  and European companies  gradually

recover, our trade with these countries is expected to

improve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson asked about Singapore Airlines.

I  am  glad  to assure him that Singapore Airlines  is

able to compete very effectively on all the routes  it

serves.  Its  fundamental problem is that  because  of

protectionist  sentiment, it is  not  always  able  to

secure the traffic rights it believes it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>



entitled  to.  Notwithstanding  rising  costs,   SIA's

profits for the financial year ending 31st March, 1975

was $40.3 million. The expectation is that profits  in

the current year will be no less.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also spoke on the resiting of

Government  buildings  outside  the  Central  Business

District  and  the  inconvenience  it  caused  to  the

public.  I think consideration has been given to  move

some departments outside the Central Business District

but  it  is  necessary  that we group  together  those

Government departments which provide related services,

and  consideration  must also  be  given  to  grouping

related  sections of departments as a  unit,  wherever

possible, to minimise inconvenience to the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also spoke on inflation and hawkers. I

think  the  matter has already been  debated  at  some

length.  I would say that, so far as my department  is

concerned,  we try and see that prices  are  fair  and

reasonable.  But  in  the final  analysis,  we  should

encourage  keener competition and try to lower  prices

in this manner. I think it is for consumers themselves

to  be  more  discriminating and to avoid  patronising

hawkers who profiteer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked about banks and banking hours.

Here  again,  we  have a lot of information  which  is

available  in our brochures and so on for the  banking

community.  But  I  may say that  we  have  encouraged

flexibility  in banking hours and many  of  them  have

taken   advantage  of  this  flexibility.   The   only

stipulation  is that banks must provide  at  least  27

hours  of  banking service a week and that  the  banks

remain open between the important hours of 10a.m, to 3

p.m, on weekdays. The banks are free to extend  their

banking  hours  on weekdays and even on  Saturdays  in

accordance   with   the  needs  at  their   particular

branches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Member complained of discriminatory

treatment of requests which originate from MPs. I hope

the Member is not correct because there are many other

MPs  who  send  requests and applications  to  various

Government departments and I think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>



they are given every consideration. But if he can give

me  instances of discrimination against his  requests,

investigations can be made and action will be taken if

the allegations are true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng spoke about the Government's

regulations on medical benefits to civil servants  and

the  discrimination in favour of male  officers  whose

wives  and  children  enjoy the privilege  of  medical

benefits.  I can only say to him that these Government

regulations  have  a very long standing, and  perhaps

they  may  need to be looked into again.  The  guiding

principle  in giving medical benefits, of course,  has

been  to prevent the civil servant from worrying about

the  state of health of his family or those who depend

on  him. So the criterion has been dependency upon the

civil  servant. Traditionally, the male civil  servant

was  the head of the household and had to shoulder the

responsibility of providing for his wife and children.

In  the  context  of  our present society,  while  the

responsibility  still lies with the  husband  in  many

households, I am not quite sure that the guideline  is

still  relevant  for others. It may  be  that  working

wives should now look to their employers and should no

longer be given the benefit that they have been  given

in  the  past.  My Ministry certainly will  have  some

reIuctance  in extending medical benefits to  husbands

and  children of married women officer in the Service.

But,  as  I say, obviously we have to look into  these

regulations  which are of historical  interest  rather

than to meet the present situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member already has noted in his comments

that medical benefits are extended to the children  of

a  woman officer who is a widow or divorcee or who has

been  granted a decree of judicial separation  and  is

the  sole  supporter of her family. This is  the  same

principle of dependency upon the civil servant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, comments were made by the Member for Katong on

payroll   tax.  He  spoke  of  the  inconsistency   of

Government  regarding payroll tax. I  think  there  is

some  reason for his suggestion and it was considered,

perhaps in earlier days, that from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>



this  revenue  we should carry out certain  activities

but  it  was later decided that the general  principle

that  payroll  tax  revenue should be  paid  into  the

Consolidated Fund amid should not be earmarked for any

specific  purpose was the proper way of  dealing  with

this  particular matter. At the same time the purposes

for which the payroll tax was originally thought to be

usable would be given the same consideration as if the

money  was  available for it. I can assure the  Member

for  Katong and also the Member for Kallang, who  also

spoke  on this, that if there are schemes for training

or  for any other purposes which are deserving,  there

will be no limitation in the way of funds, or if there

were  budgetary difficulties I would come back to  the

House  for supplementary funds which. I am sure,  will

be approved to finance any particular worthy projects.

As far as this revenue pooling principle is concerned,

it  has  the  advantage that if the needs are  greater

than  `the  tax,  then there is no  reason  to  unduly

restrict  spending on worthwhile projects because  not

enough of a certain tax has been collected to meet the

necessary expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong also mentioned past

inefficiency in collection of payroll tax. I  am  glad

to  inform  him that a Special Payroll Tax Enforcement

Unit  has  been  formed, In 1  975  it  recovered  tax

amounting to nearly

$900,000.  However, the payroll tax is mild and  there

is  not really any problem of evasion. Field officers'

reports  confirmed  that non-payment  of  payroll  tax

arose   mainly   out   of   ignorance   or   a   wrong

interpretation of the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Member for Potong Pasir made some

comments  on  consumers' interests and  so  on.  I  am

afraid I did not catch all of his suggestions. I think

they will be referred to my Ministry which looks after

these interests and will be equally interested in  any

suggestion   which  will  foster  the   interests   of

consumers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like

to raise four supplementary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>



questions or suggestions for the Minister to consider.

For  the sake of diversifying our economic development

the Minister for Finance has often stressed on this  I

would like to suggest to the Minister the following.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, encouragement should be given to family

type  or  cottage industries such as garment industry,

furniture   industry   and  food-packaging   industry,

because  these  industries are of a  low  cost  nature

involving only a very small amount of capital, whereas

they    can   provide   housewives   with   employment

opportunities besides cheap goods for our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, some undeveloped hand or small islands

should  be allotted for large scale vegetable  growing

and  breeding of fish and prawns to provide  more  job

opportunities, and on the other hand,  to  save  large

sums of foreign exchange on imported food.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the PPD should set up a research unit to

study  how to further develop our orchid and  tropical

fish  industries  because the products  of  these  two

industries    have    been   enjoying    international

popularity. Every year the products are earning for us

large  sums of foreign exchange. If we can  raise  and

improve  their  quality  and  plan  for  large   scale

production,  I  am sure they will bring about  greater

economic benefits to our country in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the EDB should prepare a comprehensive

report  on  investment statistics and quickly  collect

information on international market conditions  so  as

to  provide  ready  and  satisfactory  information  to

intending  foreign investors. This will  be  of  great

help  in attracting foreign investment here. According

to  our statistics, last year foreign investments  had

reduced  by  65%.  What  is the  reason?  I  feel  the

Minister  should go deeper into the cause and  try  to

seek out some remedial measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to ask the Minister about the

average  income  per  year of our  nationals,  whether

there  was  an  increase last year and  what  was  the

percentage rate of increase.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I would like to ask the Minister to

clarify  this  point. The Minister has said  that  the

time  has  come  for  the NWC to consider  whether  it

should  not  include  all  forms  of  wages  and  wage

increases,   including  annual   increment,   in   the

computation  of  the annual NWC wage supplement.  This

brings  about  fear  and  speculation  in  the  labour

movement  that the Government may be toying  with  the

idea  of abolishing annual increment provided  for  in

the  freely  negotiated collective agreement.  Whether

the  Government has such an intention to do away  with

annual  increment  is the question I  would  like  the

Minister for Finance to clarify.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I am very glad that the

Minister   has  conceded  that  the  medical  benefits

entitlement policy was anachronistic and that he  will

look   into   the   matter.  He,  however,   expressed

reluctance  that,  if the matter  is  pursued,  it  is

unlikely   that  medical  benefits  will  be  extended

equally to both males and females. It is my contention

that  his  Ministry is very unanachronistic  but  very

efficient  when  it  comes to matters  of  a  revenue-generating interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest that in view of the fact that the

pattern of family unit has changed and that today  the

male  may  not necessarily be the head of a household,

and  the  fact  that there are more and  more  females

joining  the Government service, these female officers

in  the Government service be granted the same medical

benefits  as  the male officers. I hope he  will  look

into  the matter sympathetically and provide an  early

answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I have not very much to add to

the  comments  I have made. The Member  for  Sembawang

made a number of suggestions. Some of these should  be

considered,  but  maybe more by other Ministries.  For

example, vegetable growing, development of orchids and

tropical  fish industries should, I think, be referred

to   my   colleague,   the   Minister   for   National

Development,  as  he  is  more  concerned  with  those

matters,   although  I  am  interested   in   economic

development as a whole.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for encouragement of cottage industries, we have

certainly  in the past tried to help small businesses.

We   have  some  financing  schemes  here  for   small

factories  built in Housing Board estates  and  Jurong

Town  Corporation estates, and we certainly think that

out   of   these  small  industries  will   come   our

entrepreneurs  of the future. I think that  particular

suggestion   is  welcome  and  will  be   given   some

attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also suggested that perhaps we should have

investment statistics ready for investors. I think  we

have  quite  a  lot of them already.  The  problem  in

investment  is  not  the lack of statistics  but  that

there has been a slump overseas in their own countries

and,  therefore,  they  are  not  keen  on  coming  to

Singapore.  But if there are any particular statistics

that  we still are deficient in, perhaps he will  give

me some information on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked what is the average family income

today, if I understand him aright. It was said  to  be

somewhere around $800 a few years ago. The figure  was

$590  per  month  in  1972. It is now  about  $900  in

November 1975.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah wanted clarification on

the  statement that all forms of wages, wage increment

and  so  on,  should  be considered  together  by  the

National  Wages Council. All we want to  know  is  the

cost  of  labour  so that there can  be  some  way  of

estimating what the cost will be to some investors. Of

course,  some of the fringe benefits have got  out  of

hand.  This has been made quite clear in the  examples

which  we have given to the National Wages Council  or

will  be  providing to them. As to what  is  going  to

happen  to the annual increments, this is one  of  the

matters  for  consideration. It can form part  of  the

scheme  which  is  suggested  by  the  National  Wages

Council or, in fact, it can be that the National Wages

Council's increases should take into account the  kind

of annual increments which can be given.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Member for Kim Seng speaks of an

anachronistic Ministry of Finance. This is a matter of

opinion. Of course, we try to keep up with the  times.

As for being ready



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>



when it comes to collecting money, I think this is  an

expected  function of the Ministry of Finance  and  it

will continue to be a characteristic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just now the

Minister  mentioned the figure of $800 with regard  to

income. I would like to ask him whether this sum is in

terms of Singapore dollars or other currencies,



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, if we do not mention US

dollars, it will be Singapore dollars.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Minister has not

replied  to  my question on whether or  not  the  13th

month allowance will be continued.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> The answer is yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, in the hope that the

Ministry  of  Finance will release the funds  required

for the Telok Blangah community centre within the next

six months, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr J F.

Conceicao



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head W be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead BAA 1105.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Conceicao is not moving. Amendment

(3). Mr Hwang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head W be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead BBA 1109*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr J. F. Conceicao.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second perhaps only to the complaints of discourtesy

and rudeness against civil servants is their habit  of

passing the buck. Indeed, in his recent speech to  the

House,  the  Hon, Prime Minister mentioned  that  even

some of his Cabinet colleagues were at times guilty of

buck-passing. We have had some evidence of that during

the  last  few  days'  debate. In  answer  to  various

complaints of inadequacies in services, some Hon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>



Ministers were only too happy to pass the buck  on  to

the  Finance  Minister by saying that  there  was  not

enough money, whereas in certain instances, I have had

my doubts as to whether money alone is the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it was Harry Truman when he was

unexpectedly called to be the President of the  United

States of America. He reportedly had installed on  his

desk  a sign which reads "The Buck Ends Here" to serve

as  a  constant reminder to him that he was the No.  1

boss.  We are fortunate to have in Singapore  a  Prime

Minister who does not have to be reminded that  he  is

the chief executive and acts as one. Had this not been

the case, I dread to think what would have happened to

Singapore  with  the rather prevalent habit  of  buck-passing.  As far as our Hon. Ministers are  concerned;

to be fair, I would like to think that they are rather

overloaded   with   the   day-to-day   work   of    an

administrative  nature which should  more  rightly  be

done  by civil servants. Consequently when these  Hon.

Ministers'   plates  are  too  full,  they   have   no

alternative but to pass on the buck to somebody else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you may think that I am being flippant but I

seriously   think   that  the  Civil   Service   Staff

Development Institute should include in its syllabus a

practical  course on "How Not to Pass the  Buck",  and

preferably the course should be conducted in a  really

down-to-earth   manner  with   plenty   of   practical

examples.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, behind the habit of buck-passing I suspect are

the  rather  more  serious problems of  communications

breakdown,   lack   of   proper   guidance   and   job

descriptions   within   our   entire   civil   service

structure.  If  a  junior officer is  put  on  counter

service  without adequate training and  without  being

told  what exactly is the extent of his authority  and

function,  who  is  to be blamed for buck-passing?  In

such  circumstances, the convenient way  out  for  the

junior  officer is obviously to say "You write to  us"

or "You see your M P'. At times, I wish I can pass the

buck  too  but  when the answer is obviously  "No",  I

would rather say "No" and face the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>



consequences  of  being cursed and sworn  at,  and  in

extreme cases, accompanied by acts of spitting  on  my

office floor than to waste people's time and money  on

a  wild  goose  chase. I believe this is  the  general

attitude   adopted  by  all  my  colleagues   at   the

Backbench.  Our  life  could be  made  a  little  more

tolerable  if  the  civil servants  could  follow  our

example.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think I can

express  as  eloquently the points made as the  Member

for  Jalan  Kayu. So that I am not accused of  passing

the  buck, I would like to say that I support  him  in

everything that he has said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, both the Members for Jalan Kayu

and  Katong  have been very helpful. In fact,  I  have

been  reading  the  interviews  which  our  Management

Development  people have had with them,  and  I  think

they  are  full of sound commonsense. Maybe we  should

incorporate  these  comments into  courses  for  civil

servants  so that they will learn how not to pass  the

buck.  But  in  some cases even the M Ps have  learned

that  it is not always best to say "no" to members  of

the  public. In fact, when they do say "no", sometimes

the public go to their MPs to complain of rudeness  on

the part of civil servants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept the suggestion that the Civil Service Staff

Development  Institute  should  have  more   practical

training programmes and that they should be geared  to

meet  the  needs of the Civil Service. If Members  are

interested they should look at the courses  which  are

being  run  by  the  Staff Development  Institute.  Of

course,  we try to tailor our courses to public  needs

and  if  there  are any deficiencies in them  we  will

always  be  happy  to  accept  suggestions  for  their

improvement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, by far, this must be one of

the most satisfactory answers that we have got out  of

so  many  days of debate. I beg leave to  withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head W be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead BCA 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Central Supplies Department is supposed to

be  responsible  for the supply of all  the  necessary

items  which Government departments require. It  is  a

standing  rule  that  Government departments  are  not

permitted to purchase anything from outside suppliers.

Yet quite often when a requisition is made for certain

items,  the  reply is "Out of stock". Sometimes,  even

common items like batteries, duplicating papers, etc.,

are out of stock. This Department which is supposed to

cater  for  the  needs  of all Government  departments

should keep their stocks of all items up-to-date.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the Central Supplies Department

caters   for   574   institutions  and  establishments

comprising    Government   departments,    ministries,

schools,  hospitals and certain statutory boards.  The

Department cannot possibly carry stocks of  all  items

that  may  be  required by them  from  time  to  time.

Currently, it carries stocks of 1.560 items which  are

commonly in use. Other items are purchased as and when

required.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I think the Minister did

not   answer   my  question.  Should  the   Government

departments purchase the items from outside or  obtain

them from the Central Supplies Department?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, if the requirement can be

bought  from  outside,  I think the  Central  Supplies

Department  will  buy and put them in  its  stock  and

supply  from  this stock to the Government departments

concerned.  I do not quite understand what  difficulty

there

is.   It   is   like  any  other  central   purchasing

department.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the duty of the Central

Supplies Department is to buy the things and keep them

in   stock   for  supply  to  Government  departments.

However,  sometimes  the Central  Supplies  Department

does  not  even keep a stock of duplicating paper  and

the  Government departments have to purchase them from

outside. They should keep a stock of all these items.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I accept the fact that the

Central Supplies Department must try and keep in stock

all  the requirements that Government departments will

need from time to time. In fact, they do keep most  of

the  items which are in common use. Occasionally, they

may  be out of stock, in which case, they may have  to

replenish  them  by purchasing from outside.  I  think

that is still the system.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, in view of the explanation

by the Minister, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr J F

Conceicao



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) That the sum to he allocated for Head W he

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead DAA 1105.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Conceicao is not here. Amendment (6), Mr P. Govindaswamy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head W be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead DEC 1111



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to claim tax relief for aged parents,

one has to satisfy the following conditions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) They are living in the same household as the

taxpayer;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) They are 55 years old or more or physically or

mentally handicapped;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) They do not each have an income exceeding $750

in the year preceding the year of assessment: and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) They are not the subject of claim made by anyone

under any other provisions of the Income Tax Act.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these conditions, it appears that some genuine

cases  of  claims have not been granted tax relief.  I

would like to seek clarification from the Minister  on

this  particular case of a girl who has to pay  income

tax  for  the first time last year. She has a  widowed

mother whose identity card shows the date of birth  as

1920. All  these years this girl has been  supporting

her mother by giving her a monthly allowance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>



Last year, when she claimed for tax relief, the Income

Tax  Department rejected her claim on the ground  that

the  mother was only 54 years. She was told  that  she

would  be eligible for tax relief this year. I  wonder

whether  this  is fair. If the girl is not  supporting

her  mother,  will the Social Welfare Department  give

aid  to  the  old lady? In exceptional cases  why  not

allow  children  to  claim relief for  maintenance  of

their  parents  who are not working  because  of  some

reasons.  Another  condition for relief  is  that  the

dependent parent must be living at the same address as

the  claimant. Many of our citizens are living in  HDB

flats  and  look after their family. But  often  their

aged  parents do not stay with them for they  live  in

another  house  or  probably  in  one  of  the   other

children's  houses  because  of  the  lack  of  rooms,

Parents  need  not  have to stay  together  with  the

claimants.   They   could  stay  in   another   house.

Nevertheless, claimants should be allowed  tax  relief

so  long  as  they support their parents. I  hope  the

Minister would relax this regulation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the income tax form has been modified over the

last two years. I must thank the Income Tax Department

for  simplifying it. However, there is still  a  snag.

The  present system of a joint declaration in a single

form  may  at times be impossible. There may be  cases

where  husbands and wives have been separated  because

of  some personal problems. Thus, the verification  of

the  returns  by  one  party may not  he  possible.  I

suggest  the form should be further modified  and, if

possible, the ticking system should be adopted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the relief granted for a wife is only $1,000 per annum. This relief is completely out of

proportion.  Since  inflation  has  brought  so   much

hardship,  the $1,000 relief, which was  introduced  a

long  time ago, is chicken feed. It is time the relief

for  the  wife  be  increased and,  if  possible,  the

personal relief for the taxpayer too.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Anson  has  complained about the conditions  regarding

the   implementation  of  tax  relief  for   dependent

parents,  c ting the case of a 54 year-old mother  who

could not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>



qualify  for relief because the stipulated  qualifying

age  is  55  years. I am afraid this is the inevitable

result  where the definite cutoff point is  specified,

as  in  this case. If we allow a 54 year-old dependant

to qualify, then we shall have next to consider the 53

year-old dependant, there will be no end to claims for

special  treatment.  Of course, if  the  dependant  is

handicapped, relief is already available even  if  the

dependant is below 55 years old.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the requirement that the dependent parents must

stay  with  the claimants before relief is granted,  I

have  explained the reason for requiring this  when  I

introduced the relief in 1973. One of the purposes  of

granting  such  `relief is to encourage  taxpayers  to

have  parents  living with them and not  left  out  in

dismal  isolation, especially in some  Social  Welfare

Home  for  the  Aged. Our Housing Board flats  are  no

longer  small.  More and more four or five-room  flats

are  being  built, and it should not be difficult  for

parents to stay with their children, This would be  in

the  tradition of the extended family common to  Asian

societies.   This   tradition  has  far-reaching   and

beneficial social effects and we must do all we can to

encourage it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also commented on the income tax return

form. I am glad that he has found some improvement  in

the  form.  He  has, however, objected  to  the  joint

declaration  by husband and wife on the same  form.  I

assure  the  Member  that  a  joint  return  is   riot

compulsory. Should any taxpaying couple find  it  more

convenient to file separate returns, they may do so by

writing  to the Comptroller of Income Tax for separate

forms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he has raised the question of increasing

the various personal tax reliefs. I have given reasons

why  this  was  not possible during the Budget  debate

last  week.  I  do  not  propose  to  take  much  time

repeating them.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg leave to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the sum to be allocated for Head W be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead DEF 1201.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been a wide speculation for a long

time  that TV licence fees will be increased very soon

and that the rate for the black and white TV set would

be double and that the rate for the colour TV set will

be  increased two to four times the present  rate.  So

far  there  has been no official comment made  by  the

department  concerned. Can I seek  clarification  from

the  Minister  on  this  point?  However, before  any

increase  is  made,  I  appeal  to  the  Minister   to

reconsider  the position and hope that the TV  licence

fees will not be increased. Sir, no doubt this subject

was  discussed during the debate in the  Committee  of

Supply under the head of the Ministry of Culture.  The

Minister  for  Culture has given a  favourable  reply.

However.  I  would like a reply from the Minister  for

Finance himself in order to clear any doubt because he

is  the  person who plays a major role in any increase

in taxes and other financial matters. Otherwise, as in

the past, we would find that the rates would be raised

within the fiscal year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be a certain amount of truth for the

press  to  have reported on the subject. But then,  if

the  press  reports were misleading. I feel  that  the

Minister  should  rectify  the  mistake  rather   than

mislead  or  keep  the  people in  suspense.  Can  the

Minister  explain  and guarantee that  such  increases

will not take place?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various forms of entertainment are too expensive

for   members   of  the  public.  Some  theatres   are

considering  increasing the prices of  their  tickets.

Many  other forms of entertainment are far beyond  the

reach  of  the ordinary worker. The cost of living  in

the  past few years has gone up so much so the  people

prefer to stay at home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The TV is quite often the only source of

entertainment in many homes. If there are TV5 at home,

the people will not go outside. They will enjoy the TV

programmes and thus help family planning. If the  rate

is  increased then we are just adding a heavier burden

on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>



the  family. This will be an unpopular move. No  doubt

costs of production, etc, have gone lip and I am  sure

TV  Singapore is not lacking in ideas in finding  ways

and  means to increase revenue, other than to increase

the rate of the TV licence fees.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since I have not

included any increase in TV licence fees in my  Budget

statement, the Member for Anson may rest assured  that

I  have no plans at this moment or indeed in the  near

future to increase the existing TV licence fee of  $36

per annum which applies to both black and white TV and

colour TV sets. As the Member has stated, the Minister

for  Culture has also made the same statement  to  the

same effect. As regards his suggestion that perhaps  I

should deny the speculation on taxes which appeared in

the  press, I would like to say that generally I would

not reply to such speculation because by a process  of

elimination, if anyone makes enough speculations and I

reply  to  enough of them, then he would know  exactly

what taxes remain to he imposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the

Minister  for the explanation. I beg leave to withdraw

my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head W be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead CAA 8201.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I merely war-it to

raise  a few questions in relation to the Jurong  Town

Corporation. First, does the Minister not  think  that

the  setup of the Jurong Town Corporation is now  over

expanded  to the extent that it has diverted from  its

original  objectives?  Can the JTC  run  its  multiple

functions,  such  as preparing lands  for  industries,

keeping up with development of gardens and parks, the

maintenance of housing estates, markets, food centres,

etc? Secondly, will the JTC raise the fees charged for

schools  and  sports  associations  using  the  Jurong

Stadium for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>



practice purposes? Thirdly, will the ground floors  of

the JTC flats to be built in future be left vacant  so

that  the residents can hold special functions or  for

children  to  play about just as in the Housing  Board

flats?  Lastly.  Boon Lay Gardens  is  a  new  housing

estate  which  has thousands of people staying  there.

But  surprisingly there is not a single eating  house,

commonly  known as a coffee house, in the estate.  The

residents find t very difficult to find a place  where

they can drink a cup of coffee or chit-chat with their

friends. I wonder whether the JTC can convert some  of

the existing shophouses into eating houses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the provision and

management  of markets, hawker centres,  food  centres

are a very minor part of the Jurong Town Corporation's

functions  and  should  not in  any  way  prevent  the

effective  discharge of its primary  responsibilities.

Markets  and  hawker  centres  are  desirable   social

amenities  which  must form an integral  part  of  the

housing  environment  created by the  Corporation  for

workers in the industrial estates. Since its inception

the  Corporation  has  been  developing  and  managing

canteens  and  other food centres in  its  estates  to

supplement markets and hawker centres provided by  the

Ministry of the Environment. From 1973 the Corporation

became  solely  responsible for  the  development  and

management of markets and hawker centres in new Jurong

Town  Corporation estates. This arrangement is similar

to that of Housing Board estates.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's second question is whether the Jurong

Stadium  will be opened free of charge to schools  and

sports associations for practice purposes. This  is  a

matter of administration and, while I do not have  the

information  and I am not really family  am  with  the

details of the Jurong Town Corporation, I believe  the

answer should be in the negative. The charges for  use

of  the  Jurong  Stadium facilities are  already  very

reasonable.  They are about the same as those  set  by

the  Singapore  Sports Council. The Stadium  is  being

heavily  used  at  the moment for athletic  meets  and

soccer  games  by the factory workers in  Jurong, the

Ministry of Defence,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>



and  occasionally the schools. This heavy demand makes

it  desirable, if not necessary, to confine the use of

the  Stadium  to those who are prepared  to  hire  the

facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's third question was whether the JTC

would  build  flats like the Housing Board  where  the

ground  floor could be used by residents  for  various

public functions. I am given to understand by the  JTC

that  the  open  deck  on the ground  floor  which  is

similar in design to that provided by the HDB has been

incorporated  by the Corporation in the 14  blocks  of

flats  now  under construction in the  Pandan  Housing

Estate, A similar design will also be adopted  in  the

additional  eight blocks of 800 units proposed  to  be

built at Kampong Java Teban.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the Member's question on coffee houses

for  Boon  Lay Gardens, I understand from  the  Jurong

Town  Corporation that the hawker centre at  Boon  Lay

Gardens has now been completed and that the allocation

of  65  stalls in the Centre was made last  month.  In

addition,  the  Corporation is now in the  process  of

obtaining the necessary approval for the conversion of

four  shophouses  into coffee shops or  coffee  houses

which  should be ready within the next three  to  four

months.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do agree that

markets and food centres are essential amenities in  a

housing estate. But is the Minister aware that due  to

wrong  choice  of sites, some hawker centres  are  not

very well patronised. In fact, they have become "white

elephants".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is in regard to the rent charged for

the  use  of the Jurong Stadium for practices  by  the

schools.  I cannot agree with the Minister  because  I

think  schools are nonprofit making organisations  and

the students are required to practise everyday. If the

schools  have to pay a fee for the use of the Stadium,

then  the schools will be heavily burdened. I  do  not

mind if the schools are charged a nominal sum for  the

holding  of functions like the annual athletic  meets.

but not for daily practices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the Minister can answer my points.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I have no doubt that the Jurong

Town  Corporation  from time to  time  may  make  some

mistakes in the choice of sites for hawker centres.  I

hope  they  will  do better in the  Member's  eyes  in

future, but I cannot guarantee that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards schools using the Jurong Stadium, I think

the  principle  is that there should be  some  way  of

allocating use and I cannot think of a better way than

to  charge  a certain small sum of money in  order  to

make  quite sure that when people make use of  certain

facilities they value this use. There is no reason why

the  Ministry of Education cannot afford to  give  the

schools  enough  money to pay for  the  rent  of  this

Stadium.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Sir, I was given to understand that

for each practice session, the schools have to pay $80

for  the  use of the Jurong Stadium. If they practise,

say, six days a week, it works out to $480 and this is

quite  an  exorbitant  sum of money  to  the  schools.

Anyway, as the Minister has given me replies to  other

questions, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by !eave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $786,687,370 for Head W ordered to stand

part of the Main Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $792,563,000 for Head W ordered to stand

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head X be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 1004.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this Ministry we have a new Department of

Scientific  Services which was formerly known  as  the

Department of Chemistry. I want to know the  functions

of  this  Department. What sort of scientific services

is   this   Department   offering   to   the   various

organisations in Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime ago, the Mechanical Engineering Department

of the University of Singapore conducted a research on

the   feasibility  of  using  solar   energy   as   an

alternative  or  extra  source of  energy.  They  have

collected  information on how much sunlight  Singapore

has for a whole year. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>



information  has been obtained to formulate  ways  and

means  by  which solar energy could be used. I  wonder

what  has happened to the research. Is it feasible  to

use  solar  energy as ar-i extra source of energy  for

Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides this, have there been any other studies made

on the use of monsoon winds as an additional source of

energy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that as our population and services grow, we

also  require  the much needed energy in  the  various

fields  of activities. There was a threat to  our  oil

supply  sometime ago. Now, the position has  improved.

But we would not know what would happen in the future.

Therefore, in   this  respect,  the  Department   of

Scientific  Services should conduct studies  and  find

ways and means of creating extra sources of energy  in

the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime ago there was a move in making Singapore

the  brain  centre in this region. I wonder  how  much

have  we  achieved  in this aim.  Do  we  have  enough

facilities and manpower to fulfil the concept? I would

also  like to know how best have foreigners  used  our

scientific services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the budget allocation, we note that a revote of

$3.41  million  is  provided for  the  Science  Centre

Building in Jurong. When will this building be finally

completed  so  that  it  could be  suitably  used  for

scientific purposes?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister for Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Science and Technology (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson has

touched  on  four  different areas.  The  first  point

concerns  the Department of Scientific Services  which

was  formerly  known as the Department  of  Chemistry.

Prior  to  1 972, the Department was mainly  concerned

with  providing  routine analytical chemical  services

for  items  such  as food, water, alcohol,  medicines,

drugs,  industrial pollution and related  services  on

toxicology  and forensic science. These services  were

mainly  provided to Government departments  to  enable

them  to  administer the various Acts and Regulations.

In the last few years, the range



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>



of services provided has been considerably expanded to

include  other branches of science, which now  include

services   in   areas  such  as  micro-biology, food

technology,   radiation   protection   and    chemical

engineering.   It  also  provides  services   to   the

commercial   and  industrial  sectors  as   and   when

required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member raised a few related questions on energy.

The  research at the Mechanical Engineering Department

of  the  University of Singapore on  solar  energy  is

still  in  progress. They have identified a few  areas

where they would profitably carry out the research and

we hope to be able to receive some preliminary reports

soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also inquired about the proposal to use

wind  as  a  source of energy. This again  is  in  the

preliminary  stage  of study.  I  am  not  quite  sure

whether we would come out with anything concrete  from

this particular area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we are also interested in other sources

of  energy supply such as the use of animal waste, and

recently there has been a proposal to use tidal  waves

as  well.  The  Member for Anson will appreciate  that

energy research is an extremely expensive undertaking.

I  think  the best strategy s for us to adopt whatever

development that is carried out elsewhere and  provide

our own innovations to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question the Member asked is how

successful we have been in developing Singapore into a

brain  and  service centre, Sir, it is a bit difficult

to quantify. Perhaps a good indicator is revealed in a

survey  in  1974 on engineering manpower where  it  is

revealed  that just over 40% of the engineers  in  the

private  sector  are  doing consultancy  work  outside

Singapore.  I think this is an indicator of  how  well

they are doing. The Ministry is currently conducting a

survey  on  the  consultancy work  undertaken  by  our

professional and scientific manpower and  we  hope  to

publish  a directory of consultancy services available

in   Singapore   to   help  our   professionals   sell

Singapore's expertise in this area.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the question of the Science Centre, the

building  will be ready towards the end of  this  year

and I hope it will be open to, the public sometime  in

the middle of next year.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I am very glad to hear the

Hon. Minister's reply, and I beg leave to withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head X be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead CAA 1201*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Yeo Toon Chia.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this amendment I would like to ask the

Minister  a  few questions. Firstly, up to  now,  what

success  has  been  achieved in the promotion  of  the

metric   system?  Is  the  Minister  happy  with   the

achievements so far? I remember last year the Ministry

launched the metrication exhibition and there was such

an   exhibition  in  the  community   centre   in   my

constituency. I would like to ask the Minister whether

the   Ministry   is  going  to  continue   with   such

exhibitions  or  campaigns to promote metrication,  so

that  more and more people will be better informed  on

how to use the metric system.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, with regard to metrication education in

schools, are students positively taught  the  use  of

metric  system and whether the teaching of metrication

in the schools has achieved good results?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the introduction of the metric system to

retail traders seems to have stopped this year. Why is

this so? Does it mean that there has been some setback

in the campaign to promote the use of metric system in

our shops?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, I wonder whether the Minister has seen on

our  TV  an advertisement showing two apples  weighing

100  grams.  The  viewers could not  quite  comprehend

this, wondering  whether  it  means  any  two  apples

together must weigh 100 grams? How can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>



they  say  that  every apple weighs 50 grams, because

there  are big and small apples as there are  big  and

small  pears.  Not  only the public  do  not  get  the

intended  message on metrication but they  are  misled

into  believing  that each and every apple  weighs  50

grams.  I would like the Minister to pay attention  to

such TV advertisements.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir.

with regard to the promotion of the metric system, the

results so far have been quite satisfactory. Last year

we  conducted a survey among housewives and found that

most  of them are aware of the metric system. However,

not every housewife is well-versed with the use of the

metric system. In view of this, we will strengthen our

campaign.  For  similar reasons  we  will  not  compel

traders to use the metric system this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also mentioned about the teaching of

metric  system  in  the schools. At  present  all  the

textbooks  use  the metric system. The exceptions  are

certain  geography textbooks which  are  published  in

other countries, and we cannot change it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned about a TV advertisement. I regret to

say  that  I do not watch TV very often; so  I  missed

this publicity. But I think probably the allegation is

true.  The  purpose of the programme is  to  encourage

people  to  think  iii metric, thus two  apples  weigh

about  100  grams. I also agree with the reasoning  of

the  Member  for  Sembawang and so I will  remind  the

Metrication Board to pay more attention to this, so as

not  to  mislead the people into a wrong understanding

of the metric system.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In view of the

Minister's detailed reply, I would like to withdraw my
