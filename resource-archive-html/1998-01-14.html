<div align="center"><b>INVESTMENTS IN SUZHOU</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

what  was the total of all Singapore monies, private and public,

invested  in  Suzhou and how much of it represented monies  from

the taxpayers.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP) is developed by a

Chinese-Singaporean joint venture company called China Singapore

Suzhou   Industrial  Park  Development  Company   (CSSD).    The

Singapore  Consortium,  called  the  Singapore  Suzhou  Township

Development  Pte  Ltd (SSTD) owns 65% of  CSSD.   There  are  24

shareholders  in SSTD.  Ten are Government linked  companies  or

statutory  boards,  whose total investment in  SSTD  is  US$65.5

million.    Ten  shareholders  are  Singaporean  companies   not

connected  with  the Government.  Four are non-Singaporean  MNCs

from Japan, South Korea, Netherlands and the US.  Details are in

the Annex (Cols. 125-32) which has been distributed.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1998/19980114/19980114-HA-0680125.htm">Annex (Cols. 125 - 132)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the SSTD shareholders include publicly listed

companies  and  MNCs, the SIP project has to be viable.   SSTD's

involvement  in  SIP has to be transparent  and  tenable.    Any

losses  sustained will be made public and available for scrutiny

by the international investment community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since SIP is a major infrastructure project, it is not

realistic  to  expect immediate profits.  But CSSD believes  SIP

can become profitable in the medium term, ie, within five to six

years from the start.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both governments are committed to the success of the

project.   Their strong support has enabled the park to  develop

rapidly in its first three years.  To-date, SIP has attracted 99

projects   with  investment  commitments  amounting  to   US$2.7

billion,  of  which  80  are industrial  projects  worth  US$2.1

billion.  The average size of projects, at US$27 million, is the

highest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



in  China.  41 plants have already started production  while  22

are  under construction.   These include major projects from the

US, Europe, Japan and other Asian countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, SIP's progress is being affected by the

aggressive  promotion of a rival industrial park by  the  Suzhou

Government, the Suzhou New District (SND).  When we started SIP,

SND  was already in existence.  However, Suzhou City and Jiangsu

Provincial  governments assured us that they  would  give  their

whole-hearted  support  to the SIP because  it  was  a  flagship

project  for both countries.  But over the past three years,  it

has  become clear that the Suzhou city government believes  that

they  will get more projects by promoting both parks.  They have

increasingly stepped up their support for SND against SIP.  This

culminated in the award of the APEC State Science and Technology

Park status for SND in September 1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such aggressive competition within Suzhou must reduce

investments  to  SIP.  Investors will stay away rather  than  be

caught in the competition between the two parks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a while, we dealt with this basic contradiction on a

case-by-case  basis.   But  at a meeting  with  German  business

leaders  in  Hamburg on 4th November last year, a  Suzhou  Vice-Mayor  openly  promoted SND and downgraded his own  government's

commitment to SIP.  He disagreed with German investors that  SIP

had  the  support  of President Jiang Zemin and  advised  German

companies to go directly into China without Singapore.  Two days

later,  in another forum in Cologne, he told investors that  all

the resources in Jiangsu and Suzhou would be placed behind SND.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International investors are now aware of the serious and

fundamental  conflict between SIP and SND.   They  must  believe

that  SND,  which is wholly owned by the Suzhou City government,

will  get  priority  support, not SIP, which is  only  one-third

owned   by  the  Chinese  joint  venture  partner.   To  restore

confidence, we must resolve the problem openly.  Investors



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



must be convinced that the problem has indeed been resolved, and

not simply swept under the carpet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign investors in SSTD, who have staked their money

on  the  success  of the SIP project, are also concerned.   They

expect a reasonable return on their investment, which they  made

in the belief that they would have fewer problems doing business

in China by participating in the Singapore-China project.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulties encountered by SIP, and the way they are

resolved, will set a precedent for how foreign investors in  the

SIP  can expect to resolve their own problems.  Our difficulties

must  be  settled  by rational and logical arguments.   We  must

restructure  the arrangements to become a win-win situation  for

both  Suzhou and the Singapore and foreign investors.  This will

boost  investor confidence in SIP.  If we gloss over the issues,

SIP  will  become  another  run-of-the-mill  park,  creating  no

special value for its shareholders, its tenants, or China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Chinese and Singapore governments recognise the

importance  of the project, and its benefits to both  countries.

President  Jiang Zemin has given his full support  to  resolving

the problem.  Singapore too is fully committed to the success of

SIP.   We  are  confident that by being open, and  tackling  the

issue  directly and completely, we will solve the  problems  and

restore the project to a strong and even footing.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, may I ask the Deputy Prime Minister  whether  the

Cabinet  had  received a full report from  the  Senior  Minister

after his recent visit to Suzhou and of his misgivings that were

reported in the local papers of the project?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam can

assume that the Cabinet is aware of the Senior Minister's views.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have a direct answer

to  my question, which is, have they received a full report from

the Senior Minister?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The matter has been discussed and all

Ministers are aware of the problem.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Another question, Sir. The Deputy Prime

Minister  talks about US$65 million investment of public  monies

in  this  project.  This, as we understand from him,  was  after

assurances by the local authorities that SIP would be given  the

highest  priority.  In view of this change in the attitude,  has

the  Singapore  Government taken up this matter at  the  highest

level with the Chinese government?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Has the Member forgotten how he became

aware of this problem?  It is because the Senior Minister raised

it at a high level and brought it out into the press.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask what representation has the

Singapore Government made to President Jiang?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The Senior Minister has raised the

matter   with  President  Jiang  Zemin  and  has  received   the

assurances from President Jiang Zemin that the project  has  the

full  support  of  the Chinese government and his  meeting  with

President  Jiang  was  prominently reported  in  all  the  major

newspapers in the PRC, both national and local.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask whether the Government has made

any government-to-government representations?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam may not

be aware, but the Senior Minister is a member of the Cabinet and

he speaks for the Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, at the time of

starting  the  Suzhou Industrial Park, was the Suzhou  municipal

government also a party to the arrangement?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> We discussed it with the Suzhou

municipal  authorities.  We negotiated the  agreement  with  the

central  government in Beijing and we are aware that the central

government made extensive consultations before they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>



committed,  and  the  agreement was signed  between  the  Senior

Minister and Vice-Premier Li Lanqing.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> So is the Suzhou municipal government

in fact reneging on their promises or agreement?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I would not use the phrase which Mr

Chiam has used but I would say that the expectations on which we

went  into  the  project  have not been  fulfilled  the  way  we

expected  them to, and that is why we are discussing the  matter

now.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> What does the Suzhou municipal

government  expect of the Singapore Government's stand  if  they

are not willing to cooperate?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not say that

they  are not willing to cooperate.  I said that we went  in  on

certain expectations which have not been entirely fulfilled.  So

we  will be discussing the matter with the Chinese government at

the  highest level and also at the municipal level and  we  will

work  out  a  fair,  rational and transparent solution  to  this

problem.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Is that not non-cooperation on the part

of the Suzhou municipal government?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Is the Deputy Prime Minister

aware  that when the Prime Minister visited Suzhou some time  in

September  last year he was reported to have said  that  he  was

satisfied  with  the  progress of the park.   But  three  months

later,  some time in December, when the Senior Minister  visited

Suzhou  he  gave  a  different  story.   Would  he  explain  the

discrepancy in the assessment of the progress of the park?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these are issues

which  built  up  over a period of time.  As I explained  in  my

answer,   the   park  has  indeed  made  significant   progress,

physically on the ground, in terms of attracting investments, in

terms of getting the type of investors in and the quality of the

projects,  they  have done very well.  There have  been  certain

problems,  which  I  have highlighted, to do with  the  priority

given to the park and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



diversion of effort and the conflict of interest between  Suzhou

New  District  and SIP, which we have been discussing  with  the

Chinese  authorities for some time and which have now  become  a

public  matter  as a result of what the Suzhou  Vice-Mayor  said

when he was in Germany last November.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you have a joint venture with a partner, there will

always  be  issues  to be discussed, whether  it  is  a  Chinese

partner,   a   Singaporean  partner  or  an  American   partner.

Depending  on  how the matters are resolved, these problems  can

either  be ironed out or, if they cannot, they have to be raised

to a higher level and discuss with greater seriousness, and that

is what we have done in this case.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Did the Singapore Government foresee

such  problems  with the development of SIP and whether  or  not

there  were  certain safeguards in the initial  negotiations  of

going into the project?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when we embark on a

project  of  this  scope and nature, we do  expect  problems  to

arise.   If it were not an ambitious project, it would not  have

been  worth doing.  This particular form in which it has  become

acute  we  could  not have foreseen, and we were  astonished  to

learn  that the Vice-Mayor had gone to Germany and spoken twice,

once  in  Hamburg,  to the Special Commissioner  for  Chancellor

Kohl, whose responsibility is to do German-Singapore-China joint

projects.   And this Vice-Mayor had told him that,  "You  should

not  go  in  with  Singapore.  Come in  alone.   We  don't  need

Singapore.   And  President Jiang Zemin does not support  Suzhou

Industrial  Park."   There was no reason whatsoever  for  us  to

anticipate  such  a  startling  statement  from  such  a  senior

official.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for provisions within the agreement, there are always

provisions for discussing and resolving problems, but it depends

on goodwill and coincidence of interests on both sides.  In this

case, it is not just a government-to-government agreement, which

has  to  do with the software transfer.  It is also a commercial

agreement with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>



commercial parties involved: on the Singapore side, a consortium

of  Singaporeans, GLCs, statutory boards, private companies  and

also  MNC  participants; on the Chinese  side,  also  a  Chinese

consortium.  So the shareholders expect their investments to  be

safeguarded.  There is no such thing as a risk-free  investment.

If there were, you would earn 3% interest, which is what you can

get for leaving your money in the bank.  So there will always be

a  risk,  but  at the same time the shareholders  expect  to  be

fairly  treated and expect their investments to be given a  fair

chance  to succeed.  And I think that is a significant safeguard

for all those who have put money into the project.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, since the

statement   by   President  Jiang  Zemin   about   the   central

government's support for the project, has this instruction  been

filtered down now to the municipal government in the sense  that

in  your  later contacts with them, have there been meetings  or

exchanges  where it shows that they are now toeing  the  central

government's line?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> We are in contact with them. We have

not  negotiated  the  issues  in further  detail.   We  are  now

studying  the  problem  in order to have  a  considered,  mature

response  which we would convey to the Chinese side as our  view

of how to deal with this problem, and we expect the Chinese side

will study that and give us their response in due course.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> I would like to ask the

Deputy  Prime Minister, in the Government's assessment,  in  the

long-term, will the problem be solved?  If the problem cannot be

solved and the current situation remains, what will be the  next

step for us to take?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps it is best if

I  just  re-read  the  last paragraph of my  answer:   Both  the

Chinese  and  Singapore governments recognise the importance  of

the  project,  and  its  benefits to both countries.   President

Jiang Zemin has given his full support to resolving the problem.

Singapore too is fully committed to the success of SIP.  We  are

confident that by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>



being  open, and tackling the issue directly and completely,  we

will solve the problems and restore the project to a strong  and

even footing.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, following the Party

Member's  question to the Deputy Prime Minister, is  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister saying then that all these problems arose  after

the  Prime  Minister's visit in September, that until  September

everything was wonderful in the garden?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not say that.

I  explained that when you have a joint venture, you  have  many

issues to be discussed and some become more complicated and some

become  simplified  and resolved, and this issue  could  not  be

resolved and eventually had to be brought out in the open.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can the Deputy Prime Minister say who

are our partners in this SIP?  Is it the central government?  We

seem  to  be  negotiating with the central  government  but  the

municipal government is the one that is giving us problems.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Chiam will know,

having  visited China, that there are many levels of  government

and authority in that country and all of them have influence and

we  require cooperation from all levels in order for our project

to  succeed.   So this is the problem which has to involve  many

levels and we are starting, including at the top.  Of course, it

will  require the cooperation of the provincial authorities  and

also  the  city authorities, but I do not think it is a  problem

which can be resolved by them alone.  That is why we have raised

the  matter  not  only  in Suzhou but also with  the  provincial

authorities and in Beijing.  In fact, the Senior Minister,  when

he  was on his trip in December, raised it with President  Jiang

Zemin  and Vice-Premier Li Lanqing.  He raised it with the Party

Secretary of the province, Chen Huanyou.  He raised it with  the

Governor of the province, Zheng Silin, and he had raised it also

with  the Party Secretary of Suzhou city, Yang Xiaotang.  So  we

have covered all bases.

<div align="center"><b>(Exposure to bad loans)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

what is the extent to which our local financial institutions are

additionally  exposed  to bad loans made to  regional  economies

with  rapidly falling currency and equity values, especially  in

October and November 1997, and whether such exposures will  lead

to banking crises similar to those in Thailand, Korea and Japan.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, 18% (S$41 billion)

of  the total global assets of the six local banking groups  are

in  Malaysia,  Indonesia, Thailand, Korea and  the  Philippines.

About two-thirds of this is in Malaysia, where several Singapore

banks have had a long-standing presence and have built up strong

business  relationships.  Of their S$28.0  billion  exposure  to

Malaysia,  S$4.9  billion  or  18%  is  to  their  branches  and

subsidiaries  in Malaysia. 2.4% ($5.5 billion)  of  their  total

global assets is in Indonesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detailed breakdown is as follows:

<pre>

     (As at end November 1997)

     Country      S$bn       Percentage of

                             Total Assets



     Malaysia     28.0       12.0%

     Indonesia    5.5        2.4%

     Thailand     4.1        1.8%

     Korea        2.7        1.1%

     Philippines  0.7        0.3%

     Total        41.0       17.6%

</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks grade their loans into five categories: Passed

(which  means  normal  repayment not overdue),  Special  Mention

(which means repayment not in jeopardy but evidence of potential

weakness in the borrower's creditworthiness), Substandard (which

means  repayments  are overdue or may be in jeopardy),  Doubtful

(which  means  full  liquidation of  outstanding  debts  appears

questionable and there is likely to be some loss) and,  finally,

Loss   (where   the   outstanding   debts   are   regarded    as

uncollectible).    So  Passed,  Special  Mention,   Substandard,

Doubtful and Loss.  If they are graded Substandard, Doubtful and

Loss, then they are considered as Classified loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of end-November 1997, classified loans to Malaysia,

Indonesia, Thailand, Korea and the Philippines amounted to  3.2%

(S$1.2  billion) of loans to these countries by the local banks.

This was 0.5% of their total global assets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total classified loans of the local banks, whether on

their  local  or  overseas loan portfolios, as a  percentage  of

their  total  loans,  was 2.0% as compared with  1.5%  one  year

earlier.  As a percentage of their total global assets, this was

1.7% as compared with 1.3% one year earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These figures are as of end-November 1997. As the

regional crisis unfolds, the percentage of classified loans will

increase.  The local banks have informed the MAS that they  will

make  adequate  provisions  for this eventuality  in  line  with

prudent banking practice, in addition to the specific provisions

which they have made on the existing classified loans.  The  MAS

is monitoring the situation closely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The local banks are in a strong position. They have

strong  capital  positions exceeding 12% of their  risk-weighted

assets,  higher than most international banks.  They  have  also

built  up  substantial  buffers, as  a  result  of  prudent  and

conservative accounting practice.  Many of the assets  on  their

books are valued at historical prices, well below present market

values.  They have also made substantial general provisions over

the  years,  in  anticipation of precisely such an  eventuality.

There is no danger of their regional exposures causing a banking

crisis in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our banks to grow, they must venture into the region.

This will always involve some risk, as the current crisis shows.

But  it  would be totally wrong to conclude from this experience

that our banks and other firms should stay in Singapore and stop

venturing offshore.  The right approach is for them to  evaluate

investments   carefully,  diversify  and   manage   their   risk

exposures, and build up reserves in good years.  Then  they  can

weather  the storms which are inevitable from time to time,  and

be  ready  to  benefit from their regional operations  when  our

neighbours eventually recover, which they will.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Deputy

Prime  Minister  has given a snapshot of the  banking  industry.

But  surely some banks are more vulnerable or more exposed  than

others.   The  question I want to ask the Deputy Prime  Minister

is:  is  there  one of the weaker banks that  may  have  a  more

serious problem than the rest?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The banks vary in their exposures but

all  of  them are sound.  As you are aware, we have a  Committee

working on disclosure standards for the individual banks.  It is

not  for me to announce individually their results.  In fact,  I

am not allowed by the MAS Act to do so.  But it is for the banks

themselves  to do so and we have strongly encouraged them,  even

before this problem arose, to put out more information on  their

annual  statements, balance sheets and profit and loss accounts,

so  that investors can make sound decisions and assessment as to

what their state is.  The problem is we have not put out as much

as we could have done and as a result, even though the banks are

sound, people fear the worst, which is not really justified.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> The figures which the

Deputy Prime Minister has mentioned really show that exposure to

Indonesia  and the other countries which are badly  affected  by

the Asian currency crisis is really rather small.  Is there,  in

his  view, therefore any reason why the banking counters at  our

stock  exchange  had  actually fallen  so  rapidly,  except  for

yesterday?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> There are two things on which the MAS

never  expresses its views.  One is the stock market, the  other

is the exchange rate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, earlier the Deputy

Prime  Minister had said that the banks had substantial  general

provisions.   Is it possible for us to know what  percentage  of

total loans would that be?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I leave it to the banks to put out

information which is necessary in due course.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> I have two questions. Firstly, I fully

support  the  Deputy Prime Minister's point earlier  that  there

should  be  more transparency in the reporting by the  banks  in

Singapore.  I want to ask whether there are measures that MAS or

the  Government is considering to encourage the banks to be more

transparent   in   their   announcements   and   more    regular

announcements on the state of their financial affairs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is, looking at the exposure, it seems

that  the  biggest  exposure  of  $28  billion  is  actually  in

Malaysia.  Could more information be given on this figure?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> On the first question, as I told the

House  and which we have published, we already have a committee,

chaired  by  Mrs  Elizabeth Sam of OCBC,  working  on  improving

disclosure  standards  and  raising them  to  developed  country

levels,  which means like those in UK and Europe.  So  I  expect

them  to complete their work within this year and I would expect

that  even  before they complete their work, the banks  will  do

their own internal reviews and soul-searching and identify  ways

in  which  they can put out more information to the shareholders

and to the investing public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question, the $28 billion in Malaysia, as I

explained,  many of the Singapore banks have had a long-standing

presence  and strong business relationships there.  Of this  $28

billion,  $4.9  billion  is  extended  to  their  branches   and

subsidiaries  in  Malaysia.  The rest are commercial  loans  and

investments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the exposure or

vulnerability of the banking system is dependent on the size  of

banks.  Will the Deputy Prime Minister say that current size  of

our  banks is large enough to weather this storm or should there

be further consolidation?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is really a

separate question which Mr Shriniwas Rai has asked about banking

mergers, and I have given him an answer.  I think the answer  to

the question will be there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to be regional players and if we want to weather

possible  upsets like this, then size is important.  Size  means

you  can  do  bigger  deals; size means you can  weather  bigger

upsets  in your individual investments; size means you can  have

more  critical mass to justify and build up expertise,  analysis

expertise, expertise to develop services for your customers  and

to  be able to hold your own against other players.  There is no

obvious final optimum size.  Even the biggest banks in the world

are  merging.   Bank of Tokyo has merged with  Mitsubishi  Bank.

SBC  is  merging  with UBS in Switzerland.  Our banks  are  many

times smaller than those, and I do not think I am giving away  a

secret  if  I  say  that  the Government has  always  encouraged

Singapore  banks to become bigger and to merge with one  another

in order to achieve this.

<div align="center"><b>(Impact)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister what is

the impact of rising interest rates on the economy.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, MAS does not expect

the  recent rise in interest rates to hurt the Singapore economy

significantly.  Our corporate and household debts are both quite

low. An MAS study has found that the debt-to-equity ratio of 181

companies listed on the Stock Exchange was 40% in 1996, compared

with  220%  for  the top 20 listed Korean companies.   Household

debt repayment burden, ie, the proportion of personal disposable

income used to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



service  debt  payments, including both interest and  principal,

was  25% in 1996.  At these levels of indebtedness, a 1-2% point

increase  in  interest  rates  will  not  significantly   impair

corporate profitability nor increase household debt burden.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higher interest rates will tend to depress asset values,

such  as share and property prices.  Households which have over-extended   themselves,  particularly  those  who  have  borrowed

excessively  to finance share purchases or buy properties,  will

face  difficulties.   But the larger impact  on  our  share  and

property  market, and the main challenge now facing our economy,

is the continuing economic crisis in the region.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, I think we live in a very

extraordinary period.  My question to the Deputy Prime  Minister

is  that  since rising interest rates have an adverse impact  on

the  property market, especially mortgages, will the  Government

review further its land sales programme, Sir?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we announced in

November last year that we had deferred land for 2,000 units  of

private property from last year's fourth quarter sales into  the

first  half  of this year and that we would review the  position

after  the  first quarter.  We have not begun to act,  but  that

plan stands.

<div align="center"><b>AUTOLOGOUS BLOOD BANK</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Health if he will

consider  setting up an autologous blood bank  for  the  general

public.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Aline K. Wong)</b>

<b>(for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of

Health   has   been  promoting  the  use  of  autologous   blood

transfusion as part of a national strategy to make  use  of  all

available  blood resources to support our health care  services.

Demand  for blood by our hospitals has been increasing and  will

continue  to do so.  Autologous blood collection can  complement

voluntary  donations.  However, voluntary donations must  remain

the main source of blood for our transfusion service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Blood Transfusion Service and many public and

private  hospitals  offer autologous blood collection  services.

These autologous blood transfusion services include deposits  of

one's  own  blood  for self use before surgery,  collecting  the

blood  in  the  operating  room and the  use  of  blood  salvage

procedures.    The  autologous  blood  collection  and   banking

services  are  meeting  current needs and  can  be  expanded  if

necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Blood Transfusion Service also provides a

special service for the long-term storage of autologous blood in

the  frozen  state for persons who may have unusual requirements

for transfusion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These steps taken by the Ministry in respect of autologous

blood  transfusion  should  suffice to  meet  both  current  and

projected  needs.  My Ministry will review the situation  should

there be greater demand for autologous blood in the future.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I am not referring

to  autologous  blood  transfusion which is  now  available  for

surgery.   I  am  referring to autologous  blood  bank  for  the

general public where blood can be stored for use in emergency at

any time in the future for a period of up to about 10 years.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not immediately

clear  from  the  question raised by  the  Member  that  she  is

referring  to  this  type of long-term storage  of  blood.   For

persons who have need for this type of storage beyond the common

storage period of five weeks, this service is available  at  the

blood  centre.  However, based on past demand, this service  has

not  really  been popular.  As I said, the present services  are

adequate to meet the demand.  We will monitor the situation.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask if the Ministry is in favour of the

setting up of an autologous blood banking service, if necessary,

by a private enterprise?

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> It is up to the private sector to set up

such  a service or bank if there is a demand and market for  it.

I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>



understand  that,  in the past, there was a  private  autologous

blood  bank but, unfortunately, the demand was not there and  so

about a year ago, it closed the services.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The Minister noted that a private

autologous  blood  bank has been closed.  But  in  view  of  the

recent  report  of  two cases of tainted  blood,  is  there  not

probably a need now for this kind of a blood bank?

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> As I said, the services for autologous

blood  donation  have been there for some  years  and  they  are

available  at many public and private hospitals. We  are  taking

steps  to  encourage patients and the doctors  in  hospitals  to

consider  this alternative.  We will see what is the pattern  of

demand.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Are the two reported cases of tainted

blood  not  enough  to  warrant  the  Government  to  start   an

autologous blood bank?  Or is the Government just waiving  these

two reported cases and not take note of them?

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> The two cases of tainted blood are through

voluntary  donor  donation.  But as  I  said,  the  service  for

autologous blood donation has always been there.  If people  are

very concerned about this, they can still demand or request  for

these services at present.

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, as blood

product  has a limited lifespan and cannot be kept for prolonged

periods  of  time,  I would like to ask the Ministry  about  the

suggestion  brought up by Dr Lily Neo and whether there  is  any

example  of  such  a  so-called autologous blood  bank  for  the

general  public  since  it is not possible  to  keep  blood  for

prolonged periods of time.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> As the Member mentioned, it is feasible but

I  am  not  sure  how difficult it is to store  blood  beyond  a

certain period of time.  It is difficult and the demand  is  not

there.  Even the experiences of autologous blood banks in  other

countries  have  shown  that  many of  them  have  closed  their

services.

<div align="center"><b>LOAN TO INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Finance what

actions  can  Singapore pursue should the Indonesian  government

default  in  repayment of the loan which Singapore  extended  to

them.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the US$5 billion loan to Indonesia is a  stand-by

facility  which will only be used when Indonesia has drawn  down

their  own  resources and other loans from international  bodies

such  as  the IMF, World Bank and ADB.  Other countries such  as

Japan,  US, Australia, Malaysia and Brunei have also contributed

to  the stand-by facility.  As previously stated, it is a second

line of defence and to-date, no funds have been disbursed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, this is a sovereign loan which carries commercial

interest rates throughout its tenor.  Indonesia has up  to  five

years  to  repay any draw-downs.  We do not expect Indonesia  to

default  on  their  loan  obligations.  The  country  has  never

defaulted  on such loans.  They are a fellow ASEAN  member  with

abundant natural resources.  At the end of 1996, the annual  GDP

of  Indonesia  was  US$228 billion.  This  is  more  than  twice

Singapore's GDP.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Would the Minister disclose the terms

<div align="center"><b>UPGRADING OF HDB FLATS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for National

Development whether, in view of the current currency turmoil  in

the  region  and  the  expected slow down of  our  economy,  the

Government will be able to upgrade the HDB flats as promised  in

the last General Election.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, the Main Upgrading Programme for HDB flats  is

funded out of budget surpluses.  In recent years, the Government

has  consistently accumulated budget surpluses  through  prudent

fiscal  policies.  Therefore, the progress of the Main Upgrading

Programme has so far been smooth and uninterrupted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent currency turmoil has created uncertainties in

the  economic outlook of the region.  Our economy will slow down

in  the short term.  Government revenue in fiscal year 1998 will

be  affected although we still expect a budget surplus. The Main

Upgrading Programme can therefore continue although we will have

to  scale back the programme to 10 precincts in 1998 compared to

15  precincts  last year.  Over the longer term, the  Government

remains  confident  about Singapore's economic  prospects.   The

Main Upgrading Programme will continue whenever there are budget

surpluses.   Over  the next five years, we  will  implement  the

Upgrading Programme as we promised in the last General Election.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> How much did the Government spend on

upgrading of HDB flats last year ending 31st December?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> On the average, every year, we announced

a launch of 15 precincts which totalled about 15,000 units.  The

budget  for  each  unit is under $60,000 per unit.   The  actual

expenditure  per  year  depends on the progress  of  works  from

previous  precincts.   As  you know,  today,  we  have  over  50

precincts  which are undergoing the Main Upgrading Programme  at

different  stages.  So if the Member wants the  specific  amount

that we spent last year, I will get the number for him.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Since Singapore is making a loan of $5

billion  to  Indonesia, will there be a run down  of  funds  and

there will not be enough funds for upgrading?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As Dr Richard Hu explained just now, the

loan  to  Indonesia is a separate issue from the funds given  to

HDB for the Main Upgrading Programme.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>



The  Main Upgrading Programme is funded out of budget surpluses.

So  for  FY 98, the Ministry of Finance expects to run a  budget

surplus  and therefore we are allowed to continue with the  Main

Upgrading Programme, albeit on a smaller scale, ie, 10 precincts

a year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> If there are already funds in hand, why

should the Government reduce their upgrading programme from 15

to 10 precincts?  We should not be affected by the currency

turmoil.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The currency problems affecting the

region  would  result  in slower economic growth  for  Singapore

which  would  result  in smaller Government revenue  and  hence,

smaller  budget surpluses.  Therefore, as a prudent measure,  we

have scaled down the MUP accordingly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Is the Government saying that the funds

for   upgrading   are  in  fact  dependent  on  a   year-to-year

collection, ie, whether there are surpluses?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> We have been saying so for the last

seven years.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> It means that if the economic situation

really  becomes  bad,  there  will  be  no  upgrading.   So  the

Government cannot keep its promise then.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> We have also said that for the last seven

years.   The  people believed that this Government would  run  a

prudent  fiscal policy and ensure budget surpluses and that  the

MUP will continue.  That is why they voted for us.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> If there is going to be a reduction in

upgrading, what is the Government's priority criteria?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> You can be quite sure that it would not

be Potong Pasir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Not Potong Pasir. Will it be last or

<div align="center"><b>MEASURES TO ADJUST POLICIES ON PROPERTY MARKET</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Implementation)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Inderjit Singh</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  whether  his  Ministry  decided  to  implement  the

recently  announced measures to adjust policies on the  property

market because of lobbying by the developer groups.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, the policy adjustments on

residential properties announced on 18th November are  necessary

to avoid aggravating the excess supply and further destabilising

the  property  market.  An unstable property market  would  have

serious  ramifications on the overall economy,  especially  when

confidence   has  been  affected  by  the  prevailing   regional

financial difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures were not introduced due to lobbying by the

developers.   They were introduced for the overall good  of  the

nation, and not to cater to the interest of any specific group.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, as a result of the currency turmoil

and regional countries facing financial difficulties, it is very

likely  that  the  number  of  foreigners  who  will  invest  in

properties in Singapore will be reduced.  Was this foreseen when

the last announcement was made?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, as the Deputy Prime Minister

explained just now in answer to an earlier question, we made the

announcement in November considering the situation  then  -  the

slower  demand, currency problems up to November,   less  demand

from  foreigners, excessive supply.  Since then, of course, many

things  have happened.  We are continuing to monitor and  review

the  situation.   But as of now, the present situation  and  the

decision of November still stand.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, the Minister mentioned that the

decision  made  was  independent of the  lobbying  by  developer

groups.   The  reason why I ask the question is that  it  seemed

quite  a  coincidence that the action came quite soon after   we

heard  the  lobby  from REDAS which was basically  made  to  the

Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I have is: when did the Government

realise  that the property market was heading for trouble?   Was

it  after the developer groups lobbied to the Government or  was

it through some other assessment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The Ministry of National Development

conducts  regular dialogues with various groups  -  with  REDAS,

architects,  engineers.   We  monitor  the  property   situation

closely.  We were watching the reaction to the May 1996 measures

and  we  were checking the developments in the property  market.

We  knew  that  the supply that is forthcoming due  to  previous

years'  sales will result in between 10,000-12,000  units  every

year,  and  we  were watching whether there will be  demand   to

absorb this supply.  In the good years, the demand easily ranged

between  10,000-12,000.  In 1996 and also in 1997,  we  expected

the  demand  to range between 6,000-8,000 units.  So curtailment

of  the supply for the last quarter of 1997 and a review of  the

1998 supply are prudent things to do.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, will the Minister agree that the

Government's  response to the likely downturn  of  the  property

market  seems to be a shift, compared to several years ago  when

Singaporeans complained that property prices were too  high  and

there  was  a  lot  of speculation.  It seems  to  me  that  the

Government was dragging its feet in depressing property  prices.

Would the Minister care to explain?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> That is not true. As property prices

moved  up  since 1992, the Government increased land sales  from

1,000 to 1,500 units, from 2,000 to 3,000, to 4,000 and then  to

6,000  units.  So the Government has responded each year with  a

larger  land sales increase.  Similarly, in this downturn,  once

we detect that there will be excess supply, it would seem rather

irresponsible of the Government to continue to push out 5,000 or

7,000 units when the demand is not there.  So we have moved  the

supply  up when the demand is there and I think correspondingly,

it  is right for us to also cut back on the supply if the demand

is soft.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether he will

consider providing structural allowances for future installation

of ceiling hoists which are useful aids that link the bedroom to

the   bathroom  so  that  the  weak  elderly  may   move   about

independently?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I thank the Member for the suggestion. I

will get the HDB to consider it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, this may appear to be operationally

efficient. But would it not be better to integrate these  blocks

of  flats with the existing blocks, rather than keeping separate

blocks for the elderly?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the challenge of the

elderly  in  our society will require many different  solutions.

There  will not be just one single solution.  As regards  stand-alone  studio  apartments, we are trying out this solution.   We

have   also  tried  solutions  of  integrating  senior   citizen

facilities, smaller apartments with bigger flats in  Pasir  Ris.

That  did not work out but that does not mean that we will  give

up.  We will try again in other towns.  Sir, I would say that we

will  continue  to  try  different  solutions  and  maybe  under

different  circumstances,  some of  these  solutions  will  work

better.

<div align="center"><b>CLOSURE OF MICROPOLIS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Inderjit Singh</b> asked the Minister for Finance to

inform the House (i) what led to the closure of Micropolis  just

under 2 years after Singapore Technologies acquired the company;

(ii)  what  went wrong in the process of the acquisition;  (iii)

how  much money was lost from the acquisition to the closure  of

the  company;  and (iv) where did the money for investment  come

from.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore

Technologies  saw opportunities in the hard disk drive  business

of Micropolis and decided to buy over Micropolis' worldwide hard

disk drive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



business  in April 1996.   The new Micropolis management,  which

led  the  acquisition, had expected to turn the  company  around

from  its  previous losses and re-establish it as  a  profitable

high-end disk drive manufacturer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following its acquisition by Singapore Technologies in

1996,  Micropolis refocused its range of product  offerings  and

changed  its market strategy to focus on the original  equipment

manufacturing (OEM) sector of the market.  With the phasing  out

of   obsolete  products  and  the  launching  of  new  products,

Micropolis   managed  to  secure  several  new  OEM   customers.

Micropolis  also continued to reduce operating losses throughout

1996,  and  turned in a profit for the month of  December  1996.

Therefore,  although  total operating losses  amounted  to  S$76

million   in  1996,  Micropolis  was  actually  showing  gradual

improvement in its performance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the high-end disk drive industry took a dramatic

downturn  in  1997, with the aggressive entry of  several  major

players.   As  most  of  you may know  from  the  various  press

reports,  there was severe over-capacity in 1997 as a result  of

simultaneous  investments by existing  and  new  players.   This

resulted  in over-supply and intense price competition.   Prices

were  dropping  at 16% to 18% each quarter in 1997,  some  three

times the normal rate of 5% to 6% price erosion each quarter  as

manufacturers  competed  for market  share.   Industry  analysts

believed  that  the disk drive industry is in the  throes  of  a

major adjustment stretching into 1998.  The leading players have

either sounded alarm over their earnings prospects or have taken

steps to consolidate their operations, including closing plants,

laying off workers or delaying new investments.   In fact, there

are  reports in today's papers regarding Seagate's, the  largest

disk  drive  manufacturer in the world, plans for  such  changes

this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout 1997, Micropolis' operating losses mounted, as

sales  continued  to fall below projections and product  margins

were eroded faster than expected.  There



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>



was  excess inventory in the market.  Micropolis was  unable  to

turn around in 1997. Operating losses progressively worsened  in

the  first  half of 1997.  By mid-1997, Micropolis  was  already

exploring various alternatives for partnerships or mergers  with

other  market  leaders  but  without  success.   Prospects   for

recovery  worsened  considerably with the sharp  change  in  the

competitive  environment as 1997 progressed.   By October  1997,

the  operating  loss  for  the year had reached  S$200  million.

Having  reviewed  the company's business performance,  resources

and  prospects, the Micropolis Board of Directors was left  with

no choice but to wind up the business.



<br><br><i>What went wrong in the process of the acquisition?</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to accept that risk-taking is part and parcel of

all  investment  decisions.  In acquiring Micropolis,  Singapore

Technologies had believed that the new management could turn the

company  around by focusing on the high-end niche  market  which

had  been  a profitable industry segment. Singapore Technologies

carried  out  a  four-month  due  diligence  with  its  external

consultants  on  the investment before the acquisition.   As  it

turned out, the severe over-capacity in the high-end disk  drive

market was not anticipated by Singapore Technologies and was the

main reason which made this investment a loss-making venture.



<br><br><i>How much money was lost from the acquisition to the closure of the company?</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company is under liquidation. This means that the

financial  affairs  of  Micropolis  are  now  independently  and

professionally managed by experienced liquidators from reputable

international  firms.  They will determine how best  to  recover

and  dispose  of  the assets of the company in  the  process  of

liquidation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the Statement of Affairs lodged by the Liquidators

of  Micropolis  in  December  1997,  Micropolis  does  not  have

sufficient  realisable  assets  to  fully  repay  the  unsecured

creditors,   including   Singapore   Technologies.      Recovery

expectation is about 10% of the debts claimed.

<div align="center"><b>SMALL CLAIMS TRIBUNALS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Small Claims Tribunals Act

(Cap 308) to increase the administrative efficiency of the Small

Claims  Tribunals and to enable them to provide a better  public

service.   In  March  1996, the Chief Justice,  in  his  keynote

address  at  the  Fifth  Subordinate  Courts  Workplan  Seminar,

announced that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>



operational  and  jurisdictional aspects  of  the  Small  Claims

Tribunals would be regularly reviewed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A working committee, chaired by a District Judge and

comprising  members  from the Subordinate Courts,  has  proposed

amendments to the Small Claims Tribunals.  The Chief Justice has

endorsed these amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments seek to achieve the following objectives:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, enlarge the powers of the Registrar of the Small

Claims Tribunals;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, expedite the procedure for the hearing and

disposal  of  claims  through  a  system  of  consultations  and

hearings  by telephone,  videophone and other electronic  means;

and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, permit respondents to admit claims by telephone or

in writing.



<br><br><i>Enlarging the powers of the Registrar</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, applications to set aside orders made in default

by   the   Registrar  of  the  Small  Claims  Tribunal  at   the

consultation  stage  are  heard only by  a  Referee.   As  these

applications  are simple and straightforward, the Registrar  can

deal  with  them.  Further, under the current position,  if  the

Referee  allows the application to set aside the default  order,

he  will  proceed to hear the claim.  This deprives both parties

of  the  opportunity to settle the claim by consultation  before

the Registrar.  The proposed amendments will allow the Registrar

to proceed with the consultation after setting aside the default

order and to refer the matter to the Referee only if there is no

settlement  after the consultation.  The proposed amendments  to

section  17, by adding two new sub-sections (9) and  (10),  will

empower  the Registrar to hear the application to set aside  the

default order.



<br><br><i>Consultations and hearings via telephones, videophones or other electronic means</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, after a claim is filed with the Tribunals, a

Notice of Consultation is sent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>



to both parties requiring them to attend a consultation session.

If  a  settlement is not reached at the consultation stage,  the

matter will be fixed for hearing.  Both parties are required  to

attend  the consultation and hearings, if any, at the  Tribunals

personally.   The  proposed amendment  to  the  Act  will  allow

parties  to  claims  to  participate in  the  consultations  and

hearings  via  a  telephone  or  videophone  link-up  between  a

Regional Centre and the main Small Claims Tribunals' location at

the  Apollo Centre.  This will make it more convenient  for  the

parties,   especially  those  who  live  near   these   Centres.

Consultations by telephone and videophone via video-conferencing

will  be  for all claims, but hearings will be limited  only  to

admissions.  The amendments will provide for safeguards  against

a  situation where a party participating in the consultation  or

hearing is an impersonator or does not have authority to do  so.

Sir,  new  sections 17A and 22A will be inserted to provide  for

this new procedure.



<br><br><i>Admission of claims by telephone</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, when a respondent admits a claim, he has to

attend  the consultation in person to admit to the claim, except

when the claim is settled prior to the consultation.  Similarly,

if  he wishes to admit to the claim at the hearing stage, he has

to present himself in person.  The proposed amendment will allow

a respondent to admit claims by telephone at any time before the

consultation or hearing stages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has provisions for safeguards against admissions

by   impersonators  or  unauthorised  persons.    Further,   the

respondent  can  apply to set aside consent  orders  made  as  a

result  of  any  admission  made by an  impersonator  or  by  an

unauthorised  person.  A new section 18A  will  be  inserted  to

provide for this new procedure.



<br><br><i>Admission of claims in writing</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some respondents have enquired if they can admit claims

in  writing  and  be excused from attending the consultation  in

person.  The present legislation does not provide for admissions

in  writing.  Respondents have to attend personally  before  the

Registrar to admit the claim.  Allowing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>



admissions  to  be made in writing will provide  another  medium

through  which respondents can admit claims.  A new section  18A

will  be  inserted  to provide for this.  As  a  safeguard,  the

Registrar  can reject such admissions and direct the  respondent

to appear in person at the consultation or hearing.



<br><br><i>Amendment of Section 38</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 38 of the Act has been amended to allow persons

aggrieved  by  any orders made by the Registrar or the  Tribunal

under  the  proposed sections 17(9), 17A(3), 18A(5), 22A(3)  and

26(1)  to apply to the Tribunal to set aside the orders and  the

Tribunal  is empowered to make such further order as  it  thinks

just.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that the proposed amendments

will  improve the administrative efficiency of the Small  Claims

Tribunals  and provide a better service and greater  convenience

to the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support  the introduction of this amendment Bill.  I  would  say

that this is very good progress in terms of making available the

technology  to  aid  the  claims of consumers  and  other  small

claimants.  I wish to make some observations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the new section 17A(1) deals with telephone,

videophone or any other electronic means.  It states that  these

means  would be allowed for the proceedings of the Small  Claims

Tribunals.  Under the proposed section 22A, some hearings  would

also   be  made  using  this  new  modern  means  of  electronic

communications.    But   by   the   principles   of    statutory

interpretation, the so-called eiusdem generis principle, general

words  used  in a statute will be limited to the same  class  of

communications,  ie, in this case, types of telephones,  because

of  the  words "telephone" and "videophone".  This will  exclude

audio-conferencing where the telephone is not used directly,  or

video-conferencing where the medium of conveying the message  is

not a telephone



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



line  but, say, a cable or broadcasting and satellite media,  or

even a set top box placed on top of a television.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask if the Minister would state that such

a limitation is not really the intention of the Bill.  Secondly,

some   electronic   means  are  obviously   unsuitable   for   a

consultation before the Registrar.  So the words should  not  be

too  broad.  Such electronic means could include e-mail or  even

if  it  is  instantaneous e-mail, perhaps even fax machines  and

other modes of telecommunication where the authentication of the

other  party is susceptible to fraud and impersonation.  I would

thus  call  on  the Minister to promulgate some  regulations  by

laying  down  the  procedures  and  standards  of  security  and

authentication  for  such  consultations  and  admissions,   and

describe  the circumstances in which such electronic means  will

be  accepted  or rejected for the purposes of the  Small  Claims

Tribunals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under new section 18A(1), admission of a claim can be

made  orally by telephone and I would similarly ask the Minister

to  mention the minimum standards and procedures of security for

such means.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to new sections 17A(4), 18A(6) and 22A(4), an

application to set aside an order of the Registrar must be  made

within  one  month  of  the order.  I am  concerned  about  this

because  I am afraid that in many cases before the Small  Claims

Tribunals, it involves consumers who may not be very savvy as to

the  ways  of  court and the ways of the law and  therefore  may

actually  be  at a disadvantage.  For example, if an  order  has

been made, the party that obtains the order could hold on to the

order  for  more  than  a  month  and  then  serve  it  on   the

unsuspecting  consumer, by which time it would be too  late  for

him  to set aside and he would have to first ask for leave  from

the  tribunals  before he can set aside  the  order.   And  this

additional process will actually deter him.  I would ask if  the

Minister  could  consider regulations that would perhaps  remove

this difficulty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would just like to mention that perhaps in future

amendment to the Small Claims Tribunals Act the Minister could



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



also  look  into expansion of the jurisdiction, for example,  in

house  renovations  below $40,000 which is really  the  kind  of

renovation that small householders of 3-rooms and 4-rooms  would

actually do as a basic renovation and these claims are presently

not  covered.   Additionally, claims by people who  have  bought

time-shares,  because time-shares hover in  this  twilight  zone

between  services and property.  And presently  people  who  are

taken  advantage of cannot go to the Small Claims  Tribunals  to

advocate their cases.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I thank Dr Toh for first

supporting  the  Bill and also making some observations  on  the

Bill.  Let me respond to these observations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first point is a point for clarification. He

asked whether the term "or any other electronic means" should be

read  restrictively in accordance with the eiusdem generis rule.

Let me first say that we are taking this one step at a time.  We

will first start with telephones and videophones, and I think we

will  use those for some time to assess how they work.  The idea

here is to provide for other electronic means that may emerge in

the  future.  Therefore, for the sake of clarity, let me say now

that  we do not want to circumscribe the new means to which this

process  can  be  adapted, should there be new features  in  the

future,  which can be used to good effect to achieve the objects

of  this  Bill.  But there must be safeguards as well.  I  think

that  is the point he has also made.  So whatever new means that

are used should garner convenience but at the same time must  be

balanced  with adequate safeguards.  So we will start  with  the

telephone,  videophone, and perhaps some  time  in  the  future,

maybe Internet can be used.  So this is the purport of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, he talked about safeguards. I think that is a

very  good point.  In fact, this was something we put our  minds

to.   Because even as we have this new approach, new technology,

we  want to ensure that it will not be abused.  For example,  he

mentioned clause 4, the new section 18A, about admitting by, for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



example, telephone.  The safeguard here will be with the  notice

of  consultation that will be received by the respondent,  there

will be a secret pin number which he will then have to use if he

telephones  in to admit the claim.  This will be in addition  to

the  other particulars which are peculiar to him, eg, IC number,

name, and so forth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even for consultation and hearing by these new means, we

are  not jumping straightaway to a situation where you can  have

consultation or hearing from your home.  The idea here  is  that

the  parties  would  be at the Small Claims Tribunals  locality,

either  the  main  locality at Apollo  Centre  or  the  regional

centre.   So even if there is such consultation by these  means,

there  will still be verification of identity of the parties  by

the officials at either the regional centre or the main centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other point that he has mentioned is about the one-month period. He says that if a person is impersonated, he may

not  know  that  he has been impersonated and if  the  one-month

period  runs from the time the order is made, it may be  out  of

time.   First, as I have said, safeguards are in place to ensure

that  there is no impersonation and I am told that this will  be

rare, but, in any case, we should provide for it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the one-month period is not cast in stone.

Because if you look at the words, the Registrar can allow for  a

further period, so that should there be unfairness or injustice,

I   am   sure   the  Registrar  would  exercise  his  discretion

judiciously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I understand that a copy of the order that is made

will  also  be  served  on  the parties,  so  that  if  you  are

impersonated,  your address is still there, your name  is  still

there,  so you still will get a copy of the order made, and  you

know  that  you are impersonated because somebody  has  admitted

your claim.  So this should take care of that point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I think if all else fails, Dr Toh will know that

the  Small  Claims process has improved so much  that  the  time

period  between the time you get the notice and the consultation

and  hearing,  now it is all within one month.  In other  words,

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



one-month period, even if all these other measures that  I  have

mentioned fail, will not prejudice the consumer of which I think

Dr Toh is concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point he mentioned is why not expand the

jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunals.  Let us take this  a

step  at  a time.  I think he will know that last year  we  just

expanded  it.   Currently  it is $10,000  and  $20,000  if  both

parties  consent.  So that is already upping the limit from  the

previous limit of $2,000 and $5,000.  So I think we should  take

this  gradually.  We do not want to lose sight of the objectives

behind the Small Claims Tribunals which is to ensure that  small

claims  which do not require examination of complex legal issues

can  be dealt with quickly by Referees and Registrars.  So  even

in  terms  of  the  type of claims that  can  be  heard  by  the

Tribunals, we are very careful not to expand it too quickly.   I

think we should let this new innovation take off and then we can

assess over time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 1998 seeks to give

legislative effect to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



income  tax  changes  announced in the  1997  Budget  Statement.

Opportunity is also taken to incorporate three other  amendments

to the Income Tax Act.



<br><br><i>Tax changes announced in the 1997 Budget Statement</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall begin with the tax changes announced in the 1997

Budget  Statement.  There are a total of five tax changes  which

require amendment to the Act.  I will start with the tax changes

affecting individual taxpayers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have announced that, with effect from Year of Assessment

1998, there will be an increase in tax reliefs for taxpayers who

maintain  dependants.  For those who stay with aged  parents  in

the  same  household,  parent relief is raised  from  $3,500  to

$4,500.   There is also an increase in tax relief  for  wife  as

well as child relief from $1,500 to $2,000.  In addition, I have

also  relaxed  the income ceiling condition for  eligibility  of

parent  relief,  wife  relief, handicapped siblings  relief  and

child relief.  The respective reliefs will be allowed so long as

the  dependant does not have an income exceeding $2,000 in  that

year, instead of the current level of $1,500.  Clauses 11 and 16

amend the relevant sections of the Act for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also announced that with effect from 1st January

1999,   all  CPF  contributions,  whether  made  voluntary,   or

obligatory under contracts of employment, will no longer be  tax

deductible for both the employee and the employer.  In addition,

the  employer's contribution will be taxable as  income  in  the

hands   of   the   employee.   However,  in   support   of   the

regionalisation programme, the existing tax treatment will still

apply  to  Singaporeans posted overseas who make  voluntary  CPF

contributions.   Clauses 2, 4 and 7 amend the relevant  sections

of the Act for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next two tax changes pertain to existing tax

concessions.   Since  the  Year of Assessment  1992,  banks  are

allowed  to claim tax deduction for general provisions made  for

loans  and  investments in securities.  To  encourage  banks  to

increase their level of general provisions to buffer against any

unexpected losses, I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



raised  the limit on tax deductible general provisions from  two

per  cent to three per cent of qualifying loans and investments.

Clause  8  amends section 14I to provide for this  change  which

will take effect from Year of Assessment 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also announced that the tax holiday granted to the

Singapore Commodity Exchange Limited (SICOM) in 1992,  for  five

years, will be extended for another five years.  Clause 6 amends

section 13(1)(p) for the extension of this tax holiday.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, to encourage the setting up of reputable credit

rating  agencies in Singapore, I have announced a  concessionary

tax  of  10  per  cent on income derived from  providing  credit

rating  services  with respect to the issue of foreign  currency

denominated securities in Singapore.  Clause 14 introduces a new

section  43M for this incentive which will take effect from  the

Year of Assessment 1998.



<br><br><i>Tax Changes not announced in the 1997 Budget Statement</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now deal with the three tax changes that were not

announced in the 1997 Budget Statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first tax change pertains to the computation of gains

derived  from the exercise of share options.  The gains  derived

by  an  employee from the exercise of share options issued under

the  Employee Share Options Scheme are taxable.  At present, the

valuation  rule  used  to determine the  taxable  gains  is  the

difference between (a) the price of the share in the open market

at  the  time of the exercise of the option; and (b) the  amount

the employee had paid for such shares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is usually an interval between the exercise

date  and  the  date  on  which the shares  subscribed  for  are

approved  by and listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore.   As

the  shares are only tradable when it is listed, clause 3 amends

section  10(5)  to  provide  that the  taxable  gains  shall  be

computed as the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



difference between the price of the shares when it is listed and

the amount paid for the shares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second tax change deals with the treatment of capital

allowances  and losses from the leasing of machinery and  plant.

Currently, the Act provides that if a lessor carries out finance

lease activities, he can only set off the capital allowances  of

a  finance  lease  asset  against his income  derived  from  the

finance  leasing.  This is to prevent finance leasing activities

from  being  used as a tax shelter.  As a result of the  current

wording  of  the  Act, the unabsorbed capital  allowances  of  a

finance  lease  asset will be forfeited when the  finance  lease

business ceased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the current tax treatment is unduly restrictive, I have

decided  to  amend  the  Act to allow  such  unabsorbed  capital

allowances to be set off against any other income of the  lessor

when  there  is  a  permanent cessation  of  his  finance  lease

business.  As a consequence of this change, and since a  leasing

company  can  carry  out both onshore and  offshore  finance  or

operating  lease  activities, the amendments also  set  out  the

manner  of  setting off capital allowances and losses  for  such

leasing  companies.  These changes to the treatment  of  capital

allowances  and losses from the leasing of machinery  and  plant

are provided for under clauses 5 and 13 which amend sections 10D

and 43I respectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the last amendment concerns the claiming of

capital   allowances   for  motor  cars  registered   and   used

exclusively outside Singapore.  At present, owners of a  Q-plate

car  are  allowed  to claim capital allowances for  their  cars.

Similar  tax  treatment is also applicable  to  cars  registered

outside  Singapore and used exclusively outside  Singapore.   An

example  of the latter would be cars used by an overseas  branch

of  a  Singapore company.  However, while owners of Q-plate cars

are  given  balancing allowances upon the disposal of the  cars,

owners  of the above mentioned foreign cars are not entitled  to

any  balancing allowance.  To rectify this inconsistency, clause

9  amends section 20(5A) to allow balancing allowances upon  the

disposal of such foreign cars.

<div align="center"><b>INTERPRETATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Interpretation Act (Chapter 1

of the 1997 Revised Edition) to provide criteria for determining

when  death occurs, and to make consequential amendments to  the

Human  Organ  Transplant Act (Chapter 131A of the  1988  Revised

Edition)  and the Medical (Therapy, Education and Research)  Act

(Chapter 175 of the 1985 Revised Edition).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, traditionally, death is considered to have taken place

when  a  person's  heart beat and respiration  cease.   This  is

termed  by the medical profession as "cardiac death".   However,

this  concept  of death can no longer be applied in  every  case

nowadays   because   of  advances  in  medical   treatment   and

technology.   In  particular, resuscitative and life  supportive

technology has enabled a patient's heart beat and respiration to

be  maintained indefinitely, even when there is not the remotest

possibility of the patient's brain ever functioning again.   The

result is a warm corpse with a beating heart.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last two to three decades, "brain death" has been

accepted  by the medical fraternity worldwide as a more  precise

determinant  of death.  The common law has accepted the  concept

of  brain death.  There is, however, no certainty in the  common

law  on the criteria and tests to be applied before brain  death

can  be  certified.  Therefore, when the Human Organ  Transplant

Act  (HOTA) was enacted in 1987, death was defined according  to

the brain death criteria in the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HOTA is currently the only legislation in Singapore which

contains  a definition of death.  HOTA, however, has  a  limited

scope  of  application.   It  is only applicable  to  non-Muslim

Singaporeans, 21 to 60 years old, who had not objected to kidney

donation  and  who died as a result of an accident.   The  brain

death criteria as defined in HOTA have been applied for the past

10  years in Singapore and have gained public acceptance.  It is

therefore  timely to legislate a definition of the criterion  of

death  that  would  be  applicable for  all  deaths.   The  main

objective of this Bill is to provide a legal definition of death

that  would  allow  doctors  to use  either  the  cardiac  death

criteria or brain death criteria to determine when death  occurs

under any circumstances.  This would allow for the determination

of death to be made in a consistent fashion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me briefly explain why there is a need to define

precisely  the  time  of death.  Firstly, techniques  have  been

developed   for   the  prolonged  maintenance  of   circulation,

ventilation,  alimentation, and excretion of the human  body  by

artificial  means.   This  makes  possible  the  creation  of  a

situation  in  which  the bodily functions continue  to  operate

while  the  brain  is dead, and the person is for  all  purposes

"dead".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the increasing use of organs, such as kidney,

liver  and heart, for transplantation, requires an accurate  and

timely  determination of when the donor has  died  so  that  the

organs  may be removed.  In addition, numerous other  legal  and

social  considerations require a precise and  definite  decision

that death has occurred.  For example, the family of a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



brain  dead  person  can  be  spared  unnecessary  anguish   and

financial  burden if brain death is determined and  the  patient

certified as legally dead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall now highlight the major new

provisions that are being introduced in this Bill.



<br><br><i>Criteria for Determining Death</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide for the criteria for determining death for all

purposes, clause 2 inserts a new section 2A which states that  a

person has died when there has occurred either:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) irreversible cessation of circulation of blood and

respiration  in  the body of a person (referred  hereinafter  as

"cardiac death"); or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) total and irreversible cessation of all functions of

the brain of a person (referred hereinafter as "brain death").

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In about 95% of all cases, cardiac death precedes brain

death and can be readily diagnosed without elaborate tests.   As

this  is the simple means of certifying death, there is no  need

for  a set of criteria to be prescribed by law.  Only one doctor

is  necessary to certify cardiac death except where an organ  is

to be removed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The determination of brain death on the other hand will be

in  accordance with the clinical criteria as prescribed  in  the

regulations  under the new section 2A.  These criteria  for  the

determination of brain death will be the same as those currently

prescribed  in  the  HOTA Regulations.   These  criteria  are  a

refinement  of  the  diagnostic criteria for establishing  death

which  were  unanimously  adopted  by  the  Royal  Colleges  and

Faculties of the United Kingdom in 1976.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the many criteria required for determining brain

death and to ensure absolute certainty, all cases of brain death

have  to  be  certified in the prescribed form  by  two  medical

practitioners   who  possess  prescribed  postgraduate   medical

qualifications.  Also, one of the two certifying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



doctors must not have been involved in the care or treatment  of

the person certified to be brain dead.



<br><br><i>Additional Provisions in an Organ Donation Situation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are additional provisions in the Interpretation Act

where death is to be certified in a potential organ donor.  This

is  to  assure  the  family  and the community  that  there  are

adequate  safeguards to prevent untimely removal of the  donor's

organ.   For  deaths which result in the removal of  organs  for

transplant  purposes, two medical practitioners are required  to

certify  the  death  in  a prescribed  form.   The  two  doctors

certifying cardiac or brain death should not have been  involved

in  the  care of the donor and in the selection of the  proposed

recipient.   They should also not participate in the  harvesting

and  transplant  operations  and after-care  of  the  recipient.

These requirements have been included to ensure independence  of

the determination of death and to guard against any conflict  of

interests.



<br><br><i>Circumstances where Certification of Death would not be Possible</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain circumstances where it may not be

possible  to  produce  the corpse as physical  evidence  that  a

person has died.  One example would be if a ship were to sink in

such  a  manner as to make recovery of the bodies of the trapped

crew  not  possible.   These  special  circumstances  have  been

addressed under existing laws.  In order to avoid doubt,  it  is

made  clear  that  the  new  section 2A  shall  not  affect  the

operation of section 110 of the Evidence Act which addresses the

burden of proving that a person is alive who has not been  heard

of for seven years.  It shall also not affect section 100 of the

Women's  Charter which addresses proceedings for decree nisi  on

presumption  of  death  and divorce or  any  other  written  law

relating to the presumption of death.  It will also not  prevent

the  certification or determination of death in a case where the

body of a person is not found or recovered.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Consequential Amendments</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by having a definition of death for all purposes

incorporated  in the Interpretation Act, it will  no  longer  be

necessary  to define death in any other legislation.   The  Bill

proposes  that the relevant section and subsection in HOTA  will

be  repealed and deleted respectively.  A minor change  will  be

made  to the Medical Therapy Act to ensure consistency with  the

Interpretation Act where determination of death is concerned.



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, doctors have been certifying death since time

immemorial.  The traditional common law definition of  death  is

the  cessation  of  circulatory  and  respiratory  functions  or

cardiac  death.   We  have had a decade of experience  with  the

brain  death definition since HOTA was implemented.  The concept

of  brain death has gained general public acceptance.  We should

no  longer  limit  the  use of the brain  death  criteria  as  a

definition  of death just to organ donors under HOTA.   The  law

must  allow  the doctors to certify death when a person's  brain

has ceased functioning totally and irreversibly, even though the

heart  is  kept  beating through artificial  means.   This  will

redress an anomalous situation created by medical science.  When

the  Bill  is  passed  it  would allow for  either  brain  death

criteria or cardiac death criteria to be applied for all  deaths

including organ donors under HOTA and the Medical Therapy Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, death is mentioned more than 1,200 times in the

Singapore statutes, and yet it is only defined in HOTA.  What is

being  proposed  in  this Bill is not a new way  of  determining

death,  but  a legislative definition of death for all  purposes

which   formalises  what  is  the  currently  accepted   medical

practice.   Even so, I propose to refer this Bill  to  a  Select

Committee to ensure that an opportunity be given for members  of

the public to express their views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Bill be committed to a Select Committee consisting

of  Mr Speaker as Chairman and seven Members to be nominated  by

the Committee of Selection. - [Mr Yeo Cheow Tong].

<div align="center"><b>PLANNING BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br>2.15 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is to replace the existing Planning Act which has

essentially  the  same  provisions  as  those  of  the  Planning

Ordinance  of 1959.  Various amendments have been  made  to  the

existing  Act  over the years to reflect administrative  changes

and  to  meet prevailing circumstances.   However, after such  a

long  time, significant changes in the Planning Process and  the

present  state  of  the physical development of  Singapore  have

necessitated an updating of the Act.  I shall now go through and

explain the rationale for the main changes.



<br><br><i>Definition of "Master Plan"</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the term "Master Plan" in the existing Act has two

different  definitions.  Each definition has a different  usage.

This has caused confusion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first definition, retained in clause 6 of the Bill,

means  the  original  Master  Plan  approved  in  1958  and  all

subsequent approved amendments to the Plan.  This "Master  Plan"

refers to the approved development or planning intention  for  a

site  and  is  used  to evaluate whether a proposed  development

could be allowed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second definition, in section 32(4) of the existing

Act, refers to the paid-up development rights of a site for  the

purpose of determining development charge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To distinguish the two clearly, we now propose to replace

the  second definition of the term "Master Plan" with a new term

"Development Baseline" in clause 36 of the Bill to describe  the

base value more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>



accurately.   This is only a change in nomenclature  which  does

not result in any change in substance or in practice.



<br><br><i>Development Ceiling</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a developer submits a proposal for the development of

a  site,  there will be a value associated with it depending  on

factors  like  the  usage and intensity.  There  is  a  need  to

introduce a new term "Development Ceiling" to reflect this value

for development charge purposes.  The development charge payable

will then be the difference between the Development Ceiling  and

the  Development  Baseline  for  a  site.   Again,  this  is   a

definitional change which does not result in any change  to  the

present basis of determining development charge.



<br><br><i>Deviations from the Master Plan</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now move on to the provisions of the Master Plan.

The  competent  authority  in  determining  an  application  for

written  permission  is required to act in conformity  with  the

Master  Plan.  However, occasionally, the zoning of an  area  in

the  Master Plan may become obsolete due to changes in  planning

intentions.   The Development Guide Plans (DGPs),  for  example,

may  have proposed new ideas which are different from the Master

Plan.   Similarly,  some  sites  may  be  affected  by  on-going

planning   reviews  of  the  whole  locality  or  transportation

studies.   Other  sites may be required to be  used  for  public

purposes,    like   the   provision   of   infrastructural    or

transportation facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is thus now made in clause 14 to allow the

competent  authority the flexibility to deviate from the  Master

Plan when dealing with applications for written permission,  but

only  in  very  limited circumstances such  as  those  mentioned

earlier, and with the prior approval of the Minister.  This will

ensure  that  confidence  of the Master  Plan  as  a  guide  for

development is maintained.



<br><br><i>Payment of Development Charge</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill allows the competent authority to introduce a two-stage procedure for the payment of development charge. At



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



present,  the  exact  amount of development  charge  has  to  be

determined  and paid up before planning permission is  released.

As  much  time  is needed to check the detailed calculations  to

determine the actual amount of development charge payable,  this

has sometimes caused delays in the issue of planning permission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea is therefore now to allow an estimated amount of

development  charge  to be collected first  through  an  interim

order,  so  that  planning or conservation permission  could  be

released  early.   A  final  order  for  the  actual  amount  of

development  charge  could subsequently be collected  within  12

months  of the grant of the planning or conservation permission.

This is provided for in clause 38 of the Bill.



<br><br><i>Vesting of land for public purpose</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry would like to take the

opportunity of this Bill to formalise an established practice of

the competent authority on the vesting of land to be used for  a

public  purpose.   Where  necessary, a condition  requiring  the

vesting  of  part  of the land to the State for public  purposes

like road widening or drainage reserves is currently imposed  in

the planning permission.  This is now explicitly provided for in

clause 15(1)(f) of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the House that the owner of the land

does  not  suffer  any  loss as he is allowed  to  transfer  the

development rights of the land vested to the remaining  part  of

his land, subject to the planning requirements of the site.  The

condition  to  vest land to the State will only  be  limited  to

requirements of public purposes.



<br><br><i>Provision of Links and Connections to Adjacent Developments and Public Facilities</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another public facility requirement is the provision of

links  and connections to adjacent developments or MRT stations.

These   are   usually  secured  as  and  when   development   or

redevelopment takes place.  The competent authority  has,  as  a

matter  of  established practice, been requiring  developers  to

provide these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



links  and  connections to create a network  of  pedestrian  and

vehicular  links  within  the city.   Besides  formalising  this

practice,  clause  15(1)(h) enables the competent  authority  to

require  a  developer to maintain and keep open these facilities

to  allow  free access by the public as a condition of  planning

permission.   It also makes clear that such conditions  will  be

imposed only for the provision of such connections to facilitate

public access and movement.



<br><br><i>Enforcement Powers</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now go through the amendments relating to

enforcement.   The  current  Planning  Act  does   not   provide

sufficient powers for the competent authority to carry  out  its

enforcement  work effectively and efficiently.  The  fines  have

not  been  updated  and  are grossly  inadequate.   It  is  thus

necessary to enhance the enforcement provisions and penalties in

the Bill.  I shall now elaborate on the main changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The competent authority's investigation into a complaint is

often  hampered  by  a lack of information, either  because  the

owner or occupier cannot be found, or the premises are locked at

the time of inspection.  To improve efficiency and enable faster

response  to  complaints, my Ministry has agreed  to  allow  the

competent  authority  to serve an "information  notice"  on  the

owner  or occupier of the land.  This will compel him to furnish

information on the activities to facilitate investigation and to

stop  breaches  of planning control.  This is  provided  for  in

clause  25  of the Bill.  There are penalties for not  complying

with the information notice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;URA enforcement officers are sometimes required to carry

out  their investigation beyond the normal working hours.   This

is  because  illegal activities are not always conducted  during

normal  working hours.  Clause 27 allows the competent authority

to  enter  the land or building for inspection at any reasonable

time, instead of only in the day time as provided in the current

Act.   It  also allows the authority to require the occupier  of

the land to furnish his identity to enable the authority to

identify  the  person  responsible for the  breach  of  planning

control.  This provision will enable the competent authority  to

act upon complaints expeditiously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 28, 29 and 30 of the Bill deal with enforcement

notices and appeals against enforcement notices.  Often, URA had

been  asked to enforce against illegal activities which  disturb

the  neighbourhood.  The complainants have often expressed their

dissatisfaction with the long period taken by URA  to  stop  the

nuisance  activities.  The proposal therefore is to  reduce  the

minimum period for the enforcement notice to take effect from 28

days to 14 days.  This should bring about more timely action  to

stop  such  illegal activities.  This is provided for in  clause

28.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An appeal can be made to the Minister against an

enforcement notice, during which time the enforcement notice  is

suspended.  From experience, some of the appeals have been  over

technical  inaccuracies in the enforcement  notice.   When  such

appeals are allowed, a fresh enforcement notice has to be served

all  over  again.   Much time and effort are  wasted  while  the

illegal   activities   persist,  to   the   annoyance   of   the

complainants.   In  order not to delay the enforcement  process,

provision  is  now made in clause 29 to allow  the  Minister  to

correct   any  error  in  the  enforcement  notice,   vary   its

requirements, or allow for more time for compliance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure due compliance with the enforcement notice by the

end  of such extended time, provision is also made in clause  29

to  allow the Minister to require security to be furnished as  a

condition  for allowing the extension of time.  This can  be  in

the form of a banker's guarantee, which will be forfeited if the

illegal  activities  still persist at the end  of  the  extended

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 30 provides for enhanced penalties for non-compliance with enforcement notices. The current maximum fine

is $3,000.  However, in many cases, the fines range from $600 to

$2,000.   These  are  insufficient  to  deter  an  offender,  as

planning  offences  could result in very  substantial  financial

gains to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



offenders.   Even after conviction, some recalcitrant  offenders

refuse to comply with the enforcement notice and are willing  to

pay the daily fine that, in most cases, ranges from $10 to $50 a

day.  My Ministry thus finds it necessary to increase the  fines

to  a  maximum of $200,000 or an imprisonment of up to 12 months

or  both  under clause 30.  The fine for continuing offences  is

also  to  be increased from $100 per day to a maximum of $10,000

per day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, the competent authority is required to take

speedy  enforcement  action in urgent  cases  to  avoid  further

damage  caused by unauthorised uses and activities on the  land.

Examples are illegal excavation or dumping of earth.  Clause  33

allows  the  competent authority to apply for a court injunction

to  quickly  restrain an actual or impending breach of  planning

control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were occasions when URA had to consider the

regularisation   of   unauthorised   building   extensions.   To

discourage  developers or architects from trying their  luck  by

carrying  out  works without prior permission of  the  competent

authority,  clause  34 provides for a new penalty  which  cannot

exceed  either 50 times the prescribed application fees for  the

relevant permission or $150,000, whichever is lower.



<br><br><i>Other changes</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two other changes to the existing Act which

I  would  like  to mention.  There have been feedback  that  the

current requirement of having to obtain subdivision approval for

any  lease of more than seven years of any part of a development

has  inhibited business operations.  The Ministry of Law and  my

Ministry  have  reviewed this and have agreed  to  exempt  lease

periods  of  up  to  14  years  for  certain  developments  from

subdivision  approval.    This  change  will  give   owners   of

buildings  the  flexibility  to grant  longer  leases  of  their

development  without  having  to  subdivide  their  development.

Clause 4(2) allows for this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another change relates to the existing requirement for two

separate permissions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



to  be  obtained for the restoration of conservation  buildings;

one  for  the development works and one for the minor decorative

works.   To simplify the process and improve efficiency,  clause

12  of the Bill requires only one "conservation permission"  for

all  works  within  a  conservation area, including  development

works.   For  developments  outside  a  conservation  area,  the

permission required will be called "planning permission".



<br><br><i>Related Amendments to the Residential Property Act</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 64 relates to the proposed section 28A of the

Residential Property Act.  It requires a foreign person who owns

vacant land originally zoned non-residential in the Master  Plan

but  which  was  subsequently  rezoned  to  residential  at  the

initiative  of  the  competent authority  to  first  obtain  the

approval  of  the  Minister  for  Law  before  he  applies   for

permission  to  develop  that land for  a  residential  purpose.

This  is  intended to prevent the foreign owner from  by-passing

the  normal controls imposed under the Residential Property  Act

for foreign ownership of residential property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, due to the different nomenclature used for

computing development charges, a consequential amendment is also

made  to the Land Acquisition Act.  Compensation under that  Act

will  be determined with regard to the Development Baseline  and

not the Master Plan which in future will be the document showing

future planning intention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the Bill will simplify and clarify the various

provisions in the existing Planning Act as well as to  make  the

new  Act  more structured and comprehensible.   Other  than  the

provisions to enhance the enforcement  power, the other parts do

not  result in changes to current practices.  Rather, they  make

the provisions and the powers clearer and more explicit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

ever  since  late  1822 when Stamford Raffles  formed  the  Town

Committee to prepare a plan for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>



Singapore, we have had planning law.  Of course, then, the  plan

was  exceedingly simple. There were separate ethnic  enclaves  - European,  Chinese,  Indian,  Arab  and  Malay.   Singapore  has

undergone  great  changes over the course of  the  century.  The

Planning  Bill  is  timely as Singapore prepares  for  the  next

century   with  regional  centres,  cultural  and  entertainment

centres  and international investment hubs.  At the  same  time,

there is the aim of preserving our Asian identity and conserving

our  heritage.   There is no doubt, therefore,  that  we  should

support  a  new  Planning  Act to allow  the  Minister  and  the

relevant  authorities to fulfil the task of making  Singapore  a

world-class city with Asian qualities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Critical to this exercise is the Master Plan which,

according  to  the Bill, will be reviewed every five  years  and

where  such  a  review  may include re-zoning,  change  of  plot

ratios, designation of conservation areas.  My concern is mainly

in  the  introduction of the new provision  in  clause  14  that

allows  the competent authority to deviate from the Master  Plan

in  certain circumstances.  While I agree that such a  provision

may be necessary to provide flexibility and adaptability, it may

also  result  in  uncertainty  and,  indeed,  monetary  loss  in

situations  where  persons may have acted  in  reliance  on  the

Master Plan only to find that the matter is under review and re-zoned.   If,  for example, land is re-zoned from  industrial  to

residential  use, the occupier or owner may find  that  he  will

need  to incur additional cost in developing it to its new  use.

A  foreign  investor may find, for example, that land originally

acquired  or  bought  for  industrial  use  may  be  changed  to

residential  use  and  he  may  have  to  apply  for  additional

conditions  to be imposed on him because it is residential  land

and  is  subject to the requirements of the Residential Property

Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, commercial transactions require certainty. Clause 14

provides for situations where there may be uncertainty.  Perhaps

the  Minister  can provide some clarification as  to  how  these

uncertainties will be minimised through procedures that  provide

advance notice of any review or study that is being conducted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also particularly struck by the width of one sub-clause, clause 14(2)(C), where the competent authority need not

follow  the Master Plan simply because the relevant land or  its

locality is being reviewed by the same authority.  This can be a

catch-all phrase that really makes the other sub-clauses, in  my

view,  redundant.  I hope that the Minister can assure the House

that  the  new  powers to deviate from the Master Plan  will  be

carefully considered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I support the

Bill.  However, there are some clauses of the Bill which I would

like the Minister to reconsider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, clause 33, Sir. As the Bill stands now, only

the  High  Court can grant an injunction.  The Minister  may  be

aware  that now the District Court is granting injunction and  I

see  no  reason  why we should burden the High Court,  which  is

already burdened with other cases, with this provision.  We  all

know  that it is cheaper and easier to make application  in  the

District  Court.  I can understand that when the  provision  was

first  enacted,  there was a limitation  in  the  power  of  the

District  Court.  But we have moved a great deal.  In fact,  now

the  District Court can  grant an injunction.  I would urge  the

Minister to reconsider the position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clause that I am concerned about also involves

the  power of the court as well.  Under clause 48, the  District

Court's  power is only when the sum does not exceed  $1,000.   I

checked  in the library yesterday and found that it was  a  very

old  provision when the power of the District Court was  limited

to  $1,000.   As of today, it is $250,000.  Would  the  Minister

reconsider this position?  Otherwise, the public would be put to

great  expense  in  going to the High Court  and  lawyers  would

charge  higher fees.  It is time-consuming and I think the  High

Court's time would also be wasted.  It is more expensive to have

High  Court judges than District Court judges.  So I would  urge

the  Minister to reconsider this position.  He has increased the

fines which, I agree with him, should have been increased.   But

he  has not increased the jurisdiction in other clauses.   So  I

would urge him to reconsider this position, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the other provisions, but I have only two

observations.   On  conservation, we are all aware  how  it  has

worked  and enhanced the physical beauty of Singapore.  We  have

various  places like Tanjong Pagar where we have  a  mixture  of

residential and commercial buildings.  I have one request to ask

of the Minister.  Would he consider in certain cases a shophouse

which  has got two usages: one shopping unit downstairs and  you

have  a  residential office upstairs.  Would he be  prepared  to

allow sub-divisions so that the owner, if necessary, could  sell

the  property  or sub-lease for, say, 30 or 60 years?   I  think

this would help in the already depressed property market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to urge the Minister to get his officials

to  try  to  conserve as many properties as possible.  Otherwise

some  of  the  properties  would be  lost  forever.   We  should

conserve  some  schools, some hospitals  and  even  some  police

stations.   I think we should not repeat the mistake of  earlier

times where a lot of properties were pulled down.   Later on, we

could  decide if we really require this property or not.  But  I

would  urge the Minister to consider this and ask his  officials

to act fast on this matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we can pride ourselves as a people who have

maintained  our conserved properties well and we  should  ensure

that these properties are well preserved in such a way that they

would help to beautify Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I rise

to  support  this Bill that is placed before the House.   In  my

view,  the  amendments are both timely and  appropriate.  Timely

because,  for  example,  the Bill has  taken  into  account  new

technologies such as electronic filing.  It is also timely  that

the  Bill  now  provides the statutory basis  for  many  of  the

existing  policies  and  practices.  It  appears  to  be  better

organised and shows greater clarity in its provisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are also more explicit explanations on the

development,  sub-division,  grant  of  provisional  permission,

detailed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>



planning  permission  and  new definition  on  the  concepts  of

Development  Baseline and Development Ceiling in the computation

of  development  charge.   These, I believe,  will  provide  for

greater  clarity and certainty for professionals and  developers

alike.   It  is  also  appropriate,  Sir,  that  the  Bill   now

eliminates  many  of  the functions mentioned  in  the  colonial

administration  which have long gone out of use.   I  compliment

the  Minister for the use of the language in the Bill  which  is

more  modern  and suited to present day use and more  structured

for  easy  reference.   I support the increase  in  the  maximum

penalties  for unauthorised subdivision, developments and  other

works  from $3,000 to $200,000 as it is in keeping with  present

day cost and will have a more deterrent impact and effectiveness

in  view  of  the  higher cost of development. Furthermore,  the

breaches of such planning controls must be made punitive in view

of the potential impact to public health and safety.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the extension from seven to 14 years for the

exemption  from  requiring subdivision approval for  residential

and non-residential leases.  This, I believe, is consistent with

existing  practice of having longer leases for  better  business

planning and in view of higher renovation cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conditional permission spelt out in clause 15 includes

provision  for  the  competent authority to  require  connecting

structures to be provided and maintained.  This, I believe, will

have  an  impact  on improving accessibility  to  buildings  and

increasing  traffic  flow  which will  certainly  be  a  welcome

addition  to  property developers and the public.   However,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I would like to seek assurance and clarification

from  the  Minister on a number of provisions  in  the  Planning

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 5, the competent authority is conferred with

the  functions instead of powers, as stated in the previous Act,

to  carry out the provisions of this Bill.  I would like to  ask

the Minister what this implies and what effect it would have  on

the development planning process.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 14, in considering an application for written

permission,  the competent authority must take into account  the

provisions of the Master Plan. However, as stated earlier, while

this gives certainty to applicants, subclause (2)(e) allows  the

competent authority to disregard the Master Plan if he deems the

development  in  the  application to  be  incongruent  with  the

adjoining  development. Sir, in my view, this  is  too  broad  a

provision  since the applicant may have submitted his  plans  in

good  faith  on  the latest Master Plan.  I seek the  Minister's

assurance on this matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 22(7), 29(4) and 39(7) state that there shall be

no   judiciary  review  of  the  Minister's  decision.  This  is

consistent  with  the existing practice, but I  am  seeking  the

Minister's  assurance that in protecting private  interest,  the

rationale,  reasons  and basis for this decision  must  be  made

available to applicants, especially in view of the fact that the

decision  of the Minister cannot be challenged or questioned  in

any court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 37(2) imposes a liability of paying development

charges  on the property owner even if he has sold the  land  to

another party.  I seek the Minister's clarification on the legal

implication  of this matter and ask whether he would  reconsider

the  provision  to make the current land owner  responsible  for

paying  development charge.  I am also appealing to the Minister

to  retain  the  current practice of allowing the applicant  the

choice  of  opting  for  the  valuation  method  of  determining

development  charges.   The alternative  method  of  development

charges  should  not be limited to the unknown term  "prescribed

sum".   For  example,  it may occur that due  to  administrative

limitation and time lag, the development charge table may be out

of line with the prevailing market conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, Sir, I find the amendments timely and

appropriate.  I support the changes proposed but hope  that  the

Minister will give due consideration and clarification  and  the

assurances sought.

<div align="center"><b>PLANNING BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

on  an  island republic such as Singapore where land is  scarce,

the  law  of  economics dictates that real  estate  bears  great

value.  It is a well-known fact that real estate accounts for  a

major  portion  of  assets  in  many  companies  and  for   many

individuals as well.  Hence, an Act as important as the Planning

Act  carries with it the power to effect changes that will  have

strong   and   far-reaching  implications  on  the  population's

distribution of wealth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1998 Planning Bill effectively sums up the Planning Act

of  1990 with some revisions.  With due regard, the current  Act

and the subsequent amendments have served our nation well in all

aspects.  The steady transformation of Singapore's skyline  over

the years, I believe, is only one of the positive results of the

sound  master  planning  by the competent  authority.   By  this

virtue,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I support this  Bill  in  principle.

However,  there  are several areas which I feel deserve  further

study.   In putting forward these points, I hope to map out  the

concerns  that  this  Bill would have on  the  parties  directly

involved in the real estate industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to comment on clause 15(1)(f). The

condition  for  granting approval gives the competent  authority

enormous  power to take any amount of land out of a  development

at  no cost.  It would definitely be more persuasive, and appear

more  reasonable, if it is stated more specifically in the  Bill

that  the  acquired  land is to be used  for  such  purposes  as

substations,  road widening, open space for landed estates,  and

so on.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



For  the  acquisition of any land for public scheme or  purposes

not  related to development, the Land Acquisition Act should  be

used, instead of this one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on clause 15(1)(g). This

clause, which is already in existence in the current Act, states

that  not less than 30% of the floor area of any development  on

the  land  shall  remain in the ownership of one  person  for  a

period  of 10 years.  At this point, I would like to declare  my

interest as the Deputy Chairman of the Property Committee of the

Chinese  Chamber  of  Commerce and Industry which  is  currently

carrying out a joint development of an office building downtown.

Land in Singapore is getting scarce.  In order to achieve better

development  potential, owners of different plots of  land  have

the  tendency to amalgamate and develop their land collectively.

If  a new company is formed to undertake this joint development,

then no technical difficulties will arise from the imposition of

the 30% condition.  However, there are cases in which the owners

prefer  to  hold  the  amalgamated  land  as  tenants-in-common,

instead  of  forming  a  company.   Upon  completion  of   joint

development,  subdivision would take place and titles  would  be

issued  to  the  various  owners as  tenants-in-common.   By  an

instrument of partition, each owner would then receive his space

entitlement  proportionate  to his original  land  contribution,

save  and  except that 30% of the floor area of the  development

shall  remain  in  the names of the owners as tenants-in-common.

Under  this arrangement, many inconveniences will arise  because

consent  must  then  be  sought among all tenants-in-common  for

matters  such  as  mortgage and sale, and  this  is  not  easily

achieved.   Hence,  I  would like to call  on  the  Minister  to

consider  modifying the condition to encourage joint development

of small plots of land so as to allow larger scale comprehensive

development of higher quality.  I am convinced that solutions to

this are readily available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I would like to bring up is on clause

18(2).   The Bill maintains that the competent authority  is  to

grant outline



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



permission only after having considered matters relating to  the

land  use,  intensity,  type, form and height  of  the  proposed

development.  What I would like to highlight is the word "form".

Essentially, the competent authority has the subjective power to

decide  whether  he  likes the design put up by  the  architect.

Would   it  not  be  better  that  the  design  aspect  of   the

development,  such  as form, be left in the good  hands  of  the

design  architects?  In a free market economy, I doubt that  the

developer  or  design architects would be likely  to  put  up  a

design which is not economically attractive.  By not restricting

the  form, we can then make headway in encouraging our designers

to be more creative and innovative.  I believe this is something

most  of us would like to look forward to in the future  of  our

nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having made all these comments, Sir, I want to state the

fact  that  the  Planning Bill 1998 has managed to  capture  the

spirit  of  the previous Planning Act.  To enhance its  intended

purposes,  this new Bill contains several additional  provisions

which  I believe would be welcomed by the members of the public.

For  example,  the  Bill now allows the competent  authority  to

grant  subdivision  permission at the  same  time  while  it  is

granting  planning or conservation permission.  This saves  time

and energy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15(1)(h) gives the competent authority the powers to

require  the  developers to design and construct buildings  with

better  links  between them.  This requirement  would  not  only

increase public convenience but also allow for a better flow  of

pedestrian  traffic.  All these make good planning sense  and  I

have  no  doubt  that  the nation would  benefit  from  such  an

integrated approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have not had very much

time  to  go through this Bill and to see what the changes  are,

all  the  changes  to the previous Act.  But  listening  to  the

Minister,  one of the major changes to this Act would appear  to

be  the  enhancement  of powers that are  to  be  given  to  the

enforcement officers and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



enhancement of punishments provided under the Act.  We were told

that the fine is being increased from $6,000 to $200,000.  It is

a  great  jump.  The  punishment would  appear  to  be  enhanced

greatly.   May  I plead, even if it be the lone  voice,  of  yet

another  instance, and this is increasingly the case, of denying

the  citizen  any review by an independent body of  any  of  the

powers that are exercised by Government officers in the carrying

out of their duties under the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I see that by clause 28(9) there shall be

no  questioning of the validity of any enforcement notice except

by  way of an appeal to the Minister.  The courts are not to  be

appealed to by anyone aggrieved by an enforcement notice.   When

one  looks  at clause 29, one finds the provision  which,  as  I

said,  seems to have become the standard practice in  Singapore.

In  every  Act, one finds the decision of the Minister shall  be

final.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the powers, as I have said, have been

enhanced and they are, in some cases, very drastic powers.   One

Member  has  drawn  attention to clause 15 where  the  competent

authority  may  alienate any part of  the  land.   It  shall  be

transferred  free from encumbrances to the State or  any  public

authority,  as  he rightly pointed out.  That  is  a  very  wide

power.  Should that not be restricted and should there not be an

appeal if that power is abused for some reason or other?  Not an

appeal to the Minister but an appeal to an independent body.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, should there not be some recourse for the person

who is aggrieved by the refusal to grant planning permission  or

by  the  issue  of any enforcement notice to seek  a  review  by

somebody other than the Executive, and the Minister of course is

part  of  the  Executive,  the  civil  servant  acts  under  the

authority  of the Minister.  Why is it not possible  for  us  to

consider  the setting up of an independent tribunal to entertain

any appeals in such vital matters as this is where the citizen's

interest   may   be   affected  quite  drastically   and   quite

extensively?  That would at least give the citizen  the  feeling

that his grievances will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



considered by an independent body who would listen carefully  to

his grievances and then decide them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it now stands, and I know from what is the usual

procedure  in  appeals  to the Ministers,  the  citizen  or  the

aggrieved person is not allowed any hearing before the Minister.

He  perhaps  can make a written representation.  I do  not  know

whether  that  is allowed or whether all his objections  to  the

competent  authority are just put before the Minister  who  then

decides  whether the competent authority was right or  not.   It

would  give  the citizen a greater sense of fairness or  feeling

that  his  complaints  will  be  considered  fairly  and  by  an

independent  body.  There is much to be said for not entrenching

the  Executive  with all the powers and making  them  the  final

judges  of  whether  they are right or  wrong.   That  decision,

whether  they  are  right  or  wrong,  should  be  left  to   an

independent  tribunal.  I can see an argument  that  the  courts

should not be burdened with this.  But what is the objection  to

setting  up  a  tribunal?  This has happened in other  countries

where  there  is a planning tribunal which hears representations

from  people  who  are  affected by any  order  made  under  the

Planning  Act.   Why can Singapore not follow that  so  that  we

introduce a little bit of democracy into the functioning of  the

Government in Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Let me thank Members for speaking up in

support  of  the Bill.  I think there are three key issues  that

have  been  addressed.   I would like to take  these  three  key

issues.   One, how to strike a balance between having  a  Master

Plan  that we follow religiously versus the flexibility to amend

the  Master  Plan.  The second key issue is how do we  have  the

powers to vest land without it being abused.  Third, how to have

a  review  of  the Minister's decision, again to prevent  abuse.

And then I will take the other issues raised by various Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue is the importance of the Master Plan to

guide  long-term development of Singapore and to have  certainty

in  that Master Plan so that everybody can make their individual

decisions through that Plan.  At the same time, we know that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  is very small and we have to respond to many  changes

and we need some flexibility in that Plan.  What we have arrived

at  after  many  years  of practice is to  have  a  Master  Plan

comprising  now of 55 Development Guide Plans.  We set  out  the

planning intentions of the different areas in Singapore.  Before

this  Development Guide Plan is gazetted, the draft Plan is  put

out to the public for comment and if anybody is aggrieved by the

proposals,  they can write in and they can object to  the  Plan.

The  Planning authority and the Ministry of National Development

will then look at each and every one of these objections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we are reviewing these plans every five

years but in between these five years, events may change and  we

may  need  to make amendments to these plans.  For example,  the

proposed development of the Light Rail Transport will require  a

complete change of the planning intentions in that area.  So  we

need  to  strike this balance between certainty of the Plan  and

the  flexibility to change.  So what we have provided for in the

Bill  is to set out the five limited circumstances in clause  14

where consideration of public interest should be allowed to take

precedence  and  even where such circumstances  are  there,  the

competent  authority  must  first obtain  the  approval  of  the

Minister  and the Ministry.  So the flexibility is  limited  and

clearly  circumscribed and therefore we can be sure that  public

confidence  in  the  Master Plan as a  reliable  guide  for  the

development of land in Singapore would not be undermined.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is the vesting of land. We could use the

Land Acquisition Act for every piece of land that the Government

needs  for  public purposes.  But, again, through  practice,  we

find that as you develop a particular site, it is more efficient

to vest that piece of land that is required for the public work,

for  example, to the Government and at the same time, you do not

suffer from any less development rights.  The development rights

of  that  piece  of  land are transferred to  the  rest  of  the

development.  That has, in practice, proven to be very effective

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



has  not  led to abuse.  In the old days, where developments  of

large  tracts  of land are involved, vesting of lands  was  also

required for setting up of parks and schools.  But that phase of

Singapore's development is largely over.  Today, the vesting  of

land  primarily refers to situations where you give up the  land

in  front of your site for the widening of road, or you give  up

the  land  by  the side of your site for drainage reserves.   We

have  found  this  current practice of vesting  of  land  to  be

effective,  efficient  and has not led  to  abuse  and  this  is

continued in the present Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third main issue is whether there ought to be other

mechanisms  of  review over the Ministry's  and  the  Minister's

decision.   Again,  over the years, we have set  up  a  practice

where  any  change in the Master Plan is put out in  the  public

domain  and  anybody who is aggrieved can object to it  or  make

representations.  The Ministry treats the competent authority at

arm's  length.  Within the Ministry, the officials will evaluate

that  complaint  or  representation separately.   In  situations

where  the  issue is very important, we will set up a  panel  of

Planning  Appeal Inspectors.  These are planners drawn from  the

university,  the private sector, or other statutory  board,  not

within  the  Ministry of National Development.  We  should  then

look  at  the  planning  decision  of  the  competent  authority

separately and recommend to the Minister whether or not there is

a  case  for the appeal.  So there is established mechanism  for

this review.  We are not in favour of independent tribunals.  We

do  not  want  to  refer every appeal to the court  because  the

experience  in  many  countries with such a  mechanism  is  that

planning  applications get bogged down and it takes a very  long

time  for any sensible development to take place.  It becomes  a

mechanism by which different vested interests will use  that  to

block future developments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now take the other issues raised by Members. Mr Rai

asked  why not use the District Court instead of the High Court.

I  must  confess  that I would have to be  guided  by  the  AG's

Chambers  on this.  My understanding is that the requirement  to

go to the High Court imposes a heavier



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



responsibility   on   the  competent   authority.    Under   the

circumstances  that we need to apply to the High  Court  for  an

injunction would be in situations where the owner excavates land

and  we want to put a stop to it.  The AG's Chambers' advice  is

that the competent authority must approach the High Court rather

than  the District Court.  But I would take it up with the  AG's

Chambers and refer the two suggestions by Mr Rai to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai also suggested a subdivision of conservation units.

Today, we do allow subdivision of shophouses in areas other than

the  conservation district.  In other words, in  shophouses  not

gazetted  for  conservation, we do allow them to  be  subdivided

into  two units as long as they have separate access,  etc.   We

are  a  little  bit  more cautious in the conservation  district

because we want a single owner to make sure that there is proper

maintenance  and proper upkeep of the conserved  area.   But  we

would continue to monitor this.  If the subdivision in the other

areas, other than the conservation district, does not lead to  a

degradation of the standards of conservation and maintenance, we

will be prepared to look at this issue again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli asked whether there is a difference between

"conferred" and "empowered".  I think this is the new  language.

I  was  told that in simplifying language, the clause says  that

the  responsibility and the functions conferred, rather than the

old way of saying that we are empowered to do this and empowered

to do that.  The substance remains the same.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the valuation method, we have found the standard

valuation  method to be effective.  We have done this  for  many

years.   We have been reviewing the standard development  charge

every  year.   We  have  found this to be  very  effective.   It

provides  greater certainty to the market.  We still retain  the

provision   to  allow  somebody  to  appeal  for  an  individual

valuation if he finds that the standard valuation does not quite

meet his requirement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional amendment in this Bill allows the Minister

to set a certain limit below which one cannot ask for a separate

valuation.  This is for practical purposes where the development

charge  is  not  expected to be very much.  We  will  discourage

applications  for separate valuations, because this  requires  a

lot of time and resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chuang raised the issue of the 30% rule. Again, we

found  that  if  we  want  to  have  a  very  high  standard  of

maintenance,  particularly in shopping centres and strata  title

developments, it is necessary to have one owner having at  least

30%,  so  that that owner can set the tone and the character  of

the  development.   If  the  entire  development  is  completely

subdivided, very soon you find the standard of maintenance  goes

down  and  that  there will be no leadership  in  redevelopment,

modifications or improvements.  So this 30% rule has  proven  to

be  quite  effective.   We will monitor  this.   Of  course,  it

imposes certain burdens on the owner to retain the 30%.  It also

creates  problems where individual owners of small plots combine

to  develop the entire property.  We will look at this  and  see

how  we  can  find a solution to overcome this - how to  achieve

singularity  of  purpose  that is given  when  you  have  a  30%

ownership,  like single owner versus the obstacles that  such  a

rule creates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also like to assure Mr Chuang that it is not the

intention  of  the  competent authority to  look  at  individual

designs,  except  in critical areas.  We have  designated  areas

where  the  buildings  will have to go before  an  architectural

design  panel.  This is to ensure that the design is  compatible

in  what  we  call "designated routes".  These  are  key  routes

leading  to  the  Istana  or  what we designate  as  "ceremonial

routes".  Beyond these very restricted routes, it is not in  our

interest and we do not intend to regulate design.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam talked about the enhancement of enforcement

powers and fines.  I mentioned this in my speech.  Many of these

enforcement  powers  have  to  be  increased  for  us   to   act

expeditiously on complaints.  A typical example will be  illegal

use of residence for workers'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



quarters  or the illegal use of residence for place of  worship.

Under  the  present Act, the URA officers find it very difficult

to  take enforcement action.  People congregate in a house to be

used  as  a  temple over the weekend, at night  or  for  certain

religious  ceremonies.  It creates a big  nuisance.   Under  the

present  Act,  we do not have the powers to enter.  We  have  to

collect  a lot of evidence before we can take action.  And  when

we  do  take action, invariably there will be a long  series  of

appeals  to  Members of Parliament, Ministers, etc.   Meanwhile,

the  people who live around the residence will have  to  put  up

with  it  being used as an illegal workers' quarters or  illegal

temple  for a long time.  So I think we want to strike a balance

in  which we can take more effective action against such illegal

uses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the enhancement of fines, again, as I have

explained,  it  is  the relativity between  the  fines  and  the

economic  value  of  continuing  with  the  illegal  use.   That

relativity  has  to  be  struck  again.   Otherwise,  they  just

continue with the illegal use and pay the $50 fine per day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have clarified many of the very important points

raised  by  Members  and I would like to thank  them  again  for

supporting the Bill.

<div align="center"><b>RESPECT FOR THE JUDICIARY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>

<br>3.40 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> This motion is subject to signification of

support by at least one Member.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I support.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House regrets that the Executive does not respect

the Judiciary as the final arbiter in the application of all

laws passed by Parliament.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I assure you and the House that I am not embarking on

an academic exercise, but raising a question which I shall say

is very relevant even in the economic woes that face this

country at the moment.  There have been calls for greater

transparency and accountability in decisions taken in other

countries in their financial matters.  It is not altogether

irrelevant to our problems in Singapore today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt the ever faithful press will report of the NCMP

wasting  the  time and I see that every time they refer  to  me,

they  say the NCMP.  I am here not just as an NCMP.  I  am  also

here  as the leader of the Workers' Party, and I am speaking  on

behalf of the party, not just for myself

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when we decided in the 1950s to set out on

the  road for self-government, we chose deliberately, of our own

free  choice,  the form and system of government that  we  would

like  for  Singapore.   And, of course, as Members are aware  or

should  be  aware, that an All-Party Mission went to London  for

talks  to hammer out what should be our style of government  and

our  form of government, and included among them was none  other

than  the  one-time Secretary-General of the  ruling  party  and

Prime  Minister  for many years.  And we chose  the  Westminster

pattern  and  the  pattern that was followed in other  countries

which had evolved into independence after British tutelage, that

we would have a division of powers.  We would have the Executive

to  implement  and carry out the day-to-day decisions  that  are

necessary.  We would have the legislature, the Parliament,  that

would  make the laws for the people and circumscribe the  powers

under  which the Executive may act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, that we would

have  an independent Judiciary - this was clearly spelt  out  in

the  memorandum - the importance of an independent Judiciary who

will interpret the laws of the country and decide whether, be it

the  Executive or any citizen, has acted in accordance with  the

law  or  laws  of the country.  So we had chosen  for  ourselves

these three divisions of Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following that choice by us, we finally enacted by Article

93 of the Constitution



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



that the judicial power shall be vested in the Supreme Court  of

Singapore  and  such  other courts as may be  established.   Any

lawyer   will   tell  you  that  judicial  power  includes   the

interpretation of any law passed by Parliament.  It is part  and

parcel  of  their function - that the courts are  always  called

upon  to  do  just  that, to interpret what the  law  means  and

whether anyone has acted outside the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good government, Mr Speaker, Sir, requires that government

acts  in  accordance with the law.  Government is not above  the

law.   No  one is above the law in a country which observes  the

rule  of  law.   In  a  civilised  democratic  country,  if  the

government  acted  above the law or outside  the  law,  then  it

ceases to be a democratic government subject to the rule of  law

and  it  becomes  no  better than a mafia government.   And  any

issue,  whether the Government has acted under the law, must  be

determined  by the Judiciary, not  by the Executive.  Otherwise,

the  Executive becomes judge and jury, master in its own  cause,

decides what is the law and whether it has followed the  law  or

not.  That is not the case where the Rule of Law prevails and in

a  country  which professes to practise parliamentary democracy.

Parliamentary  democracy, by its term, implies  that  Parliament

shall  be  supreme and the Government shall act under  the  laws

passed by Parliament and shall be accountable to Parliament, not

act as a law unto itself.  These are absolutely necessary if  we

are to have any transparency or accountability in our system  of

Government.  We  have, even our own Ministers, proclaiming  over

and over again how transparent the Singapore Government is, that

they  accept the need for transparency, for all their  decisions

to  be seen openly and to be judged by persons who are competent

to judge such decisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore a matter for regret, it is indeed sad, that

over  the  last few years the Government has not been seen,  and

manifestly been seen, to have acted in accordance with the  law.

That, as I say, is vital in any democratic system of government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I first of all highlight the recent instance where the

Government has not been seen and perceived to have acted  within

the  law.   I  should have also said that above  all  laws,  the

Constitution is the supreme law and all other laws  are  subject

to the Constitution.  Parliament is subject to the Constitution.

The  courts  are subject to the Constitution. The  Executive  is

subject to the Constitution.  It is the people's charter.  It is

an Act of the people and it is through the Constitution that the

people  control the Government.  Therefore, it is a  matter  for

regret  that  the Government should have been seen to  disregard

flagrantly the provisions of the Constitution.  Of course, I  am

referring to the question which I raised in this House not  very

long  ago, whether the  Government had acted in accordance  with

Article  144 of the Constitution.  I do not wish to  read  again

what  Article 144 of the Constitution says.  It is clear enough,

and  it  seems  to us that before any loan is given Parliament's

authority  by  way of a resolution should be first obtained  and

that should again be ratified by the President.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say from the outset that this motion does not raise

the  question whether it was right or wrong to have offered this

loan  to  Indonesia.  That is a matter which perhaps has  to  be

decided  at  some other time.  This motion raises  the  question

whether  the Government has been seen to act in accordance  with

the  law.  May I also say quite clearly at the outset that I  am

not  here to argue that the Government's interpretation of  that

Article is wrong and that the interpretation that we seek to put

is  the right one.  Parliament is not the forum to determine the

interpretation of any Article of the Constitution.  That,  as  I

said,  is  the  province  of the courts.   The  courts  have  to

determine  it.    It  is  in  recognition  of  this   that   the

Constitution  was  amended, I believe, in  1994,  to  set  up  a

Tribunal consisting of Supreme Court judges to whom any question

concerning  the effect of any provision of the Constitution  can

be referred to for an opinion.  So we have the machinery already

set up.  Under Article 100A of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



Constitution,  the  President may  refer  to  the  Tribunal  any

question  concerning the interpretation of any  Article  in  the

Constitution.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>RESPECT FOR THE JUDICIARY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, you may resume your speech.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Thank you, Sir. As I was saying, we have a

Tribunal.  We know very little of the circumstances under  which

the  loan  came  to  be  granted or  agreed  to  be  granted  to

Indonesia.   Indeed, when I raised the question  in  Parliament,

the  Minister for Finance was not quite clear even as  to  where

the decision was taken and it would appear that the decision was

not  really  taken by the Cabinet itself but was  taken  by  the

Prime  Minister in consultation with one or two other  Ministers

and  later ratified by the Cabinet.  But, as I said, we are  not

here to inquire into all that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that we are here to consider is whether in so doing

the   Government   has  complied  with  Article   144   of   the

Constitution.  When my Party first raised this,  the answer from

the  Minister was, "No, we have been advised that  it  does  not

apply  because way back in 1980 or 1986 the then Presidents  had

approved  purchase of Indonesian equities or securities."   Then

when  my Party took this matter up outside Parliament, in  press

releases,  we  heard from the Ministry of Law that  the  Article

should be interpreted in a particular way - I don't want  to  go

into  all that - and that we had got it grievously wrong in  our

interpretation.  So we offered immediately and said, "All right.

If  you  say we have got it wrong, why not let the court  decide

this."  And as I said, there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>



was  a  tribunal already in place which could have decided  this

question  once and for all.  The answer came back, "Oh  no!   We

don't   have  to  refer  it.   If  you  want,  you  refer   it."

Forgetting,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that it is only the President  who

may  refer these questions to the tribunal.  The Ministry of Law

forgets this and says the Workers' Party can refer it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Party said, "All right. If you want us to appear,

we  will be quite happy to appear, provided, in the event we are

found  to  have been wrong in our interpretation, no  costs  are

levied  against us."  It seems to be quite a reasonable request,

may I say, on a matter which concerns our taxpayers.  And it  is

not  a  trifling little sum that is in question.  It is  nothing

less  than  S$8  billion.  And so we went on,  to  and  fro  and

finally the Party asked two questions: that the Ministry of  Law

should  answer  whether  it was the business  of  the  court  to

interpret or not and whether this was a matter of supreme public

importance.   We never got an answer to that.  And,  of  course,

the  silence is deafening.  The Ministry of Law could  not  very

well  come and say it is not for the court to interpret.  So  it

is, I repeat, a matter for regret that on a matter like this, of

supreme  public importance, the taxpayers' monies of $8 billion,

the  Government is dragging its feet when it is suggested to  it

that  it  should get a decision from a competent tribunal  which

will  be  able to put this matter at rest.  All we can  say,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, it is to be deplored.  But this is not  the  only

instance,  although this is the most outstanding or  significant

instance and of very recent memory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the question whether the Prime Minister and the

two  Deputy  Prime Ministers had broken the law on  polling  day

when  they  entered the polling stations.  My Party had  made  a

complaint that it was in clear violation of the section  in  the

Parliamentary Elections Act.  It seems to us plain that the  Act

prohibited  any person other than the candidate and his  polling

agent  or election agent and, of course, other than the election

officials,  the  police and the voters, from entering  into  the

polling  station.   That was made clear by section  39(4)  which

says: "The presiding officer . shall exclude all other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



persons",  that  is,  persons  other  than  those  that  I  have

mentioned.   But  when  we complained  to  the  Police,  and  it

appeared  to  us  that it was only the Police  that  could  take

action  under  this, we were told that the Attorney-General  had

ruled that no offence had been committed because the section did

not mean what the Workers' Party was trying to say it meant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I wish to say, commenting on it, is that I was told, Mr

Speaker, Sir, that there was a story on the Internet.  I do  not

surf  the Internet, as they say these days.  The story was about

a  boy  who was caught by his mother coming out of a disco,  and

the  mother seized the boy and said, "My son, didn't I tell  you

that  you  are not to go anywhere near a disco?"   And  the  boy

said,  "But, mother, I was not anywhere near the disco.   I  was

inside.   So how can you say I didn't follow what you told  me."

That  is the only comment that I wish to make.  It seems  to  us

plain  that the Act prevented or prohibited persons, other  than

those  I  have mentioned, from being present inside the  polling

station.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was yet another matter on which the Government

seems reluctant.  And this was the question that I posed to  the

Finance  Minister  on the sitting on 19th November  and  emerged

from  it.   I had asked the question whether section  8  of  the

Prevention of Corruption Act was considered by him when  he  was

asked  by  the  Prime Minister to inquire into the purchases  at

Nassim  Jade and Scotts 28 by the Senior Minister and  DPM  Lee.

The  answer given seemed to me to confirm that section 8 of  the

Prevention  of  Corruption Act was never  considered.   And  his

answer was that it was not considered because nobody thought  it

had  any  application to the purchases.  But section  8  of  the

Prevention of Corruption Act is again explicit and it says, if I

may read it, Mr Speaker, Sir:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where in any proceedings against a person for an offence

under  section  5 or 6, it is proved that any gratification  has

been  paid or given to or received by a person in the employment

of  the Government or any department thereof or of a public body

by  or  from a person or agent of a person who has or  seeks  to

have  any dealing with the Government or any department  thereof

or  any public body, that gratification shall be deemed to  have

been  paid  or given and received corruptly as an inducement  or

reward as hereinbefore mentioned unless the contrary is proved."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So under the Prevention of Corruption Act, the decision is

left  to the court to determine so long as it is found that  the

recipient  is a public official and the gratification  has  been

received or agreed to be received from a body which has or would

have  dealings with the Government.  And there was  no  question

that  the developer would have had dealings with the Government.

And if one looks at the definition of gratification, it seems to

us  to  be  plain  that the giving of the discount  was  covered

within the meaning of the word "gratification".  So, again,  the

courts were not given an opportunity to pronounce on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going further back, and this was of course in 1988 and it

concerns   me,   the  Government  ignored  a  pronouncement   of

Singapore's highest court.  Government wastes no time in  paying

lip service to respecting the courts and does not waste any time

to  punish anyone who it says is in contempt of the court.   And

yet  when Singapore's highest court, as it was in 1988,  made  a

pronouncement that the convictions were wrong and that there had

been  a  serious miscarriage of justice, how did the  Government

react  to  a  pronouncement by its own court?   Let  it  not  be

forgotten  that  the Privy Council, although it was  staffed  by

Britishers,  was  Singapore's court  set  up  by  the  Singapore

Government to hear appeals and it was praised as serving a  very

useful  task.   And the reason given was that the Privy  Council

had no jurisdiction.  The Privy Council itself admitted that  it

had  no  jurisdiction to set aside the conviction.  We  did  not

need the Government to tell us because the convictions were  not

before  the Council.  But the Privy Council had the jurisdiction

-  and this was not only a decision of the Privy Council, it was

also  the decision of the High Court of Singapore - that it  had

jurisdiction  to consider the validity of the convictions  in  a

related  appeal.  Having looked at the convictions and how  they

were obtained, they said that there was a serious miscarriage of

justice.   And the Government not only ignored the pronouncement

but committed contempt of court, despite the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>



then  Prime  Minister, now Senior Minister,  saying  before  the

Committee of Privileges in 1986 that if it was shown that  there

was   any  injustice,  Parliament  should  ask  immediately  the

President to set aside the convictions or to order a new  trial.

That apparently meant nothing.  And then the Prime Minister when

he  went to Williams College committed blatant contempt  of  the

Judiciary by saying they were playing politics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have selected these four instances

because  they  seem to me to be very glaring.  There  are  other

instances  where the Government and officers have not been  seen

and  perceived to be acting within the law.  It is my submission

that,  by  so  doing, the Government loses its credibility.   It

loses  its moral authority to govern Singapore if it refuses  to

abide  by  the Constitution which is the supreme law  and  which

binds  the  Government, Parliament and even the Judiciary.   Any

government  which  is  sensitive to its  role  as  a  democratic

government and observing the rule of law would only be too ready

to   submit   its  decisions  for  examination  by  a  competent

authority,  competent  to examine its  decisions  and  make  any

pronouncement  on  it.  But apparently, this Government  is  not

prepared to do so.  The Government behaves, as I said, as though

it  is a law unto itself.  No one is right except itself.  That,

may  I  say, Mr Speaker, Sir, is a very arrogant attitude to  be

taken by any government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is my plea in this House - let us forget about the

other instances - that this question of granting the loan of S$8

billion  or  agreeing to grant the loan was taken in  accordance

with  the Constitution be referred immediately to this tribunal.

We  cannot do it, as I said.  The Workers' Party cannot  do  it.

No  member  of  the  public can do it.  The President,  and  the

President  of  course  acts, as he  is  required  to  under  the

Constitution, on the advice of the Government.   So  I  do  hope

that the Government will reconsider its reluctance and have this

matter  now referred to the tribunal under Article 100A  and  if

the  tribunal  wishes  to hear arguments, we,  in  the  Workers'

Party,  will  be quite happy to appear before the  tribunal  and

present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>



what  we think is the contrary argument.  But it is the tribunal

which  has to decide that, not the Government.  And my  plea  is

that  the  Government should do that now.  It will  then  redeem

itself  in  the eyes of the public.  It will show  itself  as  a

Government that is sensitive to public opinion, that  heeds  the

necessity to abide by the Constitution and the Rule of Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.22 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

Parliament, the Executive and the Judiciary are the three  major

pillars  of  Singapore's  Government.  Apart  from  legislation,

Parliament  has   the  supervisory power over  the  Government's

action.   The Government should ensure that all its actions  are

carried  out  in  accordance with the  law.   The  Judiciary  is

responsible for interpreting the laws passed by  Parliament  and

to  find out whether the acts of the Government are carried  out

in accordance with the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Government offered to loan US$5 billion to

Indonesia.  Whether or not this is done in accordance  with  the

law   should  not  be  left  to  the Attorney-General  alone  to

interpret  in  such  a  way that justifies  the  action  of  the

Government.  This  is  not convincing, and  it  is  against  the

principle of the separation of powers between the Executive, the

Legislature and the Judiciary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 144 of the Constitution provides for the protection

of   the  assets  of  the  people.   The  Attorney  General  has

interpreted  this Article in such a way that it cannot  restrain

the  Government  from  making such a  substantial  loan  without

having first obtained the approval of the Elected President.  If

the Government can freely make use of the reserves to lend money

to  any organisation or any foreign government, then the Elected

President  who  is supposed to be responsible  for  holding  the

second  key,  is  quite  useless.  Is this  a  loophole  in  our

Constitution?   Therefore, to refer the  interpretation  of  the

Article to the tribunal set up under the Constitution is what  a

responsible



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



government  should do.  But, unfortunately and regrettably,  the

Ministry  of  Law  is trying to push the responsibility  to  the

Workers'  Party.  This is not a question between the  Government

and the Workers' Party.  It is a question whether the Government

is  acting according to the law, respecting the Constitution and

be responsible to the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the people of Singapore are questioning the

Government's  right  to grant a huge loan   to  another  country

without  the  President's  approval.    The  Government   should

therefore refer the matter to the tribunal in order to   enhance

the  confidence of the people in the Government.  Why should the

Government shirk the responsibility?  Therefore, I would  appeal

to  the Government to refer the interpretation of Article 144 to

the  Constitutional  tribunal to show that  the  Government  has

indeed  the respect for the Judiciary and for such a respect  to

be affirmed. .

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, both Mr Jeyaretnam and Mr

Low  have  talked  about the recent episode  of  the  loan  that

Government  made to Indonesia.  Mr Jeyaretnam made other  points

which  I will address briefly afterwards because they are points

that  have been addressed before.  Other than the loan,  he  has

really  brought  up  old  issues.  But this  current  one  is  a

continuation  of  the debate that began in this  House  on  19th

November  1997 when Mr Jeyaretnam asked the question of  Dr  Hu,

Minister  for Finance, as to the constitutionality of the  loan.

He  said that the Workers' Party questions its constitutionality

and he said that the Government should be the party to refer the

matter  to  the constitutional court.  Let me first of  all  put

things  in  context, set out the backdrop to  this  episode,  in

particular the exchange of letters between the Government and Mr

Jeyaretnam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, it began on 19th November 1997 in this House,

after  which  in  a  letter dated 20th November,  Mr  Jeyaretnam

repeated  his  allegation  of  unconstitutionality  in  a  press

release.   The  Government responded very quickly the  following

day



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>



to  explain carefully the operation of Article 144, setting  out

the Attorney-General's opinion.  Obviously, Mr Jeyaretnam either

did  not  want  to or could not grasp the explanation  that  was

given.   Calling  the law "an ass", he asked the  Government  to

refer  the  matter to a constitutional court, boasting  that  he

would argue the case himself.  The Government responded that the

law  was clear and that there was no need to do so.  But  if  Mr

Jeyaretnam wished to, he was free to bring the matter before the

courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True to character, Mr Jeyaretnam shifted ground. He did

not  say it as much just now but he alluded to it.  But  let  me

put  it in the fullest context.  He said that the Workers' Party

would  bring  the matter before our courts but on the  condition

that  the  Government agreed to bear all legal  costs.   So  the

Workers'  Party  would bring the matter to  the  court  but  the

Government,  with  taxpayers'  money,  bears  the  legal  costs,

including  those  for  engaging  a  constitutional  lawyer  from

overseas.   If  that  was not already an absurd  condition,  yet

another condition was that the Government should meet AG's costs

in  defending the suit even if it failed.  So the Workers' Party

brings  the suit.  First, he said he would argue himself.   Then

he  said,  "Well,  we will bring the suit.   We  will  bring  an

overseas lawyer, expert constitutional lawyer.  But if we  fail,

we  won't  bear  AG's costs."  At that stage, Mr Jeyaretnam  was

already talking of the action failing and no longer was he going

to  argue the case himself.  He was now going to get an overseas

constitutional lawyer.  Obviously, he had second thoughts  about

his  assertion  that  Article  144  was  unconstitutional.   And

indeed, I think it was a wise thing when he said he would  bring

an  overseas constitutional lawyer to help him because, if I may

say, he needs it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these absurd conditions, the Government responded the

next day that the Workers' Party's position was ludicrous.   The

Government also reiterated its position that, as advised by  the

AG, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



law  was clear.  There was therefore no need to refer the matter

to  the  courts.  And we also said that if Mr Jeyaretnam claimed

otherwise, he was free to do so.  So we have this as the current

position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legal position, as confirmed by the AG, is clear. What

the  Government has done is within the law and the Constitution.

But  Mr  Jeyaretnam disagrees.  Just because  he  disagrees,  he

wants  the  Government to refer the matter to the  courts.   The

Government has said no.  From that, he now wants this  House  to

say  that  the Executive does not respect the Judiciary  as  the

final  arbiter  of our laws.  So it is a quantum  jump.   It  is

preposterous  that  just because he, as  an  Opposition  Member,

makes an issue of it or demands it, we are obliged to refer  the

matter  to  the  courts.  How does this follow?   Mr  Jeyaretnam

having  failed to be elected in the last general election  wants

publicity.  But the courts are not there to satisfy his  craving

for  publicity.  If Mr Jeyaretnam is sincere and serious in  his

view  that  the  Government has breached the Constitution,  then

surely as a lawyer he knows that he can initiate action  in  our

courts to challenge the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam clearly does not understand the provisions of

the  Constitution.   So what I have done is  I  have  asked  the

Attorney-General to once again elaborate on its earlier  opinion

as  to  why  Article  144  does  not  apply  to  loans  made  by

Government,  applying  rather to loans made  to  Government,  in

other words, when the Government borrows money, not lends money.

This  is  for Mr Jeyaretnam's elucidation.  I will now  ask  the

Clerk to distribute AG's elaboration (Cols. 133-6).  [Copies  of

Attorney-General's elaboration distributed to hon. Members.]



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1998/19980114/19980114-HA-0680133.htm">AG's elaboration (Cols. 133 - 136)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AG's exposition of these provisions on reserves is very

clear.   Article  144  applies  to situations  where  Government

borrows    ,  not lends, money.  This is because when Government

borrows  money,  it borrows on public credit.  So  a  profligate

government  without  enough money in the coffers  to  spend  can

borrow money, but who will return the money?  Future governments

will have to do that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam would do well to take some time to read it

carefully.   Or  better  still, he should consult  his  overseas

constitutional lawyer.  He would then discover that  if  anybody

is  an ass, it is not the law.  AG has set out the position very

clearly   and   I   hope  he  reads  it  very  carefully.    His

interpretation is backed by common sense.  In fact, paragraph  8

of AG's note puts it very nicely.  Let me read the paragraph:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If Mr J B Jeyaretnam's view of Article 144 is correct, it

means that the Government's power to give any loan of any amount

to  any  person anywhere is now restricted by Article  144.   It

means,  for example, that the Government may not give car  loans

or  computer  loans to civil servants without  the  sanction  of

Parliament  and  the  President.   That  would  be  an  absurdly

impractical way for the Government to govern.'





Mr Jeyaretnam prefaced his speech by saying that he makes a very

practical point.  It is not an academic point, not a moot point.

But  the  interpretation he argues for would, in fact,  lead  to

much impracticality in governance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AG's elaboration is also backed by other premises or basis

such  as  the  rules of statutory interpretation,  reference  to

Article  144(2)  and  also to the concept  of  reddendo  singula

singulis  and  indeed even to the reference to  the  legislative

material,  eg, the White Paper, where in paragraph 42  on  which

Article  144  is based, it is stated very clearly,  Article  144

talks  about situations where Government raises loans, not gives

loans, as well as other provisions in the Constitution and  also

other  legislation.  This is a full opinion.  I  hope  he  takes

care to read it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's constitutional powers to safeguard reserves

are therefore not compromised in any way.  And the Government is

very  open about it.  That is transparent government.   We  will

tell  you  why  we  think the law is clear.   And  because  AG's

exposition  is clear, the law is clear, Government  accepts  it.

Of  course, again, as I said, if Mr Jeyaretnam thinks otherwise,

he is free to bring the matter to the courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to another absurd point made by Mr Jeyaretnam - that the AG is a member of the Executive, hence it is really a

case of the Executive interpreting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>



laws  passed by Parliament.  I think that is what he has alluded

to.   He  talks about the two questions he raised  in  his  last

letter  where  there is really no need to reply to  because  the

exchange  had  gone on for sometime already, and Government  had

put  its  case very clearly.  This is one question that  he  had

asked  - is AG a member of the Executive?  Government says  AG's

opinion  is clear, therefore, there is no need to refer  to  the

courts.   I think such an assertion really shows Mr Jeyaretnam's

gross  misunderstanding of the role of the  AG  as  chief  legal

adviser  to  the  Government, as set out in Article  35  of  the

Constitution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As chief legal adviser, AG is asked, from time to time, to

advise  the  Government  on the legality of  proposed  executive

decisions  or  actions.   His  role  is  to  give  legal  advice

objectively.  In giving such advice, the AG may have  to  advise

the  Government  on the interpretation of the  provisions  of  a

statute.  In this case, he had to interpret Article 144  of  the

Constitution.    His  advice,  like  any  other  legal   adviser

including Mr Jeyaretnam who himself is a lawyer, represents  his

own  understanding  of the law.  He does  not  have  to  seek  a

judicial ruling before tendering advice to the Government.  Like

all  legal advisers, AG will assess each case on its own merits.

Like  all legal advisers, he will not say that there is a strong

case if there is really none.  After all, he has to stand by his

opinion to the Cabinet, and if it becomes public as it has  now,

then  to Singaporeans and indeed to others in the world who  may

care  to  read it, examine it, especially to his own fellow  AGs

from other jurisdictions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this instance, AG has advised that the US$5 billion loan

to  Indonesia  is lawful.  The Government has no reason  not  to

accept  AG's  advice.   In  so  doing,  we  can  understand   Mr

Jeyaretnam's  disappointment in that he will not  have  what  he

wants  - Government acting on his prompting to bring the  matter

to  the  constitutional court.  But for him to claim  that  non-referral   of  AG's  legal  interpretation  to  the  courts   is

tantamount  to  not  respecting the  courts,  I  think  that  is

mischievous.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two instances that Mr Jeyaretnam mentioned just

now ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Three.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> All right. Two instances as

regards AG's role as Public Prosecutor, which is also set out in

Article  35.  We all know that the AG has got the discretion  to

prosecute  or  not  to prosecute, and he will  do  that  fairly,

impartially.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this point about PAP leaders not being prosecuted for

acts  done in connection with the last General Election,  again,

this has been fully debated in this House when the Minister  for

Law  answered and gave a full reply.  He also set out an opinion

by  the  AG  which again was made public.  So it is examined  by

everybody  why  the provisions do not apply.  The same  argument

applies  to  the Prevention of Corruption Act.  Is it  relevant?

Is  it applicable?  The AG will have to decide, and he does this

acting  in his constitutional role of Public Prosecutor,  acting

fairly and impartially.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go on to the other point, Mr Low Thia Khiang

talked  about  a  loophole in the Constitution - can  Government

just  lend  money?  The Government has the power to lend  money,

but,  ultimately, I think he will agree that all of us know that

the  Government's actions are accountable to the people.  So  if

we  make  imprudent loans and we cannot defend what  we  do,  we

answer  for  it in the next general election.  So  there  is  an

element of accountability.  And if you look at AG's opinion,  he

also mentioned Article 148G where the Accountant-General and the

Auditor-General  have  the duty to advise the  President  should

there  be  transactions or proposed transactions which to  their

knowledge  are  likely to draw on the reserves.   So  there  are

checks and balances, I would like to assure Mr Low.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the question arises: is Mr Jeyaretnam therefore

hypocritical  in  moving this motion?  I  ask  this  because  he

accuses the Government of not respecting the Judiciary.  But let

me ask him: has he once stood up for the Judiciary?  On the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>



contrary,  the Member was censured by this House in  1987  which

found him guilty of abuse of the privileges of Parliament in his

allegation  of Executive interference in the Judiciary.   So  he

himself  impugned the integrity of the Judiciary and  Parliament

punished  him with a maximum fine of $1,000.  I should say  that

he is the least qualified to talk of respect for the Judiciary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the position of the Executive, and indeed of this

House, has always been that our Judiciary should be accorded due

respect and its integrity defended.  This is on record.   It  is

very  clear from Government's actions.  We stand by the rule  of

law.   We  subscribe  to  the  separation  of  powers  and   the

independence of our Judiciary.  Indeed, if Mr Low can remember - Mr  Jeyaretnam  was not here at that time - it was  only  a  few

years  ago in November 1995 that the Government on that occasion

stoutly   defended  the  integrity  and  independence   of   our

Judiciary.   On  that  occasion,  this  House  passed  a  motion

denouncing the SDP for attacking the Judiciary.  The message was

clear.   The  greatest respect should be shown  to  our  Judges.

Even  Mr Chiam See Tong - he is not here today - I think all  of

us remember that episode, he was then still an SDP member, stood

up  for a principle and defended our Judiciary, even if it meant

disassociating himself from the then leadership of the SDP.   He

voted in favour of the motion.  The Workers' Party, on the other

hand,  issued a statement that it would not participate  in  the

debate  and  its  sole  representative in  the  House,  Mr  Low,

abstained in the voting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, therefore, I would urge this House to soundly reject

this  motion.   It  is  baseless.  It  is  mischievous.   It  is

hypocritical.   Before I conclude, I think  Mr  Jeyaretnam  will

remind  me of one more example he cited, his own case  in  1987.

Here again, the grounds have been fully ventilated.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> 1988, not 1987.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Thank you. The grounds have

been  fully ventilated.  Indeed, this was debated in this  House

in  January 1989, when the Minister for Law answered a  question

raised by Dr Lee



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>



Siew  Choh  on  this matter.  So it was fully  ventilated.   The

grounds  are  very  clear.  In fact, the Privy  Council,  as  Mr

Jeyaretnam  said  himself,  had  no  jurisdiction  in  terms  of

commenting on the criminal convictions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You got me completely wrong. I will reply

to you.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> All right. It is very clear.

The  grounds are there.  The matter before the Privy Council  in

that  case  was  disbarment, not the criminal  convictions.   So

whatever comments the Privy Council made on the convictions were

not  binding, and the Privy Council, in fact, said that.   Also,

because the Public Prosecutor was not present, important  points

of  law  were  not argued.  These are just examples.   The  main

point  that  Mr  Jeyaretnam wants us to look at  is  really  the

motion.   I  do  not  think we should be side-tracked  by  these

examples which I have said are old examples.  He would  like  us

to  re-visit these issues, but they are really all in the books.

Government  stands  by what it has said in  the  past  which  is

totally defensible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, once again, I urge this House to reject the

motion.  Let me conclude by affirming that the job of government

is to govern.  And we will govern effectively so as to safeguard

our  interests domestically, in foreign relations  and  defence,

and  we  will  do this in a manner and in the best  interest  of

Singapore,  and  in  accordance with the law.   If  it  requires

getting the President's approval or coming to Parliament to pass

laws  or  debate  policies, we will do it.  But if  it  requires

decisive Executive action, as was the case for the loan  because

timing  was a consideration, then we will continue to take  such

decisive actions.  [Applause].

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, it

is  not  apparent to me what specifically Mr Jeyaretnam  had  in

mind  when  he moved this motion.  Allow me therefore  to  begin

with some general observations on the motion before dealing with

the specifics of what I have just heard him and the Minister  of

State for Law, Assoc. Prof. Ho, say.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is apparent to all of us that Singapore has a

written Constitution that sets out the respective roles of three

main and equal institutions - Parliament, the Executive and  the

Judiciary.   It  is also very clear that the Constitution  gives

judicial  power to the Judges.  "Judicial power", what  does  it

mean?  I tend to agree with the NCMP that it is to interpret the

law.   But  then,  I  think, in principle,  any  first-year  law

student  would agree with the same.  The question then  becomes:

in practice, has this Executive government observed that rule of

law?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allegation, first, must be taken seriously. Because,

if  it is true, then there are very serious consequences.   Many

states  in history have let slip the rule of law and there  have

been tales in which judges, after giving a decision against  the

Executive, had found themselves removed or, worse, confronted by

armed  men and tanks.  I am glad to know that we have a  trained

defence  force  in  Singapore  and  mobilisation  exercises.   I

believe  none of us, including the NCMP, would want to see  that

kind  of  mobilisation exercise carried out.  So it is a serious

matter and political, social and economic consequences would  be

very  high  for  Singapore.  What then must be done,  Mr  Deputy

Speaker,  to  prevent the possibility of force overwhelming  the

rule  of law or subtler means in which the rule of the Judiciary

might be usurped?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that has not been said in Parliament today is

that  our  Constitution provides that the Judges of our  Supreme

Court  have  security  of tenure in office.   With  very  narrow

exceptions  such  as unsoundness of mind, body or  misbehaviour,

the  Judges  of our Supreme Court cannot be summarily  dismissed

nor can their salaries or powers be reduced.  This is important.

This  is an important protection against improper influence  and

fear from the Executive or from others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courts also have the powers to punish people who speak or

act  in  contempt of court.  And so in this way,  the  Singapore

system gives Judges as much protection as the law can give.   Is

there more that can be done?  Sir,  I wish to speak



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>



on  one general principle that I wish to introduce to this House

before turning to specifics that Mr Jeyaretnam has raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step, I believe, to make the situation even

better is that all Singaporeans must recognise and respect  that

the  Judiciary can, and often will, review and strike down  laws

passed  by  this  House or actions taken by the  Executive.   In

Singapore's legal history, though brief, there have  been  cases

in  which  the court has disagreed with Government agencies  and

statutory  bodies such as the Housing and Development Board  and

the  Registry  of  Companies.  These are  not  small  and  petty

bureaucracies.  These were serious decisions taken by the  court

in favour of individual Singaporeans against powerful Government

bodies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this past year itself, we have seen the courts

significantly reduce the amount of damages sought by  Government

leaders  in  their personal capacities against  their  political

opponents  for defamation.  In two major cases, the courts  have

ruled  against the Executive.  First, in the decision  of  PP  v

Bridges,  the  courts held that the courts should be  the  final

arbiter  of  what is or what is not a secret under the  Official

Secrets  Act,  not  the  Executive.    Second,  and  even   more

recently,  in  the case of former GIC manager,  Eddie  Taw,  the

court refused to uphold his conviction on charges of corruption.

According to newspaper reports, the Judge held that part of  the

Prevention of Corruption Act is unconstitutional insofar  as  it

provides  an  unequal burden on Singaporeans.  I am not  dealing

with  the  substance of these cases, but I think  the  principle

must  be  clear to everyone that our courts are independent  and

these  examples  that  I illustrate are  not  to  shore  up  our

bureaucracy  or Executive but to show that, when necessary,  our

courts are strong and bold enough to put right what they see  as

wrong.   I  think the Executive has demonstrated in these  cases

that they have followed the decisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think sometimes we in Singapore tend to view

disagreement  as something to be avoided; something  distasteful

or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



inefficient or even "unAsian".  But when we consider the role of

the  Judiciary, an equal role, we must give allowance  for  such

disagreement  between the Judiciary and the  Executive,  or  the

Judiciary  and  this  House.  The authority  of  the  courts  to

administer  justice  to the ordinary citizen  is  built  on  the

authority  of  the courts to do so with all, even  if  it  means

being in disagreement with the highest office in the land.  When

we recognise this, we can recognise the power that the Judiciary

wields  in the name of justice.  Only with such knowledge,  will

the  confidence in our judicial system increase.  Only this will

send  the  message  that  our courts have  acted  and  will  act

independently of the Government.  Then all Singaporeans can join

in  refuting the scandalous claims others have put forward  that

our Judiciary is somehow compliant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the second step that I think is needed to

safeguard  the  Constitutional position and the public  standing

that  our Judiciary already enjoys.  This is that the House  and

the  Executive  should  best  serve the  Constitution  and  this

country   by  conducting  ourselves  in  ways  that   give   due

recognition  to the Judiciary's role.  Specifically,  I  caution

against   amendments   to   the   law   designed   to   override

interpretations and decisions given by the judges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House makes the law. But the Judiciary interprets it.

There  may  therefore  be occasion on  which  we  pass  the  law

thinking it will have this meaning and this effect, only to have

the  judges tell us that it does not, it has a different effect,

or  that  it  cannot  be given effect. When  that  happens,  the

temptation  will be to amend the laws, or even the Constitution,

abruptly.  This has happened before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been notable amendments to the Internal Security

Act  in  the late 1980s.  This followed the Judiciary's decision

in  the landmark case of Chng Suan Tze, that decisions taken  by

the   Executive  should  be  subject  to  judicial   review   on

substantive  grounds.  This House reacted then by  amending  the

law  and the Constitution to remove substantive judicial  review

and limit the courts to the review of procedure only.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



The amendments removed the ISA from full judicial scrutiny.   It

made the Executive the arbiter over the substance of ISA cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even as we recognise that fact, we must also recognise

that this is a very narrow exception.  For the vast majority  of

laws,  which  Singaporeans live under every day,  the  Judiciary

remains the final arbiter, not the Executive.  What then must be

done  is to restrict the exception, and not to allow it ever  to

become  the  rule.   It  of  course remains  the  right  of  the

Executive  to appeal the decision of a judge to a higher  court.

It is also within the power of this House to amend the laws, and

given  the  large majority enjoyed by the party  in  power,  the

Constitution as well.  But I, as an NMP, hope that this power to

make  and amend laws in the face of Judicial decisions  will  be

exercised  sparingly.  The process of making and  amending  laws

needs  a  sea  change,  I believe.  This House  should  override

judicial decisions by amending laws or making new ones only with

compelling reasons and after a thorough discussion, both in this

Chamber,  and  by  such means as Select Committees.   This  hope

extends to the recent instances I have mentioned in which courts

have given decisions that the Executive may disagree with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I humbly submit in that sense, that the question facing us

in  this  House in such situations is not: Can this House  amend

the  laws?   Of course, we can.  The question is not:  Will  the

Executive be able to act more efficiently if we change  the  law

and  exclude judicial review?  It almost certainly will be.  The

question  should be: Has the court acted within its powers?   If

it  has,  this House should recognise this is the constitutional

scheme  of things and give serious pause before overriding  that

decision by amendment of new laws and limiting judicial review.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt in my mind that Singapore has enjoyed

good Government, and benefited from an Executive and bureaucracy

that  has  been  largely efficient, non-corrupt,  effective  and

lawful.   Singaporeans recognise this.  We must  also  recognise

that our nation would also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



benefit from a Judiciary that is given and continues to be given

its full constitutional measure of power and responsibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exception that I have mentioned, as regards the ISA,

must  be just that - an exception.  In the vast majority of laws

in  Singapore,  the  Judiciary is the  final  arbiter,  not  the

Executive nor this House.  Let it remain so.  The  Executive and

this  House must be encouraged to ensure it remains so. On these

grounds, I regret that I cannot support the present motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the specifics that Mr Jeyaretnam has brought up,

I  will  confine  my  comments to basically  his  contention  as

regards  Article  144 of the Constitution and the  role  of  the

Executive  as regards seeking the concurrence of Parliament  and

the Presidency.  I think there has been some public talk, coffee

shop  talk,  if you will, that if the President  is  to  be  the

second  key  to our reserves, where was the second key  in  this

instance?   But  I think the clarifications that the  Government

has  brought  up  upon  questions in  Parliament  have  assuaged

people.   The  question  of  reserves has  been  emphasized,  as

Article  148G rather than Article 144.  I have not had the  time

to  peruse  the  detailed opinion given by the Attorney-General,

but  I  believe this, and I agree with the Minister of State  on

this  point:  the  Government cannot doubt itself.   It  has  an

opinion  from its Legal Counsel.  There is an urgent  situation.

There is a need, therefore, to move forward.  No government ever

in  the world, when faced with such exigencies, will give  pause

and say, "Well, even though I think, and my legal advisers think

we  should move on, perhaps for safety's sake, we should hold  a

constitutional conference or referendum."  These situations take

a  lot  of time and I think in this case, everyone can see  that

time  was of the essence to restore confidence to Indonesia  and

the  region  and  for  our  foreign relations.   What  then  has

happened  now,  and this is an important step for Singapore,  is

that there will  be full transparency and discussion of both the

substance of the decision and the process of decision.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think finally we must come to this point. That Article

100  of the Constitution, which is created by the Executive, was

to  give the right to refer  matters on Constitutional questions

to  one person - the President, not to me, not to Mr Jeyaretnam,

not to any Member of this House.  Article 100 says the President

has  the power to refer the matter to a Constitutional Tribunal.

And  the President has chosen, in this case, to remain, to allow

it, at least, by silence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I should stop here because my understanding of

Standing  Order No. 48(8) is that the conduct of  the  President

shall not be open to discussion in this House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy   Speaker,  Sir,  the  legislation  of  a  nation  should

basically  provide  for   the  Government  to  make  a  resolute

decision in an emergency so that they could take rapid action to

protect  the interest of the nation.  At the moment, the  entire

region is faced with a  financial turmoil that is affecting  our

nation.    We should therefore be concerned with  how  to  unite

ourselves   and  to  take  effective  measures   to  boost   the

confidence   of   the  region,  particularly  our   neighbouring

countries.  Under such circumstances, our Government has, at the

request  of the Indonesian Government,  agreed to grant  them  a

loan  of US$5 billion so that they can tide over their financial

difficulties.  We should be more understanding   and   give  our

Government  the support.  After all,  Indonesia, like  Malaysia,

is our immediate neighbour and one of our most important trading

partners.  Their economic development is closely linked to ours.

If  the  crisis in Indonesia continues, it would gravely  affect

our economic development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On these premises, and at the request of the Indonesian

Government, we give them a helping hand.  I think this would  go

a  long  way  to benefit our economic interests.  Of course,  we

must ensure that they make good use of this money and  repay the

loan as promised.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at a time when we are faced with such a crisis, we

should  rally  behind  our Government and  I  feel  it  is  most

inappropriate  to  move such a motion at  this  point  of  time.

Therefore, I do not support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  my colleague, the Minister of State, Assoc.  Prof.  Ho

Peng  Kee,  has  given  a  very  comprehensive  response  to  Mr

Jeyaretnam  and it had not been my intention to take the  floor.

But  I do so after listening to Mr  Simon Tay who, I think, made

a  very lucid and scholarly presentation of the respective roles

of  the Executive, Legislature and the Judiciary.  For the  most

part  of  his  presentation, I have very little  differences  of

view.   But  the  reason  I take the floor  is  because  of  his

comments  on  the  need  to ensure that  when  the  courts  have

pronounced  on  interpretation of the laws or the  Constitution,

the  Government or the legislature should not override (the term

used   is   "override")  the  judgment,  except  in  exceptional

circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure him that when the Government has occasion to

amend  the  law,  it is not because of wanting to  override  the

decision.  As he has very well put it, the job of Parliament  is

to  enact laws which reflect Government's policy.  The  role  of

the  Judiciary  is  to  interpret the laws,  and  he  is  right.

Sometimes the courts may arrive at an interpretation which might

not  have been the interpretation that had been intended by  the

legislature or the Government.  In that kind of a situation, the

Government will have to examine the judgement, because as Assoc.

Prof.  Ho Peng Kee, the Minister of State, ended up his  speech,

the job of Government is to govern, and to govern effectively to

defend  and  advance Singapore's national interests  in  various

fields  -  economics,  internal security and  a  whole  area  of

governmental functions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He referred to the ISA case. In the ISA case where we had

to  amend,  the  reasons for amendment were very clearly  stated

and,  that is, it had always been the intention that the  merits

of the Government, the Executive's decision, under the ISA ought

not to be justiciable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



What  can  be reviewed is compliance with legal procedure.   And

since I moved those amendments in this House, I can assure  him,

(and  this can be verified by reference to records) I  had  also

expressed  concern  about the trends in Europe  and  in  England

where because of the influence of the European courts, they were

moving  in a direction which was not in our interest.  Therefore

when we amended it, it was clearly with a view to ensure that in

the  area  of internal security, the Executive will be  able  to

promote  Singapore's national interest.  That is not to  suggest

that  there is a disrespect for the Judiciary because  precisely

we  respect the Judiciary's decision, we have to amend the  laws

and  the Constitution to ensure that Government's intention  and

policy  objectives are correctly reflected in the law.   If  the

court  had arrived at a different interpretation, then we  would

have  to  remedy by amendments to the law.  That is not anything

sinister  or  undesirable.  That is a part of  the  function  of

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned two of many examples where the courts had

taken  a  position  of disagreeing with the  interpretation  and

holding against Government.  Of those two examples, one was  the

Official  Secrets Act case.  Let me say that we have  asked  the

Attorney-General  to give us his considered  views  because  his

preliminary review was, and is, that if the law is not  amended,

then  it  may  render  it impossible or well-nigh  difficult  to

enforce  the provisions of the Official Secrets Act.   Since  he

mentioned  it, I want to make it clear in the House  that  there

may well be a need to amend the Official Secrets Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other example he mentioned was the recent decision that

section   37   of   the   Prevention  of   Corruption   Act   is

unconstitutional.  And here, as Members will note, I have  given

a  comment  to  the press that, yes, we will also  examine  that

decision  because  it has very serious implications.   The  fact

that we are reviewing it does not mean there is a disrespect  of

the Judiciary's decision.  But we have to examine what is it  in

Singapore's interest in respect of advancing our objectives  and

high  standards of non-corruption and whether, if that  decision

in any way renders it difficult to advance our national interest

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



prevention of corruption, we need to amend the law.  In  so  far

as  the  judge  has pronounced that the law was unconstitutional

because Parliament did not have power to enact extra-territorial

legislation, that also has very serious implications because the

preliminary advice from the Attorney-General is that it  renders

it  impossible to comply with our international law  obligations

and  our  obligations  under certain international  conventions,

including,  for example, exercising jurisdiction over  hijacking

offences  committed  abroad.   Therefore,  this  is  also  being

studied.  I thought I should mention this now so that if I  have

to come to Parliament later to make amendments to these laws, Mr

Simon  Tay  would  not be surprised or allege that  I  have  not

mentioned this at all during the sitting.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Tay, do you want to reply to the

misunderstood part?

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> I want to mention briefly ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I think there is a point of order. The

Member  has  only  one chance to speak.  Unless  he  is  seeking

clarification  of what the Minister had said, he has  no  second

chance of reply.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not intend to

keep  the House very long in my reply because I think I can deal

very  shortly  with all that had been said by  the  Minister  of

State.   But before I begin to reply to him, may I say I  resent

his  descent into a personal attack by saying that I  am  moving

this  or asking for this because I am craving for publicity.   I

have  heard  this  several times.  That is always  the  standard

reply  of  the  PAP if somebody asks for anything,  "Oh,  he  is

craving for publicity."  They forget that the Ministers and  the

PAP  occupy the whole of the media space and time.  So  they  do

not  crave  for  publicity  but anyone  who  tries  to  question

anything  craves for publicity.  So I do resent this.  It  casts

doubts on my motives and on my sincerity which I do resent  very

strongly.   And  he  also goes on to suggest  that  I  am  being

hypocritical.  I have heard this so many times.  It  is  nothing

new.   But  I find it surprising that it should come  from  this

Minister of State now.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now reply to his points. The Minister refers to the

press releases by my Party and the answers from the Ministry  of

Law  and  he says it is an absurd position taken by the Workers'

Party  to ask for costs.  May I say this.  When replying to  the

Ministry's  statement  made in the first instance  that  it  was

always  open  to the Workers' Party to refer the matter  to  the

court,  I  had  overlooked quite candidly Article  100A  of  the

Constitution.   And so we said, "Yes, all right,  we  will  take

it."  But we do not want to be burdened with the costs of it, if

we  should be proved to be wrong.  We are quite happy  to  admit

that  we  may  be  wrong.   We do not  take  the  stand  of  the

Government  that  it is always right, that nobody  else  can  be

right.   We said that we did not want to be burdened and  simply

because  the Government knows the Workers' Party does  not  have

the  funds  to pay the cost and no one will help us  with  these

funds  because of the climate of fear in Singapore.  So  we  are

not  ashamed of the fact that we cannot ourselves bear any cost.

But  one would have expected the Government to have said,  "Yes,

please  do,  we  will let this matter be decided  without  costs

becoming  a  stumbling  block."  But,  no.   The  Minister  very

conveniently  forgets what I have pointed  out,  which  I  later

realised, that the Workers' Party could not have taken  this  to

the  tribunal.  It had to be only by the President but Simon Tay

also knows that the President acts on the advice of the Cabinet.

He is required to act on the advice of the Cabinet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> No.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> So the Cabinet has to advise him to refer

the  matter to the tribunal.  And so ultimately it is a decision

for  the  Cabinet to take.  The Minister says, "Oh, we  got  the

opinion of the Attorney-General.  It is so crystal clear to us."

It  completely misses the point I have tried to get across.   It

is  not  for this House.  It is not for the Attorney-General  to

say  what  the  law means.  He may have his views  like  anybody

else.   But he may be wrong.  He is not infallible.  And  as  Mr

Simon Tay has rightly pointed out and underscored, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>



final  arbiter of this question is the Judiciary.   So  what  is

wrong  if you feel that you are right, that it cannot be  wrong?

What is so very difficult about referring it to the tribunal and

getting  them  to  confirm that you are indeed right,  that  the

Government  is indeed right?  But as I said, it is  not  for  us

here to decide.  I know Mr Simon Tay says that he now thinks the

Government's interpretation is right.  It may well be right.   I

do not know.  But I said, let us have a decision by the tribunal

which is competent to decide this question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister says, "Will Mr Jeyaretnam take the trouble to

read  the  opinion?"  I have not gone through it very  carefully

but  because  he picked out paragraph 8, he says Mr Jeyaretnam's

interpretation is wrong because if he is right,  it  would  mean

that the Government may not give car loans or computer loans  to

civil  servants.  Well, I was amazed to see that because I would

have  thought that provision would have been made in the  Budget

every  year.  Provision would have been made in the  Budget  for

car  loans in Ministries and Government offices, and the  Budget

would have been passed by Parliament and then assented to by the

President.  So there is parliamentary approval for loans to  its

officials to be made by the Government.  The provision has to be

made  in  the  Budget.  The money is not taken  from  any  other

assets  or  reserves,  for these car loans.   So  the  Attorney-General  is  clearly wrong on that.  It is so elementary  to  me

that  he  overlooks that that would have been  included  in  the

Budget.  And is the Minister ---

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee</b> rose ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, Prof. Ho wants to

clarify.  Do you want to give way?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I just want to ask Mr Jeyaretnam

two things.  First, whether he had also considered, not just the

route  through Article 100 of the Constitution, but  to  seek  a

declaration in the High Court as to the constitutionality of the

Executive action, which is what the Ministry of Law alluded to - unless we have to spell it out specifically.  But we said



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>



he  was  free to do so.  We know the interpretation  of  Article

100.  But there is this other route.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point of clarification is the loans. I would

suggest he takes time to read the whole opinion of the AG before

he  talks  about  Parliament giving blanket  approval  to  grant

loans.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Well, I will do. But that does not

necessarily mean because the Attorney-General gives his opinion,

and  to  you, it is crystal clear, or to the Government,  it  is

crystal  clear,  that the Attorney-General is  right,  with  due

respect  to the Attorney-General.  May I just answer this  point

on  which  clarification was sought.  Of  course,  the  Workers'

Party can ask for a declaration by way of an action in the  High

Court.   But  there  is already provision in  the  Constitution,

there  is  this  machinery set up.  There is  a  tribunal.   Why

should we be asked to go by an ordinary action in the High Court

when  it is the tribunal which has been invested with the powers

to   determine  any  opinion  as  to  what  an  Article  in  the

Constitution  means?  I do not quite understand  the  suggestion

that  you can go that way, you can go this way when already  the

way  has  been provided for you.  There is one way set  out  for

you.  [Interruption by Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee.]  Whether it is

the Workers' Party or not, would the Government concede, please,

for  the last time that this is a matter of public concern?  The

public wants to know whether in agreeing to give $8 billion loan

to  Indonesia, the Government acted under the Constitution.   Is

it  a  matter  for the public, for the taxpayers?   Or  are  you

saying it is only a matter for the Workers' Party?  The Workers'

Party  tries to represent the people.  It does not act as though

it is a law unto itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is this. He says that the AG is not a

member of the Executive, if I have understood him correctly.  He

says he is the chief legal advisor.  Does that mean he is not  a

member of the Executive?  He can be a legal advisor but does  it

not mean he is a member of the Executive?  What is he?  A member

of  the Judiciary?  Or is he a member of this Parliament?  He is

a member of the Executive.  He is the chief legal advisor.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touches on the decision of the Privy Council and, if I

understood  him  correctly, he says the  Privy  Council  has  no

jurisdiction  to examine convictions.  I am surprised  that  the

Minister of State makes the same mistake that has been made over

and over again by others.  Is the Minister ---

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, can I just

clarify  on this point?  Like I said, first, the case  has  been

fully  ventilated  in the press, exchange of  letters,  in  this

House, and the Government's position has remained consistent all

this time.  As regards the comments made by the Privy Council in

relation to Mr Jeyaretnam's criminal convictions, these comments

are  not binding on the Government because the Privy Council was

not  seized of the matter, ie, criminal convictions,  they  were

examining Mr Jeyaretnam's appeal against his debarment.  And the

Privy  Council, in its judgement, said as such that the comments

could  not overturn the criminal convictions.  And in fact,  the

position  taken by the Government was also backed up by comments

of  an English judge, Justice Brooke, who agreed with the points

made  by  the  Government.  So it is not just a  matter  of  the

Government  or the AG making these points, but even  an  outside

person.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Again, may I say I am surprised at what I

have heard.  Perhaps, I should say, first of all, what was

before the Privy Council was not the order of convictions made

by the criminal court.  What was before the Privy Council was

the order of the High Court disbarring me from practice as a

lawyer.  So that was what they were hearing.  And as they

themselves observed, they had the power to set aside that order

and they set aside that order.  They had the jurisdiction and I

am sure the Minister of State for Law must know this.  That even

before that decision, there was a High Court decision in

Singapore which said that the court listening to a disciplinary

proceeding against a lawyer can, in proper cases, go behind the

convictions.  So that was established as the law.  And the Privy

Council said, "Of course, that is the law.  In proper cases, we

can go behind the convictions."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>



So   they  had  the  jurisdiction  and  they  went  behind   the

convictions,  acting perfectly within their  jurisdiction.   But

they said, "Unfortunately for this man here (I was there at that

time)   we   cannot  set  aside  the  convictions  because   the

convictions are not before us."  But that does not make  it  any

less a decision of the Privy Council on those convictions.  They

were  saying the convictions were all wrong.  And that  was  the

reason for setting aside the order.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad the Minister has now referred to this judgement

of  Justice Brooke.  Justice Brooke is just an ordinary judge of

the  High  Court of England.  He does not rank above  the  Privy

Council and he is being quoted out of context by the PAP leaders

time  and time again.  He was not saying that the Privy  Council

was  wrong in saying that the convictions were wrong.   What  he

was affirming again was that the convictions were not before the

Privy  Council  and,  since  it had  not  been  set  aside,  the

convictions still remained.  Of course, that is true.   But  the

Privy Council itself said that they hoped - they did not say  in

so  many words - that the President would do something about it.

But the President of course refused to do anything about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I just deal with Mr Jayakumar's reply. He was

not replying to me but he was replying to Mr Simon Tay.  He says

that  when the Government amends the law following any  decision

by  the  court,  it is not meant to show any disrespect  to  the

court.  May I remind him whether he has forgotten that after the

decision  by the Privy Council, immediately the first thing  the

Government did was to pass a law abolishing all appeals  to  the

Privy  Council  from lawyers who have been found guilty  or  who

have  been disbarred, preventing them from taking it up  to  the

Privy  Council.   Is  that not a decision taken  in  pique  just

because  the  Privy Council had the temerity to comment  on  the

decision?  Equally, was that not the reason for the decision  to

exclude  the courts from inquiring into the merits of  detention

under  the Internal Security Act taken out of pique because  the

Court of Appeal had said the courts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



can  enquire  into  the merits?  The Court of  Appeal  was  only

following   what  had  been  established  in   so   many   other

jurisdictions that the freedom of a subject is so vital that the

courts  have to determine and remain the final judges on whether

the  imprisonment or detention is illegal.  They  overruled  the

1942  decision  taken  in  the war time  that  it  was  for  the

Executive   to  decide  that.   But  of  course  the   Singapore

Government  could not accept all that.  So the immediate  answer

was `out with all appeals'.  We will be our own masters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I regret that no attempt has really been

made  to grasp the point that I was making.  Instead of that,  a

lot  of irrelevant statements were made.  The point that  I  was

making  is simply this.  It is not that the Attorney-General  is

wrong and that we are right, but the point that I was making is:

was the Government seen and manifestly seen to have acted within

the  terms  of  the Constitution and that could only  have  been

demonstrated  if the decision had been referred to the  tribunal

and  the  tribunal had said, "Yes.  Of course, in our view,  the

Government has acted within the law."  That is all I was asking.

What  is  the great reluctance on the part of the Government  to

refer the merit to the tribunal?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and negatived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion accordingly negatived.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> All right.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> This time on Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the last motion was a plea that the

Executive should allow the courts to fulfill their role given to

them  under  the Constitution.  In this motion, I  am  making  a

similar  plea  for Parliament.  I am asking this  House  to  say

that  Parliament  should  be allowed its  full  role  under  the

division of powers that we accepted, and that Parliament  should

not  be bypassed, in anything, with the Executive taking all the

decisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, Parliament under a parliamentary

democracy  is supreme.  The government of the day is accountable

to  Parliament  and the government acts under and in  accordance

with  laws passed by Parliament, with the Judiciary acting as  a

watchdog  to  see  that  the Executive does  act  under  and  in

accordance with the laws passed by Parliament, that there is  no

deviation.   I  think  I said this in my first  speech  in  this

House.   This  is the House of the people.  This  is  where  the

people expect their views and grievances to be heard and  to  be

given effect.  So it is a matter for regret that this Government

does not allow Parliament its role and functions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of things why I say this. For one

thing,  sittings  of  Parliament.  I  do  not  know,  Mr  Deputy

Speaker, Sir, why it is not possible for Parliament to sit  more

often.   Parliament  should  not be summoned  just  because  the

Government  has got Bills to pass.  The efficiency of Parliament

is not to be measured by the number of Bills that it has passed.

The  efficiency  of  Parliament is to  be  measured  by  how  it

controls   the  Executive.   That  is  how  the  efficiency   of

Parliament  will be measured and judged.  But  we  do  not  have

enough sittings of Parliament, with the result that Members send

in  Questions and they cannot all be heard within the  one  hour

allotted for Question Time.  I think there is an urgent need for

extending that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was the other obvious ignorance of Parliament,

that  although Parliament had been elected on 2nd  January  last

year, no attempt was made to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>



convene  Parliament until the end of May 1997, and the Executive

chose  to  govern  without Parliament  for  nearly  six  months,

without having Parliament overlook its governance of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to raise the question as to why the Budget could

not  have  been presented in March, but Mr Speaker overruled  me

saying  that my question was not admissible.  I do not know  why

it was not admissible but anyway that is not what I am raising.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is an urgent need in Singapore if we are to

live   up   to   all  our  professions  of  being   transparent,

accountability,   honest   government   and   all   that,   that

Parliament's role be strengthened and recognised.  I think there

is  an urgent need for more sittings of Parliament.  There is an

urgent need for Question Time to be extended.  And there is also

another  need  that  Questions addressed to the  Prime  Minister

should be answered by the Prime Minister.  In other Parliaments,

one  or  two days of the sittings every week are set  aside  for

Questions to the Prime Minister and he has to attend to  answer.

But  here  the Prime Minister would seem to ignore Questions  to

him.   I have asked two or three Questions of the Prime Minister

and they were always answered by somebody else.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is a need for us, if Parliament is to be the

watchdog,  to  set  up departmental committees  with  powers  to

summon  civil  servants and Ministers to explain  any  decisions

taken  by  the  Government on any matter.  I know  we  have  got

Government Parliamentary Committees, but they do not serve  that

purpose.  I have in mind committees, as they have in the  United

Kingdom and in other countries and in the US Congress, with real

powers  to  question and to summon witnesses  before  them,  the

Executive that is.  Of course, these committees should  comprise

not  only Government Members but more so the Opposition  Members

of  Parliament,  because  it  is  the  role  of  the  Opposition

particularly to act as the watchdog for the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two instances which would highlight what I have

been trying to say.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>



On   7th  October  1997,  I  raised a Question  with  the  Prime

Minister for Written Answer whether he would disclose the  names

of  all public officers who had bought properties in Nassim Jade

and  Scotts  28.  And I had a written answer from  him  to  say,

"There  is  no  impropriety.  We are not going to  disclose  the

names  of public officers who bought these properties." I  tried

to tell him that it is not a question of any impropriety.  It is

a  question  of Parliament being told who are the  other  public

officers  who  had  bought these properties at  discounts.   The

Prime  Minister  refused  to  budge  and  said,  "There  is   no

impropriety.   I  am  not going to tell you who  are  the  other

public officers."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should Parliament be bypassed? Why should Parliament

not be told?  Public officers are accountable and they should be

seen to be acting perfectly within the law in anything they  do,

even if it is a private purchase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was the other Question that I raised with the

Minister for Home Affairs, and this was on the retirement of the

Senior  Assistant  Commissioner of Police, Ong  Seng  Chye.   My

understanding   was   that  this  officer   had   been   retired

prematurely, that he was retired in the public interest.   So  I

raised a Question with the Minister for Home Affairs whether  he

would  inform Parliament of the circumstances under  which  this

very  high  officer  in the Police Force, ie,  Senior  Assistant

Commissioner of Police, was retired.  And the answer  came,  "We

don't discuss retirement of public officers."  Should Parliament

not have a right to know why such a senior officer in the Police

Force,   the Senior Assistant Commissioner, had been retired  in

the  public interest?  What had he done that required him to  be

compulsorily retired?  These are matters in which Parliament has

a  direct interest and an attempt to shut out information on all

these  matters  from  Parliament is  to  minimise  the  role  of

Parliament  and to refuse Parliament to play its  full  role  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know how many millions of

dollars are being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>



spent  in  building a new Parliament House, a  grand  Parliament

House.  May I repeat, a grand Parliament House does not make for

an  effective  role for Parliament to fulfill its functions.   A

Parliament  that  does play its part, its rightful  part,  is  a

Parliament that is given all the opportunities to play its  part

and  to fulfill its role as the guardian of the liberties of the

people  and as a watchdog on the Executive.  So my plea is  that

it  is  time that a Committee be set up to consider the revision

of  Standing  Orders of Parliament to see how Parliament's  role

can  be  strengthened and given more power, to  examine  whether

departmental  committees should be set  up.   We  will  then  be

showing  the  people that we are quite serious in  the  role  of

Parliament   as  their  House,  guardians  of  their  liberties,

guardians of their rights, and not simply a Parliament  that  is

here to pass laws proposed by the Executive.  That is all I have

to say, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the Member makes, first of

all,  similar  points.  The point about the loan, I  think,  has

been covered in my reply.  In fact, the point is covered in  the

Attorney-General's opinion as to why there was no need  to  come

to  this House to get Parliament's approval.  That is the  first

point that he makes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he asked whether we should in any case come to

Parliament  to  discuss other matters.   I  think  the  role  of

Parliament is prescribed in the Constitution and in the Standing

Orders  and  it has been fulfilling this role for  a  long  time

effectively.   Parliament has functioned  very  well  in  making

laws, in enabling Members to come to this House to ask searching

questions where Ministers will give answers.  Mr Jeyaretnam, now

that  he  is an NCMP, has asked for an enlarged role for himself

and  for  Parliament.  But the point is that Parliament has  got

procedures  that have worked well.  Again, it is just  like  his

other  point about asking  Government to bring the matter before

the constitutional court.  The Government has good reason not to

do  it.   Government discloses the reason and we  stand  by  the

reason. So he asks questions as to why we do not meet more often

or  why  the Prime Minister does not answer questions.  I  think

these are questions which the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>



Leader  of the House and the Prime Minister will have to decide.

Parliament  will  meet when there are matters to  be  discussed,

when  there are Bills to be passed, laws to be made,  and topics

to be discussed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On matters that the law does not require Parliament's

approval,  it  is  a  matter  of  judgment  whether  or  not   a

parliamentary session should be held to discuss the matter, just

like  the loan to Indonesia.  As I have explained just now, time

was of the essence.  Therefore, this matter was not discussed in

the  House.   So  the  Executive must have the  prerogative  and

exercise  its judgment wisely, unless, of course,   required  by

law.   The  law  does set out certain requirements  as  to  when

Parliament  must  meet  and  what matters  must  be  put  before

Parliament.  For the rest, we have to look at practice, we  have

to look at what has worked well for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for accountability to the public, yes, of course. In

fact,  we  have  many Committees already set up  in  Parliament.

There  are  Select  Committees to  discuss  specific  Bills  and

Committees  such  as  the  Estimates Committee  and  the  Public

Accounts Committee to discuss expenditure and financial matters.

So  there is already in place a system where those matters which

are  within the purview of Parliament to check on the Executive,

they are in place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific motion says, "Bypassing of Parliament". We

have talked just now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>



about the doctrine of separation of powers where there is a role

for  the  Executive, a role for Parliament and a  role  for  the

Judiciary.   So each organ has a role to play.   So my  response

to  Mr  Jeyaretnam  is  that  the  Executive  is  not  bypassing

Parliament.   Just like my response just now, the  Executive  is

not  showing  disrespect to the Judiciary  by  not  putting  the

matter before the constitutional court, as asked by the Workers'

Party,  my  response now will be the Executive is not  bypassing

Parliament.  Matters which require parliamentary approval,  yes,

we  will  seek  it.  Matters which do not, it  is  a  matter  of

judgment  on the part of the Executive whether that matter  will

be  brought  to  Parliament.   Rest assured,  please,  that  the

Government  observes the Constitution, Government  observes  the

laws and procedures in carrying out its functions.  In any case,

as  I  have  mentioned  just now, Government  accountability  is

captured in a poignant form during Question Time.  Question Time

is  one hour every time we meet.  I think matters are dealt with

and  questions are answered.  There are other matters which must

be dealt with.  Therefore, we should not lengthen Question Time.

That  is all I want to say.  Sir, it is really a repeat  of  the

earlier motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Inderjit Singh</b> asked the Minister for Finance to

inform the House (i) what led to the closure of Micropolis  just

under 2 years after Singapore Technologies acquired the company;

(ii)  what  went wrong in the process of the acquisition;  (iii)

how  much money was lost from the acquisition to the closure  of

the  company;  and (iv) where did the money for investment  come

from.



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>



<br><br><i>(i) What led to the closure of Micropolis just under 2 years after Singapore Technologies acquired the company?</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Technologies saw opportunities in the hard disk

drive business of Micropolis and decided to buy over Micropolis'

worldwide  HDD  business  in April 1996.    The  new  Micropolis

management, which led the acquisition, had expected to turn  the

company around from its previous losses and re-establish it as a

profitable high-end disk-drive manufacturer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following its acquisition by Singapore Technologies in

1996,  Micropolis refocused its range of product  offerings  and

changed  its  market  strategy to focus on  the  OEM   (Original

Equipment  Manufacturing)  market.   With  the  phasing  out  of

obsolete products, and the launching of new products, Micropolis

managed  to  secure several new OEM customers.  Micropolis  also

continued to reduce operating losses throughout 1996, and turned

in a profit for the month of December 1996.  Therefore, although

total  operating  losses  amounted  to  S$76  million  in  1996,

Micropolis  was  actually  showing gradual  improvement  in  its

performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the high-end disk drive industry took a dramatic

turn  in  1997,  with  the  aggressive entry  of  several  major

players.   As  most  of  you may know  from  the  various  press

reports,  there was severe over-capacity in 1997 as a result  of

simultaneous  investments by existing  and  new  players.   This

resulted  in over-supply and intense price competition.   Prices

were  dropping at  16% to 18% each quarter in 1997, some 3 times

the  normal  rate  of  5% to 6% price erosion  each  quarter  as

manufacturers  competed  for market  share.   Industry  analysts

believed  that  the disk drive industry is in the  throes  of  a

major adjustment stretching into 1998.  The leading players have

either sounded alarm over their earnings prospects or have taken

steps to consolidate their operations, including closing plants,

laying off workers or delaying new investments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout 1997, Micropolis' operating losses mounted, as

sales  continued  to fall below projections and product  margins

were eroded faster than expected.  There was excess inventory in

the  market.   Micropolis was unable to turn  around  with  1997

operating  losses progressively worsening in the first  half  of

1997.   By  mid  1997, Micropolis was already exploring  various

alternatives  for  partnerships or  mergers  with  other  market

leaders  but  without success.  Prospects for recovery  worsened

considerably   with   the  sharp  change  in   the   competitive

environment as 1997 progressed.   By October 1997, the operating

loss  for  the year had  reached S$200 million.  Having reviewed

the company's business performance, resources and prospects, the

Micropolis  Board of Directors was left with no  choice  but  to

wind up the business.



<br><br><i>(ii) What went wrong in the process of the acquisition?</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to accept that risk-taking is part and parcel of

all  investment  decisions.  In acquiring Micropolis,  Singapore

Technologies had believed that the new management could turn the

company  around by focusing on the high end niche  market  which

had been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>



a  profitable  industry segment. Singapore Technologies  carried

out a four month due diligence with its external consultants  on

the  investment before the acquisition.  As it turned  out,  the

severe over-capacity in the high-end disk drive market which was

not  anticipated by Singapore Technologies was the  main  reason

which made this investment a loss-making venture.



<br><br><i>(iii) How much money was lost from the acquisition to the closure of the company?</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company is under liquidation. This means that the

financial  affairs  of  Micropolis  are  now  independently  and

professionally managed by experienced liquidators from reputable

international  firms.  They will determine how best  to  recover

and  dispose  of  the assets of the company in  the  process  of

liquidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the Statement of Affairs lodged by the Liquidators

of  Micropolis  in  December  1997,  Micropolis  does  not  have

sufficient  realisable  assets  to  fully  repay  the  unsecured

creditors, including ST.   Recovery expectation is about 10%  of

the debts claimed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ST has S$80 million as equity in Micropolis, plus loans

totalling  S$550  million.  Part of the loans were  provided  in

1996  to  fund  working  capital and  production  equipment  for

Micropolis.  As Micropolis managed to improve its bottomline  in

1996,  and  turn  in  a profit by December, further  loans  were

extended  by  ST  in  1997  for additional  working  capital  to

increase production capacity for key OEM accounts, and  to  fund

R&D for new products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus total losses to ST are expected to be the S$80 million

equity plus some 90% of the outstanding loans.



<br><br><i>(iv) Where did the money for the investment come from?</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Technologies had funded this investment through

its own internal funds and external commercial borrowings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government did not provide Singapore Technologies with

any  direct  funding  whether through loan or  equity  for  this

particular investment.  However, as Singapore Technologies is  a

100% government-owned company, this investment loss would result

in a dimunition of Government's assets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial services industry is in ferment worldwide.

The driving forces are information technology and globalisation.

Financial institutions are merging and restructuring,  in  order

to  derive  growing economies of scale and serve customers  more

efficiently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible to insulate our domestic banks from these

larger trends. The smallness and openness of our domestic market

makes  us  even  more  susceptible to  them.   By  international

standards,  our local banks are quite small. They need  to  grow

large  enough to have the economies of scale, the mass and reach

to  offer efficient, high quality services to Singaporeans,  and

to become significant regional players.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bank mergers are one way to achieve this, provided the

mergers   are  followed  through  and  the  previously  separate

businesses are properly integrated and rationalised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has publicly encouraged the local

banks  to  consider mergers. The driving forces in the  industry

give  them  strong incentive to do this, even without Government

persuasion.  Keppel  Bank and Tat Lee Bank have  just  announced

their  intention to merge.  The Government will study what  more

it can do to encourage the banks in this direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also informed the local banks that if they wish to

bring  in  foreign minority partners to support  a  strategy  of

growth, and to bring in expertise and technology, the government

will be supportive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS has no immediate plan to raise the foreign shareholding

ceilings.  But  the  matter will be studied, together  with  all

other  aspects of the Government's policy towards the  financial

sector, as part of the review of the sector now underway.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Minister for Law if he will

consider setting up a committee to review the Penal Code  so  as

to meet the present-day needs of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Penal Code Review Committee under the auspices of the

Attorney-General's Chambers has been working on a  major  review

of  the  Penal Code.  The Penal Code Review Committee is in  the

process   of   finalising  its  recommendations   to   introduce

amendments  to the Penal Code to meet the present-day  needs  of

Singapore.

<div align="center"><b>CONTRIBUTIONS TO INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs

(i)  what  are  the amounts that Singapore grants  as  voluntary

contributions  to  international  organisations,  in  particular

those  within the UN structure; and (ii) if such amounts are  in

keeping  with Singapore's economic development and international

standing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore makes voluntary contributions to ten

International Organisations (IOs) which are of importance to us.

Four  of  these IOs are in the UN system, and another three  are

Commonwealth-related   organisations.   In   1997,   Singapore's

contributions  made  by MFA to these organisations  amounted  to

about $600,000.  Of this amount, $450,000 was contributed to the

IOs  within  the UN structure.  Most of these contributions  are

annual payments of long-running programmes (seven out of the ten

are long-term obligations) as opposed to ad hoc contributions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to our voluntary contributions to the UN, we

have  various obligations to other international bodies as well.

For  example,  as a member of ASEAN, we will be contributing  to

the  ASEAN Foundation.  We have also made contributions  to  the

International Committee of the Red Cross.  Singapore is a  small

country.  Our voluntary contributions to IOs are consistent with

our  stature  as  a small advanced developing  economy  and  our

international standing.

<div align="center"><b>DEMOLITION OF COLONIAL BUNGALOWS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Information

and the Arts whether he will stop the demolishing of the cluster

of  black and white colonial bungalows in the Sembawang area  at

Ratus/Kloof  Road neighbourhood and declare those houses  to  be

heritage buildings and earmark them for preservation.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black-and-white bungalows are part of our nation's

architectural  heritage and some of the better  ones  should  be

conserved. The Urban Redevelopment Authority has a programme for

the conservation of our nation's built heritage based on certain

conservation criteria.  URA has already gazetted 19 of the  best

representatives   of   the   black-and-white    bungalows    for

conservation under the Planning Act administered by the Ministry

of  National  Development.  URA is of the view that  it  is  not

necessary  for  the  bungalows  at  Ratus/Kloof  Roads   to   be

conserved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a building to be gazetted for preservation as a

national  monument  under  the  Preservation  of  Monuments  Act

administered  by  MITA,  it must have outstanding  national  and

historical  importance  based  on  criteria  drawn  up  by   the

Preservation  of Monuments Board.  The bungalows  at  Ratus  and

Kloof  Roads  are  not  of  sufficient  merit  to  qualify   for

preservation as national monuments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government already allows BBC World Service radio, a

foreign station, to broadcast in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Broadcasting Authority (SBA) is currently

looking into the licensing of 2-3 more new radio channels.   SBA

is  prepared  to  consider giving a licence to a  foreign  radio

station  if  it  can  offer  services  that  are  of  value   to

Singapore's development as a business and information hub.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, taxi stands are provided in HDB town centres,

outside  MRT stations and at shopping centres in the HDB estates

where there is high demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxi stands have not been set up in other parts of HDB

estates because they have not been popular.  Demand for taxis in

HDB  estates is fairly evenly distributed throughout the estate.

It  is not practical to require passengers to wait only at  taxi

stands for taxis, whereas they could now flag down a taxi  right

at their door step.

<div align="center"><b>CERTIFICATES OF ENTITLEMENT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for

Communications (a) whether the relatively higher price of  other

categories of Certificates of Entitlement (COE), as compared  to

the  price of the COE for 1,601 cc to 2,000 cc cars, was due  to

an  imbalance  of  distribution of COEs; and (b)  how  does  the

Government fix and allocate the number of COEs to each category.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COEs are allocated at the start of each quota year

beginning in May.  The total COE quota for a year is the  number

of  vehicles deregistered in the previous year, plus  additional

COEs to allow for a 3% growth in the vehicle population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25% of the COEs from deregistered vehicles are allocated to

the  Open Category.  The other 75% are distributed to other  COE

categories, in proportion to the vehicles deregistered  in  each

category.   The  additional COEs to cater to the 3%  growth  are

distributed according to the vehicle mix as at the  end  of  the

previous year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supply of COEs in each category is therefore fixed at

the  beginning of each quota year in May.  Both the  supply  and

the  distribution of COEs by vehicle categories  are  publicised

well  ahead of the bidding exercises to allow prospective buyers

to make informed decisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As supply in each COE category is fixed, it is the demand

for  the  month which will fix the COE price.  The exceptionally

low price of COE for 1,601 cc to 2,000 cc cars (Category 3 COEs)

in the December 1997 tender exercise was not due to an imbalance

of distribution of COEs but a lack of demand for Category 3 COEs

for  that month.  In the January 1998 tender, the price  of  the

Category 3 COE went up to $43,880, with demand exceeding  supply

by more than 1000%.

<div align="center"><b>COST OF OIL SPILL CLEAN-UP OPERATION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  (a)  whether  the total  cost  of  the  clean-up

operation  and other claims arising out of the oil spill  caused

by  the  collision of the oil tankers Orapin Global and  Evoikos

has  been  ascertained; and (b) how much  of  the  cost  can  be

claimed under the Civil Liability Convention 1969 and from other

organisations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Evoikos oil spill occurred in October 1997, some

industry  estimates for oil spill compensation claims  ran  into

the  hundreds of millions of dollars.  Fortunately, swift action

by  the  Maritime  and Port Authority (MPA) and  other  agencies

averted  an  environmental  and  ecological  disaster.   Crucial

facilities  such as power stations and oil refineries functioned

normally,  and  the  beaches  at Sentosa  and  East  Coast  were

unaffected.   As  a  result, potential  compensation  claims  by

Singapore  authorities in respect of the resources mobilised  to

combat   the  pollution  and  measures  taken  to  restore   the

environment   have  been  greatly  reduced.   The  claims   will

basically  be for the clean-up costs.  This is estimated  to  be

within  the  limit  which Singapore can claim  under  the  Civil

Liability  Convention 1969.  We are confident  that  the  claims

will be met in full.

<div align="center"><b>LAKEVIEW MARKET</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  that in view of the intention of  his  Ministry  to

demolish  the Lakeview Market at Upper Thomson Road, whether  he

would   consider  the  following  measures  to   alleviate   the

difficulties  being faced by the affected hawkers,  stallholders

and  shopkeepers: (i) to consider higher compensation  sums  for

them;  (ii)  to consider larger compensation sums  for  hawkers,

stallholders and shopkeepers who hold more than one  unit  space

for   their   tenancies;  (iii)  for  those  affected   hawkers,

stallholders and shopkeepers who sign to accept the compensation

sums  as  first  generation holders of the tenancies,  to  allow

their  estates/dependants to receive the compensations, even  if

they  were to pass away before such compensations are being paid

after  their  demise; and (iv) to extend the eligibility  period

for  a  second year, in the event that the shopkeepers are still

unable   to  find  suitable  alternative  shops  based  on   the

preferential discount scheme of 10% within the initial one  year

period.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ex-gratia payment for HDB shop tenants affected by

relocation/redevelopment is $48,000.   In  the  case  of  market

produce  and  cooked food stall tenants, the ex-gratia  payments

are  $15,000  and $19,000  respectively.  HDB will not  increase

the  ex-gratia payments for tenants of Lakeview Shopping  Centre

as  the  levels of ex-gratia payments were recently  revised  in

June 1996.  The revised ex-gratia payments were made retroactive

for shop and stall tenants affected by the Government relocation

and redevelopment programmes on or after 1st March 1996.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ex-gratia payment is a goodwill gesture. For shop

tenants,  the  ex-gratia payment is granted  on  a  per  tenancy

basis.   Hence,  it does not depend on the trade,  size  of  the

premises  or  the equivalent number of unit space occupied.   In

the  case  of stalls, the current practice is to grant ex-gratia

payment to first generation stallholders  on a per stall  basis.

First  generation stallholders are those who were  resited  from

the  streets or were given the stalls under the hardship  scheme

years  ago.   A  stallholder with two stalls will be  given  ex-gratia  payment for both the stalls provided he is eligible  for

ex-gratia payment for both stalls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For affected hawkers, stallholders and shopkeepers who have

been served clearance notice and have accepted the offer of  the

ex-gratia payment while they were alive, but passed away  before

the  payment is made, his estate/dependants will receive the ex-gratia payment.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 10% preferential margin is granted for a period of one

year  from the date of relocation notice.  Since the tenants  in

Lakeview  Shopping Centre are required to vacate  the  shops  by

31st  December 1999, HDB will grant an extension of the validity

period for the 10% preferential margin in the second year  on  a

case by case basis.

<div align="center"><b>PLOT RATIO OF PROPERTIES NEAR MRT STATIONS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Minister for National

proposed MRT stations so as to maximise the land usage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the North-East MRT line was announced, some private

properties   near  the  proposed  stations  were   acquired   to

facilitate comprehensive redevelopment. This is to enable  these

lands  to  be developed to higher intensity so that more  people

can  benefit from living or working near the stations.  It  will

also  ensure  that  the North-East MRT line  would  become  more

economically viable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revisions to the land use plans for these lands will be

made known to the public when the studies are completed.

<br><br><!-- Mr J B Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr J B Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  what is the breakdown cost (showing all components)

per   unit  to  the  Housing  and  Development  Board  for   the

construction  of  the extra room in 3-room,  4-room  and  5-room

apartments in the upgrading programme for HDB apartments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost for the extra room or Space-Adding Item (SAI) does

not  vary very much with the different flat types. However, from

project  to project, the cost varies with the number of  storeys

in  the block, the design features, soil and site conditions and

other  construction  constraints. The  tender  prices  for  each

project depends on the prevailing market conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAI cost ranges from $15,600 to $31,150. The average

unit  cost  for the SAI based on recent tender prices  is  about

$21,000, with the average cost breakdown as follows:
