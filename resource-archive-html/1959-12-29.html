<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have received a message from His

Excellency  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara  dated  the

21st   December,  1959,  informing  me   that,   in

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>SOURCES OF WATER SUPPLY TO SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Estimated maximum and safe capacity)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr A. P. Rajah</b> asked the Prime Minister what

is  the  estimated  maximum and safe  capacity,  in

millions  of  gallons  per day,  of  the  following

sources of water supply to Singapore:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) MacRitchie Reservoir;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Peirce and Seletar Reservoirs;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Gunong Pulai and Pontian; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Tebrau River.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Sun Wing) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr

Speaker, for impounding reservoirs the maximum  and

safe  daily  capacity  is the average  quantity  of

water  that can be drawn off daily. One must  allow

for   the   available  storage  capacity   of   the

reservoirs,   dry  weather  conditions,   and   the

capacity  of  our treatment plants to  supply  good

quality  water.  The  maximum safe  capacity  of  a

reservoir  is therefore its safe yield which  takes

into account these considerations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated safe yields of our reservoirs are

as follows:

<pre>

           MacRitchie                 8 million gallons daily

           Peirce and Seletar        12 million gallons daily

           Gunong Pulai and Pontian  18 million gallons daily

           Tebrau River              30 million gallons daily

                                        during wet weather

                                              or

                                     15 million gallons daily

                                        during dry weather

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore draw an estimated total of 38

million gallons daily from our reservoirs. But  our

estimated average daily consumption is 62.5 million

gallons.  The  remaining 30 million gallons  during

good  climatic conditions is drawn daily  from  the

Tebrau  River  which goes direct  to  the  consumer

after treatment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>WATER SUPPLY FROM TEBRAU RIVER</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Capacity to supply additional quantity required for 1960)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr A. P. Rajah</b> asked the Prime Minister

whether the dry-weather flow in the Tebrau River is

capable  of  supplying the additional  quantity  of

water required for 1960.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Sun Wing) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr

Speaker,  the Tebrau River, because of the  absence

of  storage facilities, can give a safe yield of 15

million gallons a day during dry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>



weather.  It is therefore not capable of  supplying

the  additional quantity of water estimated  to  be

required  for next year. But our water supply  does

not  depend  on  Tebrau  during  dry  weather.  The

general water supply scheme is to draw off all  the

available  water from Tebrau during the wet  months

and  to  conserve as much water as possible in  the

impounding reservoirs against dry spells.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storage capacity of our reservoirs allows for

a  maximum  water bank of a total of 5,900  million

gallons.  The  break-down storage  figures  are  as

follows:-



<pre>

          MacRitchie                    1,038 million gallons

          Peirce and Seletar            1,073 million gallons

          Gunong Pulai and Pontian      3,789 million gallons

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned earlier, we draw a total of 38

million  gallons daily from these reservoirs  which

are replenished by rain-falls. The margin of safety

will  be  further increased when the Tebrau  water-works  output  is stepped up and the  Johore  River

scheme is completed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Can the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Prime  Minister give any indication as to when  the

Johore River scheme will be completed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> I require notice of that

question.

<div align="center"><b>LAND ON SINGAPORE ISLAND OWNED AND/OR OCCUPIED BY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>H. M. NAVY, ARMY AND AIR FORCE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Minister

for National Development what is the total area  of

land  on Singapore Island owned and/or occupied  by

Her Majesty's Navy, Army and Air Force.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, the total area of

land owned and occupied on Singapore Island by  the

British Armed Forces is about 22.6 square miles out

of a total of 209.5 square miles.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Inche Mohd. Ali.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member wishes to pursue the

subject, he has to ask a supplementary question.



<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff:</b> On the question put forward by

the  Member for Kampong Kembangan, I would like  to

add something to the statement made by the Minister

for National Development.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not possible. If the

Minister for National Development has not  given  a

complete answer, that is his own lookout.



<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff:</b> In that case. I will not pursue

the subject.

<div align="center"><b>GUARD AND ESCORT UNIT OF SINGAPORE POLICE FORCE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Personnel on permanent establishment)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Minister

for  Finance whether the personnel of the Guard and

Escort  Unit of the Singapore Police Force  are  on

the permanent establishment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, the answer is `Yes'.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): If the

answer  is  `Yes',  therefore, are  they  on  equal

status with the others?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, I do not

understand  the question put forward by the  Member

for Kampong Kembangan.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps the Member for Kampong

Kembangan  would  like to repeat his  supplementary

question.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali:</b> Mr Speaker, can I repeat the

question in English?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer to

my  question was `Yes'. Since the answer was `Yes',

I  would like to know whether the same treatment is

given  to  the Guard and Escort Unit  as  to  other

members of the Police Force.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Further notice of that question

is required.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary requires

notice  of that question. I have no doubt that  the

Member  will  give  the  requisite  notice  in  due

course.

<div align="center"><b>MALAY STANDARD VII QUALIFICATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Government policy re entry into Police Force, Customs, Immigration and Postal Departments)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Minister

for  Finance  what is the policy of the  Government

with regard to persons with Malay Standard VII  who

seek  entry  into  the Singapore Police  Force  and

Customs, Immigration and Postal Departments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (for the Minister for Finance):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the policy is to treat  persons

with  Malay Standard VII qualifications in the same

way   as   any   other   person   with   equivalent

qualifications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No distinction is made between those who seek

entry  into  the  Police, Customs, Immigration  and

Postal Departments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>ROMANISED SPELLING COMMITTEE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Singapore representation on)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Minister

for   Culture  whether  the  Government  will  seek

representation    on   the   "Romanised    Spelling

Committee"  formed  by  the  Governments   of   the

Federation of Malaya and the Republic of Indonesia.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Government   will   seek  representation   on   the

Romanised  Spelling Committee when it is  opportune

to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, there are two Malay members of

Radio  Singapore  sitting on the Committee  but  as

nominees  of  the  Federation  Government.  If  the

Member  is  interested in their names, one  is  Che

Buyong   Bin  Hadil  (Head  of  the  Malay  Schools

Section) and the other is Che Ramli Bin Abdul Hadi.

This,  to some extent, provides the necessary  link

between Singapore and the Federation Government and

Indonesia in this matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government could not have sought

representation in the Committee itself because  the

Committee  was set up as a result of  a  treaty  of

friendship  which was signed between the Federation

of  Malaya  and  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  and,

therefore, it was not possible for Singapore to ask

to be represented in this particular Committee. But

I  understand  that  this Committee  will  soon  be

dissolved - perhaps  within  the  next  one  or   two

months - and that a new Committee might be set up  in

which  case  we  shall certainly endeavour  to  get

representation in this new Committee.

<div align="center"><b>CITIZENS RENOUNCING CITIZENSHIP (Numbers)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Minister

for  Home  Affairs to state how many aliens  became

citizens of Singapore between 1st January and  15th

December,  1959, and how many citizens of Singapore

voluntarily  renounced their Singapore  citizenship

during the same period.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

assumed  that  by  "aliens",  the  hon.  Member  is

referring   to  non-Commonwealth  citizens.   9,608

persons were registered or naturalized as Singapore

citizens  under  sections  8,  9  and  15  of   the

Singapore  Citizenship Ordinance during the  period

in  question.  It is regretted, however,  that  the

information  asked  for in the first  part  of  the

question  is not readily available as the registers

of  citizens do not distinguish between aliens  and

the   other  categories  of  persons  eligible  for

registration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second part of the question,

335  persons voluntarily renounced their  Singapore

citizenship during the period in question.

<br><br>2.51 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):

Mr  Speaker,  I have the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's

recommendation that this Bill be proceeded with.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck):</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this Bill is intended to give legislative sanction for the expenditure of

additional  sums of money voted on by the  Assembly

during the course of this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure for 1959

were  approved by the last Assembly in 1958. It  is

obvious  that  some unforeseen or  new  expenditure

like  that  on  the National Loyalty  Week  or  the

expenditure  on  the  creation  of  the   two   new

Ministries  of  Culture  and  National  Development

would  require  to be incurred in addition  to  the

estimates  since it is not possible to  budget  for

all eventualities. Therefore, during the course  of

the  year,  the Government had occasion  to  submit

supplementary  estimates for the  approval  of  the

Assembly   to   meet  unforeseen  expenditure.   In

addition,  it  was also necessary for supplementary

estimates   to   provide  for   certain   financial

requirements  laid  down in the  Constitution.  For

instance, in Cmd. (New Series) No. 14 of  1959,  $4

million  was  provided to establish a Contingencies

Fund.  Then  in Cmd. (New Series) No. 34  of  1959,

$42.5 million was voted to create Advance Accounts.

In all, therefore, a total of $58,039,072 was voted

by  the Assembly as Supplementary Estimates in  the

Ordinary  Budget  and $3,808,590  as  Supplementary

Estimates in the Development Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, under section 97 (2) of the Singapore

(Constitution)   Order   in   Council,   1958,    a

Supplementary  Appropriation Bill containing  under

appropriate heads of expenditure, the sums of money

which  have  been approved by the Assembly  in  the

Supplementary   Estimates   for   1959   shall   be

introduced into the Assembly. The Bill lays out all

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>



amounts approved by the Assembly and arranged under

the   heads  of  expenditure  shown  in  the   1959

Estimates as amended. These sums have already  been

paid   out  of  the  Consolidated  Fund   and   the

Supplementary  Appropriation Bill merely  legalises

the position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

move, "That the Bill be now read the Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read the Third time and passed.

<br><br>2.53 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):

Mr  Speaker,  I have the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's

recommendation that this Bill be proceeded with.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck):</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to

move. "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Main Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure for public services during the year

1960  have  been  considered and  approved  by  the

Assembly  at  its  last sitting as Sessional  Paper

Cmd. No. 32 of 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now necessary to give legislative approval

to  the  expenditure  of the sums  shown  in  these

Estimates  and  the annual Appropriation  Bill  now

before Members is intended to so provide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 97 (1) of the Singapore

(Constitution)   Order   in   Council,   1958,   an

Appropriation  Bill  containing  under  appropriate

heads  of expenditure, the sums of money which  are

required  for  the several services  of  Government

shall



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>



be  introduced into the Assembly. The Appropriation

Bill  lays  out  all the amounts  approved  by  the

Assembly  in  the  Estimates  of  Expenditure   and

arranged  under the Heads of Expenditure  shown  on

page 31 of Cmd. No. 32 of 1959. These sums shall be

paid  out  of  the Consolidated Fund and  once  the

Appropriation Bill has been approved, the  Minister

for  Finance  will be empowered to  issue  warrants

authorising expenditure up to the amount under each

Head  in the Appropriation Bill to be paid  out  of

the Consolidated Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before I put the Question, perhaps I

may   draw   the  attention  of  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  to  page  1, line 12  of  the  Bill.  It

appears  to me that the word "thereto" should  read

"hereto".  If  the Parliamentary Secretary  agrees,

then   the   alteration  could   be   made   as   a

typographical emendation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> I agree, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The correction will be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read the Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><h4><div align="center"><b>STANDING ORDERS OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY</b></div></h4></div>



<br><br>2.56 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):

Mr Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that, with effect

from 1st January, 1960, the present Standing Orders

of this Assembly be revoked and the Standing Orders

contained  in  Appendix II to the Third  and  Final

Report   of   the  Standing  Orders  Committee   as

contained in Paper L.A. (New Series) 10 of 1959  be

made.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as Members of the House would have already been aware of, the Standing Orders

Committee  have  made  two Reports  and  amendments

which  have  already been accepted by the  Assembly

during  the past seven months. The Report  that  is

presented  today is the third and final  Report  of

the Standing Orders Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the space of seven months, a complete revision

has  been made of the Standing Orders according  to

the light of our experience and here at this point,

Mr Speaker, I must pay tribute to you yourself and

your  staff  for  the  intensive  perusal  of   the

Standing  Orders.  The  Standing  Orders  Committee

certainly   must   acknowledge   the   considerable

assistance  and  guidance you  have  given  to  the

Committee in making these revisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing Orders in any Parliament or Assembly are

essential. In Singapore, for that matter in Malaya,

the concept of parliamentary democracy is a new one

and  we  are  at the beginnings of nation  building

where  we try to introduce the idea that where  you

have  disagreements or disputes let them be  solved

by  negotiation and talk by the representatives  of

the  people in the Legislature. It is important for

us  therefore  to nurture not only the  concept  of

parliamentary democracy but also to see to it  that

the  forms of parliamentary democracy are observed,

otherwise the concept will become sour and the idea

of  parliamentary democracy will be nothing  but  a

mockery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing Orders are a guide for Members of the

House.  They are only a guide. Much more important,

there must be also a desire and a willingness among

Members to observe Standing Orders, otherwise  they

become pieces of paper and are ineffective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not everywhere that Parliaments or

Assemblies  are  as orderly as ours.  We  can  take

pride  that no ink-bottles, paper-weights or  other

missiles have yet been hurled in this House and  we

are  happy.  Sir,  that you, Mr Speaker,  yourself

have  maintained the dignity of the Chair. In other

countries,  the  role of the Speaker  is  not  only

arduous but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>



I  would  say  it  is also a dangerous  occupation.

Speakers and Deputy Speakers have been known to  be

mauled  and  manhandled  by parliamentarians,  very

much  like a referee in a football match.  We  give

you  our  assurance, Mr Speaker, that we  in  this

House  extend our co-operation to you  to  maintain

the   decorum,  dignity  and  order  befitting  the

Legislature  of the people and at some future  date

some  of  us who would have then retired  from  the

precincts  of  this  House  will  still  in   their

memories remember that Mr Speaker's "Order, order"

means "Please sit down."



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in rising to second the motion so ably presented by

the  Deputy Prime Minister, this side of the  House

would like to associate in everything he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>



has  said  with regard to the fine manner in  which

you  have  conducted this Assembly and the previous

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that, with effect

from 1st January, 1960, the present Standing Orders

of this Assembly be revoked and the Standing Orders

contained  in  Appendix II to the Third  and  Final

Report   of   the  Standing  Orders  Committee   as

contained in Paper L.A. (New Series) 10 of 1959  be

made.
