  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I, on behalf of all Members of this House, extend to you our congratulations on your re-election as Speaker. You are not new to this high office, having been first elected to it three days short of three years ago in 1989. Your re-election today signifies our continued confidence in you in the discharge of this onerous responsibility.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Seventh Parliament you have guided our proceedings most efficiently and ensured that order and decorum were observed in keeping with the dignity of this House. You have acted fairly and firmly to all Members regardless of whether he was a Minister, a Government Backbencher or an Opposition Member. You have ensured that Members did not stray from the agenda under discussion and that you did not hesitate to bring an errant Member back to his correct path. I am sure all the Members here will continue to give you our support and cooperation in the years ahead.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Lim Boon Heng who has contributed to the proceedings of this House as our Deputy Speaker. He now has other responsibilities and he will no doubt be taking part in the proceedings of this House in his new assignment as Senior Minister of State.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also privileged to have the continued services of Mr Abdullah Tarmugi as our Deputy Speaker when he is duly re-elected.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the older Members, I would like to welcome the 14 new Members into this House. We look forward to their maiden speeches and to their participation in the debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliamentary debate is serious business. What matters is the substance of what Members say, not how they can impress the viewers in the "Today in Parliament" programme. The Government is more interested in what Members say in helping to improve any aspect of its policies. We want to hear the constructive comments on how certain things can be done better. I can assure them that constructive views would be well received. We want to hear alternatives if they disagree with the present policies. But if their views are plainly wrong, they
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> must expect a strong encounter from the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act, Members are free to speak their minds. But let me remind them that they shall have to take responsibility for what they say.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had a clean record in the Seventh Parliament when no Member was taken before the Committee of Privileges. I hope Members will keep this record up and not require the Committee of Privileges to meet in the Eighth Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One final point, Sir. We now have four Opposition Members in this House, three of whom are from the same party, the SDP. For informal communication between me, as Leader of the House, and the Opposition, I propose to deal with Mr Chiam as the unofficial Leader of the Opposition. It is like the position in the Legislative Assembly in 1955 when the PAP won three out of four contested seats in the Legislative Assembly, and Mr Lee Kuan Yew was unofficially and de facto Leader of the Opposition. As its unofficial Opposition Leader, this House should give Mr Chiam due courtesy and precedence among Opposition MPs.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am happy to note that you have been unanimously re-elected as Speaker of this House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me and my two colleagues to join the Leader of the House and also, I believe, other Members of the House, in congratulating you on your re-election to this high office.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was fortunate to be a Member of this House in the last session of Parliament when you were also a Speaker. You are a very patient man and often your patience has been tested and you were never
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ruffled. I note also that you have got a good sense of humour which is most welcome in long and tedious sessions. Sir, I am confident that you will perform your duties impartially and fairly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am fortunate to be sitting in front and it is easy for me to catch your eye. But my other two colleagues have been placed at the back seats. I hope they can also catch your eye.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the recognition of me as the unofficial Leader of the Opposition. You can be assured, Sir, that I will certainly live up to a Leader of the Opposition, whether officially or unofficially. I think it is the duty, the way that I perform in Parliament and the keeping of my responsibility which are more important than a name which is attached to me.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you can be assured that the SDP Members will definitely be constructive. We are all here with a mission in nation-building and we shall certainly keep our record of nation-building and we hope for Singapore's further progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Bedok GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I join my colleagues in congratulating you on your re-election as Speaker of Parliament. Since your election as Speaker in 1989, you have guided this House fairly and with wit and wisdom. Your eyes are sharp and your timing very sharp. I am sure that under your leadership and shining example, this House will indeed benefit from your chairmanship.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to congratulate Mr Chiam See Tong on being appointed the unofficial Leader of the Opposition in this House.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the new Members of Parliament in this House, I can assure them that the Speaker, who now has little time to speak and, in fact, he cannot speak much in this House, did a very fine job when he was a Backbencher. We looked towards him when we were new in this House for guidance and if you go back and look through the Hansard, you will find that some of his speeches were very witty and humorous. And I am sure the Front Bench in this House were at times disturbed by some of the remarks that he made. We, on the Backbench, although we miss him, are also proud that he has been elevated to the Chair of Speaker. Congratulations.
  <br>

  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Braddell Heights)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to join the Leader of the House and the other Members to congratulate you on your re-election as the Speaker of this House for another term.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you have a very long experience as a Backbencher in the past years and you know that the Backbenchers have a responsibility to reflect the views of the members of the public and their electorate. Therefore, from my own experience over the past few years and in cooperating with you, I am quite sure that in the new session you will also give us a lot of opportunities to reflect our views. I also believe that you will be discharging your duties very fairly and impartially irrespective of whether he is a Government Backbencher or an Opposition Member. You will give every one of them equal opportunity to speak. And if a Member does not wish to speak, that is his own responsibility.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope and I believe that in the new session you will continue to be fair in maintaining the dignity, order and proper proceedings of this House, and that you will also help to conduct the substantial debate in this House.

  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I sincerely congratulate you on being elected as Speaker of the Eighth Parliament. I understand that you have been very fair at the last Parliament and I hope that you will be as fair as you have been and will not close ranks with PAP Members, as our Prime Minister has urged.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Honourable Members, first of all, I would like to thank all of you for having elected me Speaker of the Eighth Parliament. I would also like to thank the Leader of the House and the other Members for their kind and supportive words.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speakership is an office of high esteem and responsibility and it is an honour that you once again bestow on me by re-electing me to the Chair. That I was able to discharge my duties fully and responsibly in the Seventh Parliament is due in no small way to the cooperation which honourable Members extended to me.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together, we have shown to our people that even as we argue and debate, scrutinize and criticize, probe and query, we do so in an orderly manner that befits the honour and dignity of this distinguished House. This is the way it must be, always, so that our people continue to have faith in us. I therefore look forward to the continued cooperation of honourable Members in this new Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us are bound by the Standing Orders, a set of rules that might appear cumbersome at times, but has passed the test of time in ensuring the orderly conduct of our proceedings. I would advise all Members to be familiar with them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be free to speak your minds and let your conscience be your guide, but remember that at all times we should never abuse the privileges accorded to us as Members of Parliament. To do so would be to undermine the confidence that our
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> people have placed in this high institution. I therefore urge each and every one of you to uphold the rules, dignity and decorum of the House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to extend a warm welcome to the new Members. There are 14 of them and I look forward to hearing their speeches. A piece of friendly advice to them. Remember that not all of us are born orators and a good speech is not necessarily a long speech. All of you have the right to speak but do follow my advice, otherwise you might not understand why you have difficulty catching the Speaker's eye! For sure it is not where you sit that counts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the Speaker's most potent weapon in this House is the "guillotine" which comes down on a Member who has exceeded the time permitted for making a speech. The "guillotine" when inflicted on you is sharp and swift, and I have noticed in the past the devastating effects it has had on a Member when it falls on him in mid-sentence. So time your speeches well as I will be regulating the proceedings of the House with clock-work precision, a field I am somewhat familiar with.

   <h4>PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS</h4>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The President (Mr Wee Kim Wee):</b> Honourable Members:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Next Lap sets out what we want Singapore to be in the next generation. My 2Government will translate these long term goals into immediate programmes, so that Singaporeans will be better off by the end of this term of Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standards of living have risen rapidly in Singapore. Jobs have been plentiful. Nearly everyone owns his own home, complete with telephone and television. CPF and POSB savings have gone up. Standards of health care have risen. More students are making it through secondary schools, and into polytechnics and universities. All this has been achieved because sound government policies have created a framework for sustained growth, and enabled Singaporeans to progress and prosper.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we are only half way up to becoming a developed country. The
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> more difficult half remains ahead of us. We can only get there as one united nation. Singaporeans naturally compete to do well individually and get ahead. But we must also work together to succeed as a group, and to strengthen the bonds among us. We must encourage the more able to do their best for themselves and for Singapore. But the more able also need to show concern for the others and help them to catch up. We should level up to progress, not level down to stagnate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will play an essential role. It will reward drive and enterprise, and give each Singaporean the incentive to excel. It will invest heavily in education and human resources, so that each one can acquire the right knowledge and skills, be self-reliant, and earn more. The Government will also help to build up the assets of Singaporeans by upgrading and increasing the value of their HDB homes. This will give every citizen a share of the wealth we have created together, and strengthen his stake in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while the Government will subsidise investments like education and infrastructure, it will not subsidise consumption expenditure. To do so is to undermine the traditional virtues of thrift, personal responsibility and the will to achieve, and to weaken our economy. The experience of other countries has proved this again and again.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Education</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is the foundation of competitiveness. It is not a one-off exercise, but a lifelong process, as we acquire new knowledge and skills to keep up with new technology and adapt to economic changes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School results have steadily improved as we raised teaching standards and refined the education system. Demand for higher education has increased. The Institute of Technical Education will be formed this year, to train not only fresh school leavers, but older workers who
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> want to upgrade their skills and their jobs. A fourth polytechnic will be set up this year. NUS and NTU have increased their intakes, and will expand further as more qualified students graduate from schools. The Singapore Open University will admit students starting this year, to give adults who missed out on a tertiary education a second chance to work for university degrees.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is an investment in our people. We must invest more in our most promising students, while looking after the needs of the less able. In schools, we need to give parents a wider range of choices, so that their children can receive the education best tailored to their individual needs. This is the rationale for the independent schools and the Edusave scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to develop the independent schools into outstanding institutions, to give the most promising and able students an education matching their promise. Admission to these schools must be based principally on merit, not ability to pay. No bright child from a poor home need lose his chance to study in an independent school. There will be scholarships and bursaries for him. Attention paid to independent schools will not be at the expense of the other schools. Instead the other schools will benefit from ideas tested out successfully in the independent schools. By demonstrating what is possible, the independent schools will help other schools to raise standards.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will widen the Edusave scheme to achieve these objectives. It had previously announced that every year the scheme will contribute a sum to the Edusave account of each individual student. In addition, Edusave will now fund two types of scholarships. One scholarship will be for top pupils going to independent schools. They will be chosen based on academic merit, from among the best students in the country, regardless of family background. One quarter of the pupils in independent schools will receive such scholarships, which will cover the school fees.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second type of scholarship will be for students going to non-independent secondary schools. This scholarship can be awarded on a constituency or school basis, through grassroots organisations and school advisory or management committees. In this way good students in many schools, and not just the outstanding students in independent schools, will be recognised and encouraged to put in their best efforts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides awarding scholarships, Edusave will also make annual grants to government and government-aided secondary schools. The schools will have discretion to use these grants, for example to hire extra specialist staff, for additional equipment like computers, or for bursaries to help needy students. They can be equipped more like independent schools.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fund these new schemes, the annual Edusave contribution to individual accounts will be correspondingly reduced.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Housing</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly every Singaporean now owns the home he lives in. The Government will refurbish and upgrade the older HDB estates, to approximate the quality of newer estates like Pasir Ris and Bis2han. Demonstration projects will be launched later this year. If they are popular with residents, HDB will upgrade other neighbourhoods which want to do so over the next 10 to 15 years. Meanwhile, we can make many improvements to existing estates, to spruce up common areas and improve essential facilities, for example by water-proofing bathroom floors. These investments will enhance the value of HDB homes, and increase the assets of Singaporeans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans living in HDB flats wish to upgrade to private housing. Government will sell more land to private developers, for condominium and landed property developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides homes, HDB has also built many shophouses, but so far it has only sold a few of them to the shopkeepers. As landlord, HDB has periodically needed to raise the rents of these shophouses, causing difficulties to some tenants. To solve this problem, HDB will sell most of these shophouses to the tenants. The price will be related to the market values of the properties, with an appropriate discount. This will enable the shop owners to plan ahead with certainty.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Health Care</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area of concern to Singaporeans is health care. As incomes rise and the population ages, the demand for medical care will inevitably go up. As wages of medical staff go up, so will costs. So will national expenditure on health care. This has happened in every country.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's per capita income is only half that of the US and Japan. Yet the subsidised wards of government hospitals already offer better medical care than most Japanese hospitals. Low income Singaporeans enjoy better medical care than many American families, who cannot afford medical insurance and have no access to good hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will ensure that all Singaporeans receive basic medical care. It will continue to subsidise B2 and C class wards, though it will still have to revise charges for these wards from time to time. There is a limit to the level of medical care which the Government can guarantee every citizen. The state cannot afford unlimited subsidies for high technology medicine, especially treatments which are recently discovered and not yet established. Every dollar spent on these areas is a dollar less for other proven, basic, and cost effective procedures. Patients who want non-standard treatments will have to pay for them at non-subsidised rates, or depend on the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governments which have provided free medical care for their citizens, like Canada, Britain, Spain, and other developed countries more affluent
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> than we are, all face serious difficulties. Sweden, after 70 years of state welfare, plans to reform its system of government funded free health care. Even Communist China intends to start charging government employees for medical care. No state can meet the insatiable demand for health care. The burden of the ever increasing expenditures ultimately falls back on the people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must learn from these painful experiences of other countries. Our medical care system must create maximum incentive for responsibility, and minimumtemptation to waste. The individual has a personal responsibility to keep fit, stay healthy, minimise the need for medical treatment, and save for his own medical expenses. The first report from the Review Committee on National Health Policies, emphasised preventive medicine and healthy living. The Government has accepted this report, and will launch an annual national campaign for healthy lifestyles this year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have restructured government hospitals to provide medical care more efficiently and economically. The trend is for the private sector to play a bigger role in providing health care and competing against Government hospitals, as it has done in obstetrics. More than half the babies in Singapore are born in private hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans who have Medisave have generally been able to meet their medical expenses, especially if they also have Medishield. But the self-employed are not covered by Medisave. The Government will extend Medisave to as many self-employed workers as possible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long term, the Medisave contribution rate of 6% will be insufficient. The Government will raise Medisave contribution rates progressively, especially for older Singaporeans who have already bought their homes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will set up a new endowment fund, called Medifund, to complement Medisave. Income from the endowment will be used to help
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> poorer Singaporeans whose Medisave accounts are insufficient to meet their medical expenses, and who need help as a last resort. Medifund will be an extension of the existing scheme of fee waivers for C and B2 class wards. This will provide a safety net for Singaporeans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help from Medifund will not be an entitlement. Each application to Medifund will be assessed individually by a committee involving community leaders, to decide how much help is needed. In keeping with the principle of personal responsibility, Medifund will give priority to helping those who have consistently contributed to their own Medisave accounts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be an additional incentive for self-employed Singaporeans to contribute to Medisave. For older Singaporeans, who retired before Medisave was fully introduced, Medifund will be more flexible.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Pace of Change</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes in Singapore society have been rapid. Sometimes people feel disorientated, and have to struggle to keep up, but the pace of change is not dictated by Singapore alone. The entire Asia Pacific region is undergoing dramatic change. Other countries like South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand are advancing even more rapidly than Singapore, and catching up on us. If we choose a more relaxed pace, we must be prepared to be overtaken and left behind. To stay ahead, we must constantly restructure and upgrade.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustaining growth depends on pursuing efficient, market oriented economic policies. People sometimes criticise these policies for paying inadequate attention to social and human factors. But these are the very policies which have created the prosperity we enjoy today. The Communist countries pursued the opposite policies, ignoring market forces and eliminating income differences by government order. They created poverty and despair. Many have collapsed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government cannot hold back change, but it will help Singaporeans to adapt to change. It cannot protect local businesses against foreign competition,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> but it will help them to restructure and compete. It cannot preserve redundant jobs where technology or market demand has changed, but it can help affected workers to retrain and find new jobs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we constantly upgrade and adjust to changing world conditions, we must not unthinkingly cut ourselves off from our cultural roots. Government policies must always enjoy the broad support of the major social groups, including the less vocal non-English speaking part of our society.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the economy is more developed, growth is becoming more difficult. Despite our best efforts, the economy will slowdown. Where previously 8% growth was normal, in the next phase 5% to 7% growth will be very good. While we work harder to upgrade and become more productive, we must also moderate our expectations of wage increases. In recent years, wages have increased by as much as 10% per year, but this cannot be sustained over the long term. The labour market is still tight, but eventually wages will have to slow down to match productivity and economic growth. Otherwise we will be chasing our own tails, and higher wages will cause higher inflation without improving standards of living.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Civil Service Personnel Management</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementing policies to carry Singapore forward in the Next Lap depends on an efficient and professional civil service, which can attract and challenge some of the most able Singaporeans to contribute their best to Singapore. The present civil service arrangements for recruiting, promoting and managing personnel, centred on the Public Service Commission and the Public Service Division, were inherited from the colonial government. The arrangements are over-centralised and too rigid to cope with
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the rapidly changing labour market. They give more weight to internal civil service relativities between unrelated vocations than to what the market judges the jobs to be worth. Despite periodic salary revisions, the civil service is unable to recruit all the talent it needs and pay them market rates.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Britain, the Civil Service Commission has delegated most of its authority to ministries and departments, and retains responsibility for only 15% of recruitment. Malaysia, which inherited similar arrangements as ours, has amended its Constitution to delegate civil service promotions to ministries. The Malaysian PSC is only responsible for recruitment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must make fundamental changes to the management of the Singapore civil service and free up its personnel administration. The public sector must become a more responsive and competitive employer without compromising the integrity and impartiality of the civil service and the statutory boards.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>The Next Lap</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are entering a new phase of Singapore's development. We have successfully overcome the basic challenges of the first 25 years of independence - schools, housing, security, jobs, and basic health care. We have built up substantial reserves, and created an elected Presidency with powers to give some protection to these reserves.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we face new challenges - how to strengthen national consensus despite the absence of visible danger; how to remind Singaporeans that the basics have not changed, however secure our prosperity may appear; how to remain agile and keen even though we are no longer lean and hungry; how to be a meritocratic but not an individualistic society; how to maintain the pace of upgrading so that Singapore will become a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> developed country, and all will be better off, by the end of the century.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new generation of Singaporeans must find fresh answers to these challenges amidst tumultuous international changes. The breakup of the Soviet Union has caused great upheavals. It will bring in its train alterations or modifications in alignments worldwide, as nations seek security and economic growth under changed circumstances. The continuing impasse in the GATT Uruguay Round negotiations will put more
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> great strain on the multilateral trading system. As European economic integration and a North American Free Trade Area develop, the Asia Pacific economies will at the very least face stronger competition. We have to work together productively as one nation, to exploit the opportunities and avoid the dangers which these and other external developments will bring. Then we will fulfil the promise of The Next Lap.

  <i>Air Transport</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We aim to maintain Changi Airport's reputation as the best airport in the world. We will invest $200 million to improve facilities for transit passengers, and refurbish Terminal 1 to the standard of the newly completed Terminal 2. We will build a fourth cargo agents' building at a cost of $60 million. This will increase Changi Airport's cargo handling capacity by 350,000 tonnes per year, to 1.1 million tonnes, making Singapore one of the largest air cargo centres in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Sea Transport</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We will strive to maintain our premier status as the world's busiest port and the number one container port. Over the next five years, we will invest $2.2 billion in new port facilities. The first three berths at the Brani Terminal will commence operations in 1992. When completed in 1994, the Terminal will have the capacity to handle 4 million TEUs a year. PSA is also planning a new container port to serve our needs in the 21st century.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The container freight station at Nelson Road will be completed by end 1993. It will boost our position as a regional cargo distribution centre. The Singapore Cruise Centre will begin operations in early 1992, and will make Singapore the cruise hub in the Southeast Asian Region.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Singapore Telecom will be corporatised in 1992. Subsequently, its shares will be sold to the public.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The national and international telecommunications infrastructure will be upgraded at a cost of $3.7 billion over the next 5 years. The telephone network will be completely digitised by 1994.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The optical fibre submarine cable linking Singapore and Brunei will be inaugurated in 1992. Singapore will then
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> be linked by optical fibre cables to the Asia Pacific region and the US via Brunei and the Philippines. We can then provide users with an efficient and high quality international telecommunication service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. An integrated postal complex will be built at Jalan Eunos by 1995. It will use modern technology to process mail and improve our mail service.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Land Transport</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. We will strive to keep our roads free-flowing, so that people and goods can move about efficiently and smoothly. We will continue to improve the Vehicle Quota System to allocate scarce and valuable road space as fairly and efficiently as possible to vehicle owners. Towards the middle of the decade, we expect to implement the Electronic Road Pricing System, in order to charge road users according to 2usage, and price roads according to congestion. This will be a more responsive and sensitive way to control traffic flow. More people will then be able to own cars.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We will continue to improve public transport to make it more convenient, accessible and affordable to commuters. Work on the $1 billion MRT extension to Woodlands has started and will be completed in five to six years' time. We will encourage bus operators to further upgrade their buses and streamline their routes, to provide a comprehensive network of public transport service together with the MRT.

   DR YEO NING HONG
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   Minister for Defence
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The threat of a global war has receded with the end of the Cold War. However, the Gulf War and the bloody conflict in Yugoslavia show that regional conflicts will continue. We must continue to maintain vigilance and invest in defence, because that buys us national security. MINDEF's mission is to preserve Singapore's peace and security, and should deterrence and diplomacy fail, to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> defeat the aggressors swiftly and decisively. To achieve this MINDEF will improve the manpower resources of the SAF, strengthen its technological edge, and foster close defence relations with friendly countries in the region and beyond.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Manpower Resources</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. 1992 marks the 25th year of national service for all male citizens. Full-time national service and the follow-on reserve service remain critical to Singapore's peace and security. They are also important institutions for building up national resilience and forging a sense of national identity and purpose.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. When national service began in l967, there were about 27,000 male l8-year olds per year. This number has been declining and will go below 20,000. To maintain the SAF's operational capability and compensate for the smaller numbers, MINDEF will:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. improve methods of training,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. emphasise physical fitness,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. introduce weapon systems which generate more firepower with fewer men,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. use more civilian staff or contractors in support roles to release more SAF personnel for combat duties,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. reduce the size of combat units and support units; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f. continue to strive for productivity improvements.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Reservists are the mainstay of the SAF's fighting force. They form the bulk of MINDEF's manpower resources. A motivated and well-trained reservist order of battle is essential for military deterrence. MINDEF will strengthen the motivation of reservists, upgrade their training, and recognise their contributions to the Total Defence of Singapore. Most of the recommendations of RECORD - the Committee to Recognise the Contribution of Reservists in Total Defence - have been implemented. Wherever feasible, MINDEF will decentralise training and call-ups to make
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> it more convenient for reservists, without compromising operational readiness. This is already done for the Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) and medical check-ups.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Weapons alone cannot assure the SAF's success. The morale and motivation of the soldiers are critical. This requires excellent commissioned officers and talented and capable warrant officers and specialists who can lead and command their men to perform in the stress of battle. MINDEF will restructure the Non-Commissioned Officer Corps to give junior commanders more opportunities for responsibility and personal development, and to take advantage of the better education levels of recruits. A Warrant Officer School will be set up to complement the SAFTI Military Institute for officer training.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Overseas Training</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Overseas training is essential to SAF operational training. It makes up for the lack of space and variety of terrain in Singapore. The closure of the Crow Valley training area in the Philippines due to the Mount Pinatubo eruptions is a significant loss to the Air Force. Training possibilities in other friendly countries will be explored.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Defence Technology</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. MINDEF will continue to emphasise defence technology as a critical element of the SAF's operational capability. The Defence Science Organisation will expand its research and development capability, particularly in electronics and military software. Other elements of the Defence Technology Group will strengthen capabilities in weapon systems integration and computer applications.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Defence Relations</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. MINDEF will continue to promote defence relations and bilateral exercises with other armed forces. These help to develop mutual confidence and understanding, and contribute to regional stability when the new world order is still uncertain.

   MR LEE YOCK SUAN
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   Minister for Education
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next 5 years, the Ministry of Education will introduce improvements to the education system from primary school to university. All pupils will receive at least 10 years of general education. We will restructure vocational education and expand the polytechnic and university sectors. We will set up an Open University. We will develop our human resources to the fullest, to meet the manpower needs of our modern technology-based economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Primary Education</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Improvements to the primary education system will be phased-in from 1992. The aim is to give pupils a strong foundation in English, the mother tongue and mathematics and prepare them for secondary education and beyond.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We have developed a preparatory year programme for 5-year-olds. It will strengthen language skills, and help compensate for differences in the language spoken at home, to prepare pupils for formal schooling at Primary 1. The programme is currently being tested out in several primary schools. However, the Government will not expand its role in pre-primary education, in order to concentrate its resources on formal primary education. As private kindergartens and pre-school centres upgrade their preparatory-year programmes, Government and Government-aided schools will correspondingly phase out their programmes, probably within two years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The foundation stage of primary schooling (Primary 1 - 4) will emphasize the learning of English, the mother tongue and mathematics. Pupils will be streamed at the end of Primary 4, to enter different language streams in Primary 5. In the final two years of primary school, the orientation stage (Primary 5 - 6), pupils will learn English and the mother tongue at different levels of proficiency. From 1993, all pupils will sit a modified Primary School Leaving
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Examination which will place them into appropriate courses in secondary schools.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Six primary schools will function as Day Schools on a pilot basis, 5 from 1992 and one from 1993. Teaching and learning in these schools can take place at a more measured pace. These schools will also organise optional after-school activities to cater to the needs of pupils.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. To meet the expected increase in primary school enrolment, the Ministry will build 8 more primary schools by 1994.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Secondary Education</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. From 1994, the Ministry will introduce a new secondary course with a technical bias. This course will strengthen pupils' language and mathematics skills, and teach new subjects such as computer applications and technology to prepare pupils for vocational education at the post-secondary level.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Independent Schools</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Independent schools have introduced new educational programmes and created a more conducive teaching and learning environment since they were established. The Ministry will help independent schools to consolidate their programmes and introduce more innovations.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Edusave Scheme</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. To maximise and equalize educational opportunities for all Singaporeans, the Government will launch the Edusave scheme. The Government will make an annual contribution into the Edusave account of every eligible pupil. Pupils can use their Edusave accounts to pay for enrichment activities and programmes organised by their schools, as well as to meet approved fees.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. Edusave will fund scholarships to independent schools. The scholarships will cover fees for one-quarter of the pupils enroled in these schools. This will give able children access to independent schools, regardless of their financial means.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Edusave will also fund scholarships for students going to non-independent secondary schools, so that good students in many schools will be recognised and encouraged to put in their best efforts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. Edusave will give all Government and Government-aided secondary schools an annual grant, averaging $100,000 per school. The schools can spend these grants at their discretion, to improve the quality of their teaching.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Post-Secondary Education and Training</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. The Institute of Technical Education (ITE) will be established in 1992 to take over the functions of the present Vocational and Industrial Training Board. The ITE will offer skills-training courses for pupils with secondary education. It will expand the scope of apprenticeship training to include new skill areas. Outstanding ITE graduates can further their studies in the polytechnics.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. The polytechnics will expand. Temasek Polytechnic will increase its intake by 50% in 1992 and introduce more courses. A fourth polytechnic will be set up in 1992. By the end of the decade, the four polytechnics will together admit 40% of each cohort of pupils.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>University Education</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. NUS and NTU will expand their intake and offer a greater variety of courses. By the second half of the decade, their combined annual intake will reach 9000 students, or 20% of the cohort. New courses such as communication studies, fine arts and design, human resource management and theatre studies will be introduced. Both universities will also step up research and development activities by expanding post-graduate enrolment and establishing specialised research institutes in conjunction with overseas centres of excellence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. The Singapore Open University (SOU) will be established in 1992. The Ministry is collaborating with a British open university for this purpose. The SOU will offer part-time degree
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> programmes for working adults and those who missed out on a university education in their younger days. Initially it will offer undergraduate courses in Arts and Social Science, Science, Engineering and Technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Healthy Lifestyle</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. The Ministry will launch a Healthy Lifestyle programme in 1992 to make pupils aware of the need for and importance of a healthy lifestyle. The programme will help pupils to inculcate desirable health and eating habits, improve their physical fitness and reduce obesity.

  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Singapore Green Plan" sets out the policies to maintain and improve our environment. By the year 2000, we aim to develop Singapore into a model Environment City, with high standards of public health, a quality environment, and an environmentally conscious and responsible people. It will be a focal point for regional and international environmental activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We seek public feedback on the Plan. We will reach out to schools, grassroots organisations, corporations and the media to promote environmentalism and green consumerism. By 1993, a "green labelling" scheme will help consumers identify products that cause least harm to the environment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We will strive to generate less refuse per capita, to conserve resources and scarce landfill space. We will encourage efficient use of energy, and promote waste minimization through reduction, reuse, recovery and recycling. All incinerable wastes will be burned when the Senoko Incineration Plant is operational in June 1992.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We will set higher standards for emissions to the air and discharges into the waterways.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Use of unleaded petrol has reduced the amount of harmful air-borne lead. Consumption of leaded petrol will decline as all new petrol-driven vehicles imported into Singapore must be able to run on unleaded petrol. Vehicle emission standards will be further tightened on 1 July 1992.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. To minimise odour nuisance and free up surrounding land, sewage treatment works will be progressively enclosed and foul gases treated before they are discharged.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Disposal of hazardous materials must satisfy more stringent requirements. Mercury content of batteries will be limited and, where possible, eliminated to minimise the hazard caused by the metal. We will do a feasibility study for a toxic waste treatment plant.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. We will continue to ensure that only safe and hygienic food are sold. Food manufacturing will be modernised and automated.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We will establish Singapore as a regional centre for environmental management and technology.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. Singapore will continue to help protect the global environment. Lower sulphur fuel will be used to limit sulphur dioxide emissions. We are phasing out ozone-depleting gases such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons well ahead of the schedule stipulated in the Montreal Protocol.

  <i>Fiscal Policy</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government's fiscal policies will continue to support the private sector as the engine of growth. The public sector will be kept lean and trim to free more manpower and financial resources for the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Expenditure priorities will be to invest in areas which yield lasting
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> returns, e.g. education, infrastructure and housing. More emphasis will be given to the arts, sport, recreation and programmes to protect the environment and to improve the quality of life.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. On the revenue side, factors of production will be taxed as lightly as possible. The Government will maintain a balanced budget, accumulating surpluses in good years as a bulwark against periods of economic downturn.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Taxation Policy</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The personal tax system will remain broad-based and equitable, in order to reward hard work and enterprise. Tax administration will be simplified and streamlined.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The corporate tax rate will be kept internationally competitive. We will continue to use tax incentives to promote investments into selected areas with growth potential.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. We are finalising the White Paper on proposals for a comprehensive consumption tax, and will publish the Paper when it is ready.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. We will continue to widen our network of double taxation agreements, and improve existing agreements to help companies expand overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Monetary Policy</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Monetary and exchange rate policies will aim to contain inflation, and maintain price stability and export competitiveness. Singapore enjoys the lowest inflation rate among the regional economies and NIEs.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Regulatory Framework</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Recent problems in international banking and financial circles have re-emphasised the need for adequate regulation in the financial sector. Singapore was spared these problems through vigilance in supervising and regulating our banks and financial institutions. We will maintain prudential standards to protect the soundness and integrity of our financial markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. The financial sector must be innovative and flexible to be competitive. Financial sector legislation will be reviewed in line with market developments. MAS will encourage banks and financial institutions to upgrade their operations and play a bigger regional role.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Privatisation Programme</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Government will continue to privatise mature government-linked companies to broaden the stock market, allow greater private sector participation in the economy and enable ordinary Singaporeans to share in the successes of these enterprises. The Public Service
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. The present centralised arrangements for recruiting, promoting, and managing personnel will be restructured, to make the public sector a more responsive and competitive employer, without compromising the integrity and impartiality of the civil service and statutory boards.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. The Inland Revenue Department will be converted into a statutory board, to give it greater flexibility in managing its manpower.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. The public sector will exploit advances in information technology to upgrade productivity and efficiency. Computerised management accounting systems will be operational in all ministries by mid-1993. These systems will allow ministries and statutory boards to track accurately the costs of their services, and help identify poor performance and waste.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. The computerised Central Personnel Information System will be fully operational by 1993. Its 10 core applications will be on-line in all ministries by this year. 10 more applications will be added during the next two years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. A pilot programme to promote health and fitness at the workplace will be carried out in a few ministries and statutory boards this year. Based on this experience, the programme will be extended to the rest of the public sector later.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. We will review service terms and conditions this year to keep them in tune with changing circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. The civil service is considering a Civil Service Staff College for senior administrators. It will be the institutional focal point for the Civil Service to train and build esprit de corps among senior officers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. The Civil Service Institute (CSI) will continue to train civil servants at all levels. Following the establishment of the Service Improvement Unit (SIU), the CSI will train 600 Division One Quality Facilitators this year to help their Quality Service Managers upgrade the quality of their organisations' service to the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Social Development</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. We will continue to encourage single graduates to marry one another. A special effort will be made to encourage work-oriented singles, especially new graduates from NUS and NTU, to view marriage as a desirable goal in life.

  </div>
  <div align="center">
   Minister for Health
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health aims to build a healthy nation through health promotion and disease prevention. It will keep medical services affordable, so that all Singaporeans can enjoy a high standard of basic health care.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Building a Healthy Nation</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Singapore can only be a healthy nation if all Singaporeans take personal responsibility for their own health and take a personal interest in keeping fit and healthy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We will encourage Singaporeans to adopt a healthy lifestyle, to reduce lifestyle-related diseases such as cancer, heart disease, stroke and diabetes. We will launch an annual nation-wide campaign to promote healthy lifestyles and to educate Singaporeans on the importance of regular exercise and a balanced diet. We will continue to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> discourage smoking through anti-smoking campaigns.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The National Healthy Lifestyle Programme will encourage and motivate Singaporeans to make healthy lifestyle a way of life. These campaigns will encourage Singaporeans to stay slim, exercise regularly, avoid smoking, reduce blood cholesterol levels and the incidence of high blood pressure, and switch to more healthy diets and eating habits.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Strengthening Disease Prevention</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The Ministry will strengthen disease prevention programmes, and maintain a high immunisation rate against the common childhood diseases. We will expand selected health screening programmes for specific groups at risk, to detect diseases early. We will upgrade the health surveillance programme for children to detect physical and developmental abnormalities.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Ensuring affordable basic medical care</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. With an aging population, rising manpower costs and greater use of expensive medical equipment and drugs, health care costs will inevitably continue to rise. Following on the Review Committee on National Health Policies, the Ministry will make a thorough evaluation of current health care policies, in order to contain health care expenditure and government subsidies, and keep basic health care accessible and affordable to all Singaporeans. This will include reviewing:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. the Government's role, including the extent to which Government should be directly involved in providing health care, and in controlling or influencing health care costs;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. the ideal mix of private sector initiatives and Government's involvement;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. how to give individuals maximum freedom of choice and maximum incentive to stay healthy and minimise use of medical services.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The Government will continue to subsidize Class B2 and C wards to keep basic health care affordable to the average and lower-income groups. Subsidies on Class A and B1 beds will be progressively phased out to focus Government health subsidies on those who most need them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Medisave and Medishield have given most Singaporeans access to good health care. But the self-employed are not covered by Medisave. To meet their hospitalisation needs, especially when they retire, the Government will extend Medisave to cover as many of the self-employed workers as possible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. The Government will raise Medisave contribution rates, especially for older Singaporeans, so that Singaporeans have adequate provisions for their medical needs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. To help those who do not have sufficient Medisave, the Government is setting up Medifund as an additional safety net.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Upgrading Hospitals and Clinics</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. The Ministry will continue the programme of rebuilding hospitals and clinics. The upgrading of Alexandra Hospital will be completed the end of 1993. We will commission a new psychiatric hospital to replace Woodbridge Hospital in late 1992. We will review and finalise plans to rebuild Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Kandang Kerbau Hospital and a new General Hospital at Simei.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. We have opened four new polyclinics in Toa Payoh, Jurong, Tampines and Hougang New Towns. The polyclinic at Woodlands will be completed by the end of 1992. We will also build new polyclinics at Bukit Batok, Geylang and Chua Chu Kang.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. The first Community Hospital will be open in Ang Mo Kio in 1992. It will provide low cost hospitalisation for the elderly and chronic sick, and for patients who do not need to go to acute hospitals. The Community Hospital will also have a Senior Citizens' Health Care Centre and a Dialysis Centre.

  <br>
  <i>Maintaining High Professional Standards</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. We will regulate private hospitals and medical clinics to ensure that they maintain high professional standards, and set up a register of specialists under the Medical Registration Act so that specialists are properly accredited.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. We will improve our postgraduate training programmes both to prepare specialists for the different specialties and to train competent family physicians. The fourth polytechnic will offer higher level training for nurses, and diploma courses for rehabilitation therapists and radiographers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Achieving replacement fertility</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. We will continue to encourage Singaporeans to have three children and more if they can afford it, in order to achieve replacement fertility levels. We will monitor the population trends and adjust population policies to meet the needs of the country.

  <br>
  <i>Efficient use of Manpower</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Progress in raising the retirement age is still slow in the non-unionised sector. If this continues, legislation to effect the change will be necessary.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Foreign Workers</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We will continue to allow a controlled pool of foreign workers to complement the domestic workforce and facilitate economic growth. We will give preference to skilled and compatible foreign workers who may be suitable for assimilation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. We will vigorously prosecute those found illegally employing foreign workers, as the practice is still rampant.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Industrial Health and Safety</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. We will protect workers' health by preventing and controlling occupational health hazards and diseases.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. We will continue to encourage factories to regulate themselves in order to promote industrial safety, and prevent occupational health hazards and diseases. We will step up training for workers and supervisors on industrial safety and health.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Social Security</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. We will extend the CPF scheme to more self-employed Singaporeans and encourage more retirees to buy life annuities with their CPF minimum sums.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We will implement the Edusave Scheme jointly with the Ministry of Education. This will benefit some 420,000 primary and secondary students.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1990 Revised Edition of Subsidiary Legislation of the Republic of Singapore will be published in 1992. This will be useful to both legal practitioners and the lay public.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The Ministry will expand LawNet to give lawyers easy access to all electronic legal services. When fully implemented in 5 years' time, lawyers can perform many legal transactions from the computers in their offices.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To upgrade the standard of prosecution work, lay Public Prosecutors are being replaced by professional Deputy Public Prosecutors in the Subordinate Courts.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The Ministry will continue the following major computerisation projects:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. The Singapore Land Data Hub allows the sharing of commonly required land-related data, both graphic and textual. 12 public agencies are contributing their digital land data to the HUB. The project will be completed in 1994, and will enable users to manage and share land-related data more efficiently.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. The Registry of Titles &amp; Deeds is computerising the land titles registration system under the Land Titles Act, so that title searches can be done by computer. The first phase of the Singapore Titles Automated Registration System (STARS) will be operational by end 1994.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. The Registry of Trade Marks and Patents is computerising all aspects of trade marks registration. This will speed up trade marks registration when fully completed in 5 years' time.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD will foster maximum community participation to build a cohesive, compassionate and robust society. We will create more opportunities for people to take part in community and voluntary work. We will work with community and welfare organizations, to help them increase community services.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Enhancing Social Cohesion</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Together with civic, ethnic, voluntary and community organizations, we will strengthen community cohesion and national unity. We will encourage more informed discussion and greater public participation in policy-making.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Together with the National Community Organizations Council, we will develop programmes to strengthen community groups and help them reach out more effectively to residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The Feedback Unit will reach out to more segments of the population.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>A more Compassionate Society</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. We will devote more attention to the needs of the lower-income groups, and extend them more assistance, through the many helping hands of community and civic organizations. We will work closely with civic and voluntary organizations to help such families upgrade themselves and become self-reliant.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. We will give grants on a cost-sharing basis to voluntary welfare organisations, to provide welfare facilities and services to the aged, the disabled and low-income families.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Helping the Family</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. We will counsel families who need help and provide them with information and referral services. Family service centres will provide counselling, family life education and social support services to families. If the pilot centres are successful, more will be set up.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. We will encourage more organisations to set up child care centres, and step up training of child care personnel.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Helping Senior Citizens</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Elderly Singaporeans aged 60 years and above will increase from the present 9% of the population to 11% in 2000, and to 26% in 2030. Senior citizens should continue to be an active and valued part of the community. We will encourage more Senior Citizens' Activity Centres, Senior Citizens' Clubs and other family-oriented programmes to be set up to help senior citizens remain active in the community.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. We will work with community and voluntary welfare organizations to provide community-based day-care, respite and residential care facilities for the frail aged. Over the next five years, 11 new homes will be built, increasing the number of residential places by 50%.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>A Fit and Robust Society</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. We will encourage every Singaporean to be active in at least one sport to help keep "fit for life".
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. We will create a stimulating and conducive environment to promote both sports excellence and mass participation. We will have more programmes for the young, the aged and families.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. We will spend $24 million to redevelop the Outward Bound School (OBS). When the project is completed in 1994, our youth will have a modern adventure centre to develop ruggedness.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Malay/Muslim Matters</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. The Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) will work closely with community and other Malay/Muslim organisations to strengthen the religious values of Muslims in Singapore. The Government will, together with Yayasan Mendaki and other interested groups, work to improve the educational, economic and socio-cultural status of the Malay/Muslim community.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union have brought about rapid and dramatic changes in international relationships. Singapore must adapt to these changes and promote our interests abroad by adopting an increasingly international outlook. Greater demands will be placed on our foreign policy, which must be flexible, robust and proactive.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The successful liberation of Kuwait from Iraqi occupation by the multinational coalition has enhanced the prestige and influence of the United Nations. The UN has played a constructive role in resolving regional conflicts, as in Angola and Cambodia. Singapore supports a strong UN, and the UN's efforts to preserve law and order and settle disputes peacefully. We will seek ways to enhance the security of small states and promote regional stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Singapore is participating in UN peacekeeping operations at the Iraq-Kuwait border and in Angola. We will continue to discharge our obligations as a responsible member of the international community of nations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Human resource development is vital if developing countries are to break out of the vicious cycle of poverty and ignorance. We will increase technical assistance to developing countries through the Singapore Cooperation Programme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. ASEAN remains a cornerstone of our foreign policy. We will continue to support ASEAN and ensure that the organisation remains a force for regional stability and economic progress. In a few weeks' time, Singapore will host the Fourth ASEAN Summit. The Summit will be a significant opportunity to give ASEAN clear objectives and a fresh impetus.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The creation of the Single European Market, the larger European Economic Area, and the North American Free Trade Area compel us to strengthen cooperation within ASEAN, and in the wider Asia-Pacific with our major trading partners - the United States, the European Community and Japan.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. In South Africa, apartheid is being irreversibly dismantled. Singapore will progressively develop economic ties with South Africa. With other Commonwealth countries, we have begun to remove sanctions against South Africa.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. The Cambodian peace agreement was signed in Paris in October 1990. We have begun to normalise relations with Vietnam. We expect to find many areas of mutual interest and cooperation with Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We live in an increasingly interdependent world. As a small country whose survival depends on access to the whole world, we must deepen and strengthen relations with our old friends, and develop relations with other countries friendly towards us.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Home Affairs will step up action to improve road traffic safety, and to reduce crime and drug abuse. It will update its civil defence programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Law and Order</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To reduce injury and death in traffic accidents, the Traffic Police will require vehicles to have child harnesses, and rear passengers to use seat belts. It will consider giving incentives to drivers with good driving records.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. New legislation to combat computer crimes will be introduced by 1992.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The Police will:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. study how neighbourhood police posts can provide better community policing;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. upgrade crime investigation through a computerised criminal intelligence system, voice-print analysis and other scientific means; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. upgrade the Marine Police to protect our coastal waters.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The Police will build a new Police Academy, and new buildings to house the Police HQ, Traffic Police and Marine Police.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Anti-Drug Measures</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. We will introduce drug asset seizure legislation in Parliament in 1992. Besides taking enforcement action against drug addicts and traffickers, Central Narcotics Bureau will co-ordinate the drug aftercare programme to help ex-drug addicts re-integrate into the community.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Rehabilitation of Offenders</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. We will build two new maximum security prisons by 1993 and a new drug rehabilitation centre (DRC) replacing existing outdated DRCs by 1996. This will reduce over-crowding, and free manpower from security functions for rehabilitation programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. The Prisons Department is using the Electronic Monitoring System to monitor drug abusers released on supervision. It will extend this system to Police criminal supervisees, in order to monitor them more effectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Civil Defence</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. The SCDF will complete the nation-wide public warning system by 1992. It will build a new Civil Defence Academy and a new SCDF HQ by 1996. It will conduct nationwide emergency exercises involving the community.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Immigration and National Registration</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. Immigration Department will install a voice processing system in 1992 to answer telephone enquiries from members of the public.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. The immigration control at Finger Pier will be relocated to World Trade Centre in 1992 to cater for the increase in traffic to Batam and Bintan. The Woodlands Checkpoint will be redeveloped to meet the growing volume of cross-border traffic. When it is completed, the immigration and customs clearance facilities at Keppel Railway Station will be shifted to Woodlands.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. National Registration Department (NRD) will introduce a One-Stop Change-Of-Address reporting system in 1992. When a person reports his change of address, NRD will automatically inform all relevant government departments and statutory boards.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Arts Council will establish an Arts Endowment Fund to help promote the arts in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The Singapore Arts Centre will be built at Marina Bay by 1999. Comprising five auditoriums and a commercial component, it will be a cultural village which will be lively throughout the day and week.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Heritage</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The National Museum will be converted from a Government Department to a Statutory Board. This will give the Museum more flexibility to set up an Endowment Fund and to build up its collection from donations and loans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. In the long term, the museum precinct will be comprehensively developed into five separate museums. In place of a museum of Southeast Asia Ethnology, we will work towards a Museum of Asian Civilizations, with separate sections on Southeast Asia, East Asia and South &amp; West Asia.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The Fine Arts Museum at the former Saint Joseph's Institution will be ready by 1994.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The former Tao Nan School in Armenian Street will be renovated to provide more space for museum and cultural use.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Information</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The Government will consider the recommendations of the Censorship Review Committee, which will be ready by April this year. Broadcasting
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. SBC will be privatised to give it more operational flexibility to carry out its mission to inform, educate and entertain in the four official languages.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>National Library</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. A new National Library building at Victoria Street will replace the present building at Stamford Road by 1996. It will be equipped with up to date information technology, and linked to national and international library databases.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. We will review the number, size and location of new branch libraries that will be needed for the next 10 years.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MND will improve the quality of housing, roads, infrastructure and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> recreational facilities in Singapore through judicious planning and use of our limited land resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Planning and Developing a City of Excellence</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The Ministry published the final draft of the Concept Plan in September 1991. The Plan safeguards sufficient land for infrastructure, new commercial complexes, business parks and industrial estates to support our economic growth. It also sets aside land for housing and other social amenities, to give Singaporeans a better living and working environment. We will preserve areas which reflect our distinctive social history and architectural styles.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We will develop the islands of Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong. In the next 5 years, we will begin reclamation work to enlarge the islands. Pulau Ubin will be linked to Pulau Tekong by a bridge. The two islands will be connected to the mainland by tunnels or bridges. We will use the islands for recreational purposes, until we need to develop new towns on them to accommodate a larger population.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. To make the Concept Plan more useful to developers, URA will prepare Development Guide Plans (DGPs) for 51 local areas. URA will complete 9 DGPs in 1992 and the rest by 1995. The DGPs will show the development potential of specific areas, such as Tanjong Rhu, Simpang and future HDB new towns.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Housing</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. HDB will build more flats for new households as well as those moving up to bigger and better units. Existing flats in older estates will be progressively refurbished and improved under the Upgrading Programme, to match the standards of the newer estates. HDB will launch demonstration projects in six precincts later this year. The upgrading Programme will be extended to other precincts over the next 10 to 15 years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. HDB will invite private architects and developers to "design and build" its flats. Over the next 3 years, HDB will
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> award "design and build" contracts for some 3,000 units in the Tampines New Town. This will produce more varied designs for public housing, and give Singaporeans a wider choice of affordable housing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. More State land will be sold to the private sector to develop condominiums and landed properties. This will enable more people to buy such properties.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. 80% of HDB occupants own the flats they live in. To give more families an opportunity to own their homes, HDB will give financial help to low income families to buy 3-room resale flats.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Eventually most rental flats will be 2-room units. HDB will improve the fittings and furnishes in rental flats, to help the minority who cannot afford to buy their own flats or who need transitional housing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. HDB will sell tenanted shops in HDB estates to existing tenants at appropriate discounts from the market price.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Construction</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. CIDB will continue to improve the productivity and quality of our construction workforce. It will build a new training centre at Bishan, and expand and upgrade its training and trade testing facilities. It will organise more training courses for professionals at the Centre for Advanced Construction Studies at NTU.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Roads</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. Over the next 5 years, PWD will spend $2 billion to expand the capacity of the road network. It will build 540 lane-km of new roads. This includes widening 20 existing roads, building 14 new roads and expressways, and 35 new interchanges, flyovers or underpasses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. To improve traffic flow without consuming more land, PWD will construct more underground roads to expand the road capacity in the Central Area, and extend the computerized traffic control system to more areas outside the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. PWD will build more walkways and integrate them with the public transport system. By the end of 1992, 13 MRT stations will be linked by covered walkways to adjacent bus interchanges. PWD will complete the walkway programme along Orchard Road by 1992 and the walkway upgrading programme in the Civic District by 1995.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Parks</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. PRD will spend $66.5 million over the next 5 years to develop new parks and upgrade existing parks. It will connect the parks up with green links, for Singaporeans to jog or cycle from one park to another.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. National Parks Board will develop the Botanic Gardens into a premier equatorial botanic garden for botany and horticulture.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Primary Production</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. PPD will continue to ensure a stable and adequate supply of safe, wholesome meat, fish and vegetables in Singapore by diversifying sources of supply and maintaining high standards of food hygiene and safety.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. PPD will develop more agro-technology parks to make efficient use of farmland for intensive and high-tech farming. This will help Singapore become an agro-technology service centre for tropical agriculture.

  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Economic Growth</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore economy grew by 6.5% in 1991. This slowdown was expected in view of the weakness of the industrialised economies and our supply-side constraints. For the next 3-5 years, we expect about 5-7% growth per annum. Beyond that, growth will probably slow down to 4-6% per annum. This is inevitable as the economy matures.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To sustain growth, we must qualitatively improve the economy and make better use of our resources. Faster growth depends on timely restructuring. The Government will help industries and companies to restructure with as little dislocation as possible. We will upgrade the workforce, restructure existing economic activities, promote science and technology, and develop more global and regional linkages. We will continue to provide efficient infrastructure to support our economic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Education and Training</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The Government will create more places in the universities, polytechnics and technical institutes to train skilled manpower for economic development. Intakes of science and engineering students into the universities, polytechnics and EDB institutes will be increased. The Government will encourage employers to train workers, for example through VITB apprenticeship schemes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We will create more opportunities for mature workers to retrain. Currently, VITB offers 50,000 places for worker education (BEST and WISE), and 20,000 places for skills training. VITB will consider conducting full-time modular courses in addition to the part-time courses currently available. NPB will offer FAST FORWARD programmes for more subjects, using other languages besides English. By 1996, NPB aims to train 50,000 workers annually through 20 FAST FORWARD courses. This and other programmes will double the participation of mature workers in SDF-supported training courses to 14%. Workers can also further their studies in the Open University.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Restructuring of Economic Activities</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The Government will help sectors which have not kept pace with economic changes to upgrade and restructure. In the retail sector, some small retailers face difficulties. Demand for their wares has declined because of changes in consumer taste and life-styles. They face keen competition from bigger and more profitable companies for workers and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> shop space. The EDB, HDB and MOL are together working out plans to help these small businesses become more viable, by doing joint promotion, centralised buying, and more systematic business inventory control and book-keeping.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Together with the private sector, EDB has set up the Enterprise Promotion Centre to give direct help to local companies in management and financial matters, and to disseminate information on Government incentive and assistance schemes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Science &amp; Technology</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Singapore has done well promoting foreign investment, but we need to do more to encourage innovation-driven activities. The Government will spend up to $2 billion over the next 5 years to support industry-driven R&amp;D, develop centres of excellence in science and technology, train research personnel and provide infrastructural support. Our target is for the public and private sectors together to spend 2% of GDP on research and development by 1995.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Global and Regional Linkages</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. We will continue to build global and regional linkages so that the Singapore economy can tap into as many sources of growth as possible. We will do this at multilateral, regional and bilateral levels. We will participate actively in international and regional forums and groupings like GATT, APEC and ASEAN to promote international trade and economic co-operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Infrastructure Provision and Promotional Activities</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Government will continue to invest to improve and upgrade infrastructure. The seven islands off Jurong will be reclaimed and amalgamated by 1998 for industrial use. Work on the first Business Park in Jurong East will begin in early 1992.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. The PUB will invest $6 billion over the next five years to expand its generation, production, transmission and distribution facilities for electricity, water and piped gas. It will build a new gasworks in Senoko.
