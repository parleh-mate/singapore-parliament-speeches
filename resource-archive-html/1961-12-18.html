<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of

Supply [1st Allotted Day].



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>2.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Minister signify the

recommendation  of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan   Negara

before    the   Committee   proceeds   with    the

consideration of the Estimates?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> I

so signify.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Estimates containing a Vote on

Account for expenditure for part of the year  1963

of  the  State  of Singapore (Cmd.  39  of  1961).

Dealing  now  with  the heads  of  expenditure  in

respect  of  which amendments stand on  the  Order

Paper -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1 -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance in his

statement  to this House on 4th December explained

why  he considered it necessary and desirable that

the  1963  Vote on Account had to be taken  at  an

early  stage.  I  would  like  to  quote  from   a

transcript  of  his speech. The P.A.P.  Government

are  fond of saying that they always say what they

mean,  and  they mean what they say. If you  remem

ber. Sir, a ministerial statement made during  the

course  of  the  debate here  on  the  boycott  in

Chinese  middle schools was found to  be  a  mis-statement. In order that there can be no doubt  in

the minds of the Opposition that he has made a mis-statement, I would like the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2412</b></font><br><br>



Minister to say whether the transcript of

his speech is correct. I quote from page

37 [of the "first copy" of the Hansard].

He said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The vote on account is asked in respect of

annually  recurrent expenditure. Such  expenditure

is  incurred  in regular amounts each month  being

payments  for salaries of staff, regular  services

used  by  the  Government such  as  water,  light,

electricity,  stationery,  telephone,   rents   of

offices and so forth.'



<br><br>May  I,  Sir,  before  I  proceed  with  the  many

amendments that stand in my name, ask the Minister

whether  he  meant what he said and said  what  he

meant when these words were said by him?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think the Member

has even moved the amendment standing in his name.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am sorry, Sir.

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 1 be reduced by $100.



<br><br>I mean to say what I have said just now

after moving this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The point the Chair wishes to make

is  that  all remarks must be related to  Head  1,

because the hon. Member did have an opportunity of

debating  the  statement made by the Minister  for

Finance.  The  House was given an  opportunity  of

saying whether or not they wished the Minister  to

move, "That the House do now adjourn," to enable a

debate  to  be  held  on the statement.  But  that

opportunity was not taken. Therefore, there cannot

be  a  general  debate  on the  statement  of  the

Minister.  If,  of  course,  the  remarks  can  be

related to any particular Head which indicate that

the  Minister  went wrong in his  statement,  then

that will be in order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With respect, Sir, I am not

debating  the  Minister's  statement.  What  I  am

seeking  is information-whether the transcript  of

what  he said on 4th December is correct, in  view

of the fact that one Minister's previous statement

had been found to be a mis-statement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2413</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member must indicate how that

question  relates to Head 1. I think that  is  the

point I am trying to make.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Because I can

prove that if it is a correct transcript, then the

Vote on Account does not bear out the statement of

the Minister for Finance.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Membet should now

indicate how that is so.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I would like tt, indicate that

the  Minister asked in his statement for a 55  per

cent  vote oh account in respect of Personal Emolu

ments  and Other Charges Annually Recurrent.  That

is   what   he   meant   by   annually   recurrent

expenditure. But I want to prove that no work  has

been  done  at  all  in the compilation  of  these

Estimates  before  us. What is presented  to  this

House is that it is 55 per cent of the total votes

in    1962   including   Other   Charges   Special

Expenditure,  and the Minister, of course,  cannot

say  that  the Special Expenditure for  1962  will

also be the same Special Expenditure for

1963.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did make

a  statement  and  I  think the  transcript  is  a

correct representation of what I said. Perhaps  it

lacked precision because I did not convey the full

meaning  of what items would, in fact,  be  sought

under the vote on account.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I intended to make in that statement

was  that it is the ordinary Estimates which would

come under the procedure applicable to the vote on

account, because, apart fiom O.C.S.E. items  which

form a small part of the total sum in the ordinary

Estimates,   the   others  cover  fairly   regular

amounts. I made that statement in order to compare

the  procedure for estimating expenditure  in  the

ordinary   Estimates  with  the  difficulties   in

forecasting   expenditure   in   the   Development

Estimates - that they are two different  things.  If

the  Member for Cairnhill will refer to the  whole

text  of  my  statement,  he  will  find  that   I

developed the reasons why, in respect



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2414</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Development Estimates, it is not possible

to ask for approval for part of the year. That was

the  point  I  was making, not that I intended  to

pull  a fast one over the Member for Cairnhill  or

any  other Member. I was just developing the theme

of  the  two approaches when asking for a vote  on

account. I hope I have made myself clear.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> On a point of clarification, if the Chair might assist

us.  In view of the Minister's indication that the

statement  was not quite precise in character  and

since  we  have now received the full details,  is

there no procedure whereby we can, in fact, debate

the principal issue whether there should be a Vote

on Account and Development Estimates for 1963?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member is too late on

that  issue.  I did indicate earlier on  that  the

time  to do that was when the Minister offered  to

adjourn the House, but that offer was not taken ad

vantage of. That was the time to debate whether or

not  there should have been a Vote on Account.  At

the  moment,  we are presented with this  Vote  on

Account  and  no  details of it have  been  given,

quite  correctly. The only idea of a  vote  on  ac

count  is,  as  indicated in the Constitution,  to

provide for expenditure for a part of the year and

details  need not be given. I do not know why  the

Minister  chose to say 55 per cent.  This  is  the

procedure in every Parliament, that if a  vote  on

account is asked for, a lump sum is asked for  and

they  simply  say, "We want this lump  sum  for  X

months." That is all.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when we

listened  to  the  statement of the  Minister  for

Finance  on 4th December, we took it to mean  that

what he was asking the House for was just 55  per

cent of annually recurrent expenditure. Those  are

the  words he used. Because of that, we  were  led

into  a position where we thought it would not  be

necessary  to scrutinise the Estimates in  detail.

This  could  account  for the  fact  that  so  few

Members of the Opposition have sent in amendments.

It  would  now appear that what the Minister  said

was  not  what he meant to say, because the  words

are very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2415</b></font><br><br>



clear - "55  per  cent  of the  annually  recurrent

expenditure". The Minister tried to pooh-pooh  the

Special Expenditure as a small amount. But  may  I

point  out  that for 1962, that is the  basis  for

this  present  Vote on Account, the Other  Charges

Special Expenditure is $48 million and 55 per cent

of that would come to about

$27 million. We are being asked - if I may touch on

the  whole lot - to vote $27 million more than  what

is  actually necessary to pay for any recurrent ex

penditure. Once we give our approval to  the  Vote

on  Account, there is no control on how that money

is  to be spent. The only control is the amount to

be spent under each Head.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vote on Account, in this particular

instance, Sir, comes to about $16,000 under Head 1

for  1962.  This  is  for three  items:  crockery,

electric  typewriter, and motor car.  And  55  per

cent  of  that  vote is $9,000. Now,  these  three

items are special items. I do not think they  will

be  required to be purchased in 1963. We  will  be

voting $9,000 - a blank cheque to the Government  to

use in any way it may think fit so long as it does

not  spend  beyond $9,000. For all we  know,  this

$9,000  could be used towards the payment  of  the

creation  of  a new post or towards  new  annually

recurrent   charges,   or   for   other    special

expenditure  which, if brought to  this  Assembly,

the  Opposition might consider to be  unreasonably

extravagant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is unfortunate that I have to speak in

this  strain on the Head "Yang di-Pertuan Negara",

but  it happens to be the very first Head. I would

not  like it to be misunderstood that I am raising

anything against the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, but  I

am  raising  it in the strongest terms of  protest

against  the  Minister for Finance  who  tried  to

mislead this Assembly by saying something which is

not borne out now by the facts of the case. Sir, I

would like the Minister to note this: if this vote

is  given, it is clear the money could be used for

a purpose which the Government considers advisable

or necessary. The Minister need



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2416</b></font><br><br>



not  have to come to the Assembly and say, "No,  I

think we want to buy a motor boat for the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara with the $9,000." They  can  still

buy it so long as it does not go beyond $9,000. We

would  have, as it were, given away our rights  to

criticise  any expenditure so long as  the  amount

spent  does  not go beyond the Vote on  Account - 55

per cent of the special expenditure for 1962.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I am sorry if I misled

Members  of  the Opposition on this point,  but  I

assure you that if they were so misled, it was not

intentional.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill understood my remarks

to  mean  that we will be asking for  a  Vote  on

Account only on

O.C.A.R. items. I think that was his

point.  If  that was my intention,  I  would  have

mentioned  specifically that we were  only  asking

for  a Vote on Account on O.C.A.R. items. Perhaps,

as I have admitted, my presentation was lacking in

precision.  And if it has misled Members,  then  I

can only express my regret. But, Sir, if you study

the  O.C.S.E. items, you will find that  for  the

most  part  they  are  very  necessary  items   of

expenditure.  They  are items to  replace  various

types    of   equipment   needed   in   Government

departments. Further, some items are really in the

nature   of   annually  recurrent,  for  instance,

"Scholarships, Courses and Fellowships". They  now

appear  as O.C.S.E. items. It is just not possible

for  us  to  say, "Well, we can run the Government

only  on  O.C.A.R. expenditure." That  would  mean

that   replacement  of  equipment  in  the  public

services would have to be suspended. Further, some

very vital items which are really in the nature of

annually  recurrent expenditure have been included

for  accounting purposes under O.C.S.E. The Member

for  Cairnhill  quite rightly said that  it  would

mean  that  the  Assembly would  be  committed  to

approve  of  items of expenditure the  details  of

which  they do not know. I think that is  a  valid

submission  to  make,  and  I  trust  he  will  be

satisfied  with two assurances which I  will  make

before the House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2417</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, that we shall limit as far as possible

O.C.S.E. items to replacements of equipment,  very

essential  purchases  of, say,  new  equipment  to

maintain efficiency, provision of certain items of

expenditure such as scholarships to which  we  are

in  any  case  committed. We  shall  be  extremely

careful about introducing items such as this, i.e.

getting new types of equipment which in the normal

course  of  events would go to the  Assembly  for

approval. That is the first assurance I make.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second assurance that I give to the Assembly

is  that we hope it will be possible to frame the

Budget  for  1963 if not by the end of next  year,

then as soon as possible after that.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the difficulty we are faced with is

this:  the  Minister did say in  page  37  of  the

"first  copy"  of  the Hansard that  the  Vote  on

Account  asked  for  is  in  respect  of  annually

recurrent   expenditure.  He  also  went   on   to

enumerate  and categorise what annually  recurrent

expenditure  meant. He said that such  expenditure

is  incurred in regular amounts each month,  being

payment  of  salaries to staff,  regular  services

used  by  the  Government such  as  water,  light,

electricity, stationery, telephone rentals, and so

forth.  The enumerated and categorised items,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, are normally items which come  under

annually recurrent charges. So I regret it  rather

puts  us  in a difficult position for the Minister

to say now that he made a slip of the tongue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if one examines the 1963 Estimates, Paper

Cmd. 39 of 1961, the Minister in his statement  at

page 1, paragraph 2, says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The estimates containing a vote on account below

provide for six months requirements for the public

services  shown  under  the  respective  Heads  of

expenditure  for 1963. They are calculated  at  55

per  cent of the votable expenditure appearing  in

the 1962 Estimates.'



<br><br>The    important   phrase   there   is    "votable

expenditure". Votable expenditure is  set  out  in

page  42  of the 1962 Estimates, and the vota'b'le

estimate  appears  at  the  bottom  of  the  fifth

column - $352,920,900. Next to it, Mr Speaker, Sir,

is  "Statutory Expenditure 1962 - $41.105 million"

which is not votable expenditure. And if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2418</b></font><br><br>



you  will be good enough to turn to page 44  where

there is a further categorisation of total amounts

to  be  spent; the first column there is "Head  of

Expenditure";    then   "Personal    Emoluments"; "Annually Recurrent"; and the "Total". On this page

44,  Mr Speaker, Sir, Special Expenditure amounts

to $48,150,370. It is a big sum. It is not a small

sum. If the Minister says it is only a small item,

it  is not, because $48 million is very much  more

than  the Statutory Expenditure which we  have  to

incur,  being  $41 million. So it is an  important

item.  Now, that is the difficulty that we in  the

Opposition  find ourselves in - that  we  are  being

asked to vote, by the manner in which the Minister

has approached this problem in asking for a 55 per

cent  vote,  on what is known as "votable  expenditure",  which  includes special  expenditure.  And

special expenditure amounts to $48 million. If you

will  look  at  page  43, under  the  Ministry  of

National  Development, Head  20,  the  special  ex

penditure  is  $6.05  million.  And  the   special

expenditure for the Minister himself [Head 32]  is

$32.017  million.  Quite  a  big  sum!  What   the

Minister  wants us to give him is 55 per  cent  of

this  $32  million by virtue of this  Vote  on  Ac

count,which  the Opposition might not be  prepared

to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the position now is this. Because of the

manner  in  which this has been presented  to  the

House,  I think it will become necessary  for  the

Opposition to vote against all the provisions  for

the Heads which the Minister is asking, unless  he

is  prepared to withdraw this Vote on Account  and

come back to the Assembly on a different basis.  I

myself,  Mr Speaker, Sir, do not think that  this

is  proper  time  at which this  Vote  on  Account

should  be  asked  for. If the Minister  had  felt

honestly  that  he  could not  have  prepared  his

Estimates  for 1963 in time, i.e. in  November  or

December of this year, he could quite easily  have

presented  this  Vote  on  Account  sometime  next

year - March   or  April,  June  or  July - and   the

Assembly would have been prepared to look at it.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall :</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2419</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> But the manner in which this has been

brought to the Asembly leaves one in doubt,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, on a number of matters. After  all,

Sir, the only effective control the Opposition has

over  the Government is the Annual Estimates.  The

Government  could  govern  without  convening  the

Asembly,  but  by virtue of the Constitution,  the

Government has to come annually to the Assembly to

get a vote for the following year.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member for Farrer Park

is  embarking on an issue which is. I  think,  now

barred by reason of the fact that the House did not

take the opportunity when it presented itself.  He

has made his point indirectly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> So that is the position the

Opposition finds itself in - that the Opposition  is

constitutionally  bound to exercise  control  over

the  Government on expenditure. The  position  the

Opposition ncw finds itself in, Sir, is that it is

going  to  give  the Government  arte  blanche  in

matters  of  expenditure to the end of June  1963,

which the Opposition is not prepared to do.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, both the Member for

Cairnhill  and  the Member for  Farrer  Park  made

objections  on  just this fact:  that  while  they

would  not mind agreeing to a Vote on Account  for

Personal  Emoluments  and Other  Charges  Annually

Recurrent, their contention is that the  vote  for

Special Expenditure, amounting to $48 million,  is

a  big item and carte blanche for so large an item

of expenditure does not appear acceptable to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I just explain to the Members of the

Opposition   that  of  the  $48  million   Special

Expenditure, $30 million (the biggest single item)

would  be a contribution to the Development  Fund.

You are left, therefore, with $18 million. Now  of

that $18 million, the biggest single item would be

the  Ministry  of  National Development -  some  $6

million, and nearly the whole lot of that goes  to

expenditure  on the Work Brigade.  These  are,  in

fact, really annually recurrent expenditure. They



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2420</b></font><br><br>



are  not something special, not something that has

been  sprung on the Opposition as a new item. When

I  use  the words "annually recurrent", I was  not

using  them in the technical sense when referring

to   O.C.A.R. items  Therefore,  the  balance  of

Special  Expenditure, after the deduction  of  $30

million  contribution to the Development Fund  and

the cost of maintaining the Work Brigade, amounts

to  some  $12, million. And six  months  of  such

expenditure  would  be  a  sum  of  just  over  $6

million. I do not think the Opposition.,  if  they

consider  these facts, could say  that  they  are

giving the Government an undue measure of freedom

in financial expenditure.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I just want to answer the Minister

on  the two points he raised. The first point  was

about  the  $30 million which appears  under  Head

32, page 346 of the Estimates, subhead  34 - Allocation to Development Fund, $30 million. I  do

agree with the Minister that that is a big sum. We

voted  that  sum last year too; we have  voted  it

this  year,  and  the  Minister  thinks  that  the

Assembly  will  vote  it next  year  too.  In  all

fairness,  I  do  not  think the  Minister  should

assume  that.  If, for some reason,, the  Assembly

comes to the conclusion that the Development  Fund

is  not doing all it can, and there are sums  left

in the Development Fund, it could well be that the

Assembly might not vote the $30 million.  That  is

in reply to that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point the Minister made was in respect

of  the Ministry of National Development, Head 20,

page

150.  It  is  quite  true that subhead  41,  Work

Brigade  Projects, $5,890,170, is the  main  item.

But  here again, Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Assembly

were  to  come to the conclusion that the projects

envisaged for 1963 are such that the Assembly does

not  approve them, then the vote could  easily  be

knocked out. But the point at the moment is this:

without  the Assembly knowing anything about  this

special expenditure, we are being asked to vote 55

per cent of $5.89 million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2421</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Minister is trying

to  explain  away his mis-statement.  He  is  now

trying   to  say  that  when  he  said   annually

recurrent expenditure,

he did not mean O.C.A.R. But let us examine his

statement again. He did

itemise. He did give examples of what he meant

by annually recurrent expenditure, such as

regular amounts each month being payments for

salaries of

staff, regular services used by the Government,

such as water, light,

electricity, stationery, telephone, rents and so

on and so forth. All these mean

P.E. and  O.C.A.R. and  nothing  else.  I  must

register  my  very  strong  protest  against  the

manner   in  which  these  estimates  have   been

prepared. They have not been prepared in  keeping

with   the   ministerial  statement.  They   were

brought  in  at a time when we had  been  sitting

for 22 days, and when every

Member of the Assembly was very tired. If it  had

been   a  true  statement,  no  one  would   have

challenged it. But that

statement  has now been proved to be a misleading

statement.  It  is now left to the Opposition  to

show  its  protest and disgust at the  manner  in

which  this has been presented by voting  against

every item under every Head.

the  Judges are a very small body, but they  are

the  balance wheel of our constitution.  I  have

raised  this matter before and received  a  most

unsatisfactory reply, a reply completely lacking

in  imagination, suggesting that our  Government

intends  to  do  nothing about a small  body  of

extremely important people constitutionally,  although  they recognise that the remuneration  is

grossly inadequate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2423</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I say that it is important

that their status should be

recognised as equivalent to Ministers. I say that

being  conscious  that  they  are  being  grossly

underpaid, we should give them justice. I do  ask

the Minister for

Finance  to give us an assurance that he will  so

alter their remuneration as to bring their status

outside the civil service ambit. I know - and it is

unfortunate  that he himself has been conditioned

for so long in the civil

service - we can only see them in the context of

the  civil  service pay. It is inappropriate  for

Judges.  I  say we do not have to wait until  the

Federation takes a decision. We should be able to

take  a  decision  now without prejudice  to  any

schemes which the Federation

may  seek to impose on all Federal judges if  and

when  the  closer political relationship proposed

is ultimately achieved. I do urge the Minister to

recognise that this is a matter of some  gravity.

It  should  not be dealt with lackadaisically  in

such a cavalier fashion as it has been dealt with

so  far.  Let us not have only sympathy.  Let  us

have action.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the hon. Member move?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I apologise. I move,

by $100.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, as usual the Member for

Anson  has  over-reached himself. He has  charged

the Government with dealing with this subject  in

a  lackadaisical fashion and treating Judges in a

cavalier manner. What is the evidence on which he

makes  this  accusation,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir?   I

already  said,  in  reply to his  question,  that

Government   was  considering  changes   in   the

remuneration of Judges. I was not prepared to  go

further  because  at that time  discussions  were

taking  place  between  the  Government  and  the

Judges  on these matters. For this reason,  I  am

not  in a position to make any statement on  this

subject.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2424</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, he complains

that  I  am  making unfair comments and  without

evidence.  The  evidence is that the  Government

has  been  conscious  for a  long  time  of  the

inadequate  remuneration  of  the  Judges.   The

Federation has moved as far back as the  1st  of

June,  and  there have been new  provisions  for

Federation  Judges. Will the  Minister  tell  us

when we may expect action from this Government?

<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have made a study of

what the Federation Judges receive and what  our

Judges  receive. The information has  been  very

carefully  tabulated and from the  figures,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, we find that there is very  little

difference between what our Judges get and  what

the  Federation Judges receive. In the  case  of

High Court Judges in England, their salaries are

more or less equated to what the permanent heads

of  the  British civil service get, and  we  can

say,  Mr Speaker, that similar equations  exist

both in Singapore and the Federation of Malaya.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I understood the

Government   accepted  as  a   fact   that   the

remuneration  of  the Judges was  inadequate.  I

understood  the Government accepted  as  a  fact

that  it is inappropriate that the salary scales

should be equated with the civil service scales.

I  do  ask  that there be some action  in  those

circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 7

be reduced by $100.*

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The same amendment also stood in the name of

Mr David Marshall.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the same matter as that which I

raised  under  Head  1. In fact,  Sir,  all  the

amendments that I have put



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2425</b></font><br><br>

in  are of a similar character. I have not put in

amendments for every Head, because I am satisfied

that  the  little bit extra to be voted  for  the

other  Heads  will not give the  Government  much

leeway  to do what it likes. But on this Head  of

Prime Minister, Sir, the total for O.C.S.E. comes

to $546,090. At 55 per cent, we are asked to vote

about  $300,000 for the Prime Minister to use  as

special expenditure. What do we see under special

expenditure,  Sir,  under this  Prime  Minister's

Head?  We  have  here an item  of  two  cars  for

replacement. There were two cars for  replacement

in   1961,  two  more  cars  are  asked  for  for

replacement  in  1962,  and  the  two  cars  cost

$47,030.   Then   again,  the  furnishings   .for

Temasek, Kuala Lumpur, that is $30,000; Furniture

and  Equipment for State Guest House $5,000;  and

other matters into which I will not go. But  this

amount  of $82,000, it does. I do not think  this

expenditure will be incurred again. But  then  by

approving  a vote on account of 55 per  cent  for

items  that  will  not be used - again  that  money

could  be  used  if  the Government  thought  it

necessary to buy another three cars for the Prime

Minister - then we will have no control whatsoever.

I  feel we could save the time of this House if I

appeal  to  the Minister for Finance to  withdraw

this  and  get his staff to work on  it;  and  if

where items under O.C.S.E. are, in fact, and  can

be  described as O.C.A.R., then put them in,  put

in a provision of 55 per cent for them. But where

the  items are of a special character,  like  the

purchase of cars, furnishings of guest houses and

what  not, which definitely will not be  incurred

again  in 1963, leave them out. Then we would  be

quite  satisfied.  But as it  is,  because  of  a

ministerial  misstatement, we  are  beginning  to

have  doubts of the intentions of the Government.

So  I  would  suggest  the Minister  for  Finance

withdraw this and get his staff to spend  another

month on it. Then come back to this Assembly with

an  application for a vote which is more  related

to  what  is required to be used in 1963, instead

of coming here and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2426</b></font><br><br>

asking us for something which is more than  what

is  required to be used for 1963. If he will  do

this,  then there will be a need for me to  move

an amendment to every item. Otherwise it will be

my  duty  to stand up in this Assembly on  every

item  and describe the attempt by the Government

to  foist something on the Opposition which  has

been   done  through  a  mis-statement  of   the

Minister for Finance.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you. Mr Chairman,

I  rise  to  support this motion on the  ground

that  the  position of the Prime  Minister  has

been  utilised  for  purposes  of  abusing  the

people  of  Singapore  and  bringing  us   into

disrepute  and contempt. The Prime Minister  of

Singapore, a citizen of Singapore himself,  has

been  indulging,  as  Prime  Minister  of  this

territory, in constant abuse of the  people  of

Singapore, whereby he has built up an image  of

a people who are Communists or proCommunists, a

people  who  are  to be feared,  a  people  who

indulge in riots; in fact, a people for whom it

is  necessary  to  seek outside  assistance  to

control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to protest in the most vigorous

fashion    permissible   under    parliamentary

procedure  against  the conduct  of  the  Prime

Minister  in  that respect. I  know  there  are

rules  which  prevent  us from  discussing  the

conduct  of  a Member outside this  House,  but

this is conduct as a Prime Minister. I am sorry

he  is  not  here to hear this.  It  cannot  be

postponed  to another time. But I say  that  he

has  given  a  false, a grossly  inaccurate,  a

grossly improper, a grossly untrue picture of a

decent people and that we are no more cancerous

or  diseased  than any Member  in  this  House.

Every human being has a few germs in his blood.

That  does  not make him any the less  healthy.

There  are  no healthier people, there  are  no

more  decent people, and there is not a  better

State in the world than this island of ours, or

a greater one - things which have been forgotten,

thanks to the Prime Minister and the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2427</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I propose to ignore the

outburst.  I  think  it makes  no  impression  on

anybody.  But the Member for Cairnhill  raised  a

point  which  I think requires some answer.  Now,

under the O.C.S.E. Head, like the subhead in  the

Prime  Minister's Office, surely, this reinforces

the  point I was making earlier; that  out  of  a

total  amount of $546,000 voted for in  the  1962

estimates,  about  90 per  cent  is  to  pay  for

expenses  in  our  two trade  divisions,  one  in

Jakarta  and one in the United Kingdom. You  will

find as we go along, Mr Speaker, Sir, that these

are   necessary  items  of  expenditure.  I  hake

already   given  the  Member  for  Cairnhill   an

assurance  that great care will be taken  to  see

that we shall not spend money on new items which,

in  the ordinary course of events, should  go  to

the  Assembly for consideration in detail, and  I

think that assurance could be accepted.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I personally have no desire to

embarrass   the  Government.  It   may   be   the

Government was caught short on this and  made  an

overstatement which it possibly now regrets.  But

I  hope  the  Minister will also  understand  the

point  of view of the Opposition that if we  vote

for this we are giving him carte blanche. Whether

he  accepts  it  or not, it is,  in  fact,  carte

blanche  for him to spend the money. But  if  the

Minister  will  undertake that no money  will  be

spent on these items of special expenditure (what

we say is special expenditure is that which comes

under  column  4  on  pages  43  and  44  of  the

Estimates)  without coming to this  House  for  a

resolution  on  it, then, so  far  as  I  and  my

colleagues  en the Front bench are concerned,  we

will be prepared to accept it. I do not know what

my colleagues behind are going to say on this.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I do not know whether

I   understood  the  Member  for   Farrer   Park

correctly. Did he say that we should  net  spend

any  O.C.S.E. items without a resolution of  the

Assembly'?  For  instance, we have  to  pay  the

salaries  of the staff in the Trade  Offices  in

Indonesia  and in London. Does it mean  that  we

should  not  do it without the approval  of  the

Assembly? If you are going to say. "Well,  look,

you should refrain from incurring expenditure on

items  like  cars, furniture, etc, without  the

approval of the Assembly," I am prepared to give

that kind of undertaking on things which are new

items as distinct replacements of equipment.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I find it difficult to understand why  the

Minister  seeks  money which he is  prepared  to

undertake  not  to  spend.  Surely  the   simple

procedure would be for him to concede  that  all

the  $48  million  or the 55  per  cent  thereof

should be deleted from the vote.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Surely what the Member for

Farrer  Park is asking is very simple.  He  says

that  in order not to hold up the debate or  the

approval  of this vote on account, he  wants  an

assurance from the Minister that no money  under

O.C.S.E. will be spent unless by a resolution of

this Assembly, and that is only to take place in

1963. Even in the course of the whole year 1962,

the  Minister can get one of the civil  servants

in his Ministry to work out what is required for

1963,  and  he can just table a motion  covering

every



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2429</b></font><br><br>

item.  It will then mean that we do not  have  to

hold  up  the  debate on this  vote  on  account,

otherwise  it will be necessary, in the  interest

of  the  right use of the funds of the people  of

Singapore,  for  the Opposition to  vote  against

every item.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am trying to come to an

understanding  with the Opposition  on  this.  Is

this  correct? They say that sometime next  year,

if  time  is given to work through the  O.C.S.E.

items, and we give this undertaking and say, "All

right, we will give details of what is required,"

then  they are prepared to carry on. Well,  I  am

prepared to give that undertaking.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Can I have a little

clarification, Sir? It is very ambiguous. What is

the  undertaking?  Do  we  understand  that  the

undertaking is that no part of the money which is

for O.C.S.E. will be spent except by a resolution

of  this House with reference to detailed  items?

Is that it?

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, that is the position.

Sometime next year, I shall present to the  House

details  of  the  O.C.S.E. items  and  seek  the

approval  of  the House to spend that  money  for 1963.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Tun Lim, do you wish for a vote?

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, before I withdraw, there

is another assurance which is necessary, that the

money  voted  for O.C.S.E. - the 55 per cent - should

not  be  used by the Government for other  items - O.C.A.R. or P.E. That is another undertaking.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, what my colleague, the Member

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has said that

the  O.C.S.E. - I am only touching on  this  in

passing - contains a vote of $5 million for the

Work  Brigade. In view of the fact  that  the

Work  Brigade  is now turning  out  to  be  a

Frankenstein to the P.A.P. Government,  would

the  Minister  make a statement  of  what  is

happening now in the Work Brigade where  even

soldiers have to be used?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Chair is in a difficulty.

If  the  Member for Cairnhill wants  to  know

what the present position of the Work Brigade

is, then he should not raise it on a vote  on

account for 1963. But if he puts it this way - that  in view of what is happening now,  does

the  Minister  think that  the  Work  Brigade

should be in existence in 1963? - then  that

is in order.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> That was what I meant

originally.  I  thank you for your  guidance,

Sir. The reason why I put all that in is that

the   big  O.C.S.E. is  there.  I  was  most

disturbed  when I read the Free  Press  as  I

came  in.  That  is  why  I  am  taking  this

opportunity of asking

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2433</b></font><br><br>

the Minister whether he thinks it advisable,  in

the  light of what is now happening in the  Work

Brigade,  where even troops and the police  have

to  be  used, to continue with the Work  Brigade

right up to 1963.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, we consider it

advisable to continue to 1963. I do not think we

can let incidents like this upset our plan.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  fully realise that the Barisan Sosialis

would  be accused of having fomented trouble  and

all  that,  and I rise to speak because,  as  you

have  read  in the papers and as the  Member  for

Cairnhill  has just mentioned, troops  have  been

used in the camps.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has said that the

trouble in the Work Brigade is the fourth  round.

We  do  not know what round it is, but if  it  is

truly  the  fourth round, I can assure  him  that

there  will be a kayo for the P.A.P. in the fifth

round.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Does that mean the fifth

round will be in 1963?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I think the P.A.P. will be

knocked  out  long before that. As I was  passing

the -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I tried to indicate how

this  debate should go on. I do not know  whether

the Member for Queenstown is coming to the point,

that  in view of what is happening, the vote  for

the  Work  Brigade should not stand for 1963.  If

that  is  his  attitude, then  of  course  he  is

correct.  But  if he is not urging that,  then  I

think these details become irrelevant.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, Sir, if the Work Brigade

should ever exist in 1963, then let us hope  that

things like this will not happen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I went to the Airport early this morning -

<br><br>3.45 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I cannot allow that. These

details, I think, cannot be debated. We are on  a

Vote  on  Account for 1963. We should  focus  our

attention on 1963 - to consider whether a vote of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2434</b></font><br><br>

this nature would be necessary in 1963. If it  is

necessary,  then these details do  not  arise  at

all.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Can I draw your attention,

Sir,  to  the little bit of trouble  that  is  at

present in the Work Brigade, so that we may  take

precautions and so that similar trouble will  not

happen in 1963?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please continue.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> As far as I know, Sir, there

is grave dissatisfaction in the Work Brigade, and

this stands under two heads.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I cannot allow that. I

think  the course the Member can take is to claim

the  right to speak on the adjournment or move  a

motion on the matter.

squatters. It is a problem which is with  us  and

which will be with us in 1963.

notices to a fairly large number of squatters, in

so  far  as  I  can  ascertain,  asking  them  to

demolish unauthorised buildings and evicting them

from  their land. I would wish the Government  to

consider establishing a policy for the period  in

question   whereby,  though  these   people   are

unquestionably  in  the  wrong,   Mr   Chairman,

nevertheless  the  problem of  housing  being  as

acute  as  it  is,  should  be  approached   with

understanding.   I   would   like   this   policy

established, that where it is possible to  permit

unauthorised structures to continue -

speaking about demolition of buildings  which  1

understand the Minister to claim as being  under

there   should  be  an  established  policy   of

sympathetic consideration of the needs of  these

people  and  an  attempt  made  by  him  or  his

colleagues  to live them alternative  sites,  or

where   possible  to  refrain  from  demolishing

unauthorised   structures   unless   they    are

genuinely   of  a  character  which  make   them

unhealthy.

answer that?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 31

be reduced by $100,

<br><br>in   respect   of  the  State  Advocate-General's

Chambers. These Chambers, Mr Speaker, have  been

chronically  understaffed for as long  as  I  can

remember.  I remember I urged, when I  was  in  a

position  to  do  so,  that we  should  have  the

staffing  position improved. But it is a  curious

thing.  It  is the only department in  Government

that I know which is anxious not to increase  its

staff.  Sir,  I say that today though  there  has

been  a  recruitment, there is,  in  fact,  acute

understaffing.   We   have  heard   through   the

newspapers,  the favourite medium of  information

of  the  Government,  that we  are  recruiting  a

gentleman  from  Australia to  assist  the  State

Advocate-General in criminal court  prosecutions,

and  that  we are recruiting some other gentlemen

from overseas for civil matters. Those, like many

others, have proved abortive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Government whether, in fact, it is

conscious that the staffing position of the State

Advocate-General's Department is inadequate,  and

what measures it intends to take.

worried  about these three legal appointments.  I

must  mention  to  the  House  that  one  of  the

I rise to move the motion standing in my name,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 32

be reduced by $100.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I wish to draw the House's

attention to the Income Tax Department. I  have

been reliably informed by a firm of accountants

of  repute  it  is  not a  matter  of  personal

prejudice that, until the advent of the  P.A.P.

and   before   the  departure  of  the   former

Comptroller  of Income Tax, the Department  was

far   more   approachable  than   corresponding

departments   in   the   United   Kingdom   and

Australia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to draw attention

to one minor aspect in which I was involved. In

1960  a  new section, section 86 of the  Income

Tax  Ordinance, was introduced which - makes  tax

payable  within seven days, not tax  on  monies

which  have  been earned, Sir, but tax  on  the

current year's income. If it is not paid within

30 days, Sir, then immediately it attracts a  5

per  cent penalty, not 5 per cent per annum but

5  per cent on the total amount allegedly  due.

Even  if there was an error in computation  and

it  is pointed out to the Comptroller and there

is correspondence, if you exceed the 30 days by

one day, there is a 5 per cent penalty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is true that there is a discretion in

the  Comptroller  whether that  penalty  should

apply  or  not. I give you this  case,  Sir,I

received a notice, and in due course I wrote by

sending  a cheque for one-third of my  tax  and

asking  whether I could pay the remaining  two-thirds during the next two months. Sir,  I  had

just exceeded the period,- I think, by about  a

day or so. I received a reply to say, "Yes, but

the 5 per cent penalty

applies." Now, a 5 per cent penalty for the first

month  makes it 60 per cent interest  per  annum.

And  a  5  per cent penalty for the second  month

makes  it  30  per  cent per annum.  The  Finance

Minister, who is a statistician, can do  his  own

calculation; but it does mean, Sir, that for  two

months'  grace I had to pay 45 per cent  interest

per annum. We rightfully condemn money lenders as

criminals who charge more than 24 per cent annum.

But  documents  are available to prove  that  the

Comptroller  of Income Tax asked, in effect,  for

45  per cent interest per annum. I promptly  went

to  the  bank, Sir, and made arrangements to  pay

forthwith by cheque. And when I did pay  it,  protesting  vigorously, I received a letter to  say,

"Well, in the circumstances, you need not pay  it

and the penalty will not apply."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position, Sir, is obvious: that the

Comptroller  of Income Tax did not  exercise  his

discretion - that,  in  fact, these  almost  lethal

powers   are  being  used  indiscriminately   and

probably  used  by junior officials  without  con

sidering the principle involved. I say that it is

necessary  for  the  Income  Tax  Department   to

protect  the revenue and it is perhaps  sometimes

necessary to be unpleasant about it. But there is

no  need to act like thugs or to try to earn  the

reputation of thugs. There is no need to be tough

guys.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have received complaints of delays in

refunds.  You see, Sir, you have got to pay  your

tax  within 30 days in spite of any complaint you

put in. But if you complain in good time, and  it

is  graciously  viewed by the  Comptroller,  even

then,  Sir,  you  have to wait a very  long  time

before you get any refund.

<br><br>4.00 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do say, Sir, that there is, particularly in

the   Income   Tax  Department,  an   unfortunate

tendency   to  absorb  all  too  readily   P.A.P.

traditions  of tough guys. All too  readily  they

are  acting in a manner wholly incompatible  with

the conduct one expects and is entitled to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2440</b></font><br><br>

expect from a civil service - consideration and,

particularly,   an   intelligent   exercise   of

discretion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, just on the evidence

of   his  one  experience  in  the  Income   Tax

Department,  the  Member for Anson  has  decided

that the Inland Revenue Department is guilty  of

indiscriminate  use of its powers.  Sir,  may  I

suggest that one swallow does not make a summer.

If  the Member for Anson wants to convince us of

his  proposition, he must surely bring more than

his  own personal experience, unfortunate though

it was at the beginning. But the fact, Sir, that

he was let off in the end -

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I was not let off.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am sorry, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I beg your pardon. I

understood  him to say that after  he  had  paid

off, the Comptroller did say that he would waive

his tax. Is that right? This is not the way.  If

I  am  that thuggish, I suggest that the  Member

for  Anson  would  be  more troubled  than  what

actually happened to him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the delay of refund, that point was

made  by the Member for Farrer Park. I did make

inquiries   from  the  Comptroller  of   Inland

Revenue, and he assured me that there  was  no

intention  at all on the part of his Department

to  hang on to money that was not due to it. He

gave   an  assurance  that  he  himself   would

intervene  personally should any  instances  be

brought  to his notice. Here again,  Sir,  wild

allegations  are being made by the  Member  for

Anson with no supporting evidence whatsoever.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, it is so easy to

indulge in abuse - "wild allegations". I do not

know  what  is  wild about  what  I  said.  "No

evidence  whatsoever", he says. Mr Speaker,  I

quoted  information received which the Minister

has, because I wrote him a letter incorporating

it   from  one  of  the  outstanding  firms  of

accounting   in   Singapore,  in   which   they

complained of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2441</b></font><br><br>

the  conduct  of the Income Tax Department  since

the  P.A.P. took  over. I gave him  an  instance

where his Comptroller sought to charge me 45  per

cent  per annum. I paid from the bank immediately

without   seeking   that   indulgence   at    the

Government's  cut-throat  rate.  Is   that   wild

allegation - that 45 per cent per annum?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you are aware that until the

Committee  of  Privileges rules,  I  am  somewhat

forced  to  refrain from referring to information

which  came  into my possession in a professional

capacity,  even  though I may  have  my  client's

permission  to  disclose it.  Those  instances  I

cannot  disclose. But at least is it not  a  fact

those  things which I have stated, and  are  they

not  indicative? Is it not recognised that  there

is,  in fact, a general dissatisfaction with  the

management of the Income Tax Department?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

before  I  go on, I need your guidance whether  I

can  touch on the question of the mishandling  of

the  presentation  of the 1963 Estimates  by  the

Government under this item.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> What point is that?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> I mean under Head 32, can I

speak  on the question of the mishandling of  the

presentation  of  the  1963  Estimates   by   the

Government?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not quite get what the hon.

Member desires to do. But we have dealt with that

aspect  of  the matter. The Minister for  Finance

has  given an undertaking that a motion  - correct

me  if I am wrong - will be moved in due course  in

1962  in connection with the special expenditure.

I  thought that was the solution. I do  not  know

what  other point the hon. Member wishes to touch

on.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

touch on the statement made by the Minister  for

Finance  on  the  4th of December.  It  was  the

explanation  given  by  the  Minister   on   the

presentation of the 1963 Estimates.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Which page and which paragraph?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2442</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Page 35 ,of the "first

copy"  of  the  Hansard. I will  touch  on  the

statement in the various paragraphs.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If it is a general debate on

that  statement,  I  have indicated  that  that

cannot  be  done. The point was raised  by  the

Member  for  Cairnhill that the statement  that

the  vote on account took in 55 per cent of the 1962 Budget also indicated that 55 per cent  of

the  special expenditure is to be voted by this

House on account. The point was taken that  the

House  would not know how that money was to  be

spent,  and  that  point was  resolved  by  the

Minister  giving the undertaking that  no  such

special expenditure would be undertaken without

a  resolution  of this House.  I  do  not  know

whether  there  is  any other  point  the  hon.

Member wishes to touch on.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my whole

idea  is  that  it  is not  necessary  for  the

Government  to bring up, at this juncture,  the 1963  Estimates. It is simply wasting the  time

of this House.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is a point I made at the very

beginning - I do not know whether the hon. Member

was  here - that if he had wished to  raise  that

point,   he  should  have  insisted  that   the

Minister move the adjournment of the House when

he  offered  to  do  that, so  that  his  whole

statement could be debated. The opportunity has

been  lost.  The  hon. Member cannot  raise  it

again now. We are still on Head 32, Ministry of

Finance. Does the Member for Anson wish  for  a

vote  or  does he wish to add to  what  he  has

said?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir. I wish to say that the reasons given  for

the  presentation  of these Estimates  at  this

juncture  suggest an inefficiency in the  staff

in  the Ministry of Finance, which seems  inade

quate for the normal requirements of presenting

a Budget in appropriate time; or else, Sir, the

utilisation  of  the  Standing  Order  by   the

Minister  for  purposes  of  bringing  about  a

position



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2443</b></font><br><br>



whereby the Government can rule without convening

the Assembly. In either

case,   my  motion  is  reinforced,  as  I  would

respectfully suggest in this instance, as a  vote

of censure which I intend to press.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 38

be reduced by $100.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Minister for Finance to inform

the House whether he considers that in 1963,  we

will  still have an Exchange Control Department,

and if so, Sir, for what purposes?

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> In 1963, we shall have

Exchange  Control unless, in the  meantime,  the

Central  Bank  of the Federation of  Malaya  has

established its branch in Singapore to take over

the  duties  of  Exchange  Control.  It  is  not

possible  now to say whether it will come  about

by  1963. Other than that eventuality, we  shall

have our Exchange Control.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I would ask the

Minister  whether  he  has ever  considered  the

appropriateness  of the provisions  of  Exchange

Control to this area, which should be as free as

possible  from any controls hampering  financial

activities.  Why should they be  necessary  here

and for whose benefit are they in force?

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Malayan  dollar is linked with sterling  whereby

the  currency backing of the Malayan  dollar  is

held, under the law, in sterling securities.  It

is  the responsibility of all governments in the

sterling  area,  i.e.,  all  governments   whose

currencies are backed by sterling in one way  or

the  other,  to  exercise a degree  of  exchange

control  for a general purpose, to see that  the

basic  common  unit  on which  their  individual

currencies are based is fully protected,  should

such  protection  be  necessary.  Sterling,   of

course, in the last few years has been a  strong

currency,  although  recently  in  England,  the

British Government has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2445</b></font><br><br>

felt  there  is  a  certain balance  of  payments

problem.  Improvement in the standing of sterling

has  made  it  possible for  Singapore  to  relax

nearly  all  its exchange control  provisions  in

line  with the policy taken by the Government  of

the  Federation  of Malaya. One hopes  that  this

happy  state  of affairs will continue.  But  one

cannot  say  for certain that this  will  be  the

case,  and  so  long as there is any  possibility

that  the  sterling  area  could  experience  the

balance of payment difficulties, exchange control

would be necessary as an instrument of Government

policy.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

understand the Minister. I am not sure whether  I

do.  Exchange control is enforced for the benefit

of  the sterling area but not for our own. We are

in  a  strong  position. Sterling  itself  having

achieved a fairly strong position, Singapore  has

been  able  to relax those controls  to  a  major

extent,  and it is hoped that in the future  they

will   be  completely  removed.  Do  I  have   an

assurance  from  the  Government  that  they  are

conscious of the importance of giving the maximum

freedom  to  trade in this area, and that  it  is

their  duty to put the maximum pressure at  their

disposal  for special treatment of Singapore  for

the removal of all exchange control restrictions?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, those considerations

are   always   present  in  the  minds   of   the

Government, and I can assure the House  that  the

government  of an entrepot centre  such  as  ours

must  press  for the largest area of  freedom  in

these matters.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, I

rise to move the amendment standing in my name,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 48

be reduced by $100.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this amendment, Sir, is; to seek

an  assurance from the Government that they will

honestly   and   conscientiously  refrain   from

utilising   community  associations  for   party

political purposes, that they will take  earnest

steps  to  prevent those community  associations

from  being  used not only for P.A.P. purposes,

but  for any other political purposes, that they

will be strictly administered for the welfare of

the  community associations and not as  breeding

grounds for the P.A.P.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter that I wish to raise, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  is  on  the  subject  of  public

assistance, with reference to 1963.  It  is  not

adequate  to raise public assistance  by  5  per

cent  in 1963. Mr Speaker, I ask the Government

to  consider the report to which I have  already

referred,  which  advised that  we  should  have

statutory   provisions  in  respect  of   public

assistance,  that  it  is  this  Assembly  which

should be responsible for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2447</b></font><br><br>

exact amounts to be paid out in public assistance

and not at the whim of the Government from day to

day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also revert, Mr Speaker, to the

question  of  allowance to tuberculosis  patients

who are not citizens. Mr Speaker, I hope to make

my   point  clear,  that  though  there  is  some

political  justification for saying we  will  not

give  allowance to the indigent if they are  non-citizens, that is false economy in the context of

tuberculosis patients, because tuberculosis, Sir,

knows no barrier of citizenship and a non-citizen

can infect citizens of Singapore. I would like an

assurance  from  the Government  that  they  will

reintroduce payment of tuberculosis allowance  to

non-citizens.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b>

Mr  Speaker, I will answer the point  raised  by

the Member for Anson on community centres and  my

colleague, the Minister for Health and Law,  will

reply to the one on public assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intention of the Government that

community  centres should be run solely  for  the

benefit  of  the community living in a particular

area. I do not believe that Members of this House

will  support  any  idea that  community  centres

should  be  used  as, what the Member  for  Anson

terms,   "breeding  grounds"  for  either  P.A.P.

members  or  Workers' Party  members  or  Barisan

Sosialis  members  or S.P.A. members.  I  do  not

think we want to make community centres political

centres.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> They have been.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I can point to one model, and

that  is the community centre in Rochore.  It  is

still called the Stamford Community Centre. It is

a  very  old  centre. The residents who  live  in

that, area form the committee. They run their own

centre  and no party politics has been introduced

there.  It  is our intention that in  future  all

community  centres will be kept free  from  party

politics.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2448</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>4.30 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have again

been accused by the Member for Anson. He is apt

to  make - I  would  not describe  them  as  wild

statements, but pretty exaggerated statements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the hon. Member will look up the 1961

Estimates  he  will find that  the  expenditure

voted on public assistance was $7,760,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to increase the rate for the

head of a household by another $5, we have  had

to  increase that vote to $8,980,000, which  is

an  increase  of  $1,220,000.  All  the  family

budgets  are  related to the expenditure  which

this  Assembly approves. We have a lot of other

commitments - not only public assistance. We have

our  educational programme and our medical  and

health  programme, and this is  the  amount  of

money   that  we  can  afford  in  the  present

circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of T.B. treatment allowances,

it is true that we had to stop these allowances

for people who are not citizens for reasons  of

economy. It does not mean to say that they  are

left to fend for themselves. We have the mass X-ray  teams  which  go  round.  They  have  been

visiting various parts of Singapore. They  have

been  isolating  all cases of  T.B. and  these

cases are being sent regularly to S.A.T.A. for

treatment. So that if we find a deserving or  a

hard  case where a person is a non-citizen  and

is  suffering from T.B., we try to help him out

by  contributions from the Silver Jubilee Fund.

The  Silver  Jubilee  Fund  is  used  for  that

purpose.  So it is not true to say that  we  do

nothing for people suffering from T.B. who  are

non-citizens.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> In view of the assurance of

the Deputy Prime Minister, could we ask him  to

clarify a couple of points? So far as we  know,

only P.A.P. Assemblymen have been asked to open

community   centres.  In  future,   would   the

Government ask Opposition Assemblymen  to  open

community centres? In view of the fact that the

present   Board  of  Management  is  completely

political, would the Deputy Prime Minister make

it non-political?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2449</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot

agree  with the Member for Queenstown  that  only

P.A.P.  Assemblymen have been  opening  community

centres.  He himself opened one. The  Member  for

Nee  Soon, the Member for Pasir Panjang  and  the

Member   for   Havelock  have  opened   community

centres.  How  can  it be said that  only  P.A.P.

Assemblymen have been opening community  centres?

But  I  must say this: if in future any community

centre should be opened in a ward where there  is

an  Assemblyman, then it is quite correct that he

should  be  invited to, open it or b: present  at

least.  I must say this in this House, that  when

the post office was opened at Pulau Branithis has

nothing  to  do with community centres - I  invited

the  Member  for  the  Southern  Islands  to   be

present, but I do not think he was present.  What

else can I do?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Can I remind the Deputy

Prime  Minister  that  in the  Mountbatten  ward,

where there is an Assemblywoman, he went along to

open  the community centre? Again in the case  of

Joo  Chiat  where  there is an  Assemblyman,  the

defeated P.A.P. candidate of that ward was  asked

to open the community centre.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Shame!

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I am really not keen to

open  anything at all and I always fight  shy  of

social events. But the point is that I was  urged

by  the  Minister,  who was  then  in  charge  of

community centres, that in my capacity as  Deputy

Prime Minister I had to go to this area and I did

so. But I must confess that it was a mistake.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In Upper Serangoon there is a

community  centre  which has  been  completed.  I

would  like to ask the Minister whether he  would

like  to  invite the Member for that constituency

to officiate at the opening ceremony.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian (Punggol)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just

now, the Member for Upper Serangoon mentioned the

community centre in his constituency.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2450</b></font><br><br>

If   the   community  centre  is   in   Punggol

constituency,  I  do  not  know   whether   the

Minister will ask him or me to officiate at the

opening ceremony of the

community centre. Can he enlighten us on this

point now?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The solution is to invite both

Members!

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> As this community centre has been

functioning for the last three months, there is

no need to open it at all.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir, I was going to be content with what seemed

to  be  a  very honest assurance given  by  the

Deputy Prime Minister on the subject of the non

political  conduct of these community  centres,

but  I  was  a bit startled when he  said,  "No

Member  present  wants to use  those  community

centres for political purposes." He knows  very

well  that his Government has been using  those

centres for political purposes, and I am  sorry

to  hear that even now they are being used  for

political purposes. If the centres happen to be

in the wards represented by Opposition Members,

they  are not invited to open them. But  it  is

the  Deputy Prime Minister who opens  them  and

invites others to attend. I shall leave  it  at

that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a much more important matter and

it is one which the Minister for Health and Law

has  dealt with. I would like to ask him:  what

is  the  amount  that has been spent  from  the

Silver   Jubilee   Fund   on   assistance    to

tuberculosis  non-citizens  during  the   first

eleven  months of 1961? How many of  them  have

been  assisted? And what will be the  cost  of

assisting tuberculosis; non-citizens under  the

present  scheme on the same basis as  citizens?

The  Minister  speaks  of  economy - a  dangerous

economy - because what he has pointed out is that

they  are  sent  to S.A.T.A. and  given  X-ray

treatment. He

has  omitted to mention this basic factor, that

they   do  not  get  the  wherewithal  to  have

adequate  nourishment  which  would  strengthen

them  in  order  to resist and  overcome  their

disease,  and if they are unemployed,  as  they

must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2451</b></font><br><br>

be,  and if they are destitute - and these are  the

people  I am speaking about - and if they  have  no

adequate  nourishment, then they are the breeding

ground  for  tuberculosis for our citizens.  Sir,

they  are  not our citizens, but let us  face  it

honestly: those people who live and work here are

entitled,  from  the humane  point  of  view,  to

assistance in respect of these matters.  What  is

the Government saving money for? I consider it is - and  I  say this with regret - an inhuman approach

to a very human problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we come to the question of public

assistance.  The Minister said  that  I  made  an

exaggerated statement. What statement did I  make

which  was exaggerated? I said that it  was  not

adequate  to  increase by five per cent  in  1963

payments that we would be making in 1962. The  $5

extra  per head of household is for 1962, and  it

is   only  five  per  cent  extra  that  we   are

increasing for 1963. Those are facts. I would not

ask  the  Minister for Finance  to  withdraw  any

statement that he makes because he rather  enjoys

slanging me, but I do ask the Minister for Health

to  review the suggestion that I have indulged in

exaggeration. I would like to go further on  this

subject.  The  head of a family will  get  $21  a

month, which

is  not  bad;  the wife will get  $10,  and  the

children  will  get $5 each. You will  see,  Sir,

that when we view, shall we say, our very healthy

financial position, when we view the surpluses we

have  every year and the dynamic picture for  the

future, we can approach with more liberality  the

question of those who are officially starving.  I

am  quite sure the Minister accepts the figure of

the University that it requires, I think, $22  to

live on the cheapest possible food scientifically

purchased  in  order to maintain  survival,  that

anything less

than  that  means deterioration in  health  which

will  have an effect on the country. I know  that

he  must accept these things as facts. Let us not

speak  of economy in the wrong places. Our wealth

has  permitted us this year to give back  to  the

businesses - thanks to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2452</b></font><br><br>

the    Minister    for   Finance - the    business

registration  fees of $2 million a  year.  These

were  the people who, he said, last year  should

contribute   something,   that   they   were   a

privileged class. This privileged class has  had

$2 million given back to them, and no more money

is  to  be contributed by them next year or  the

year  after. If we are in a position to be  that

generous to a privileged class, can we not  show

a little more humanity - no more than that - to the

very under-class?

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The Member for Anson says that by

giving  the head of a household $5 more, we  are

putting up the expenditure by five per cent.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No. On a point of clarification,

Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> We are putting it up by $5 for

1962, but in the 1963 Budget, we are putting  it

up by only another five per cent, not by another

$5 for 1963 from 1962.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> We did approve the increase in

expenditure. This is what the House has  already

voted   - an   increase   from   $7,760,000    to

$8,980,000,  which I make out to be an  increase

of 16 per cent to pay for this $5 increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to include all people suffering from

tuberculosis  in  the  T.B. treatment  allowance

scheme, we would also have to allow non-citizens

to  participate in our public assistance scheme.

It  is  not  possible to keep these two  schemes

distinct.  If the rule is that public assistance

is  to be given only to a citizen, we will  also

have  to  apply the same rule to the person  who

suffers  from  T.B. and exclude the non-citizen.

In  order  to get over that difficulty, payments

have  been made in very deserving cases to  non-citizens  suffering from T.B. from  the  Silver

Jubilee Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of community centres, I think

the Member for Anson has made an accusation that

these centres are for political activities. I do

not  know  whether  the  hon.  Member  has  ever

visited  a  community  centre  to  see  how   it

operates. If he goes into one, he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2453</b></font><br><br>

will  see  that there are all sorts of activities

going on. There are young persons engaged in  all

sorts  of  handicraft work.  There  are  activity

instructors engaged in all the community  centres

and  they do very valuable work. Handicraft  work

is  not  political  activity.  Sewing  is  not  a

political  activity.  Basket  work   is   not   a

political activity. Radio engineering  is  not  a

political  activity. I wish the Member for  Anson

will really go round the community centres to see

what  is  going on, and once he does so, he  will

change his mind.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now, the

Deputy  Prime Minister gave us an assurance  that

the  activities in the community centres will not

be   of  a  political  nature.  We  welcome  this

assurance, but there are three points on which  I

want to be clear.

<br><br>4.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. has now lost the support of the

people  and  no one goes to the branches  of  the

P.A.P.  The branches are now closed at night  and

their   officials  have  gone  to  the  community

centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that there are many

community   centres  and  their   officials   are

officials of P.A.P. branches.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that the Minister for

Labour,  in his reply, said that in view  of  the

strike  of employees of the People's Association,

the   People's  Association  has  recruited  many

voluntary workers to help in the running  of  the

community  centres. He said that these  voluntary

workers  are paid $4 allowance, and all  of  them

are not P.A.P. members. As far as I know, many of

these   paid  workers,  the  so-called  executive

secretaries, are, on the one hand,  paid  by  the

P.A.P., and, on the other hand, are also paid  by

the   People's  Association.  Many  of  them  are

working in the community centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government can clarify these three

points.

<br><br><!-- Inche M. Ismail Rahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche M. Ismail Rahim (Geylang East)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I wish to reply to the

Member for Havelock. He says that it is not  true

that P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2454</b></font><br><br>

branches  have closed down and that it is  merely

a  falsehood.  He also says that members  of  the

P.A.P. have   become  officials  of   community

centres.  It is not the people who have  defected

to  the Barisan Sosialis but merely the executive

committee  that  has  gone over  to  the  Barisan

Sosialis.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, when the Member for Geylang East stood up to

reply, I thought he was replying on behalf of the

Government.  Now  I see that he  is  replying  on

behalf  of  the  Party, and  making  an  official

admission  that all the members of the  executive

committees of the branches of the P.A.P. have now

come  over to the Barisan Sosialis. I am indebted

to him for that explanation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my real purpose now is to make one point

only, and that concerns the Minister's reply that

the  T.B. allowance  cannot  be  given  to  non-citizens,  because, if the Government decides  to

give  the T.B. allowance to non-citizens, it  has

also  got to give public assistance allowance  to

non-citizens as well. I am very disturbed by such

an  analogy and such logic, because basically the

purposes  of  giving public assistance  allowance

and T.B. allowance are different. In the case  of

public  assistance allowance, it is  given  as  a

welfare  aid  scheme.  On  the  other  hand,  the

tuberculosis allowance is given as a welfare  aid

scheme  only secondarily, but primarily  for  the

purpose of eradicating tuberculosis in Singapore.

It is what we call in medical words a therapeutic

allowance, because if T.B. allowance is given  to

those  people  who are infected with tuberculosis

so that they may get well, the result would be an

eradication of the reservoir of infection so that

other people in Singapore may not be infected  by

the  infected people. Therefore, not to give non-citizens  a  T.B. allowance  would  defeat   the

purpose of the allowance itself, because  if  one

section of the reservoir of infection remains, it

still serves to spread the disease. For the last

two  years  I  have been trying .to convince  the

Minister  for  Labour  and  Law  then,  and   the

Minister   for  Health  and  Law  now,   of   the

importance of the therapeutic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2455</b></font><br><br>



aspect of the allowance. He does not seem to have

understood  it  and still does not understand  it

today. I am very disturbed, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> He need not lecture to me, Mr

Speaker, Sir,I understand more about it than the

Member  for  Nee Soon ever will. This  is  public

assistance.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> It is not public assistance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> It is paid by the Social Welfare

Section  of the Ministry of Labour. Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  we know that no payments are made to  those

who  are  chronic sufferers from  T.B.  The  T.B.

allowance vote will not be used to assist  people

who  are  chronic sufferers from T.B. It is  only

those  who are able to recover that are  assisted

out of this public assistance vote.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in point of fact, we can give

the  information the Member for Anson is  seeking

by  looking through our records. There is a  very

small  proportion of people who  come  from  else

where, who are non-citizens and who are suffering

from  T.B. whom we can assist, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

and assist adequately, through the Silver Jubilee

Fund.  This is a question that we understand.  We

are  not  ivory  from  the shoulder  upwards.  We

understand all these problems and we know how  to

tackle them. The point is this, Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  cannot  make  a logical distinction,  however

hard  we try, between granting T.B. allowance  to

non-citizens  and  denying  non-citizens   public

assistance.  We cannot explain such a distinction

to  the  public, Mr Speaker, Sir. They will  not

understand it even if we tried to so explain.  So

the  only  way is to use the other fund  to  help

people who suffer from T.B. who are not citizens.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps I might make it very clear to the House that I

had  no  intention of lecturing to the Minister,

nay,   far  less  to  arrogate  to  myself   the

impertinence  of lecturing to him.  I  was  only

speaking



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2456</b></font><br><br>

because I thought it was in the interests of the

people of Singapore to know these facts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel the Minister is trying to lead us away

from the point by saying that this T.B. allowance

is not given to chronic patients. When the scheme

was first introduced, Sir, it was introduced with

a  view  to  first treating  all  the  actively

infected patients, particularly those within  the

income  earning group, that is to say, under  the

age  of 55, and subsequently to isolate and treat

all the other chronic cases. The whole purpose of

the  T.B. allowance, Sir, I wish to stress again,

is  to  eradicate this disease, and it  has  been

introduced   satisfactorily   in   most   Western

countries  where T.B. is now almost non-existent.

I  just want to make it very clear that I had  no

intention of lecturing to the Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, I

for  one am grateful for the intervention of  the

Member  who  last spoke. He was able to  put  the

matter  from the medical point of view  and  from

his  special  knowledge when he was working  with

the  Government.  But I would like  to  draw  the

Minister's  attention  to  certain  facts   which

emanate from his own statement. He started off by

telling  us  that the measure was  necessary  for

economy  purposes,  if you remember.  But  now  I

understand  him  to  say  that  it  is  necessary

because of the rules. You cannot have rules for a

non-citizen  who  has T.B. allowance  but  cannot

have  public  assistance. Sir,  I  must  confess - probably  I  am deaf - but I am just not  able  to

follow  that. We have a public assistance  scheme

which  deals  with our citizens and,  frankly,  I

would  like  to touch on it this far: I  consider

that  those who have given five years' employment

to  this  area  and  have five  years'  residence

should qualify even though they are non-citizens.

But  I  touch  on that en passant. Then  we  have

tuberculosis allowance. Surely it is in the hands

of  the Government, and the only persons who  can

criticise the Government are the representatives

of  the people themselves who would criticise the

Government for being more generous today by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2457</b></font><br><br>

giving where it has not given in the past and  by

giving  to  non-citizens who are tubercular.  Mr

Speaker,  he  has  indicated  one  aspect   which

somewhat lightens the load of our anxiety. He has

assured  us  that  some of  the  deserving  cases

receive assistance from the Jubilee Fund. I would

like to ask him, Mr Speaker, whether he is in  a

position  to give a firm assurance to this  House

that  in  all cases of persons suffering actively

from  tuberculosis  who are destitute,  deserving

non-citizens  will  receive  adequate  assistance

from  the  Silver  Jubilee Fund  for  nourishment

purposes. Can he give us that?

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have X-ray

teams  that  are making surveys. In  the  reports

that  we have received of surveys made in various

areas, it has been pointed out about 60 per  cent

of the total population have turned up to take X-rays. Out of this number, Mr Speaker, Sir, about

5  to  6  per cent have been found to be infected

and  are  treated by S.A.T.A. Out of the rest  of

the  40  per cent, there might be quite a lot  of

them  who  are infected. We do not know what  the

incidence is. But whenever T.B. cases do come  to

our  notice and when they appeal to us for  funds

and  assistance, I can assure this House that not

a  single  case has been ignored. Every time  the

fullest  inquiries are made.  There  is  a  means

tests  for  public assistance. There  is  also  a

means  test  for the T.B. allowance. Whenever  we

get  to know that the breadwinner of a family  is

incapacitated  because of T.B. I can  assure  the

House  that our officials play the game  by  them

fairly.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

indebted  to the Minister for that assurance.  By

that  assurance, I understand that should  people

come to see me at my Meet-the-People sessions and

tell  me  that they are not citizens of Singapore

and  would like to have public assistance or T.B.

allowance,  I will most certainly refer  them  to

the Minister concerned.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

reply to the Member for Havelock. He said that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2458</b></font><br><br>

there were about 100 members on the staff of  the

People's Association. When they left their posts,

the  People's Association did not recruit any new

staff  to  replace  them.  The  establishment  of

community   centres   is   to   provide   certain

facilities  to  enable the  people  to  have  the

opportunity to learn certain things and  to  take

part in certain cultural recreational activities.

But  some ex-members of the staff of the People's

Association,   as  a  result  of  influence   and

agitation  by  the Barisan Sosialis,  left  their

posts  in  total disregard of the need of  people

for  cultural recreational activities.  Thus  the

People's  Association  thought  it  necessary  to

appeal  to willing volunteers to step forward  to

run community centre activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the allegation that there were some

volunteers who were P.A.P. members, I wish to say

that we accepted their offer since they were  the

people then prepared to sacrifice and offer their

services.  We  accepted their  services  on  this

ground only. It is not because of their political

background  or  any connection  with  the  P.A.P.

There  were many P.A.P. members in various  areas

of Singapore. If these voluntary workers happened

to  be  P.A.P. members, there was nothing  wrong

with that. But as to the activities which benefit

the people so much -

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> On a point of

clarification.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member please wait until

I  have  the  translation? A Member should  never

intervene until the Member speaking has completed

his sentence.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I apologise, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Minister for Home

Affairs continue?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I have finished.

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> I must apologise for having

disturbed  the last speaker in the  middle  of  a

sentence,  Sir.  But  I understood  him  to  have

challenged  the members of the Barisan  Sosialis,

that  none  of them had volunteered for  service,

either  in  the People's Association  or  in  the

community centres. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2459</b></font><br><br>

would  just  like to inform him that the  Member

for  Upper Serangoon and myself, who had  served

the People's Association for the last one and  a

half

years,  were  expelled from  the  Board  of  the

People's Association. We were prepared to serve,

but we were expelled.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now, Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs  said

several things which I think are not quite  true.

He said that in respect of the voluntary workers,

there  were  inevitably some who happened  to  be

P.A.P. members.  But what I said  just  now  was

that, although some were voluntary workers,  they

were  paid $4 each per day. Among these voluntary

workers,  several were paid executive members  of

the  P.A.P. I have raised this question in  order

to  ask  how it is possible for a person  to  get

paid from the P.A.P. on the one hand, and on  the

other   hand,  to  get  paid  from  the  People's

Association.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Home Affairs said that some

Members  now on strike are irresponsible.  It  is

regrettable  for him to say so. We can  recollect

that several months ago, there was a big fire  at

Bukit  Ho  Swee.  Without the  workers  from  the

People's  Association, who worked  hard  day  and

night,  I  believe the relief work at  that  time

could  not have been carried out so smoothly.  At

that time I heard several Ministers praise highly

some of these workers who are now on strike.  How

can   they   say  now  that  these  workers   are

irresponsible?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Minister for Home Affairs also

said  that  the  People's  Association  have  not

recruited new members of the staff. It is now the

18th  of  December. I remember it was last  month

that the Minister for Labour, when he replied  to

my  question,  said that he wanted  to  advertise

vacancies  to  get new members for  the  People's

Association.  Now  I  wonder  who  is   right - the

Minister  for  Home Affairs or the  Minister  for

Labour?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2460</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also says that none of the Barisan Sosialis

members  have come forward to assist in the  work

of  the community centres. Of course, this is but

natural,  because  at present the  staff  of  the

People's  Association are on strike. That  cannot

be denied. You may try to argue about it, but you

just  cannot deny it and convince the people that

they are not on strike. So if in the course of  a

strike  members of the Barisan Sosialis  were  to

come  forward  to  assist  in  the  work  of  the

community centres, then it would be tantamount to

our  trying to break the strike of the  staff  of

the  People's Association. This is  what  we  are

against.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the points I have raised just now,

that   is  to  say,  that  some  of  the   branch

executives of the P.A.P. have gone over  to  work

in  the  community centres on a voluntary  basis:

and  on another point, that many of the community

centre workers are executives of the P.A.P.,  the

Government  has  not answered them.  I  hope  the

Government will give us a positive and  clear-out

answer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of debate on Question,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head 48

be reduced by $100."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again

proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,   we  already  dealt  with  this  item  when

debating  the 1962 Budget, and I do not  want  to

waste  the  time of the Assembly.  I  have  three

points to make.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2461</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no strike in the People's Association.

It  is not a strike. The workers of the People's

Association  voluntarily  left  their  posts  on

political  grounds.  The second  point  is  that

after  these  irresponsible workers  left  their

posts, we have not recruited any new workers  to

replace  them. The Minister for Labour has  said

that  the Government wants to advertise for  new

workers.  That is something for the future.  For

the  time  being, we have not made any  decision

yet.  The  third point is that if those  workers

who  voluntarily left their posts now feel sorry

for what they have done in the past, and if they

want  to write down a statement expressing their

regret  for what they have done, then the  Board

of  the People's Association will consider their

cases.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is a pity that the

Deputy  Prime Minister is not here, Sir,  because

we are very glad that he has admitted that it was

a   mistake   to  have  made  community   centres

political  in the past. We on this  side  of  the

House,  especially the Barisan Sosialis,  welcome

his   assurance  that  he  will  in  future  keep

politics  out  of  community  centres   and   the

People's  Association.  Sir,  in  view   of   the

Government's  admission of their  past  mistakes,

would they give us an assurance, in spite of what

the Minister for Home Affairs has just said, that

the  present team leaders and centre leaders  who

are  on strike will not be victimised because  of

their political views?

<br><br>5.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could we also have an assurance that some

reasonable  settlement would be come  to  between

the  Government and the people who are on strike?

In  view  of  the admission that politics  was  a

factor  involved  in  the recruitment  of  P.A.P.

members  into  the community centres,  would  the

Government also give an assurance that interviews

and  questionings  be  not  done  at  the  P.A.P.

headquarters,  that  Central Executive  Committee

members  be  not asked to interview and  question

candidates, and that membership of the P.A.P. be

not a condition for the getting of work?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Another thing, Sir, which

has  not  yet come out so far is that all  these

members have been asked to subscribe to the  so-called P.A.P. Welfare Fund. We wonder -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I was wondering whether

all  these  details could not best be ventilated

in  the  Commission of Inquiry, which the  Prime

Minister  said would be appointed. Am I  correct

in  saying that a Commission of Inquiry is to be

appointed in regard to the People's Association.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If the Government will give

that undertaking.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is there no such undertaking?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If the Government is

willing to give that undertaking.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> My understanding is that we

are quite prepared to carry on with a Commission

of  Inquiry, but we are waiting for a  draft  of

the  terms  of  reference of this Commission  of

Inquiry from the Member for Upper Serangoon; but

so far it has not been forthcoming.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But we want an assurance

from  the Government that whatever the terms  of

reference,  they  are  willing  to   have   this

Commission  of Inquiry. Are they going  to  give

that undertaking? Do not turn round and say just

because certain terms ,of reference are no good,

therefore, they do not want to have it.  Let  us

have their assurance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not waste the time of the House much

longer,  Sir.  But  I want to make  one  further

point, that if community centres are meant to be

non-political,  let them be truly non-political.

But  if  the  Government intends  to  use  these

community   centres  as  avenues  of   political

meetings,   then  let  them  extend   the   same

facilities  to  Opposition Members.  Because  we

know for certain that the Prime Minister himself

called a party meeting in one of the community



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2463</b></font><br><br>

centres.  We  hope such things  will  not  happen

again,  and  if  they  do,  then  let  the   same

facilities be extended to all political Parties.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I cannot agree with the last speaker  about

facilities    for    all    political    Parties.

Fortunately, I am in a very independent  position

in  this, and my opinion is that it is unhealthy,

from  the  point of view of public welfare,  that

community  centres  could be used  for  political

purposes, whatever the Party and however good  it

may  be. I think the debate can be cut very short

now.   We  have  what  I  understand  to  be   an

assurance, and I would like this clear  from  the

Minister  for  Finance,  that  a  Commission   of

Inquiry  will  be appointed. I am quite  sure  he

does not mean that he is waiting for the terms of

reference   from   the   Barisan   Sosialis.   No

government could possibly mean that.  I  take  it

that what he means is that he is waiting for  the

terms  of  reference  suggested  by  the  Barisan

Sosialis  before the Government itself  sets  out

the  terms  of reference. But am I to  understand

that  whatever  the  terms of  reference  by  the

Barisan  Sosialis, the Government will, in  fact,

appoint  a  Commission of Inquiry to  investigate

the  activities of the People's Association,  the

dismissal  of  the  employees  therein  and   the

circumstances  of their dismissal; all  political

activities in which it has indulged, and to  make

recommendations   with  a  view   to   protecting

community  centres  from political  interference,

generally speaking?

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, my colleague the

Minister  for  Health and Law has gone  to  great

pains  to  explain to the House that no political

activity  takes place in community  centres.  The

community centres provide a range of recreational

activities  to persons living in the areas.  That

has   never  been  disputed.  No  Member  of  the

Opposition  has ever given one iota  of  evidence

that it is otherwise.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2464</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Commission of Inquiry, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  let  it not be imagined by the  Opposition

that  the  Government  is shrinking  from  this,

because  the misdeeds that were carried  out  in

the  administration  of community  centres  were

misdeeds  perpetrated by former members  of  the

P.A.P. who are now in the Barisan Sosialis. That

is  why, Mr Speaker, Sir, I suggest to you that

there  is  some reluctance on the  part  of  the

Member  for  Upper Serangoon to put forward  the

draft  terms  of reference. We are  not  running

away  from this at all. We have nothing to fear.

I  say that when the time comes and the truth is

out,  those members of the Barisan Sosialis  who

were former members of the P.A.P. will be put in

a position of extreme discomfiture.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I ask a simple

question.  The Minister is telling us  that  the

Government  need not fear, that  they  will  not

shrink  from  it, that they will not  run  away.

Just  answer, will you, "yes" or "no"? It  is  a

simple question. Do not evade. Maybe he does not

mean  to  evade, but to me it is  tantamount  to

evasion.   Will  the  Government  undertake   to

appoint  a  Commission of  Inquiry  on  its  own

terms,  quite naturally, Sir, after  considering

any  terms of reference which might be suggested

by  the  Barisan Sosialis, since he  insists  on

them,  and he will not accept any from  me - I  do

not  mind,  Sir.  But will he  give  us  a  firm

assurance  that  the Government will  appoint  a

Commission of Inquiry?

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Prime Minister has

already given that assurance.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Will you?

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> How often have we got to

repeat  this  simple thing, Sir? I  say  we  are

waiting  for  the draft terms of reference  from

the Member for Upper Serangoon. There is a point

to this.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $8,679,830 for Head 48 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2465</b></font><br><br>



Head 49 -

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, I

rise to move the amendment standing in my name,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head

49 be reduced by $100.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 49, Sir, is the Ministry of Culture, a

Ministry that is the creation and the creature of

the  P.A.P. with annually larger votes.  1962 - $9

million; 1963 - $5 million to account for  part  of

the  year. Mr Speaker, the P.A.P., conscious  of

the  specious but not of the basic facts of life,

are  conscious of the value and influence of  the

propaganda  machinery  of Western  and  Communist

nations.  They  have patterned  the  Ministry  of

Culture  as  the Ministry of Propaganda,  seeking

through  selective and false reporting to  create

an  atmosphere favourable to the P.A.P. Party and

to  the P.A.P. front bench. The word "culture" is

a  misnomer.  It  is, in fact, a party  political

machine and a Government propaganda machine. I do

not   know   whether  the  Minister   is   really

interested in culture. I do know, in so far as  I

can  judge  as  a  citizen, that he  knows  about

culture  as  much as I know about  the  sputniks.

Culture, Mr Speaker, is the sediment of the ages

in  the human spirit reflected in a people's  way

of  life.  The Ministry, apart from acting  as  a

P.A.P. propaganda machine, seeks not so subtly to

destroy the roots of the cultural heritage of our

individual  communities in the  name  of  Malayan

culture.  What kind of Malayan culture  does  one

expect  to build on the quicksands and falsehoods

of  the P.A.P. political philosophy? They do  not

even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2466</b></font><br><br>

racial  cultures is to destroy  the  members  of

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Thank you, Sir,I say they do not

recognise  that  in  order to  build  a  Malayan

culture - that is their intention, which I  doubt - it  is  necessary not merely to maintain respect

for  individual  racial cultures,  but  also  to

strengthen them. It is on the strong pillars  of

the  individual racial cultures of  our  peoples

that  we  can build the common roof of a Malayan

culture.  You  cannot, Sir, build  anything  but

hypocrisy  and humbug, the fear and  inferiority

complex  in people whom you seek to make ashamed

of  the traditions of their respective races.  I

feel  strongly  about this aspect,  Sir. It  is

fortunate  our people are not misled  and  maybe

the  P.A.P. will ultimately recognise  that  the

road  it  is taking is a dangerous road for  all

concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the minor aspect of the P.A.P. acting

as   a  political  propaganda  machine,  I  draw

attention  particularly to Radio Singapore,  now

popularly know as Radio P.A.P. Much was expected

from this organisation. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2467</b></font><br><br>

Prime  Minister  told us we could  not  have - what

was it, Sir? - rock-'n-roll; that is right. Instead

we can have

rhymes  about  smoking cowdung  cigarettes  every

morning.  That is the extent of the changes.  But

what  we  do  have is a completely  dishonest,  I

repeat,  dishonest News Division.  Sir,  I  would

like,  if I may, to table the text of a broadcast

allegedly  made by the Head of the News  Division

of  the Ministry of Culture, Mr Li Vei-Chen,  of

the  merger  debate  which,  to  my  mind,  is  a

dishonest  travesty  of the proceedings  of  this

House.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If the Member wishes to

make  an allegation that there has been a  breach

of privilege in this House, then in that case the

proper  method  is for him to give  notice  of  a

motion.  That  motion will then be considered  by

me,  and  if I agree that there is a prima  facie

matter which affects the privileges of the House,

I will refer it to the Committee of Privileges.

<br><br>6.00 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this came to my

attention  on  Saturday  morning.  I  seek   your

guidance here. Is it not proper to deal  with  it

under  this  Head,  because it  does  affect  the

conduct of the Ministry of Culture?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If it is an allegation of a

breach  of  privilege, there is a Standing  Order

which tells the hon. Member what to do.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Minister did make light of  complaints

from the Opposition about Radio P.A.P. being used

for  P.A.P. political purposes.  He  quoted  the

number of lines given, inter alia, to myself.  It

is not the quantity of coverage. It is the points

they permit you to be heard on. You do appreciate

that in expending one's points, one might perhaps

take  ten minutes in referring to a single aspect

which  can be dealt with under its relevant  head

perhaps  succinctly  in  three  lines.  It  is  a

question  of,  if  they give you  your  full  ten

minutes, touching on one of the minor points



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2468</b></font><br><br>

you   have   been  dealing  with  but   excluding

completely  the main paint, as they  excluded  in

the  case of the Member for Queenstown the  pivot

of his attack on the White Paper by

ignoring his complaint about citizenship. That

is dishonest reporting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not listen out of

consideration for myself to Radio P.A.P.  I  have

unfortunately  had occasion to  hear  reports  of

what   had   transpired.  On  one  occasion,   by

accident,  I did listen and I considered  that  a

certain  part  was  a gross misrepresentation.  I

wrote to the Head of the News Division asking for

a copy of the transcript of what was broadcast. I

was informed that the Ministry would not release,

not  even  to  Members maligned,  copies  of  the

transcript  of  what  was  broadcast  over   this

political  radio organisation. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

when   there   is  a  legitimate   or   seemingly

legitimate complaint particularly by a Member  of

the  Assembly  about  a radio  broadcast,  it  is

important  that he should at least  be  permitted

the  right  of  inspection of the  transcript  in

order  to  ascertain to what extent he  has  been

misrepresented or maligned. I have to inform you,

Sir,  that I did mention to the Head of the Radio

Division and to the Head of Radio Singapore  that

I  required inspection for the purposes of making

known  to  this Assembly - which was then sitting - the facts, and I was refused. Not until four days

afterwards did the Minister approach me and  say,

"You  can have the inspection now." By that time,

Sir,  as you are aware, a motion that the  matter

had  suddenly arisen would not have been accepted

by  you and could not have been accepted by  you.

It  would have meant a substantive motion and  it

would  have meant resuscitating what was  already

dead. I say that that sort of approach is not  an

honest  and  proper approach and  is  lacking  in

adequate  consideration not only for  Assemblymen

but for all those who may be maligned - as they are - by the radio organ of the P.A.P.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore have suffered, and

suffered grievously, from the diarrhoea of words

which  the  P.A.P. has poured through its  radio

organ day



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2469</b></font><br><br>

after  day,  and from the hysteria  of  Communism

spearheaded by their Prime Minister. They were so

sick  of it that the town was full of jokes about

it.  The  radio  has  been abused  and  the  long

suffering  citizens of Singapore have  had  their

bellyfull of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment is by way of protest on two

aspects: one, the distorted political concept of

culture, and, two,

the gross abuse of Radio Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I was shocked to hear the allegation made by

the Member for Anson because the point raised  by

him was the same as that he made in the Anson by-election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last two years, open-air concerts

have been held in all parts of Singapore. In this

respect,  I  believe  the  people  of  Singapore,

irrespective of race, will agree with me that  we

have encouraged the bringing together of the many

arts and cultures of the different races. We  are

also  encouraging the bringing  together  of  the

arts  and cultures of the East and West. By  this

means, we hope to nurse a new Malayan culture. If

the Member for Anson will .admit that he does not

know  the  significance of culture,  then  it  is

excusable.  However,  if  he  alleges  that   the

Minister for Culture does not understand culture,

I  hope  he will make an appointment to be  at  a

forum with the Minister for Culture.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Maybe what the

a point of order if you like, Sir,I did not hear

what was said, and I do not think the interpreter

told us.

translation  of what is said. I have  not  heard

the translation and I am entitled -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the allegation is that

the  culture  of  the  Member  for  Anson  is  a

striptease culture.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I say this

because when the Member for Anson was the  Chief

certain contacts and connections with her.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order. I do not

consider it a laughing matter. It is a point  of

privilege,  Sir. I  ask  that  this  matter  be

referred to the Committee of Privileges. It is a

grossly  dishonest  and improper  suggestion  to

make  that I have a relationship with Rose  Chan - a striptease  actress. It is only disgraceful  and

disgusting people who can think like that.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am not aware that the

Parliamentary Secretary meant what  he  said  in

the  sense taken by the Member for Anson. All  I

understood is that there was an occasion alleged

by the Parliamentary Secretary that a striptease

dancer  was received by the Member for Anson  in

his  official capacity. I think that is all.  Is

that it, Mr Parliamentary Secretary?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, what you

have   interpreted   is   quite   correct.   The

allegation  of the Member for Anson against  the

Government is an insult: to the cultural  bodies

in Singapore. During the last two years, we have

never  received any complaint from any  cultural

body alleging that the Government has victimised

the  cultures of the different races. They  have

never  been dissatisfied with the policy of  the

Government  on  culture.  During  the  last  two

years, when I was the Parliamentary Secretary to

the  Minister for Culture, I had never  received

any complaint from the Chinese, the Indians, the

Malays  or  the  Eurasians  alleging  that   the

Government's   policy  was  to  destroy   racial

culture. It is only the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2471</b></font><br><br>

Anson  who  alleges that there is dissatisfaction

among  the races, and it is unfortunate  that  he

has brought forward this kind of argument in this

House.  During the last 2� years, the  Government

has  encouraged  Asian  cultural  bodies  to   be

conscious  of their arts and cultures which  have

been  suppressed  by the colonial  government.  A

play entitled "Ch'i Yen" was staged in Singapore.

This  play is about the great poets of old China.

If we wanted to destroy Chinese culture, would we

have given permission to a local cultural body to

stage  this  play  in the Victoria  Theatre?  The

Malay  and  Tamil  local  cultural  bodies   have

similarly staged their own dances and plays.

<br><br>6.15 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We try to draw the essence of the cultures of

all  races and bring about an interflow, so  that

there  will  be  a  mutual understanding  of  the

cultures of all races. And through this interflow

of  culture,  we try to create a Malayan  culture

and art.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Anson raised a question

concerning  a  member  of  the  staff  of   Radio

Singapore,  Mr Li Vei-Chen, in relation  to  his

broadcasts. In this respect, if all of us make  a

serious study of his broadcasts, we will know -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. As regards this particular

broadcast, the hon. Member for Anson has  made  a

serious  allegation, and that is that  there  has

been  breach  of privilege. I have indicated  the

course of action he should take, if he wishes  to

pursue the matter. I do not think we should  open

a debate of this nature.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Member

for  Anson  has made an irresponsible  allegation

against  the  Government.  I  hope  he  can   sub

stantiate  his  allegation  against  Government's

action in trying to create a Malayan culture.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am indebted

to  all  those who are straining at the leash  to

answer that Member, for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2472</b></font><br><br>

their indulgence in permitting me to rise again.

And I rise, Sir, to point out the dishonesty  of

this culture which seeks to make an issue of the

fact  that  a lady came to visit me  in  public,

with  reporters  and my staff present.  She  was

perfectly   decently  dressed   and   asked   me

something about a licence. She happened to be  a

striptease artiste. They used what was perfectly

proper  conduct on my part, even though  it  may

not be proper to the P.A.P. who only receive the

rich  and have no time for the poor, to  suggest

that  I had relations with a striptease artiste,

which was the phrase I heard interpreted.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> That is wrong!

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Parliamentary

Secretary  has  indicated in no uncertain  terms

that  the  interpretation put by the Member  for

Anson on that remark is wrong. He has said  that

in so many words.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Thank you, Sir. But in the

circumstances  I would like to  point  out  that

such an interview could

have no possible relevance at all in the context

of this debate, or of my having an understanding

of  culture being a striptease. It was  intended

for malicious

prejudice.  Sir,  who  is  guilty  of  striptease

culture?  It is this Government. Whether  it  is

under the aegis of the Minister for Culture is  a

matter for this, House to judge. But we have had,

month  after  month, this striptease  tearing  of

little veil by little veil, and little dribs  and

drabs  of  information about  merger.  Striptease

culture? These are the artistes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary says that no

dissatisfaction   has  been  indicated   to   the

Government by cultural bodies. Maybe not  to  the

Government. I know to what extent the  people  of

Singapore  befo

re  Hong Lim and  Anson  had  been

terrified and intimidated by this group of people

when  their  leader,  the Prime  Minister,  spoke

about  "We have to be a little tough." There  has

been   grave  intimidation  of  the   people   of

Singapore,  and  it is only since  Hong  Lim  and

Anson that the voice of the

people has been raised in protest.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2473</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall not keep the others who are now

straining at the leash, but to give the gentleman

who spoke last all the particulars he seeks.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I was surprised just now  that

the  Member who answered the Member for Anson was

not    the   Minister   for   Culture   but   his

Parliamentary  Secretary.  Perhaps  the  Minister

does  not  understand culture, and  that  is  why

someone else answered for him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Education said that

the  Government  was trying to  promote  cultural

activities among the various communities. At  the

same time, he said the Government had never heard

of  any  complaints from any cultural  body.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, I believe everybody will agree that

we  must have a Malayan culture. In the course of

promoting this Malayan culture, we should not  do

anything   to  the  disadvantage  of  a   certain

culture,  and talk about it in the Assembly  now,

because  we  still do not know what form  Malayan

culture  will take. This will depend on  how  the

cultures  of the various communities  develop  in

future.  Therefore, in respect of this  question,

namely, the future of Malayan culture, we  should

not stress the culture of a certain community and

praise or denounce its merits, because this  will

only lead to certain misunderstanding and perhaps

to some disastrous results.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Education  has just now said that last  year  the

Ministry of Culture approved a drama called "Ch'i

Yen" and allowed it to be played on the stage  of

the  Victoria  Memorial Theatre. This  drama  was

presented  by  the students -of the Chinese  High

School. I saw the drama myself, perhaps with  the

Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister   for

Education.  According to information received  by

me,  the  Ministry of Home Affairs nearly refused

to  allow  this  drama  to  be  staged.  But  the

Minister  for Culture, in order to show  that  he

was  encouraging cultural activities,  asked  the

Special



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2474</b></font><br><br>

Branch to approve the staging of this particular

drama. During the course of its presentation  on

the   stage,  the  Government  ruled  that   the

contents  of  this drama should not be  stressed

too  much and that certain aspects of it  should

not  be  dramatised. I do not know  whether  the

Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for

Education  can guarantee any future stagings  of

this  drama,  and  whether in future  Government

will  still have regulations and conditions when

giving permission for this drama to be staged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of the debate last week, I

pointed out that the policies of the Ministry of

Culture  and  the Ministry of Home Affairs  were

contradictory. As far as I know, there will be a

drama  staged  at the Victoria Memorial  Theatre

next year. The title is "The Song of the Coconut

Forest" - "Yeh Lin Chiao Kerh". According to  what

we  know,  the  Government has not allowed  this

play  to be staged. But, Mr Speaker, the  whole

play is based on the local situation, namely,  a

presentation of the lives and activities of  the

people,   which   the  Minister  concerned   has

professed to encourage. But this play  has  been

banned. This morning I went to a book-store'  to

buy  a  book  on this play. I have  not  made  a

careful study of its contents, and therefore  am

not  sure whether they are as undesirable as the

Minister  has claimed them to be. And I  do  not

know  whether they are similar to those  in  the

book  called  "The Reminiscences of Fire"  which

was banned by the Minister concerned.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, I cannot understand the

Member  for Choa Chu Kang. He has not even  read

the  play.  So what is he talking about?  He  is

talking about something which he has not read!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, the Government's decisions and the work  of

the Government are usually for show only. What I

want  to  stress here is that we must give  more

chances to local artistes and writers to develop

their talents. If the Government think that  the

presentation of local realities and facts are of

a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2475</b></font><br><br>

Communist overtone, then I say there is no  need

for  the Ministry of Culture to be in existence,

and  there  is  no  need  for  the  Ministry  to

encourage  or  promote local  writers  to  write

works  representing the actual way of  life  and

real  facts as exist locally. From this example,

we  can say that this year, on National Day,  we

planned to organise a concert. One of the  items

on  the  programme was "Tsai Hua Pu Tieh".  This

item  has  not  yet been approved. Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  an  application  has  been  made  by   the

Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for

National  Development and he  has  not  got  permission for it.

<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Point of

clarification.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No, the Member is not giving way.

<br><br>6.30 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, at that time the Parliamentary Secretary to

the  Minister for National Development mentioned

this question to me, and I had also -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have allowed the hon.

Member to go into one or two details, but I  must

remind  him  that we are now talking  on  general

principles. I do not know what general principles

he   wishes  to  illustrate  by  this  particular

incident.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order. I would like

to  draw  the attention of the Chair to the  time

limit.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The debate on this amendment can

go on to 7.00 p.m. Mr Ong Chang Sam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I mentioned this incident just now because I

wanted  to  disprove  what  the  Government   has

claimed.  They claim that they want to  encourage

local artistes to produce their own works with  a

local  realistic  background. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

just  now  I said that this item had been  staged

several times and for many years in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2476</b></font><br><br>

Malaya.  It  had  been staged on many  occasions

during  the Aneka Regam Raakyat concerts.  I  do

not  know  whether the Minister for  Culture  is

really  encouraging the free development of  the

cultures  of  the various communities.  Why  did

they ban a simple item such as this? That is the

contradiction  between the Ministry  of  Culture

and the Ministry of Home Affairs. I hope that in

future  the  Ministry of Culture  will  be  more

liberal towards local artistes and that it  will

be  more  realistic in their approach  to  local

works. It should not think that local works  are

communistic.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Member for Anson made certain allegations against

the  News Division. He made references to letters

that  he  had  written to the News  Division  and

implied that the replies were not prompt or  that

they  were  not forthcoming. I want to draw  your

attention, Sir, to the type of letter the  Member

for  Anson  wrote. I have a copy of a  letter.  I

shall  read  an extract, Sir, and  I  shall  make

copies of this letter available to the Clerk.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I intend to say this in public on Sunday

night  and I hope you will be there to  hear  it

and  to  sue me. I intend also to say it in  the

Assembly -'

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think we should

go  into  these  details. The  complaint  by  the

Member  for  Anson was that he never  got  prompt

replies..  And  what was the reason?  The  reason

was the tone of his letters. Well, say so and  be

done with it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kandasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the person to

whom  he addressed the letter is a civil servant.

The  Member for Anson was once a Chief  Minister,

though short-lived. He knows well that if he  has

any  complaints  against any  department  in  the

Ministry,  the  avenue  is  open  to  him  either

through  the  Standing Orders or to approach  the

Minister.  But  he  threatens  a  civil  servant,

knowing  full  well that a civil servant  is  not

able  to defend himself. That is the point,  Sir.

I  think  such  behaviour, of using his  official

position



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2477</b></font><br><br>

to  threaten and abuse a civil servant,  is  most

unbecoming  of  an  honourable  Member  of   this

Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, over $5

million  has  been  asked to  promote  a  Malayan

culture.  Unless the Ministry knows exactly  what

it  wants  and  what is to be achieved,  this  is

going  to be a waste of money. From what the  ex-Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister   for

Culture has said, it looks as if culture to  them

means songs, dances and things having relation to

the  stage. This is not true, Sir. Culture  is  a

way  of life. The work of the Ministry of Culture

is  to promote goodwill and understanding between

the   different   races,  and   to   promote   an

understanding of the way of life of the different

races.  Probably the putting up  of  the  dances,

songs and art of the different races does promote

an  understanding of the different races in Singa

pore. But I have asked this question a couple  of

years   ago.   It   has   never   been   answered

satisfactorily.  I  wonder  whether  it  can   be

answered  today.  What does the  ex-Parliamentary

Secretary mean when he says, in effect,  that  he

hopes that a Malayan culture is to be born in the

future  out  of the different cultures  that  are

being  displayed today? Does he  mean  a  Chinese

dance  more  malayanised or an Indian dance  more

Chinese? What is the Ministry's idea of a Malayan

culture or a Malayan dance that they are going to

promote  out of all these Malay, Indian,  Chinese

and  European dances? Have they a clear  idea  of

what  exactly is their aim when they  talk  about

the birth of a new Malayan culture?

<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

firstly, let me say that I sincerely congratulate

the Member for Anson who, I know, is a well-known

lawyer.  He  now  professes to be  an  expert  in

matters  of  culture. In his speech, he  mentions

That he greatly respects all the various cultures

existing  in  Singapore. I support  him  in  that

respect.  But if you read his speech between  the

lines,   he  is  insinuating  that  the   present

Government  is  ignoring  the  cultures  of   the

various races. This will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2478</b></font><br><br>

stir  up  communal feelings. I still remember - I

have forgotten the title of the book - that there

are  cultural leaders who say that  colonialism

cannot eradicate a nation unless the culture of

that  particular nation is wiped out. A  nation

cannot   be  continuously  colonised   by   the

colonialists  unless, first and  foremost,  the

culture of that particular nation is colonised.

This has a great influence on the culture of  a

nation.  For that reason, Mr Speaker,  because

the  question of culture is very important, let

us   not  discuss  something  which  will  have

detrimental  consequences to  our  cosmopolitan

society. We do not wish political influences to

affect  the  people  into  thinking  that   the

Government   is   trying  to  destroy   Chinese

culture,  and  similarly that it is  trying  to

destroy  Tamil culture or Indian  culture.  Let

the Government be damned if it wants to destroy

Malay  culture.  This has been uttered  by  the

various political leaders during election  time

in  order  to get votes. They tell the  Chinese

people  not  to  forget  their  culture  of   a

thousand  years  old,  and  that  they  have  a

traditional culture of their own. Mr  Speaker,

let  us not try to revive communal feelings  if

we are sincere in our efforts to build a united

nation with an undivided loyalty to this  land.

To  build  a  Malayan culture is not  a  simple

matter.  It will take a long time to  evolve  a

Malayan  culture. It cannot be achieved  during

the short space of few hours or a few days.  To

create  a  Malayan culture out of  the  various

cultures  and the various religious beliefs  is

surely not an easy matter. As suggested by  the

Member for Anson, by the creation of a Ministry

of  Culture,  a  united Malayan  culture  could

easily  be developed. The creation of a culture

cannot be forced upon the people. As one leader

did say on one occasion, "I

can  influence thousands, in fact, millions  of

people  to respect me, but I cannot force  them

to  smile at me because such a smile comes from

the  bottom  of  their hearts."  Likewise,  Mr

Speaker,  the  question of culture.  We  cannot

force any kind of culture upon the people.  The

people  themselves must voluntarily accept  the

culture, a culture which they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2479</b></font><br><br>

themselves  wish  to  make as  the  basis  for  a

Malayan nation. Therefore, a national culture can

only be born from a sincere and honest desire  of

the  people  who wish to practise it and  without

its being forced on them. Therefore, in a country

like  Singapore,  where there is  a  multi-racial

society,  we must have a Ministry of Culture.  It

is  not  for  the  purpose of forcing  a  certain

culture   upon  the  people.  But   it   is   the

responsibility  of this Ministry to  bring  about

goodwill  and understanding between  the  various

races so that they can live in harmony and peace.

Otherwise, if they do not know one another, there

will  be  no  feelings  of  love.  So  the  first

responsibility of this Ministry is  to  introduce

the   culture   of  the  various   people   among

themselves.

<br><br>6.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, if plays are performed by

Malays,  the  audience  are  limited  to  Malays;

similarly  with the Chinese and the Indians.  But

with the creation of this Ministry of Culture, we

can  stage  the dances of the various  races  and

have  an audience composed of the various  races.

If  the Chinese put up a lion dance play, it does

not  mean  that  it will swallow up  the  Malays.

Similarly, if the Malays perform the art of self-defence, it does not mean that it is stabbing the

Chinese.  If they can understand the  meaning  of

the  word "art", then they will not be afraid  of

the lion dance nor will they fear the art of self-defence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the first and primary job of culture is to

introduce  the  various cultures. We  should  not

forget that to create a Malayan culture the  most

important  factor is language.  Language  is  the

instrument to unite all races for the purpose  of

creating  culture.  For that reason,  it  is  our

declared   policy  that  Malay  be  the  national

language.  If this can be practised  as  a  first

step - we  are  going to have  National  Language

Week - then  I  am  confident, Mr Speaker,  that  this

matter   will  be  resolved  with  the  best   of

intentions. Language reflects the nation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2480</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Mr Speaker, when talking about

all these matters, we must have a people who owe

their  allegiance  to  this  country.  If   they

realise  that they will live and die here,  then

the spirit of compromise will emerge between the

various  races. After that it will be  easy.  We

have  been  segregated by the  colonialists.  We

should  not forget the old diseases left by  the

colonialists  and  which  cannot  be  eradicated

quickly.  I  wish to warn all political  leaders

not to stir up communal feelings in cultural and

religious  matters which may lead to undesirable

consequences in our multi-racial society. I hope

they will not use this means for political ends.

They  will  win,  but  let  us  not  forget  the

disastrous  consequences. For that  reason,  Mr

Speaker, I very much regret the speech  made  by

the  Member for Anson. In the beginning  he  has

said  he  has  all the respect for  the  various

cultures. Then he alleges that the Government is

killing  Chinese culture. I hope  this  sort  of

thing will not happen in our community.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  last speaker tells you he regrets  my

speech.  Sir, I would like to say there  is  one

speech   from  the  Opposition  which  I  really

enjoyed.  It was a magnificent speech, and  with

much of it I agree -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> From the Government?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir, from the

opposite  benches. Sir, there are two  or  three

misunderstandings.  I  did  not  say  that   the

creation  of  a  Malayan culture  was  easy.  Of

course,  not.  At  no time  it  is  to  my  mind

impossible  for  any group to create.  It  is  a

matter  of evolution of time. Nor did  I  single

out  Chinese  culture as being attacked  by  the

Government. But there is one aspect with which I

must  disagree with the Member. Sir, he has  the

right  approach  when  he  says,  do  not   stir

communal   issues;  they  could  have  dangerous

repercussions. That is true. But, Sir, there  is

a  far  greater danger in allowing an  ulcer  to

fester  quietly than to lance it. I  say  it  is

wise  to  bring  into  the  open  the  deep-felt

emotional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2481</b></font><br><br>

anger about certain aspects of Government policy.

It  clears  the air and it also shows  Government

what  the  Opposition  and  some  people  in  the

country  think. You heard a Member on the  Government  Front  benches  tell you  that  nobody  has

complained to the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we all follow the advice of the last speaker

and  do  not mention it because we fear  arousing

communal  emotions,  we will  have  exactly  that

attitude. Nobody complains; therefore, it is  all

right. The question of communal issues is like  a

nettle.  Grasp it firmly, grasp it cleanly,  deal

with it honestly, do not pursue it beyond what is

necessary  to  make the point. Sir,  we  disagree

there,  and  he is entitled to his views.  To  my

mind,  it is healthy and it is necessary to raise

an issue of that character.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of course, I agree with the last speaker

that we need a Ministry of Culture, but I say  we

do  not  need  a  Ministry of P.A.P.  Propaganda.

There  is  a  distinction. We need a Ministry  of

Culture.  I  agree  with him  completely  in  his

assessment  of some of the aspects of work  which

the  Ministry of Culture could achieve but which,

unfortunately,  the  Ministry  is  not   pursuing

seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the Member for Kampong Kapor - I am

sorry;  I  think he holds an office in Government

which I have definitely forgotten.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> He is the Parliamentary Secretary

to the Minister for Culture.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Culture? Forgive me, Sir. The

Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister   for

Culture has listened so attentively to my speech.

He  misunderstood the only point he stood  on.  I

did  not complain, Sir, that I received no reply.

I  said the reply I received refused me sight  of

the script. Then he referred to another letter in

which I invited a certain civil servant to attend

my  rally where I had intended to attack him, and

he said that was improper conduct.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have ruled that out.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2482</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes. I have ruled out that

letter.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You ruled out the letter but not

the reference, I thought, Sir; his reference to

it.  I  just want to make this point. If  I  am

going  to attack a civil servant, surely it  is

only  right and proper that I should write  and

tell  him, and give him the opportunity  to  be

present.  That is my understanding of  culture,

obviously  not that of the gentleman who  spoke

on   behalf   of   the   Ministry   and   whose

understanding  of  culture  I  cannot  possibly

agree  with.  To my mind, it is  the  essential

fairness  to  the officer in question  that  he

should be invited to be present and I am  sorry

the  Parliamentary Secretary  thinks  that  was

improper conduct.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  am  glad to hear from the  Member  for

Anson,  for he has tried to draw back  what  he

said  just  now.  Because just now  he  clearly

alleged that the Government was destroying  the

root  of  cultural heritage.  But  now  he  has

swallowed his own words.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose-

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes, Sir. Surely if I am

misrepresented it is a point of order. He  says

I  have swallowed my words and withdrawn what I

have said. That is not correct, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, the Member for Choa Chu Kang said that  we

should  allow  the  mutual  interflow  of   the

cultures of the various communities and not try

to stress their merits or defects. I agree with

this very much. But then he alleged that we had

interfered with the free staging of dramas  and

plays   in  Singapore.  We  have  an  executive

committee. When an application by any  organisa

tion  to  stage any programme is  refused,  the

decision can be reviewed by this committee.  As

far as I know, there is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2483</b></font><br><br>



book-stall  in Singapore - I think I can  tell  the

Member  for  Choa Chu Kang that it is  the  Youth

Book  Store - which has published  many  works  and

books  by  local artistes. According  to  what  I

know, the Government has banned only two of these

plays.  One  describes  how  the  police  of  the

Federation  of Malaya used their gun  barrels  to

murder rubber tappers who were unarmed. But  this

kind  of  action in this environment of ours,  in

this  multi-racial society of  ours,  is  perhaps

that of the Communists in the Federation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point the Member for Choa Chu Kang has

raised is about dances. We have only banned those

dances  which were imported from Communist  China

praising  Mao Tse-Tung and the People's  Republic

of  China. If we allow this kind of publications,

dances or dramas or plays to be imported into our

multi-racial  society,  it  perhaps   may   cause

suspicion   among  the  Malays  and   the   other

communities.  Another  play  was  about   certain

strikes. This was written by a local play-wright.

Now  we are encouraging that all kinds of strikes

should   be   settled  by  peaceful   means   and

negotiations. For instance, a book describes  how

the  strikes  in  1956 were staged  and  how  the

police  used force to cause bloodshed and so  on,

would  such  a book be desirable in  the  present

circumstances?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is that before we approve any

item  of programme to be staged, we have to  take

into regard our ultimate objective of merger with

the  Federation  of Malaya. In this  respect,  we

have  to  see  to  it  that  we  have  favourable

conditions and an environment that are  conducive

to  merger,  and not try to cause any  suspicions

among any races.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 50 -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The time allotted for Head 50

expires  at  7.10 p.m. I propose  to  add  five

minutes  to  the time allotted for Head  50,  a

further  five  minutes for Head  51,  and  five

minutes  for Head 52. Head 50 - the time  expires

at 7.15 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, I rise to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head

50 be reduced by $100.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2485</b></font><br><br>

I  will  be  very brief, Sir. There is under  the

Preservation  of  Public  Security  Ordinance  a

Review  Tribunal which, at the time I  formulated

that  Ordinance  as  a  temporary  measure,   was

presided over by a Judge and it had the power  to

make  its own orders, and if it released a person

the  Government could not interfere. This  P.A.P.

Government  which  says it is socialist  and  for

liberty  removed the protection of the Judge.  It

also removed -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think the hon.

Member can say that the P.A.P. Government removed

it. It was a decision of this Assembly. As far as

I  can  remember, I think it was an amendment  of

the   Ordinance.  If  the  hon.  Member  is   not

satisfied,  he must then beg leave  to  introduce

another Bill to bring back the old provisions.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, the

protection  of  the  Judge  was  removed  at  the

instance   of  this  Government.  The   provision

whereby  the Tribunal had the right to  make  the

order  was also removed at the instance  of  this

Government. There !is nothing left but the  power

to advise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason given by the Prime Minister was

that  the Judges were unhappy at being associated

with   the  administration  of  these  provision.

Imagine  my surprise when I discovered  than,  in

fact,  it  is a High Court Judge who is presiding

over one of these Tribunals. Now I would like  to

know  whether  it is the Government's  intention,

insofar as it can for the period in question,  to

reinstate the previsions of the protection  given

by  not merely having a High Court Judge,  as  it

has  now,  but  also by giving that Tribunal  the

power to make the order and not merely to advise.

I  would  also  ask  the  Minister  on  how  many

occasions  up to now has the Government  rejected

or not acted in accordance with the advice of

the Tribunal.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, the subject raised by

the Member for Anson was clearly explained by the

Prime Minister when he moved the amendment to the

P.P.S.O. in 1959. The main reason was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2486</b></font><br><br>

that  the Judges were unhappy - as the hon. Member

knew  full well. In view of impending merger,  I

think   it   is  highly  undesirable   for   the

Government  to move a further amendment  to  the

P.P.S.O., which will mean a departure from  what

is  in  force  in the Federation at the  moment,

because I think the Internal Security Act of the

Federation   also  provides  for   an   Advisory

Committee  and not a Tribunal. As far  as  I  am

aware,  Sir, I do not think I have acted against

the  advice of the Advisory Committee. I am  not

very sure, but I do not think I have done so.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I said that I understood the

Prime  Minister  to  say that  the  Judges  were

removed  by  this House at the  request  of  the

Government  because they were unhappy  at  being

associated  with the administration of  the  pro

visions. But the curious thing is that there  is

a  High  Court Judge. So that unhappiness  could

not have been real. Why should the power not  be

given back, or an assurance not be given to this

House that the Government will at all times  act

in accordance with the advice of this Tribunal?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> So far as I can see, the

difference is that in the case of

the  adivisory Committee the Chairman may  be  a

High  Court Judge but he only gives advice.  The

responsibility lies with the Executive  and  not

with the Judiciary.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Will you give me an assurance?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $931,750 for Head 50 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2486</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 51 -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The time is now altered to 7.25 p.m. The time at which consideration will end is 7.25 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I rise to move the motion standing  in  my

name,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 51

be reduced by $100.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2487</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would enquire whether,

since the Government is so confident of what they

call  merger, this sum for defence services would

be  carried by the Federation and is part of  the

$10  to $12 million which we will be giving  them

for  the  purposes  of defence and  a  diplomatic

corps. I would enquire whether the Government  is

conscious  of  the need, for the  future,  of  re

fraining from utilising the military forces in  a

provocative manner.

<br><br>7.15 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during the City Council

strike - I  shall  call the  Public  Daily-Rated

Employees  Federation  for  simplicity  the  City

Council  strike - troops were used in a highly  provocative manner insofar as I could judge  myself.

It  was  wholly  unnecessary. Everywhere  that  I

could see in the places where I saw these troops,

the strikers were completely peaceful. Sir, there

was  no  need to use, troops at all so far  as  I

could  judge, and the police were adequate. Again

this  morning  we  see  newspaper  pictures   and

reports  of troops being used in the eviction  of

42  individuals. Surely, Sir, our Police Force is

adequate. I am a little uneasy at what  seems  to

me to be a provocative use of military force, and

I would request an explanation.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> To the first point raised by

the Member for Anson - whether  in the event of merger this would  be  a

commitment  of the Central Government - the  answer

is  obviously  "Yes". The White  Paper  is  quite

clear on that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the use of troops. They were

necessary in the City Council strike, because  on

the first day of the strike, strikers resorted to

illegal  methods of intimidation. It  was,  there

fore,  necessary to mount a show  of  force,  and

this had an immediate salutary effect. After this

demonstration of strength, the strikers in  their

picketing action complied strictly with the  law,

with  the result that we went through that strike

peacefully and without incident after the  second

day. And



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2488</b></font><br><br>

I  say  that, far from the use of troops  being

provocative,  they were deployed  to  give  the

minimum of provocation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not need any advice from the Member

for  Anson on such unfortunate occasions as may

arise on how to use troops, the police, and  so

forth.  Members  will recollect,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  that  during the years 1955-56  when  the

Member  for Anson was at the helm of State,  we

saw  him  being chased from pillar to post.  He

tried  to  please people who were not there  to

argue in a reasonable and logical way. He tried

to  deceive  himself into believing that,  when

you are confronted with a political force which

is, not out to seek a reasonable settlement  of

issues, you can argue with them, you can  treat

them   as   reasonable   people   across    the

negotiating  table. Sir, we  saw  during  those

days  how  the Member for Anson,  when  he  was

Chief Minister, was chased from pillar to post,

allowed the administration to collapse, allowed -

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is false.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> - the whole apparatus of

State  to  be regarded with contempt by  people

who  should  have  been taught  a  lesson.  The

result   of   his  feeble,  weak,   vacillating

policies   was   that   ultimately   when   the

Communists mounted the effort against  him,  he

was  reduced to a quivering, whimpering,  half-demented pulp of a man -

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You are a liar!

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member for Anson

knows  that  [Interruption]. Order. The  Member

for  Anson  knows  that is  an  unparliamentary

word.  It  must never be used in this Assembly.

He  must  apologise to the House  and  withdraw

that word.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I apologise, Mr Speaker.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> And withdraw the word.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I withdraw.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, history is a record of

facts.  It  is  quite  unnecessary  for  me  to

conjure up imaginative events



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2489</b></font><br><br>

when  they  are  recorded in newspaper  accounts,

when everyone knew that when the major effort was

mounted  against  him,  he  fell  sick.  And   in

Singapore, one degree north of Equator, where the

temperature  is  always  above  80  degrees,  the

Member  for  Anson  had to go around  in  woollen

suits, and eventually -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Is all that necessary or

relevant?  I will refuse to allow any details  of

that nature.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The point I want to make is

that  when we deployed the instruments  of  force

which  every State must have at its command,  the

objective is not to provoke action. The objective

is to subdue any thought of illegal resistance - to

convince   the  persons  against  whom   such   a

demonstration of force is necessary, that  it  is

quite  unprofitable  for them  to  mount  illegal

resistance.  If  we had relied  on  the  innocent

approach recommended by the Member for Anson,  we

could have perhaps sent a couple of policemen  to

each of these Work Brigade camps and tell them to

behave   themselves.  Far  from  achieving   this

objective, Mr Speaker, Sir, might I say that the

result would be that the mutinous members of  the

Brigade  might  have  been tempted,  or  probably

would  have  been tempted, to assault  policemen,

the arm of the law; the police on whom we rely to

enforce   law  and  order?  It  was,   therefore,

necessary in this exercise to have such a show of

overwhelming strength that even the most reckless

of  the  members of the Brigade would  have  been

brought  immediately to their senses and complied

with the orders which had been lawfully given  to

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not regard this

exercise  with any particular pride or happiness,

this  series  of events in the Work  Brigade.  It

has, to the Government, been a regrettable thing.

It  is  regrettable because so many  hundreds  of

young men and women, whom we are trying to assist

to  start  a  useful career in  life,  have  been

deceived by evil men conspiring behind the scenes

to  use  these  persons as instruments  of  their

policy   to   discredit  and   bring   down   the

Government. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2490</b></font><br><br>

gives  us no pleasure at all, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

for  us  to  carry  out this exercise;  but  the

decision having been taken, discipline  must  be

enforced,  and law and order must be maintained.

We  do  not  shrink from these  measures.  Quite

unlike  the Member for Anson, Sir, who tries  to

avoid  unpleasant decisions. When the time comes

for  us to make an unpleasant decision, we stand

up to the challenge, Mr Speaker, Sir. We do not

scoot like cowards, like the Member for Anson.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I object.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Minister must now

withdraw the word "coward" used of a Member  of

this House.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> As you so wish, Mr

Speaker, Sir, I withdraw.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Time has -

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order. Is it

permissible   that   I   request   that   those

statements should be referred to the

Committee  of  Privileges?  Because  they   are

false.  He  has made repeated false  statements

about my past actions, and I do say, Sir,  they

should be referred to the Committee.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I will not act under the

Standing Orders in this context, but if the hon.

Member is dissatisfied, he

can  file  a  notice of a motion alleging  that

there  is a breach of privilege or an abuse  of

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order. Is it

in  order  to suggest that an hon. Member  abuses

another Member?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Chair is in a very

difficult  position if he has to decide  what  is

and what is not abuse. I think jibes and counter-jibes  have  gone across the table. Some  of  the

jibes  can be construed as abuse and some cannot.

Mr David Marshall.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I did refer to any hon. Member.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir. One can

hardly  hope for satisfaction when one  can  only

register a protest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been told that there is $1�* million

less  in  Entertainment Duty  for  1962,  and  we

anticipate for 1963. We know, Sir, that 14 out of

the  19  persons  appointed to the  Film  Censors

Board of Appeal are P.A.P. persons. I did earlier

ask, Sir, in a speech on the Budget Statement for

an answer. I did not get any, and it looks like I

am  not going to get any. In those circumstances,

I  shall  press  for a division. The  Government,

Sir,  in acting in the way it has acted, and  the

Minister, in acting in the way he has acted,  has

shown  a  disregard  for  the  Opposition  and  a

contempt  for  democratic procedure.  Sir,  apart

from  protesting  against  the  conduct  of   the

Government in appointing P.A.P. personnel to  the

Film Censors Board of Appeal, and apart from  pro

testing  against  conduct  which  seems  to  have

resulted  in  a  loss  of  $1�  million  to   our

Treasury,  I now add a protest at the conduct  of

the  Minister  who,  l  say,  has  shown  by  his

attitude   a   few  moments  ago   his   complete

unworthiness for his post or any post at all.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr David Marshall.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for a number of years now, there has been

a  serious  shortage  of  trained  staff  in  our

schools.  We hope that by 1963 the Minister  will

have   enough  trained  staff  to,  prevent  this

instability of staffing in the schools. Sir, this

instability   of   staffing   has   led   to   an

unsatisfactory  state  of affairs.  If  heads  of

schools  are transferred after one or two  years,

and sometimes only after a few months, or trained

teachers are taken from one school to reinforce a

new  school,  although the Ministry may  find  it

necessary,  yet  from the point of  view  of  the

parents  and the students, the whole position  is

not satisfactory. Sir, judging from the point  of

view of the heads and the teachers themselves, if

they  know  they are going to be in a school  for

three  or five years, they will think not of  the

short-term   objective,  but  of  the   long-term

objective.  They know that if they plan  a  thing

and  carry it out, they will be able to  see  the

results. But if they have no such certainty, they

will  reason  out  that it  is  no  use  planning

something if they are

not  going to be there to see the fruits of  what

they  have  sown. The result of such instability,

Sir, is that the heads regard themselves as stop-gap measures, and the best thing to do is to keep

the  machinery  moving with the result  that  the

children and the schools suffer. From



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2494</b></font><br><br>

the point of view of the parents, they feel that

they  cannot identify the school as being linked

up with a certain head

or  a certain senior teacher; the staffing is so fluid  that  they themselves get  confused.  The

children,  like little children  who  see  their

parents  changing and their nurses changing  all

the time, have also a sense of instability and a

lack of continuity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would suggest that, as soon as trained

teachers  are  sufficient,  the  schools  be  so

organised  that  they have  teams  of  heads  of

schools  and  teachers  stablised  round   them,

because  unless there is this kind of stability,

I  am  afraid, Sir, we will not be able to  have

efficiency,  co-ordination  and  the   long-term

interest of the students and the community round

these schools looked after. This is a suggestion

that  I  make  for the Minister's consideration,

because we have found that where a school has  a

stable  staff and a head who knows that he  will

be  there  for some years, there can be  maximum

efficiency, continuity, a team spirit, a  family

spirit  produced  and  a community  round  these

schools. We also feel that the school belongs to

the community.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, I

do  not intend to raise under this amendment  the

many  faults  and deficiencies of this  Ministry.

This will be dealt with in the substantive motion

seeking  a  Commission. But this afternoon  I  do

rise  on  what  may  seem  a  minor  matter,  but

nevertheless it is important to many parents.  In

1959,  Mr  Speaker,  many  students  failed  the

Secondary School Entrance Examination. They  were

told that they would be posted to Post Primary  I

and  thereafter  to Post Primary II.  They  under

stood  that after Post Primary II, having  passed

it, they would be allowed to join the main stream

in the secondary schools. Sir, I myself have very

little  knowledge  of these aspects,  but  I  was

approached  by a parent and he drew my  attention

to  the  fact that his daughter, who was  one  of

those  who  failed  in 1959, was  put  into  Post

Primary I in 1960, did well, went to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2495</b></font><br><br>



Post  Primary II in 1961, did well, and  in  fact

she  was  amongst the top 25 or 30 per cent.  But

despite  this, she has received a letter  telling

her  that she has been dismissed from the  school

and she could not be considered for a transfer to

a secondary school since the standard of the Post

Primary  II examination is below that of  Primary VI.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, she is not the only one affected.

I understand a large number of them are affected.

I  wrote to the Minister on the 4th of September.

That  was two weeks ago, Sir,I have not had  the

courtesy of an acknowledgement or a reply. It  is

true  he is busy, but I had anticipated at  least

that  somebody  would have replied  pointing  out

what  the  true  position is,  if,  in  fact,  my

information is inaccurate. The unhappy  position,

Sir,  is this. If those two years, 1960 and 1961,

were  in  fact  inadequate to  bring  her  up  to

secondary school standard, which she had taken in

1959,  they  were a fraud upon the  child  and  a

fraud upon the parents. Secondly, they were given

the  impression,  Sir, and  I  ask  the  Minister

whether  this is correct, that these Post-Primary

classes  were to equip the students to cope  with

secondary school curricula.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I wish to put

two points to the Minister. Although this expendi

ture  is  for  1963,  I  hope  the  Minister  for

Education  will  implement it during  this  year.

Many  parents  have complained that the  students

are  required to use a particular school  uniform

and  that  the cloth can only be bought from  one

shop.   This  is  inconveniencing  poor  parents,

because  that particular shop will  then  have  a

monopoly. I think the best thing for all students

in  Singapore to do is to use one school  uniform

for  the  sake  of convenience, so  that  when  a

student   is  transferred  from  one  school   to

another,  there  will be no need  to  change  his

uniform.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2496</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the purchase of textbooks, Mr

Speaker. This is a source of hardship  to  poor

parents.  If  a student is in Primary!  V  this

year  and  he has a younger brother in  Primary

IV, the child in Primary IV will not be able to

use  his  brother's books when he  goes  up  to

Primary V. I do not know why the textbooks keep

on  changing  every  year. This  is  merely  to

benefit  the  printers at the  expense  of  the

parents. I hope the Ministry of Education  will

help  to  resolve  this  problem  in  order  to

alleviate the hardships of the parents most  of

whom cannot afford to buy textbooks. If the old

textbooks can be used, it will be a great  help

to those parents who have many children.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I should like to reply

very   briefly,  first,  to  the   Member   for

Tanglin's  remark  regarding  the  shortage  of

trained staff, which he hopes would be overcome

by  1963.  That,  I think, is a  forlorn  hope,

because, according to the Four-Year Development

Plan   we  have  indicated  that  it  will   be

necessary   to  recruit  no  less  than   1,000

teachers  each year. Because of the large  size

of  our admission per year - between 55,000  and

60,000   children - and  about  20,000  leaving

school,  we  have therefore a net increase  per

year  of something like 35,000 students.  At  a

rough ratio of 1 teacher to 30 or 35 pupils per

class,  we  must have at least 1,000  teachers.

Therefore, if we have to recruit 1,000 teachers

each  year, there is no, alternative except  to

train our teachers by the in-service method. On

the  whole,  they will have to do 3  years  in-service  training largely for primary  schools.

Therefore,  each  year we shall  be  having  at

least  3,000  teachers under  training  at  the

Teacher's Training College. So you can see  the

size of our problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1959, we started with 10,000 teachers.

Every  year there has been an increase of 1,000

teachers.  So  by  1963, we  will  have  14,000

teachers.   Of  the  14,000,  3,000   will   be

undergoing  training. Much as I would  like  to

see trained teachers being produced at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2497</b></font><br><br>

rate of 1,000 per year, it is not something that

seems foreseeable in the near future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I will reply to the Member for Anson. I

wish to apologise to him for not having been able

to   reply   to   his  letter.  He  himself   did

acknowledge that I have been quite busy in recent

weeks.  The tone of his letter was rather strong.

He used the word "fraud" in the provision of Post-Primary classes. Knowing the Member for Anson,  I

did feel that when replying to him I should couch

my  reply in such words as not to bring about  an

altercation  with  him outside  the  Assembly.  I

would like to assure him, first of all, that  the

Post-Primary classes were first started  in  1960

because  the  result  of  the  Secondary   School

Entrance  Examination (as it was known  in  1959,

and  which has since been changed to the  Primary

School Leaving Examination) was so bad that  only

31 per cent of the students passed it. Now had we

attempted  to  follow  the previous  Government's

policy,  what would have happened would  be  that

only  31  per cent would have gone into secondary

schools and the remaining 69 per cent - those from

the  English primary schools - would have had  to

fend for themselves in private schools or get out

of  school  completely. We felt that  that  would

create  a great social problem. So we immediately

got together to give these poor kids a chance  to

stay  in school. Now, the main tragedy was  this.

Because  of  the automatic promotion system  that

existed  in  the  English primary  schools  since

1951,  I  think what happened was this.  Although

they took the so-called Secondary School Entrance

Examination,  a good percentage of  the  students

were  only  of Primary III or Primary  IV  level,

because they were not examined at all. They  just

moved  up  year  by  year.  So,  having  provided

classes for the nearly 4,000 pupils who

failed  the  examination, we did find that  after

one  year in Post-Primary classes, only 200  were

salvaged. In other words, we found them  able  to

keep  pace  with  the secondary school  students,

and  they  were siphoned off. But the  rest  were

such  poor material that all we could do  was  to

give them another year of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2498</b></font><br><br>

education in school. There was no fraud at all.

We  were  trying to keep them in school.  After

these  two years, they were still not  able  to

catch   up  with  the  secondary  stream   and,

therefore, would have to leave. That really  is

the   position,  Sir,  about  the  Post-Primary

classes,  and  this  is only  the  transitional

period.  We  intend to put these children  into

regular  secondary vocational schools  for  two

years.  That  is why we had the  Commission  of

Inquiry    into   Vocational   and    Technical

Education. Its Report has been tabled, but  the

White Paper of the Government has not yet  been

placed before this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, to reply to the Member for the

Southern  Islands. It is, I think, a very  good

suggestion  that  all schools should  have  the

same  type of uniform. But there would be  this

danger,  that we would be accused of trying  to

standardise everyone. Every school has a little

pride about the type of uniform that it designs

for  its pupils. But, on the other hand, we  do

say  that  no  school should  really  tell  its

pupils  that  t  they must  buy  cloth  from  a

particular shop. But generally they  have  some

little understanding in that they get a special

rebate, and so school children will benefit  by

going  to  a  particular shop  because  of  the

special rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for textbooks, Sir, it is a little

regrettable  that  there should  be  changes  in

textbooks  because we are talking  in  terms  of

Malayanisation  of textbooks. So  it  is  likely

that   books  are  being  changed  because   the

authorities feel that better types of books  are

now   available  and  are  more  in  line   with

Malayanisation. Hence the changes  in  the  text

books. But all we should -
