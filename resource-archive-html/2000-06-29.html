<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question Nos. 1 and 2 stood in the name of Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To ask the Minister for Trade and Industry how his

Ministry interprets the 1999 Labour Force Survey which showed

an  increasing trend in income disparity; and what plans  the

Government has to help the unskilled, lower-income workers to

improve their job prospect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To ask the Minister for Trade and Industry how his

Ministry interprets the 1999 Labour Force Survey which showed

a  rise in income inequality; and what social safety nets are

available   to   help  the  lowest-income  households   avoid

hardship.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  whether any further constructive  steps  have  been

taken  by  the Government to render assistance to the  bottom

10% of the population whose household income had plummeted.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  whether  his  Ministry will  quickly  identify  the

household income of only $133.00 and encourage them  to  take

up the many better-paid unskilled jobs

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



that  our small and medium enterprises are desperately trying

to  fill  up  to meet the demand in the service,  retail  and

manufacturing sectors.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Dr Jennifer Lee</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  whether  single-parent families  and  other  family

structures  not  within our "traditional" definition  form  a

disproportionate  number  of the households  in  the  lowest-income  group and, if so, whether the Government will  review

its policies to help these families bridge the income divide.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Question No. 1, Sir.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to take

Question Nos. 1 to 5 together, please?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> The Government has always been

committed  to  helping  low  income  families  improve  their

economic  prospects and living standard.   First,  we  ensure

that their basic needs are met through affordable housing and

healthcare.   Second, we help equip them with  the  means  to

support  themselves by providing heavily subsidised education

and  skills  training.    Third, we  help  create  ample  job

opportunities by building a strong and competitive economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach has worked well for us. Over the years,

low  income families in Singapore have seen their incomes and

living standard rise steadily, in real terms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among households in the bottom 20%, 95% own colour TV

sets, 90% own telephones, and 77% own washing machines. These

ownership rates are better than even the national average  of

all households in many developing countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our achievement in home ownership is also good. While

many  of the poor in other countries are homeless, the lowest

20% of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>



households  in Singapore are well-housed.  75%  of  them  own

their own homes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have achieved this without creating dependence or

weakening  the  family, and in a way which gives  opportunity

and  hope  for  the  children of low income  families  to  do

better.  All segments of our society are thus able to benefit

from  our economic prosperity, and this is part of the reason

for Singapore's political stability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the progress we have made, many people were

surprised and disturbed by newspaper headlines claiming  that

the  lowest 10% of our households lived on only $133 a month.

In fact, the headlines were misleading and inaccurate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Statistics had reported that, in 1999,

the  average income from work of the bottom 10% of households

was  $133 per month.  This was the statistical average.   75%

of  these households had members who did not work at all  and

therefore reported zero income.  This pulled down the average

income for this group of households to $133 per month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statistical average of $133 per month in 1999 was

sharply lower than the average of $258 per month in 1998. The

main  reason  was  that the proportion of households  in  the

bottom  10% with no working persons went up from 62% in  1998

to  75%  in  1999.   Put it another way,  the  proportion  of

households with persons working fell sharply from  more  than

one-third (38%) to one-quarter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was partly because unemployment increased during

the regional economic crisis, and also because the number  of

retiree  households  had grown. (The  proportion  of  retiree

households  in the bottom 10% has risen from 27% in  1997  to

32%  in  1998 and 35% in 1999*.)  [*The increase  in  retiree

households  can  be attributed to (a) the ageing  population,

and  (b) older workers choosing to retire due to the poor job

opportunities during the economic crisis.]  Dr  Jennifer  Lee

asked  whether  there  is a disproportionate  number  of  the

households in the lowest-income group which are single-parent

families.  Single parent

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



families  constituted only 4.2% of households in  the  bottom

10%  in 1999*.  [*Definied as households with heads who  are:

(a)   single,  widowed,  divorced/separated;  and  (b)   with

children  below  16 years of age.  The percentage  of  single

parent  households in the bottom 10%, although low, is higher

than  the  national average of 1.8%.]  This  was  in  fact  a

slight reduction from the 4.5% in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cushion the impact of the crisis on the lower income

families, the Government had provided rebates in HDB  rental,

utilities and service and conservancy charges as part of  the

cost  cutting package. This assistance amounted to about  $46

per  month for households in HDB 1- and 2-room flats, and $36

per month for those in HDB 3-room flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan has suggested that we help the bottom

10%  take  up  the many better-paid unskilled jobs  that  our

small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are trying to fill.   The

Ministry of Manpower (MOM) provides employment assistance, at

no  charge, to unemployed Singaporeans who have  difficulties

finding  a  job,  including those  in  the  bottom  10%.   It

actively  sources for job vacancies, and organises job  fairs

and   outplacement  events  in  partnership  with  employers,

unions, and the Community Development Councils.  SMEs seeking

workers are encouraged to register their job offers  with MOM

and participate in its recruitment events.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the economy recovers and the job market improves,

more  people  in  the  bottom  10%  would  be  able  to  find

employment and the income growth of working households should

resume.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the bottom 10% of households, their median CPF

savings  amounted to $20,000 in 1999.  Among them,  only  25%

live  in  1-  or 2- room HDB flats.  39% live in  HDB  3-room

flats,  24%  in  4-room or larger flats and  11%  in  private

properties.  Nearly all of these are owner-occupied.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, many in the bottom 10% have significant

wealth, in the form of CPF savings and their homes.  They are

not an underclass.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken some time to put the Department of

Statistics'  figures in context, as it is important  that  we

get  a  right  picture  of the bottom 10%  income  households

before  we  discuss how best to help them.   There  are  poor

Singaporeans in our midst but the situation is not at all  as

bad  as  the headlines portrayed. To help the less  well-off,

the  Government  has  put  in place  a  range  of  assistance

programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Community Development and Sports (MCDS)

has various schemes that target the most disadvantaged in our

society.   The  Public Assistance (PA) Scheme  provides  long

term  financial help. PA recipients also receive free medical

services   and  assistance  in-kind.  The  Interim  Financial

Assistance  Scheme caters to those in need  of  shorter  term

help, while families in rental flats can seek relief from the

Rental and Utilities Assistance Scheme (RUAS). There are also

child  care and student care fee assistance schemes for  low-income  families.  The Community Development Councils  (CDCs)

further   complement  these  schemes  with  other  assistance

tailored for their needy residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the children of low income families, the Ministry of

Education  (MOE)  renders  help for  their  education.  MOE's

Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) provides needy pupils  from

families  receiving social assistance from MCDS a 50%  waiver

of  miscellaneous  fees, full waiver of  school  fees  and  a

textbook grant or an annual bursary.  Schools can augment the

assistance  through the School Advisory Committee  or  School

Management Committee Fund.  Children from low-income families

who  perform  well are also awarded Edusave Merit  Bursaries.

Many  charitable  foundations  and  grassroots  organisations

provide supplementary support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of healthcare, the Ministry of Health (MOH)

ensures that healthcare remains affordable and accessible  to

all,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>



including  the  poor.   Class  C wards  are  subsidised  80%.

Patients  facing difficulty in paying their healthcare  bills

are assisted by the Medifund scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Government also funds 90% of the

capital  expenditure and 50% of the recurrent expenditure  of

approved  projects by social service agencies.  This  enables

community organisations to provide a support system, such  as

counselling services or simple financial budgeting  guidance,

for  families in need which go beyond just dollars and cents.

Together with the National Council of Social Service, MCDS is

also  encouraging  more  corporations to  sponsor  assistance

programmes for the less fortunate.  This `many helping hands'

approach  enables us to create a strong basic  social  safety

net for the poor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, the bigger concern to us is the widening

income  gap  between the bottom and top earners. The  average

income ratio of the top 20% to the bottom 20% households  has

increased  from  13.6 times in 1997 to 17.9  times  in  1999.

This  was  partly because the impact of the recent  recession

was  much harder on the lower income households than  on  the

higher  income  households. However, it  is  also  likely  to

indicate a longer-term structural trend.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With globalisation, there is now a global market for

labour.    At   the   top,   scarce  talents   command   high

international wages while, at the bottom, the wages earned by

those  who  are  unskilled  come  under  increasing  downward

pressure  from  the hundreds of millions in the  Third  World

joining  the  global market who are prepared to  work  for  a

pittance.   This  is a worldwide trend which  our  system  of

foreign worker levies ameliorate only to a point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, the ratio of average income of the top 20% to

bottom 20% increased

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>



from  12.2  in 1988 to 13.7 in 1998.  According to  a  recent

report in the International Herald Tribune, the income gap in

the  US  is  now  at its widest since data was  collected  in

1977*,  [*Study by the Center on Budget and Policy  Priorities

was  based on after-tax income figures from the Congressional

Budget  Office.   Source: IHT, 6 September 1999.]   with  the

ratio of top executives' to factory workers' pay increased 10-fold from 42 times in 1980, to 419 times in 1998*.  [*By  the

Institute  for Policy Studies and United for a Fair  Economy.

Source:  IHT, 6 September 1999.]   Even in Japan,  which  has

long  been  regarded as one of the world's  most  egalitarian

industrialized nations, the gap between the rich and poor  is

widening*.  [*Source: IHT, 5 January 2000.]  We can expect the

same to happen in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should be our response? First, we must make sure

that the incomes of those at the bottom continue to rise.  We

can  only  achieve  this  if our economy  continues  to  grow

healthily.   For  the  majority of  low-income  Singaporeans,

especially older and less educated workers, skills  upgrading

is  the  key  to  enhancing  employability  and  income.  The

Ministry of Manpower has therefore worked with employers  and

unions  to  launch the Skills Redevelopment Programme  (SRP).

Under  the SRP, generous grants covering up to 100% of course

fees  and  85%  of  absentee payroll  are  provided  for  the

training  of less educated workers aged 40 years  and  above.

The  target is to upgrade the skills of some 100,000  workers

through this programme by the year 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Ministry of Manpower is working with

other   Government   economic  agencies  and   employers   to

professionalise  jobs in domestic-based industries  with  low

productivity such as cleaning, construction and retail.   The

aim is to upgrade these jobs to achieve higher skill content,

and facilitate the training or retraining of workers in these

industries. With improved productivity, these industries  can

then provide more viable job opportunities for local workers,

including   those   displaced  as  a   result   of   economic

restructuring.   To support the various manpower  development

initiatives, the Government has set aside $200 million

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>



for the Manpower Development Assistance Scheme to co-fund the

projects with industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we must continue to ensure that lower income

families  have  the means and opportunities to  move  up  the

economic and social ladder.  That is to say, we must have  as

little   friction   as  possible  to  social   mobility   and

progression.   Here,  our education system  plays  a  crucial

role.   We  must give every child the best education possible

and  prepare him for the needs of the New Economy.   This  is

why  we  have always given the highest emphasis to education.

For  every  cohort, we are targeting 25% to have a university

education,  40% to have a polytechnic education  and  another

25% to have an ITE education.  We make sure that the children

of  poor  families are not disadvantaged.  MOE, MCDS and  the

CDCs help them financially so that no child is prevented from

being  educated  to  the limit of his potential  because  his

parents are poor, sick or unemployed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has pointed out, our

basic  approach is to level up.  The more economic growth  we

have, the more we will be able to level upwards.  The key  is

a healthy Singapore economy that is globally competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our social safety net sets a good minimum standard of

living  for the least well-off Singaporeans.  This undergirds

our  sense  of  community solidarity.  Beyond that,  we  must

always  give  hope to those at the bottom that even  if  they

themselves cannot do better, their children will be able  to.

At  all  times,  our system must incentivise  effort,  family

support and self-help.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether there will

be  newer incentives, apart from those mentioned earlier,  to

facilitate low-paid and low-skilled workers to go for further

training so that they can earn more wages?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> These are on-going programmes.

We have allocated funds for them.  As and when new needs

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>



come up, we will look at how these new needs can be met,  and

if  we have to allocate more funds for such undertakings,  we

will do so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> I would like to ask

the  Minister  to  review other aspects of this  issue  which

affects  the ability of lower income Singaporeans to  improve

their financial situation.  May I ask that he looks into  the

various Government policies which, though well-conceived  and

implemented with good intent, have the unintended  effect  of

disadvantaging  the lower income groups' ability  to  improve

themselves.   For  example, would  the  Minister  review  the

policy  of  prohibiting the sale of cooked food  prepared  in

homes?   Would  the  Minister consider reinstating  the  past

policy of allocating hawker stalls and school tuckshop stalls

to  deserving  applicants instead of tendering  them  to  the

highest bidders?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are some of the traditional ways in which the

poor  could improve their financial situation but today  they

are no longer available because of Government policies. Would

the  Minister  also  review HDB's policy  of  not  permitting

second-time direct purchases from HDB if the second  unit  is

of a lower category from the first even though both purchases

could  be within HDB's general policy of two direct purchases

from HDB? Surely, the removal ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Heng, are you making a speech?

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> No, Sir, I am asking questions. I

am  asking:  whether the Minister could do this or  do  that.

These are all questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I know that. But you are also punctuating

your questions with sentences.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> I agree. I will remove the

sentences.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister whether he could

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



establish an Inter-Ministry Committee to review and amend, if

needed,  such policies, taking into consideration the  effect

on  the poor and the diminishing number of opportunities  for

them  to  upgrade themselves.  I would also like to  ask  the

Minister that if he does so, whether feedback from the public

would be solicited.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, I thank Mr Heng for his

helpful  suggestions.  Some of the issues are not new issues,

like  whether we should allow cooked food to be  prepared  in

HDB  households. There are, of course, conflicting objectives

because  there  are externalities involved.   The  smoke  may

cause  annoyance to neighbours and we should strike a  proper

balance   between  allowing  for  flexibility   of   resource

allocation   and  not  causing  inconveniences  or   negative

externalities to people around.  But these are  issues  which

Ministries should review from time to time so that we are not

trapped  in old positions, especially with the new challenges

posed  by  changes in the world.  His particular  suggestions

will  be  forwarded  to  the  various  Ministries  for  their

consideration.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether the

widening  of  income  gap in Singapore is definitely  getting

worse  and  whether  this  will jeopardize  social  cohesion,

social stability and other related issues here?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> The most common index used by

countries  to  measure  inequality  of  income  is  the  gini

coefficient and the higher it is, the greater the inequality.

For   many  years,  before  the  economic  crisis,  our  gini

coefficient has improved and then flattened out.  During  the

crisis  year  of  1998,  it went up. So  we  asked  ourselves

whether this was just the result of the economic crisis which

hit  those  at  the bottom disproportionately or  whether  it

represented  a trend break.  We have been studying  the  gini

coefficient in advanced countries in the US, the OECD and  so

on,  and  we  have  noted that in these countries,  the  gini

coefficient has tended to worsen. So we ask ourselves:   what

is the likely tendency in the future?  I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



think we have worsened because of globalisation.  The top  in

our   social   ladder  would  command  international   wages,

particularly  in  growth sectors where  talents  are  scarce.

Many  of  our  hotshot  dot.com types  now  command  fabulous

salaries  or incomes because of the recent boom.  Of  course,

the  bubble  has  punctured  the boom  somewhat  but,  still,

relative to many other sectors, they have done very well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are those who are unskilled and,

increasingly, they are competing with the unskilled in China,

Vietnam,  Indonesia and India. With the end of the Cold  War,

these  countries are opening up and hundreds of  millions  of

people  are entering the workplace.  In the past,  when  they

lived  in  remote  villages, they could not  compete  in  the

global    market.    Now,    with    better    communication,

transportation,  Internet and e-commerce, more  and  more  of

them are entering the global market and this has a depressing

effect  on the wages which unskilled labour in Singapore  can

command.  Of course, in the services sector, they tend to  be

protected.   But  even  in  the  services  sector,  with  the

globalisation trends, more and more segments in the  services

sector are being opened up to global competitive pressure and

it  is in our own interest to open up the services sector  to

international competition because it lowers the cost of doing

business in Singapore and helps make the tradable sector more

competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the worsening of the gini coefficient continue

forever?   I  think  in  the  end,  it  will  find  its   own

equilibrium.  When a new frontier is opened,  there  are  the

robber  barons,  there are those who have  struck  gold,  and

there  are  those who are left penurious, so the  coefficient

tends  to  widen.  But after a while, stability will  resume.

Those  who are at the bottom will catch up, those who are  at

the  top  will find that temporary scarcity is met by growing

supply,  and so the trend may reverse itself years  down  the

road.  But when that will take place, we do not know  because

the  economic  changes  taking  the  world  today  are  truly

revolutionary.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> The Minister mentioned

the Government's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



target  to upgrade 100,000 less-educated workers by 2003.   I

would like to know from the Minister what are the targets  of

this  group  of workers specifically and what concrete  steps

the  Government  has taken so far to achieve  these  targets.

Also,  is  the Minister aware of the problems of  these  low-educated, low-paid workers, many of whom are trapped in  low-paid professions?  And will the Government consider providing

a  living allowance to these workers who are prepared  to  go

for  training?   The  other question  is:   in  view  of  the

widening income gap, will the Government review the benchmark

for  affordability  in  terms of  HDB  flats  and  healthcare

services?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> The Skills Redevelopment

Programme covers a wide range of retraining courses.   It  is

true that among the older workers, some find it hard even  to

get  themselves retrained in these courses.  But we have  had

some very good successes of workers going for retraining  and

finding good jobs in growth sectors of the economy. Take, for

instance, our disk-drive industry which has shed thousands of

workers  in  the last two years.  Many of these  workers  had

since  been  redeployed to other industry sectors.   Many  of

them are still in the electronics sector where we enjoy rapid

growth   in  the  components,  in  the  computer,   and   the

communication  segments.  We  do  provide  salary  assistance

through Government subsidy of absentee payroll.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we should, from time to time, review what

constitutes  a minimum safety net in Singapore,  I  think  we

should,  because  this  is what it means  to  be  part  of  a

community, that those at the bottom enjoy a minimum  standard

which is commensurate with the average living standard in our

society as a whole so that the inequalities are not so  gross

as to cause social discord and disruption.  If we look at the

bottom 10% in Singapore and compare them to the bottom 10% in

any  other major city in the world, whether it is London, New

York, Berlin, Tokyo or Hong Kong, I do not think we have done

too badly.  We should not measure a city by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



how  its  top 10% live.  Because they can live very well;  in

Hong  Kong,  they drive Rolls Royces, in New York,  it  is  a

lifestyle  which  many  of us can only imagine  or  fantasize

about.   But judge a city by how it looks after those at  the

bottom, its most downtrodden. And if we look around, I  think

we can be proud of what we have achieved in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I do not think the Minister

has  answered  my  questions. There are basically  two  focus

points.  One,  what  is  the  specific  target  and  how  the

Government intends to achieve the target of upgrading 100,000

workers by 2003 who are low-paid and less-educated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question I asked was whether the Government

will  review  the  benchmark for affordability  in  terms  of

healthcare and HDB flats.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

answered  both questions.  If Mr Low wants more details,  and

he  tables  another  Question, I will  get  the  details  and

provide them to him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Skills Redevelopment Programme, we have a

whole  range of courses for the retraining of workers to  fit

them  into  growth sectors in the economy. As to  his  second

question   whether   we  will  re-assess   what   constitutes

affordability  levels,  this is done on  a  continuing  basis

because it is always relative to the overall standards in our

community.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I am still

surprised  to  learn  that  in Singapore,  people  are  still

earning  only $133 per month.  I believe this is  due  to  an

educational problem. There are many workers in the  workforce

who are unable to read or write.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, can you ask your question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am asking the Government whether it

is  willing to tackle the problem at its source, ie, to amend

or   change  our  education  programme  because  it  is   too

inflexible at the moment and those slow learners will  always

be left behind and probably will be unable to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>



cope  and  may give up altogether. They end up by  not  being

even  able  to  read or write and how are we going  to  train

these workers if they cannot even have the basic literacy and

numeracy  skills?  So I am asking the Government  whether  it

wants  to  tackle the problem at its source by  changing  the

education  system to make it more flexible to cater  for  the

slow learners.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, I thank Mr Chiam for his

comments.  He is right that the root problem is education. If

we look at Singaporeans above the age of 40, less than one in

two  have  more than six years of education.   When  the  PAP

Government came into power, we introduced mass education  and

the  result has been a sharply increased educational  profile

of the population. Our educational profile of those above the

age  of 40 is basically a third-world educational profile and

many  of them will continue to be with us for a long time  to

come.  We  have  got  to find ways and means  to  help  them,

retrain  them, upgrade their skills, and so on.  Among  those

who  are  younger, aged 35 and below, our educational profile

is  first-class  and many of the good things which  Mr  Chiam

talked about are precisely the elements which are built  into

our  educational  system of providing for slow  learners,  or

going faster for fast learners, and so on.  If you go to  our

universities, polytechnics and even our ITEs today, the level

of  equipment, the facilities which are available to students

are  something unimaginable 10-20 years ago, and this attests

to the emphasis this Government has put on education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The younger ones, we can solve. Those who are coming up,

we  make  sure  that  from kindergarten onwards,  they  learn

computers.  They  play games at first,  Internet  access,  by

primary five do web pages. They are off.   But those who  are

already in the system who were educated during colonial  days

and  the early years of independence, we should try our  best

to  help  them  and in the past we had, and  we  still  have,

programmes like BEST and WISE, but there is only so  much  we

can  do  because for many skills, if you do not acquire  them

when you are young when

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>



their  minds are plastic and malleable, it is very  difficult

to  acquire them when you are older.  I have met workers  who

have  gone  through BEST and WISE and watched  them  struggle

with  square roots and so on.  It is tough.  They should try,

and  the  skills  should  as  far as  possible  be  practice-oriented, but that historical legacy will remain with us  for

many  more  years to come and we have got to take  that  into

account in all our programmes and policies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Other

than training and education for this group of people who find

difficulty in training, would the Minister consider playing a

more direct role in getting these Singaporeans obtain jobs in

the  region  where such jobs are more easily available?   You

cannot  train  them,  you  cannot  increase  their  level  of

education,  can  you perhaps help them to get jobs  elsewhere

outside  Singapore?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, I would not say that they

cannot  be  trained  or upgraded.  They can  be  trained  and

upgraded,  but what we can achieve will not be  the  same  as

what  we  can  achieve  with the young lads  or  lasses,  and

teenagers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we should send our unskilled workers to

neighbouring countries to work, I do not think that is right.

They enjoy a much higher standard of living in Singapore than

what  they  can  ever hope to enjoy, say, in other  parts  of

South  East Asia or even beyond.  We try to protect the  wage

levels in Singapore through the workers' levy.  Imagine if we

had  no work permit system in Singapore and no workers' levy,

then millions will want to come to Singapore and wages at the

bottom  will be greatly depressed.  This will cause not  only

social  problems  but  it will also  lead  to  a  Singaporean

underclass which would be a political problem.  So we try  to

strike  a balance between protecting those at the bottom  and

not  allowing  this protection to be such  a  weight  on  the

overall competitiveness of our economy.  It is a balance that

we have to strike well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member's proposal to send our unskilled

workers overseas, I think many of us would be against that.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, if I

understand  the  Minister  correctly,  the  statistical  $133

figure  is  caused  by a high percentage of  jobless  people.

Would  the  Minister be able to tell us if we minus  off  the

jobless  people, what is the true figure for the bottom?   In

that sense, has the actual figure itself gotten worse?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I would like to ask the Minister, if joblessness

is  the problem, are there ways to relook at policies to keep

jobs  in Singapore?  By this, what I mean is that instead  of

searching  only for higher value high technology  investments

in  Singapore,  should we look for reasonable wage  companies

and industries that will keep the bulk of jobs in Singapore?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the first

question,  in  1999, 75% of the bottom 10% of households  did

not have a working member.  Among the households that had  at

least  one  income earner, the average household  income  was

$530 per month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay also asked a broader question about our economic

strategy,  ie, whether we should not deliberately nurture  an

industry sector to cater to these people.  Let us say that we

create  such  a  sector.  Can we ever  bring  our  costs  low

enough,  say,  in disk drives, to compete with Malaysia,  the

Philippines or China?  I think that is an impossible game and

a  fool's  game, because in these countries, there  are  many

more  willing  to  work at even lower wages.   So  this  will

result  in  our  economy being constantly pulled  down.   Our

strategy  is  to move upstream.  When we have   R&D  centres,

wafer  fabs, pharmaceutical companies and petrochemical works

in  Singapore,  there are people at the  top  who  earn  high

salaries  because their skills are very scarce in the  world.

But  for each of these individuals that we have in our midst,

they  bring  work and opportunities to many other people  who

service   them,  who  maintain  the  plants,   who   do   the

landscaping,   who  provide  the  food,   who   provide   the

transportation and personal services.  So it  is  far  better

for us to move upstream, which is  higher value added and for

which  we  have  a competitive advantage and use  these  high

points to raise the general level of the tent.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a paradox in economics that, sometimes to have

greater  growth,  we  must accept a widening  of  inequality,

because  without that higher point for the tent, it  is  more

difficult  to  raise the whole skirt.  From the viewpoint  of

our  economic  strategy, we are targeting  high  value  added

industries  for  which we have a clear competitive  advantage

and rely upon these centres of growth to bring employment and

advantage to ordinary Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member): Sir,

will  the  Minister  consider  setting  up  a  crisis  credit

facility  to help the 10% through these difficult  times  and

allow them to pay back on very low interest terms?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, there are many ways that

we  can use to redistribute income to those who are less well

off.   The  most  important thing is to have welfare  without

welfarism  and to achieve redistribution without  it  somehow

disincentivising effort or self-help.  If there are  projects

which are low risk to justify the low interest rates, I think

the market will attend to them.  As far as the Government  is

concerned,  we  provide direct assistance through  affordable

HDB  mortgages, through subsidies on service and  conservancy

charges,  through MediFund, through subsidy of C class  wards

and  polyclinics,  through  education  facilities  which  are

completely  affordable  all the way  up  to  ITE  and  junior

college.  There are many ways to cause a redistribution.   We

should   choose  the  ways  which  encourage  effort,   which

increases the productive capacity and capability of those  at

the  bottom.   And we should be careful not  to  devise  ways

which lead to dependency and to moral hazard.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, there are some

groups  of people who have great difficulty in accessing  the

skills  retraining programmes, eg, working  parents  who  are

struggling to earn a living and, at the same time,  look  for

childcare arrangements.  Are there any programmes or  service

assistance that would be available for this grouping so  that

they could in fact take advantage of skills retraining?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, there are many programmes

which  are  available.  If Dr Jennifer Lee knows of  specific

cases, they can be referred to either MOE, MCDS or to a  CDC.

All  these  agencies are aware of the whole array of  schemes

which  are available and which would best meet the  needs  of

particular  families.  The fact is that if you  look  around,

yes,  there are poor people around us but are their  children

not  going  to  school?    Are they  not  being  treated  for

illnesses because of a lack of financial resources?  And  the

reason  why the outcome is not there is because these schemes

are available and they are available in different places.  If

there  are  individuals who do not know how to  access  them,

these  cases  can be referred to their MPs, CDCs  or  to  the

Ministries involved.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I wish to

supplement what my fellow NMPs said.  As a matter of fact,  I

wish  to  state  that there are sufficient unskilled  workers

available in Singapore.  There are many sectors of industries

like  servicing, manufacturing, etc, which are in urgent need

of unskilled workers.  We have this 10% ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tay, can you ask your question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan:</b> Sir, will the Government conduct a

special   recruitment  programme  in  conjunction  with   the

employers'  group  to persuade this 10% low-income  group  to

work  for  these  unskilled industries?   However,  if  these

people  are  unwilling to do unskilled work, then  would  the

Government reconsider the rigid rules which apply to  foreign

labour, so that our SMEs will be able to meet their immediate

demands and take care of their requirements?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, I thank Mr Tay for raising

this  point.   It is an important point because the  feedback

from  industries is that the labour market is tightening very

rapidly with the end of the economic recession.  We have,  on

the  one hand, a group of unemployed who cannot seem to  find

employment and, on the other hand, a great demand for workers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



including  unskilled workers.  Part of the reason is  because

some  of  those who are unemployed are deterred by having  to

work  third shifts or having to travel further to work.   And

the  fact that they are able to express these preferences  is

because  one  way or another, they are able to make  do  with

contributions from family members or from their own  savings.

If  the hardship were very acute, then even third shift  work

or even work in Tuas would be snapped up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay's other question is one which concerns us more in

Singapore.   It is the rapidly tightening labour  market  and

how  we should adjust our manpower policies in order to  feed

the  growth  that  is in our economy.  I do  not  think  that

working  the  old method is the right way to go, particularly

for  SMEs.  Because of the Internet and e-commerce, middlemen

are  being weeded out in many industry sectors.  So those who

require foreign workers to do work the old way may find  that

a difficult approach to take.  Some restructuring is required

but,  at  the same time, we recognise that in the SME  sector

there  is a need for a greater allocation of foreign  workers

and  we  review these allocations all the time, and  feedback

from  SMEs,  from  Mr  Tay Beng Chuan and  from  the  various

business  chambers and associations will be very  helpful  to

the Government Ministries involved.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I would like to ask

the  Minister  whether  we  can examine  the  extent  of  the

problems  in future, particularly the problems affecting  the

older  workers  who are unskilled and uneducated.   With  the

relocation of the labour intensive industries, is the problem

likely  to  be  aggravated?  What  concrete  steps  will  the

Ministry  be taking besides retraining to assist these  older

workers?  At the same time, I would like to find out  whether

there  is  a mismatch between the manpower that is available,

the  older workers, and the jobs that are out in the  market.

If  this  is  the  case, could we take  a  better  integrated

approach  in trying to follow through these workers  who  are

unable to be deployed for employment?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, there is a limit to what

we can do to bring down

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



the  unemployment rate without causing economic  inefficiency

to  the  system as a whole.  I believe we are  now  below  3%

again.   If not yet, then we are likely to be quite  quickly.

If  we  try  too hard to lower the natural unemployment  rate

further,  we  may end up causing unnecessary inefficiency  to

other  parts  of the economy.  The Department  of  Statistics

will  study  the problem in greater detail and if  there  are

practical solutions that we can take, we will.  But I do  not

think we should distort the entire economy just to bring that

number down.  It was a major problem in 1998, and maybe early

1999.  It is no longer a major problem now.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, with the relocation of labour intensive

industries, will the problem be likely to be aggravated?   If

that  is the case, are there any proactive steps that we  are

taking?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, Dr Vasoo raised a point

which is very valid, a point which concerns not only MTI  but

also  the other Ministries greatly, ie, given the new trends,

the  knowledge  economy and the fact that at least  for  some

years  to come salary ranges will stretch out, and those  who

are  unskilled will find it more and more difficult  to  find

good  work in Singapore, how should we best accommodate  them

without  reducing  them  to  subsidy  cases  in  the  housing

estates.   The  issue is being reviewed by all Ministries  to

see  how  we can bring work closer to them so that  they  can

spend  part  of their time looking after their grandchildren,

part  of  their time attending to their own household affairs

and, maybe when they are free, doing some part-time work.  In

the old days, we used to separate out industrial estates from

housing areas because they were polluting, they needed  space

and  heavy  equipment was involved.  But in the new  economy,

there  will  be  many industries which do  not  require  this

generous  allocation  of spaces, and  which  can  be  brought

closer   to  housing  estates  and  therefore  within  easier

commuting  distances.  We are now looking at master  planning

in  Singapore  to see how we can better bring work  into  the

housing estates,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



so that part-time and irregular time work can be more readily

available  to  those  who  would  otherwise  be  structurally

unemployed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, can I ask the

Minister  what  steps  are  being  taken  to  promote  social

consciousness  among the talents and top  earners  that  they

have  a  responsibility towards the massive majority who  may

not  have the talents or the abilities they possess but  they

were able to exercise those talents and abilities to earn top

salaries  and  incomes,  because the  majority  provides  the

social  opportunities, and part of that social  consciousness

is  to  give  back to society?  And also for employers,  when

they offer jobs to people, they should take into account  not

just  the  market factors of the lowest possible and  not  to

benchmark  them with foreign workers but also take the  human

perspective and offer them jobs which they can have a  living

wage.   Many  people may have turned down jobs because  their

salaries are so low and they do not just cover ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Thomas, are you making a speech?

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> No. I am just explaining.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can you proceed to your question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> I am just asking whether the

Government will promote a living wage as well.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, Mr Thomas has touched on a

problem  which  is  very fundamental and which  concerns  the

Government  a  great deal.  When I was in Davos  at  the  WEF

Meeting  in  January this year, they had one  session  called

"The  Age  of Disloyalty", that with globalisation  and  with

international talents becoming mobile, are we all linked only

by  money  and  nothing else?  Is there such a  thing  called

"patriotism"  or  "loyalty" left to corporations,  tribes  or

charities?  Because we are a cosmopolitan city and our  young

are all educated in English, they are internationally mobile.

While we tell

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



ourselves  that  we  should be in  the  game,  bring  foreign

talents to Singapore, we are also in danger of losing our own

talents  to  other  countries  and  even  when  they  are  in

Singapore, are they loyal to Singapore?  This is the question

which concerns us a lot because, in a crisis, whether or  not

we  have  this sense of solidarity makes a difference between

success  and failure, between life and death, between victory

and  defeat.  So national service will remain important.  Our

willingness  to look after those who are weak,  subnormal  or

crippled in our midst is very important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one reason why the Government has been very

careful   to   avoid  subsidising  charities   or   self-help

organisations    completely    without    requiring     these

organisations  to  also raise their own money.   The  widow's

mite  is  very important.  Without that fund raising  effort,

there will be no ownership of schools, hospitals or community

organisations.   Many of us complain that we  are  constantly

being  roped in for fund raising, but all the effort in  fund

raising is actually a process of social bonding.  We help  to

build  that  community centre or that church or that  mosque,

and  that  creates a sense of ownership and of rootedness  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National service requires all Singaporeans, whether

those  who  are  at  the  top  or  at  the  bottom,  to  feel

collectively that when it comes to a crisis, we must all work

together for the common survival of the state.  But  this  is

not   a  question  which  can  be  easily  answered  by   the

Government. The Government can do its part.  All of  us  have

to do our part as parents, as teachers, as community leaders,

that while we adjust to market developments, we do not forget

that in the end what holds the community together is not just

money,  but  a  sense of solidarity and  a  sense  of  common

destiny.  That we must always have in Singapore.  We can have

foreigners to help us, we can have foreign talents coming  in

to  supplement  various positions, but at the core,  we  must

have a group of people who feel completely Singaporean.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> I would like to seek a point

of clarification with the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



Minister.   Why  does the Minister see the setting  up  of  a

credit  on-line as a strategy on distribution  or  welfarism?

Because we are not giving to the people, we are lending  them

money  although on extraordinary low interest terms, does  he

not see that this is also a strategy of growth because we are

allowing  the 10% to have a sum of money upon which they  can

start a new venture?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, it is not my intention to

reject  offhand  Mdm Claire Chiang's proposal.   What  I  was

saying  is  that  there is an interest subsidy  involved  and

whether  an income subsidy should be provided through reduced

interest  rate  is something that we have  to  look  at  very

carefully  to ensure that there is no moral hazard associated

with it.  I am not saying that it should not be done.  What I

am  saying is that it is not an idea which can be implemented

without  very careful thinking of the consequences  following

downstream.   Many of the lower income families will  not  be

able to pay back their loans, in which case they may have  to

be declared bankrupts.  Do we want that to happen?  Is that a

good idea?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, the Minister earlier did not answer my

question  on  the  effect  of  social  cohesion  and   social

stability should the gini coefficient gets worse.  May I also

ask  the  Minister whether more incentives could be given  to

employers  to ameliorate their bias on hiring older  workers,

for example, giving more tax rebates to such employers?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did spend

some  time  talking about why it is important  to  provide  a

sufficient  social  safety  net at  the  bottom  to  maintain

community solidarity  and social cohesion in a society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we should subsidise employers to take on

older  workers,  again we have got to ask  ourselves  whether

this  is  the  best way of achieving our objective.   It  may

create distortion and game playing and may be quite difficult

to  police  because  some of the older  employees  should  be

employed  in  their own rights.  But since there  is  such  a

scheme  available, they too will apply for subsidies.   While

we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



should  agree on our objective that we should help those  who

are  at the bottom,  we should be very careful about the  way

in which we achieve that objective because it can create side

effects and lead to other problems.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Can the Minister tell us whether the

Skills  Redevelopment  Programme and  other  skills  training

programmes are focused enough to tackle the problems  of  the

bottom 10% unskilled and less educated workers?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> The various economic agencies

monitor  very closely the trends in the labour market,  which

companies  are retrenching, which companies are  growing  and

need  workers  and we try to achieve the best  match  between

those who are sheding workers and those industries which need

workers.  The SRP programme offers courses to create as  good

a match as we can achieve.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I am talking about the bottom

10%  of  the  workers.  Are the programmes  actually  focused

enough?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> It includes the bottom 10% who

can  be  retrained.  But as I said earlier,  it is  sometimes

not  as easy as it sounds because to go back to school to  be

retrained  requires  a  certain  discipline  and  a   certain

willingness  to  relearn.  It is not always easy.   For  some

workers, especially the younger workers, it is not a problem.

For others, it is a problem.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> The Minister has spoken of targeting

particular  assistance to those without  jobs  right  at  the

bottom.   I tend to agree with that.  May I ask the  Minister

how  targetted are we right now?  Can I assume that  each  of

the  jobless  in  the  lowest  bottom  10%  actually  has  an

individual  file  with  the Ministry  or  are  they  actually

relatively faceless people?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second and broader question is that I take the

Minister's  explanation  of  globalisation  and  our  current

policies of many-helping-hands, etc, to basically say nothing

needs to be done at present.  What

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>



is  the  trigger point of either the bottom 10% or  the  gini

coefficient that will make this Government move?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, I do not think it is wise

for  us to open a file on every Singaporean who is unemployed

in  Singapore.  If he needs help, it is for him  to  ask  for

help  and a file would be opened.  But for us to open a  file

in  advance of his asking for help will lead to all kinds  of

unnecessary problems and it is bad public policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay is wrong to say that our position is that nothing

needs  to be done.  The whole point of my answer earlier  was

that  a lot of things are already being done and our policies

are  constantly being reviewed to make sure that the problems

are attended to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan:</b> Further to my earlier question, Sir,

I  would like to ask the Minister this question.  We do  have

SMEs  that  need  unskilled workers and  unskilled  jobs  are

available.   If  this lower income group of people  does  not

like  to  take up these jobs and yet, on the other hand,  our

tight  rigid labour policies  do not allow us to employ  more

foreign unskilled workers, can the Minister advise us what we

should do?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, Mr Tay has raised a

question  for  which  there is no easy answer.   Ideally,  of

course,  we  should  just open the doors  and  bring  in  the

foreign workers and all SMEs will be happy.  But if we  bring

in  foreign workers in unlimited numbers, then the  wages  of

Singaporeans at the bottom will be very depressed.  That  may

be  good  for those who are high income earners because  then

they can get many services on the cheap.  But is it good  for

Singapore?   We  already have, out of a  population  of  four

million, one million who are non-citizens.  How many more can

we  accommodate in our midst who are not one of us?  So there

has  got to  be a limit.  And within this limit, we have  got

to  ask  ourselves how we should allocate the numbers between

those  who  work in the high-tech, financial, pharmaceutical,

petrochemical and  wafer fab sectors  and those who  work  in

coffee shops and restaurants.  MTI's policy has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



always been that where we can upgrade we must try to upgrade,

mechanise, automate, sub-contract.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the knowledge economy, more and more middlemen would

be  bypassed.  Should we slow down this process or should  we

accelerate  it?  If we do not facilitate this transformation,

the  difficulties  would  be more difficult  for  us  further

downstream.   It is better that we go with the flow.   Today,

we  can  order  groceries on the Internet  and  it  would  be

delivered  to you the following day, eggs, vegetables,  meat,

whatever.  It comes straight from the factories to your home,

bypassing  the  shop,  which  means  no  rental  cost,  lower

manpower cost.  Many of the SMEs are unable to make this jump

because they are staffed with older people and their children

are not interested to take over the parents' businesses.   As

a  result of which they are unable to restructure themselves.

Those  who  restructure themselves, operate franchises,  they

are able to make the transformation.

<div align="center"><b>AND REVIEW OF SALARY BENCHMARKS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the last years

have seen dramatic changes in our economic prospects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until 1997, the Singapore economy was growing strongly.

Asia was booming, and Singapore rode the wave of prosperity.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Asian crisis struck, and Singapore was not

spared.   We  shifted gear to weather the storm.  We  reduced

business  costs  by  cutting Government  charges  and  taxes,

reducing  CPF  contributions, and exercising wage  restraint.

This  helped  companies  to remain viable,  saved  jobs,  and

prevented our economy from crashing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the crisis has passed, and the Singapore economy is

growing   strongly  again.   We  are  benefiting   from   the

sacrifices and cohesion of Singaporeans, who worked  together

to  cut  costs,  accept  the  CPF  reduction,  and  keep  our

industries  competitive.  We made healthy growth of  5.4%  in

1999.  This year, MTI has announced 9.1% growth for the first

quarter, and has raised the growth forecast for the  year  to

5.5% to 7.5%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quick recovery has caused the labour market to

tighten.   Retrenchments dropped by almost half, from  29,100

in  1998 to 14,600 in 1999.  Seasonally adjusted unemployment

fell  from a high of 4.3% in December 1998 to 3.4%  in  March

this  year.   Total employment rose by 39,900 in 1999,  after

declining by 23,400 in 1998.  Private sector wages are  going

up, in some cases sharply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global backdrop to these developments in Singapore

and  in the region is the ferment of the New Economy and  the

process  of  globalisation.   These  have  proceeded   apace,

regardless  of  the problems in Asia.  The IT revolution  has

dramatically changed the global economic landscape.   It  has

unleashed  tremendous  dynamism, especially  in  the  US,  by

raising productivity, opening up entirely new businesses, and

revolutionising   existing   ways   of   doing    businesses.

Underlying   the  dot-com  fever,  a  real  and  far-reaching

transformation is taking place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spectacular success of companies like Microsoft and

CISCO Systems, based on sheer brainpower rather than tangible

assets,  has attracted enterprising and ambitious  people  to

start new ventures in the knowledge sector.  The new economy

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>



is a powerful magnet to draw talent, especially young talent,

from  the  old  economy.  These young people  have  a  strong

desire  to be part of the IT revolution, to change the world,

and of course to make it big.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, investment banks and law firms have

traditionally been the most sought after employers,  offering

the  best  paid  jobs.   Now,  investment  banks  are  facing

difficulties  hiring graduates from business  schools,  which

are  their traditional source of recruits.  And law firms are

having  to increase their pay of junior lawyers, even at  the

expense  of  the earnings of senior partners, to  stop  their

junior lawyers from leaving and joining dot-coms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalisation has created a single world market for

talent.   Today,  talent is highly mobile,  in  great  demand

everywhere, and commands a world price.  Countries  all  over

the  world have opened their doors to talent.  Silicon Valley

is  full  of  Asians,  including  a  few  Singaporeans.   The

alternative to a job in one country is not another job in the

same country, but a job nearly anywhere in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, too, we are feeling the impact of these

trends.   More Singaporeans in the private sector are  taking

up  opportunities abroad, and more civil servants are leaving

the  Government  to  join  the private  sector.   Singaporean

students  in  the  US  are  being  head-hunted  before   they

graduate.   The head-hunters say, "Come, join me.   Here's  a

sign-on  bonus and a BMW, before you start work."  The  Legal

Service  is losing lawyers to local law firms as well  as  to

foreign  ones.  And British recruiters have come to Singapore

to hire our nurses to work in England.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans sense the opportunity, and the excitement

of  the IT revolution.  Enterprising and ambitious people are

taking  the  plunge,  and starting new companies.   Some  are

senior  executives who have left the security of their  well-paying jobs to venture into the New Economy.  But many others

are young Singaporeans, hoping to become not just

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



the  next  Sim Wong Hoo, but the next Bill Gates.  This  year

alone,  eight Administrative Officers have already  resigned,

of  whom  three left to join start-ups.  And these  are  good

officers.  But they are convinced that they are witnessing  a

revolution.  They want to be part of this revolution, so that

when they look back later, perhaps in their old age, they can

say, "Yes, we tried".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These developments pose new challenges to Singapore, and

particularly to the public sector.  Recruiting and  retaining

talent is vital to the civil service, as it is to any private

sector  company.   But  with  the economic  pick-up  and  the

powerful  forces  of  globalisation and  the  IT  revolution,

attracting  and retaining talent is quickly becoming  a  real

problem across the whole civil service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has to respond promptly, to adjust and

adapt  to  the  new labour market and operating  environment.

This  involves  changing  not just   salaries  and  terms  of

service,  but  also  the way we incentivise  and  reward  our

officers,  and  even  more  fundamentally,  our  approach  to

managing the flow of talent in the public sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector has thrived in the past by reshaping

itself to cope with a changing environment.  It must continue

to  re-invent itself, faster than before, to stay  up-to-date

and  relevant.   The civil service needs to offer  attractive

and  challenging  prospects, to induce young Singaporeans  to

take up a public sector career.  We have kept salaries in the

public  sector competitive, and we will continue  to  do  so.

However, we need to approximate not just private sector  pay,

but   also   relevant  private  sector  personnel  management

practices.   This  is particularly so for the  Administrative

Service, which is our main avenue for managing and developing

leadership in the public sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I will brief the House on the following changes:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A new approach to managing public sector leadership

talent;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Civil service salary revisions and this year's NWC

award for civil servants;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Review of salary benchmarks for the Administrative

Service, Political and Statutory Appointment holders; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Restructuring salaries for the Administrative

Service, Political and Statutory Appointment holders.

<br><br><i>Managing Public Sector Leadership Talent</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, first, cover managing public sector leadership

talent.  The Administrative Service is the premier service in

the  public sector.  Administrative Officers occupy key posts

in  the  ministries,  helping to formulate  policies  and  to

supervise  the  running of ministries and  departments.   The

most  senior and critical civil service appointments  in  the

ministries  are  mostly occupied by Administrative  Officers.

These  appointments include the Permanent Secretaries, Deputy

Secretaries, CEOs of major statutory boards and the heads  of

key  departments, in other words, the top ministries and some

of  the  posts one level below the top.  We term them "Public

Service Leadership (PSL)" jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifying and developing officers for these PSL jobs

is  vital.  Each year, the Government has sought to garner  a

fair  share  of top talent from the new cohort  to  join  the

Administrative  Service.   We  hope  that  from  among  them,

sufficient  numbers will stay in service and eventually  make

the grade to fill the PSL positions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditionally, officers appointed to PSL positions

expected  to  stay on in these positions until they  retired.

However,  this  is  no  longer viable  for  several  reasons.

Firstly, young officers nowadays do not think in terms  of  a

lifetime  career  in  the civil service, gradually  advancing

through the ranks till they reach their top posts a few years

before retiring to draw pension.  They see a job in the civil

service as just one of several steps toward fulfilling  their

lifetime   career  aspirations.   They  are   energetic   and

ambitious.  They want a faster sense of progression, and  the

chance    to    take   on   larger   and   more   challenging

responsibilities earlier in life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we need to advance officers to Public Service

Leadership jobs early,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



preferably  by  their early 40s, to keep  leadership  in  the

public  sector  young and vigorous.  In the  private  sector,

professionals and executives can expect to reach the peak  of

their  careers by their 40s or early 50s.  So a  model  where

you  mark time, or as they say hentak kaki, until you are 55,

then  you reach your top job, you serve for a few years,  you

go into retirement, play golf, is not one which will work for

us or which will attract the young people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, not all officers appointed to PSL posts in

their early 40s can realistically stay on in these posts  for

20-odd years until retirement.  We need adequate turnover  in

these  posts.   This  will  prevent  the  organisation   from

becoming  too settled in its ways, and it will also encourage

young and capable officers to stay on in the service, in  the

realistic hope of reaching a PSL post.  Because otherwise the

young  officer  looks  up  and  says,  "Here's  my  Permanent

Secretary who was promoted early.  He is now 40.  He has  got

22  years  left, by which time the retirement  age  may  have

reached 67.  Why should I hang around?"  And he will  be  off

looking for more exciting challenges elsewhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we need to balance this need for turnover and renewal

in  the civil service, with adequate career security for  the

officers.   We want to build a corps of highly motivated  and

dedicated  officers who take a long view of the issues  which

they handle.  In other words, if you mishandle something  and

create  a problem, you will still be around to deal with  the

problem  when it comes back to haunt you.  It is  not  enough

for officers to know that they can make it to the top if they

have  what  it  takes and they give their  best.   They  need

predictability in their service career paths, both before and

after  reaching a PSL post.  Officers must feel assured  that

their careers are being managed systematically, in a fair and

transparent framework.  We do not want civil servants  to  be

less than totally dedicated to their tasks, because they  are

quietly preoccupied making provisions for themselves just  in

case their careers take an untoward turn.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing in mind both imperatives, the Government has

decided to introduce a "flow-through" mechanism of fixed-term

appointments for Public Service Leadership jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this framework, the retirement age for

Administrative Officers  will remain at 62, like other  jobs.

Officers with the potential to be promoted to PSL posts  will

remain  in  the  Administrative Service, while  those  judged

unlikely to do so will be re-deployed to other parts  of  the

civil service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrative Officers who make it to PSL posts will be

appointed  for fixed terms.  An officer appointed  to  a  PSL

post  at  the Deputy Secretary level will be given a  10-year

term,  during  which  he  may hold  two  or  three  DS  level

appointments.  If he is subsequently appointed to a PSL  post

at the Permanent Secretary level, that will also be for a 10-year  term,  starting  at  that point  when  he  reaches  the

Permanent Secretary level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a general rule, officers will relinquish their PSL

appointments  on  completing their 10-year terms.   Some  may

have  their  PSL  terms  extended,  but  this  will  be   the

exception.   We  seek to maintain a constant flow-through  of

talent   and   a  constant  rejuvenation  of  public   sector

leadership.   Officers who relinquish their PSL  appointments

but  wish  to stay on in the public service will  be  offered

suitable  non-PSL  jobs, subject to availability.   They  can

then serve until the age of 62.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers who do not wish to take up a non-PSL job will

be  freely  granted early retirement and  can  then  start  a

second career somewhere else.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remuneration at the PSL level will take into account the

significantly  heavier responsibilities  of  PSL  jobs.   PSL

officers  will  generally receive larger performance  bonuses

than other Administrative Officers.  They will also receive a

special  PSL  Allowance, in addition to other  components  of

their salaries, so long as they are still occupying their PSL

posts and have not relinguished these posts.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



The  PSL Allowance will initially be one month per year,  and

will be built up later to two months per year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to introducing fixed-term appointments for

PSL  jobs,  the  Government will also  broaden  training  and

development opportunities for Administrative Officers.   This

will  help  to develop talent for the service, and  make  the

service  a  more  attractive  career.   For  example,   every

Administrative  Officer  with the potential  to  hold  a  PSL

appointment  will be sponsored for one postgraduate  training

programme while in service, in other words, a Master's degree

of  some  kind.   Some  Permanent Secretaries  will  also  be

granted    sabbatical    leave,   to   recharge    themselves

intellectually, and update themselves on new developments  in

their policy fields.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transition to fixed-term appointments for PSL posts

must  be  managed  judiciously  and  sensitively,  to  ensure

stability  and  continuity  in  the  public  service.   These

changes   will  be  implemented  together  with  the   salary

revisions  for  the Administrative Service  that  I  will  be

announcing   later.   We  will  make  suitable   transitional

arrangements  for  the current incumbents of  PSL  jobs,  and

address any concerns they may have over the new framework.

<br><br><i>Civil Service Salary Revisions and NWC Award</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we focus on the Public Service Leadership

positions,  we  must  not neglect the  main  body  of  public

officers, at all levels and in many different services.   For

the  whole system to work well, every public officer  has  to

contribute  his or her best.  Every one of them needs  to  be

properly managed, paid, and incentivised, and not just a  few

top officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has conducted a full review of civil

service  salaries.  Salaries of most schemes of service  have

not  been  revised  for  at least two years  because  of  the

economic   downturn.   However,  with  the  strong   economic

recovery, private sector's earnings have risen substantially.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPF data indicate that except for secondary school

leavers,  the  starting annual salaries of the civil  service

are   generally   lagging  significantly  behind   the   75th

percentile  salaries  in  the private  sector.   The  gap  is

greatest  for graduates with pass degrees, where  the  annual

private  sector starting salary is about 36% higher than  the

civil  service; and those with technical diplomas, where  the

private sector is about 51% higher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resignation rates have also gone up across the entire

civil service.  For example, this year, 284 officers from the

Senior  Officer Service (which means 12% of the  total  staff

strength)  resigned   in the first five months  of  the  year

compared  to  267  for the whole of last  year.   So  if  you

extrapolate  that, by the end of the year, 1/4 will  be  gone

and after two years, you will have no army left.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some outflow of staff is normal in a market

economy,   especially  during  a  strong  economic  recovery,

excessive  outflow  will  undermine  the  civil  service  and

jeopardise public services.  The civil service must  be  able

to  attract  and  retain  sufficient talent  to  continue  to

function stably and effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has already announced salary revisions

for  several  schemes  of  service, which  face  particularly

critical  problems  of  outflow and staff  shortages.   These

include   senior   officers  from  the   Commercial   Affairs

Department, the Legal Service, the Nursing Service,  and  the

Medical  Service.   Now we have decided  to  make  a  general

salary revision for all civil servants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are mindful that civil service salaries should follow

private sector salary trends, and not lead them.  We  do  not

want excessive civil service pay adjustments to increase wage

pressures  on private sector firms.  But it is also  critical

for  the  civil  service pay to keep pace  with  the  private

sector, and not to lag too far behind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This civil service salary revision coincides with this

year's  National Wages Council (NWC) award.   The  Government

has accepted the NWC's recommendation that "workers should be

rewarded with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



wage  increase in line with economic recovery".   Instead  of

making  a salary revision and a separate NWC adjustment,  the

Government  will  consolidate the two into  a  single  salary

revision exercise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consolidated salary adjustments will include a

further  restoration of the Annual Variable Component  (AVC),

increased  performance bonuses, higher monthly salaries,  and

more portable medical benefits.

<br><br><i>Annual Variable Component</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the annual variable component. The civil service

has been paying an AVC of 2 months every year since 1991.  We

had  built  it up gradually after the last economic recession

in  1985.  In 1998, the AVC was reduced to 3/4 month  because

of the economic crisis.  Last year (1999) we paid an AVC of 1

month,  (we  restored 1/4 month) plus another  1/4  month  of

Special  Bonus  at  the end of the year, when  we  found  the

economy recovering more strongly than we had expected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, because of the positive economic outlook, the

Government  has  decided  to  increase  the  Annual  Variable

Component  by 3/4 month.  We will pay 1 3/4 month of  AVC  in

total.   3/4  month  will be paid in July,  and  1  month  in

December.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will bring us close to restoring AVC to 2 months,

where it was prior to the crisis.

<br><br><i>Performance Bonus</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, performance bonus. Currently, only civil servants

in  the more senior grades are paid performance bonuses.  The

salaries for the rest of the officers do not depend on  their

performance.  But we must strengthen the link between pay and

individual  performance, by building up a performance-related

component  in the total wage package of every civil  servant.

This salary revision provides a good opportunity for us to do

so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will pay a performance bonus to all civil

servants who currently do not receive any performance  bonus.

The base rate will be 1/2 month per year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



This  means  that  an average officer who  has  put  in  good

performance  will receive a performance bonus of  1/2  month,

while  officers who perform better than average will  receive

more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the civil servants who already receive a performance

bonus,  we  will increase the base rate for their performance

bonus by 1/2 month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will cover all civil servants - Divisions III, IV,

the  road  sweepers,  the cleaners, the  clerks,  the  senior

officers.  Everybody will have one component of his pay which

will  depend  on his performance.  You perform, you  will  be

rewarded;  you do not perform, this is the first signal.   If

you  continue not to perform, further strong signals will  be

on the way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 1/2 month performance bonus is only the first step,

because  1/2  month is not quite large enough.  As  and  when

additional  salary adjustments are justified  in  future,  we

intend to further build up the performance bonus component to

a base rate of at least 1 month for all civil servants.

<br><br><i>Monthly Salary Increase</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the performance bonus, we will increase

monthly salaries for most schemes of service by an average of

5.4%.  In keeping with the spirit of NWC recommendations, the

5.4%  increase in monthly salaries will be in the form  of  a

$50  lump sum plus a 3.8% increase.  This formula of a  fixed

quantum plus a percentage of pay will benefit the more junior

and lower income officers.  The actual percentage increase in

monthly  salaries will range from 11% for the lower  division

officers to 4% for senior Superscale officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average total salary increase for a civil servant

from this revision is about 13%.  I say "average" because  it

will depend on your grade, your service, your performance and

whether  additional adjustments are made  for  your  service.

This  includes  the  3/4 month AVC increase,  the  1/2  month

increase  in  performance bonus, and  the  5.4%  increase  in

monthly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



salaries.  This revision will significantly narrow the salary

gap between the civil service and the private sector, but  it

will not completely close it.

<br><br><i>Specific Services</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me mention a few specific services. The SAF

has traditionally paid a premium over civil service salaries,

given  the  strategic need to attract a fair share of  talent

into  the SAF in order to maintain a credible defence  force.

To  maintain  the  premium,  MINDEF  will  also  be  revising

salaries of SAF personnel upward by an average of 13%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several services still face particularly serious

staffing problems, or have salaries which are further out  of

line  from  the  private sector.  They  will  receive  higher

salary revisions than the general civil service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Intelligence Service and Foreign Service will

receive salary revisions of between 11-31%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Management and Technical Support Services, which

recruit  polytechnic diploma holders, are  also  experiencing

higher  attrition rates.  The most serious gaps  are  in  the

lower  grades.  The salaries of the relevant grades for these

two services will be increased by about 20%.

<br><br><i>Further Adjustments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect some other services to require further

adjustments  beyond this salary revision.   In  this  dynamic

environment,  waiting  for the next annual  cycle  of  salary

reviews  will be too slow.  The Public Service Division  will

work   with  other  Ministries  to  review  their  respective

staffing situations within the next three to six months,  and

make adjustments where justified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will just mention two. One is the Ministry of Home

Affairs  which  is reviewing the scheme of  service  for  its

uniformed   personnel,  to  ensure  that  the  Home   Affairs

Uniformed Services remain an attractive career choice and the

services recruit their fair share of quality

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



staff  to  ensure the safety and security of Singapore.   MHA

has  engaged  Towers Perrin to conduct the review,  which  is

proceeding well on track.  The consultants will present their

overall recommendations at the end of August, covering mainly

career   structures,   benefits,  continuous   learning   and

development,  and  work environment  issues.   And  the  Home

Affairs  Uniformed  Services Council will then  consider  the

recommendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, the Education Service. In this revision, the

Education Service will receive the average increase  of  13%.

However,  teachers play an important role  in  educating  our

next  generation  of  Singaporeans  for  the  knowledge-based

economy.   We  must continue to attract and retain  good  and

committed teachers.  The Ministry of Education will undertake

a further review of the pay structure of teachers to shape it

to  better  meet  both  MOE's organisational  needs  and  the

teachers' personal aspirations.

<br><br><i>Portable Medical Benefits</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to its core wage guidelines, the NWC

recognised  that  with an ageing population,  rising  medical

costs  and increasing job mobility, there is a need to refine

existing  medical benefit schemes to make them more portable.

It  noted  that  the  Ministry  of  Manpower  had  set  up  a

Tripartite  Committee on Portable Medical Benefits  to  study

the issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government agrees with the NWC that there is an

urgent  need  to  address the issue of medical  benefits  for

workers.   During the Budget debate this year,  Mr  Yeo  Guat

Kwang  and Mr Thomas Thomas had also suggested that the civil

service  review its medical benefits schemes.   Mr  Yeo  Guat

Kwang  specifically suggested that "unused" portions  of  the

annual $350 cap on outpatient subsidy for civil servants  who

are on the Medisave and Subsidised Outpatient Treatment (MSO)

Scheme  be  credited into the Medisave account  of  officers.

These are officers who have 1% extra of Medisave paid to them

to  pay for their hospital expenses and who have a $350 limit

which  they  can claim if they have outpatient expenses,  and

many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



of  them do not claim the full amount.  The question is: what

happens  to the balance at the end of the year?  And  Mr  Yeo

suggested  that  the balance, instead of going  back  to  the

Government,  should  be  paid into their  Medisave  accounts.

This  would  make medical benefits in the civil service  more

portable  and encourage younger officers to stay healthy.   I

have replied that this suggestion had merit, and promised  to

review the matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has decided to accept Mr Yeo Guat Kwang's

proposal.  Starting this year, if an officer does not use  up

the  full  amount of his annual outpatient cap of  $350,  the

balance will be credited into his Medisave account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average unused outpatient subsidy per MSO officer in

1999 was $276.  As there are about 31,300 officers on the MSO

Scheme  (this includes a few Members of Parliament), it  will

cost the Government about $8.6 million to transfer the unused

balance  into  the Medisave accounts of the  officers.   This

amount  will  increase over the years as the  MSO  population

increases.

<br><br><i>Review of Salary Benchmarks</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn now to the review of salary benchmarks and

restructuring  of  salaries for the  Administrative  Service,

Political and Statutory Appointment holders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1994 White Paper on Competitive Salaries for

Competent  and  Honest  Government  established  two  private

sector salary benchmarks to peg Ministers' and Administrative

Officers'  salaries.   The  benchmarks  were  based  on   the

salaries  of  top  earners from a basket  of  6  professions,

chosen as far as possible to be similar to the nature of work

performed  by  Ministers and senior civil  servants.   The  6

professions  were: bankers, accountants, engineers,  lawyers,

MNCs, and local manufacturers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, the White Paper recommended pegging the

salary  for  a  Superscale G Administrative  Officer  to  the

principal  earned income of the 15th person aged 32 belonging

to the same 6 professions (15P32). The salary for a Staff

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



Grade  I  Minister  was  pegged  at  two-thirds  the  average

principal earned income of the top four individuals from each

of  the  6  professions regardless of age  (2/3  AVE24).  The

formulas would be reviewed after 5 years, ie, in year 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key advantage of this approach was that the

benchmarks  would be computed annually, based on  IRAS  data,

and  the  salaries  of Ministers and Administrative  Officers

would  automatically follow the benchmarks up or down, albeit

after  a  lag. This has taken place. In 1996, both benchmarks

went  up,  and Government salaries followed.  In  1997,  both

benchmarks went down, and Superscale G salaries were  cut  by

2%  and Staff  Grade I salaries were cut by 7%. In 1998,  the

Superscale  G benchmark decreased marginally, but  the  Staff

Grade I benchmark increased.  In view of the economic crisis,

Superscale G salaries followed the benchmark down, but  Staff

Grade I salaries were frozen even though their benchmark went

up.  Government salaries were again frozen in  1999,  despite

increases in both benchmarks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while Government salaries have been frozen

since  1998,  top  private  sector  earnings  have  increased

substantially, despite the economic crisis.   The  2/3  AVE24

benchmark increased by 13% in 1998, 29% in 1999, and 23% this

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The individuals in the benchmark were not salaried

workers,   whose  employers  had  failed  to  exercise   wage

restraint.  They are lawyers, accountants and engineers,  who

are professionals earning fees that depend on their volume of

business.  They  are  bankers, whose bonuses  depend  on  the

profits of their banks. They are CEOs of manufacturing firms,

multinational  or local, many of whom receive stock  options.

Why  did  their earnings go up? The immediate explanation  is

that   their   businesses  did  well.  The  more  fundamental

explanation  can  only  be globalisation  and  the  knowledge

economy.   In  other words, while the Singapore economy  went

down, not the whole of it went down, some parts continued to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>



thrive  and prosper.  They were linked not to our region  but

to  America,  Europe and to the rest of the world.  And  some

persons, the best lawyers, the best bankers, the best CEOs of

multinationals  were  in  demand.  They  could  command  that

higher  price  and they did well, and their  firms  also  did

well.

<br><br><i>Benchmark Formulas</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the latest figures for the existing benchmarks,

the  Superscale G annual salary should be $363,000, 50%  more

than  the  current $242,000. The Staff Grade I annual  salary

should  be  $1.64  million, about 90% more than  the  current

$861,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of simply accepting these figures, and

increasing  salaries  to  match  them,  the  Government   has

thoroughly  reviewed  the  salary benchmark  methodology  and

framework.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have found that the benchmark of 15P32 for Superscale

G is sound. It has been effective in attracting and retaining

good  officers in the Administrative Service for the  past  5

years.  We will retain the benchmark as it is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the 2/3 AVE24 benchmark, the basic

approach  of comparing the salaries of Ministers  and  senior

civil  servants  with  a  basket of  top  earners  in  the  6

professions  is sound. The 6 professions remain relevant  and

appropriate,  and the discount factor of 2/3  is  reasonable.

Empirically, the benchmark has been reliable, moving in  line

with wider trends of earnings of top professionals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the robustness of the 2/3 AVE24 benchmark can

be  improved in several respects.  Firstly, the base  of  the

benchmark  is narrow. Only the 4 highest earners  are  chosen

from  each  profession. These 4 may not be representative  of

top  members  of  the profession, but may  just  be  the  few

individuals  who  happened to have had an exceptionally  good

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore propose to broaden the base of the

benchmark from the top 4 earners in 6 professions to the  top

8

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



earners  in  6  professions.  We  will  thus  be  considering

principal  earned incomes of 48 individuals  instead  of  24.

This  will make the benchmark more representative of the  top

professionals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the benchmark uses the arithmetic average of

the  24  incomes.  In other words, we get the 24 figures,  we

add  them together, we divide by 24 and use that average. The

average  is  satisfactory  if the 24  incomes  are  clustered

fairly close together. But if there are a few extremely  high

incomes in the group, this will affect the average, and  will

make the average less representative of the group as a whole.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, instead of using the arithmetic average, we

will  take  the  median income of the  group,  ie,  the  24th

highest  income among the group of 48. We have 48 people.  We

rank  them from the highest to bottom and we choose the  24th

person,  who  is  in  the middle, and  we  use  that  as  the

representative.  This fixed rank approach will not be  skewed

by  the presence of a few very high income earners, and  will

yield  a  more  stable benchmark.  Because I am choosing  the

income of person number 24, so even if person number 1  earns

$10  million  instead of $2 million, it does not affect  that

figure of the middle person unless the whole group moves,  in

which  case it is fair for the median and our benchmark  also

to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the benchmark treats stock option gains just

like any other form of income, for example salary, bonus,  or

partnership share. But stock options are volatile. Executives

may  exercise in a single year stock options which they  have

accumulated over several years, especially in a bull  market.

To  accept the full amount of stock option gains without  any

discount  is  unfair and will skew the benchmark upwards.  In

the  past, gains from stock options formed only a small  part

of  the  top earnings, but they may become more important  in

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock option gains form part of income, and are taxed as

such.  We therefore cannot ignore them in estimating  private

sector incomes. However, to allow for the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



uncertainty  and  volatility, we will discount  by  half  any

stock  option gains before computing their median income.  In

effect, we are assuming that the stock options that are being

exercised  have been accumulated over 2 years.   So  whatever

the stock option gain is, we divide by 2.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if a person earns $1 million in salaries

and bonuses and another $1 million in stock option gains, his

total  income  for the year will be $2 million. However,  for

purposes of the benchmark, we will discount the stock  option

gains  by  half,  ($1 million from salaries and  bonus,  $1/2

million  from  the stock option gains) and we  will  use  the

figure of $1.5 million in our calculations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of these changes, the Ministers' benchmark

will  be  renamed 2/3 M48, instead of 2/3 AVE24.  The  latest

value  of  2/3 M48 is $1.21 million. $1.21 million  per  year

ranks 206th among private sector earners. In comparison, when

we  first  set  the  2/3  AVE24  benchmark,  the  figure  was

$811,000,  which  ranked 101st among private sector  earners.

You  can  see from the old benchmark to the revised  one,  we

have maintained roughly the same relativity.  In fact, it has

come down from 101st to 206th.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides refining the 2/3 AVE24 formula, another

significant  improvement to the present scheme is  to  reduce

the  18-month  time-lag  in applying the  benchmark.  Private

sector  earnings in Year X are reported to IRAS in Year  X+1,

and  the benchmark is calculated and applied only in July  of

Year  X+2,  which  is 18 months later. By then,  the  private

sector  earnings  will have moved, and  the  benchmarks  will

already  be  somewhat out of date, especially if the  economy

has  changed  direction, which can happen, as we  have  seen,

quite suddenly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make the salary comparisons more timely, we will

reduce  the lag in the process from 18 to 12 months.  Instead

of  waiting for the full IRAS data at the end of Year X+1, to

be  applied  only from July of Year X+2, we will compute  and

apply the updated benchmark in January of Year X+2, based  on

partial IRAS returns.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Restructuring  Salaries  for the Administrative  Service and Political Appointment Holders</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to reviewing the benchmarks, the Government

has  made  fundamental  revisions to  our  salary  and  grade

structures.  This  will bring them closer to  private  sector

practices, and give the Government more flexibility to reward

deserving officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will change our structure from salary points to

salary  ranges.  We  will  also increase  the  proportion  of

variable pay in the annual salary, by introducing a new "GDP-related bonus", and by building up the performance bonus.

<br><br><i>Salary Ranges</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me explain the salary ranges. The Government

has  operated  on  a system of fixed salary  points  for  its

senior  officers. Each Superscale or Staff Grade  corresponds

to  a  single  salary  point.  The  political  and  statutory

appointment  holders are also tied into the same  fixed-point

system.  In  other  words, this is your rank,  this  is  your

salary.  There is a one for one correspondence.  If  you  are

promoted, your salary goes up.  If you are not promoted, your

salary  remains fixed.  In this system, promotions and salary

revisions coincide: we cannot give an officer a pay  increase

without also promoting him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This system is rigid. No other organisation in Singapore

uses  such  a system.  Private firms and even some  statutory

boards   use  salary  ranges,  where  each  rank   or   grade

corresponds to a range of salaries. Managers can then  adjust

an officer's salary without also having to promote him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will introduce a system of salary ranges

to   replace   the  present  system  of  salary  points   for

Administrative  Officers and political  appointment  holders.

The  existing 14 Superscale and Staff Grades will  be  banded

and consolidated

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



into 9 salary ranges. The existing 4 Timescale grades will be

converted to 4 salary ranges. I have an Annex explaining this

and  the  Clerk  will now distribute Handout 1.   [Copies  of

Handout 1 (Cols. 489-92) distributed to Hon. Members].



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000629/20000629-HA-0720489.htm">Handout 1 - Table 1: Salary System Based on Salary Ranges</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at Annex 1 in the Handout, you will see on

the  left  side  the  old  system of salary  points  for  the

Superscale and Staff Grades, and they are replaced by  ranges

which  we have renamed and renumbered.  Most of the political

appointments  will also move on to the new system  of  salary

ranges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This salary range system will give us more flexibility

in  personnel management.  We can reward officers with  merit

increments within their salary range each year, depending  on

their  assessed  potential and demonstrated performance.   We

will  no  longer  need to wait several years  to  promote  an

officer, in order to increase his salary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staff Grade I will now correspond to salary range MR4.

"M" stands for Ministers' range.  'S' further down stands for

Superscale range and the Timescales are just 'R' ranges.   So

Staff  Grade 1 will now correspond to salary range MR4.   The

2/3  M48  benchmark will be the "Ministers'  Benchmark",  and

will  determine the lower end of the MR4 range, which is  the

entry grade for Ministers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political, statutory and judicial appointment

holders  will  be merged into this framework.  Ministers  are

currently on three salary points (Staff Grade I, Staff  Grade

II  +  12%, and Staff Grade IV).  They will be moved to three

corresponding  ranges  of MR4, MR3  and  MR2.   Deputy  Prime

Ministers will be moved to the MR1 range.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President, Prime Minister, Senior Minister, Chief

Justice, Speaker, Chairman PSC, Attorney General and  Auditor

General  will  continue to be at fixed salary points.   Their

salaries  will  retain  the  same ratios  to  the  Ministers'

Benchmark as in the existing salary structure.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Larger Variable Component</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we will increase the variable component of

annual  salaries.  This presently consists of the 13th  month

NPAA, the AVC, and the performance bonus, which together make

up about 30% of the total annual pay of senior officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will increase this variable component to

approximately  40%  for  senior  officers,  in  other  words,

Superscale Range 9 and above.  This way, a large part of  the

salary increase will be in variable pay, which will depend on

the  performance of the officer and the state of the economy,

instead  of  in  fixed  pay which the  officer  will  receive

regardless of how he performs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will increase this variable pay by creating a new

"GDP-related bonus", and by building up the performance bonus

further.   We  will  also introduce  a  bonus  pool  so  that

performance  bonuses are paid out over  several  years.   The

details  are at Annex 2 (Cols. 491-2) of  Handout 1  which  I

have just given you.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000629/20000629-HA-0720491.htm">Annex 2 - GDP-related Bonus</a><br>



<br><br><i>Implementation and Phasing in of New Benchmarks</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the gap between the revised benchmarks and the

present  salary  levels is large, this  is  because  we  have

lagged behind the private sector, which moved ahead while  we

froze  public sector salaries.  This is an exercise to  catch

up, not to race ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service salary revisions will benefit 70,000

civil  servants.   While  the 13%  revision  will  make  most

salaries  competitive,  some schemes  of  service  will  need

further   revisions   and  special  arrangements.    We   are

proceeding  with these, but in the interim we will  not  hold

back the more general revisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Administrative Service, the more pressing

changes  are  the ones that affect the younger officers.   We

must move urgently to retain the bright young officers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



who  are  the  most mobile, and the most likely  to  consider

leaving   for  the  private  sector.   The  Government   will

therefore  move Superscale G salaries (now SR9  salaries)  to

the  full 15P32 benchmark; in other words,  $363,000 from 1st

July.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the more senior officers and the Ministers, the

problem  is  less pressing.  Also the Government  is  mindful

that  while  the  economy  is recovering  strongly,  the  CPF

restoration is still being phased in.  We should not send the

wrong  signal that we can now abandon all restraint  in  wage

settlements.   However, we have to adjust salaries  to  reach

the  benchmarks  over  time, if  the  benchmarks  are  to  be

meaningful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore instead of implementing the full revised

benchmark of 2/3 M48 immediately, we will phase it in over  3

years,  in 4 steps.  In the first step, we will move salaries

to  80%  of  the Ministers' benchmark.  This means an  annual

salary  increase of 12% for a Staff Grade I (MR4) officer  or

Minister,  from $861,000 to $968,000.  At $968,000,  he  will

rank  367th among private sector earners.  Nearly all of this

increase  of 12% is in the bonuses.  The monthly salary  will

hardly  change  (it will increase by only 0.3%).   The  Clerk

will  now distribute Handout 2.  [Copies of Handout 2  (Cols.

493-4) distributed to hon. Members.]



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000629/20000629-HA-0720493.htm">Handout 2 - Table 2: Pay Comparison Before and After Salary Revision</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handout 2 shows the pay comparison before and after the

salary  revision  for the Prime Minister, Ministers at  Staff

Grade II, Ministers at Staff Grade I, Superscale B which is a

significant  grade for Permanent Secretaries,  Superscale  G,

which  is the lower benchmark and Member of Parliament.   The

left hand side shows you the current monthly pay, the current

annual  pay  and  the current ranking against private  sector

earners.   The right hand side shows you the revised  monthly

pay,  annual  pay and ranking and also the corresponding  new

names  for  the grades.  So you can see Members of Parliament

at present receiving an allowance of $9,100 per month will in

the revised scheme receive an allowance of $11,900 per month.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salaries for grades between Superscale G and Staff Grade

I will be adjusted by percentages in between the 50% increase

for Superscale G and the 12% increase for Staff Grade I.  For

grades  above  Staff Grade I (MR4), including  the  statutory

appointment  holders  and the higher  grades  for  Ministers,

salaries  will be increased by 12%, proportional to  the  new

Staff Grade I (MR4) salary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this revision, the Prime Minister's salary will be

$1.94  million,  which  will rank 63rd among  private  sector

earners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will subsequently reduce the discount on

the  2/3 M48 benchmark to 10% in July 2001 and to 5% in  July

2002, and will fully achieve the benchmark in July 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the salary revisions for the Civil Service,

Administrative  Service  and  political  appointees  will  be

implemented  with effect from 1st July 2000.   They  will  be

effected  via payroll in August 2000, with back  payment  for

the  month  of July.  So anybody who receives a pay  slip  in

July  without new numbers, please stay calm.  It  is  on  the

way.

<br><br><i>Costing</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary revisions for the entire civil service

(excluding  statutory and judicial appointees) will  increase

the Government's wage bill by about $400 million, or 13%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wage bill for political appointment holders will

increase from $28 million to $34 million, or about 20%.  This

is  higher  than the 12% increase for the Ministers,  because

the  political appointments below the Ministers, for example,

Ministers  of State and Parliamentary Secretaries, will  have

larger  increases, because they correspond to the  Superscale

grades.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while the details of this salary

revision  and  review  of  benchmarks  are  complicated,  the

principles are simple and well-established.  Our policy is to

pay people according to their market value

and  contribution,  in  the  case  of  political  appointment

holders,  with  a  discount.   Paying  officers  properly  is

essential to recruiting the quality of talent that we need to

build a first-class public service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a new departure. The issue of public sector

pay  and,  particularly Ministers' pay, has  been  repeatedly

debated  in  this  House  over  the  years.   In  1994,   the

Government tabled the White Paper on Competitive Salaries for

Honest  and  Competent  Government.   After  a  full  debate,

Parliament endorsed the White Paper "as the basis for setting

salaries  of Ministers and senior public officers".   Today's

Ministerial  Statement  is  entirely  consistent  with   that

policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proof of this policy is in its results. Foreign

investors  and international ratings agencies like PERC,  WEF

and  IMD  regularly rate Singapore's competitiveness  highly,

and  an  important  element of these ratings  is  their  high

assessments  of the quality of the Government  and  political

leadership.    Even  more  important,  the   Government   has

consistently  delivered  results to  Singaporeans.   We  have

navigated  the  country  safely  through  the  Asian  crisis,

delivered strong economic growth year after year, and  raised

the  standard of living of all Singaporeans, rich  and  poor.

We could not have achieved any of this, without competent and

dedicated political leaders and a first class civil  service.

These  salary  revisions  will  help  us  to  maintain  these

critical  strengths, and continue to score new  wins  in  the

years to come.

<br>2.27 pm

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the hon. Members in this House will join me in

thanking  the Deputy Prime Minister for his Statement,  given

in  his usual candid and lucid manner.  And I am sure Members

in  this  House will also want to thank him for the  generous

allowance to Members of Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of Ministerial and civil service salaries

has  surfaced several times in this House in the  past.   But

for  Members like myself who entered this House only in 1997,

it will be the first time that we have an opportunity to give

our  views  on the matter.  The debate in 1994 on  the  White

Paper entitled "Competitive Salaries for Honest and Competent

Government" raised many of the issues that I am sure will  be

raised again in this House this time round.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Statement today refines what was put in

practice  after Parliament endorsed the White Paper in  1994.

The  principles,  as  stated by the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,

remain  much  the same  -  clear, transparent  principles  of

reward,  competitive salaries to attract top talent into  the

public  sector and, following from that, the benchmarking  of

salaries to comparable posts in the private sector.   In  the

October  1994 debate, Prime Minister Goh reminded this  House

and  Singaporeans that one of the crucial questions is, "What

sort  of  people  in  the Government will  best  provide  you

stability, a healthy environment, good-paying jobs and  bring

you more prosperity?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the turn of the century, I believe that

Singaporeans  will  accept  the  wisdom  of  the  policy   of

attracting  top  talent  into  the  public  sector   -   from

Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries to Permanent Secretaries

and  other civil servants.  What is readily apparent to  many

who  would  pause to think of recent events is that Singapore

has  weathered the economic storms of the past two  to  three

years  far better than many other countries in the region   - countries that have an abundance of resources that we do  not

have.  What we do have is a strong, reliable Government and a

resilient  people, who are prepared to take hardship  and  to

ride out the storm together.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the story could have been different. We could have

been  no better off or indeed be worse off than many  of  the

worst hit countries.  What could have happened, for instance,

if instead of being Ministers, they have been employed in the

private  sector,  taking care of their own  companies  rather

than the general well-being of all Singaporeans?  Would we be

in  this  position today, when we can point once  more  to  a

healthy  growth rate in our economy, when there is a  gradual

restoration  of  the cuts in salaries and CPF  that  we  have

endured over the past couple of years?  To me, and I am  sure

to  many  right-thinking Singaporeans, the  crucial  policies

taken  by  the  Government to combat the economic  crisis  in

1997 made the difference between what happened to us and what

happened in the region.  I do not wish to be smug about this.

Many  Singaporeans  still suffer from unemployment,  loss  of

income and other hardships.  But still recovery was not  long

in  coming  and all this because of the swift, decisive  and,

more  importantly, correct decisions taken to stave  off  the

ill-effects of the crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest people think that we may be blowing our own

trumpet,  it is gratifying to know, as Members of this  House

must  have  read  in today's Straits Times  as  well  as  the

Straits  Times  on  Monday,  26th June,  that  the  Singapore

Government   had  been  rated  top  in  Asia   for   economic

effectiveness and leadership quality.  Their management style

is described as moderately interventionist, which is distinct

from  being intrusive or highly intrusive.  This is the  view

culled from a survey on Asian leadership conducted by a  Hong

Kong  think-tank, the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy

(PERC).   The  survey  is based on the views  of  expatriates

working in the region conducted in the first quarter of  this

year.    In   other  words,  we  have  the  views  of   those

expatriates, most or all of whom, I presume, are  working  in

the  private sector, stating quite firmly and simply that the

leadership  in  Singapore  is  "High  Quality".    No   other

leadership in the survey attracted the same rating.  If there

was, and such leaders are paid less, we can, I think, ask the

DPM for an explanation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was struck not so much by the results of the

PERC's  survey  which was expected, as also by another  major

piece  concerning  Singapore  in  the  latest  issue  of  the

Economist, that very respectable English publication.  It ran

a  feature on e-Government.  The reporter said that "after e-commerce and e-business, the next Internet revolution will be

e-Government".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised me was that the only country that merited

a detailed feature was Singapore.  According to the Economist

list  of Net neighbourhoods, ie, people with Internet  access

at  home, Singapore came second only to Norway.  It is  ahead

of  countries  like  the US, Germany, UK, Canada,  Japan  and

Australia.   At the same time, in the feature on  Singapore's

approach  to e-Government, the report quoted an international

survey  of sites offering integrated service delivery through

the Internet conducted last year by America's General Service

Administration.  It stated "that Singapore eCitizen Centre is

the most developed example of integrated service delivery  in

the world."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these singular achievements, together with many

relating  to our infrastructural facilities like our  airport

and  seaport,  do not come about spontaneously.   Neither  do

good  Government spontaneously emerge from a population.   If

only  that  were  true.  But the histories of many  countries

bear  testimony  to  the  fact that  the  rise  and  fall  of

economies,  of  societies and even of civilisations  rest  on

political  and public leadership in times of war,  of  crisis

and of revolution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is facing challenges the like of which

have not been experienced before.  We face global competition

for  talent,  we  face  competition with developed  countries

which  have  far better resources and much larger populations

than we have.  Are we as a people going to be so small-minded

as to begrudge the political and public leadership their just

rewards?   Or  are we going to be positive, and  look  beyond

ourselves,  have the interests of the nation  at  heart,  and

say, "Well done, carry on" and be properly rewarded?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the refinements made to the

quantification of salaries for civil servants  and  political

leaders.    I   particularly  welcome  the   institution   of

performance  bonus for all civil servants.  But  lest  it  be

thought  that it can be taken for granted that one would  not

cast a critical eye on the public service as a Member of this

House, I should like to end by asking the DPM to assure us of

three things:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, that the selection process for the top leaders,

whether  as  Ministers, office-bearers, Permanent Secretaries

or  other PSL appointments, be as rigorous, if not more, than

what it has been before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, that we should consider some form of independent

mechanism  or  body to monitor and evaluate  the  quality  of

decision-making in the civil service.  We do not in Singapore

prefer to use the legal process for challenging civil service

decisions.    In  other  countries,  such  as  the   European

countries   and   North   America,  there   are   significant

developments  in the area of administrative  law  where  good

practices such as candour, transparency and regard  for   the

individuals  are  implemented.  We should like  to  encourage

such  values in the civil service, and as many have  said  in

this  House  during the Budget debate this  year,  we  should

expect   now   a   higher  standard  of   communication   and

transparency from the civil service than before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I ask the Government to make all possible

haste to restore the cuts to CPF and other wages to alleviate

the  hardship that is still felt by many.  Singaporeans would

want  to be assured that the Government would, as the PM  has

said,  "provide stability, a healthy environment, good-paying

jobs and more prosperity".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I thank you and support the measures on public

sector salaries.

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, I thank you

for allowing me to make some comments on the measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time when the salaries and benchmarkings were

commented upon, it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>



was  in  a different environment where the economy was  doing

well and many of the salaries have not gone up to the million

dollar  ranges.  This time round the issues will probably  be

more emotive because there are many other issues at hand, for

example,  the economic recovery has been patchy  and  certain

sectors   have  not  fully  recovered.   There  is  still   a

significant minority of the households in Singapore  who  are

low  income families.  Many of these will find these  million

dollar salaries, especially for the high office holders, very

mind-boggling  numbers  which they cannot  quite  fathom  and

understand.  Of course, there will be some people who believe

that  political  leaders should always be altruistic.   I  am

here  not to defend anybody but to try to take a level headed

approach  to  some  of these issues and try  to  dissect  the

emotive issues from the logical and rational thinking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question we want to ask ourselves is whether

there  are  any grounds for salary adjustment.  The  economic

crisis  has seen either a freeze or a downward adjustment  in

remuneration   for  senior  Government  leaders   and   civil

servants.  A strong and far-sighted political leadership that

we  have and an efficient civil service have helped Singapore

to  steer ourselves through the crisis with minimal damage to

the  economy.  Our political leaders have formulated policies

that  have allowed Singapore to have a speedy recovery.   The

upswing  in  the economy has been fast and, as  Members  have

read in the recent PERC report, our Singapore Government  has

been rated No. 1 in this region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the recovery in the economy, there have been

several  pull  factors which have made it more  difficult  to

retain  good leaders in the civil service and in other  areas

of  the  civil service as well.  I think there will  be  this

global  pull  for  talents which DPM has  mentioned,  and  we

cannot  escape  the  fact that this pull will  increase  when

stock  options  become a part of life in the private  sector.

It will be increasingly more difficult to attract top quality

leaders  to join the political leadership.  We need  to  make

these adjustments to market changes to retain the talents and

to attract new talents.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question that will bother many people is

whether  the  degree  of pay rise is  justifiable.   DPM  has

explained  that the percentage of pay rise across-the-  board

has  been  tailored to meet different segments in  the  civil

service  according to the type of professions or  departments

that  they  are  in.   I  support the move  to  moderate  the

increase  in  the base pay and instead move towards  variable

and  performance  linked bonus system.  I think  it  is  very

heart  warming that, for the Ministers especially,  the  base

pay  increase has only been 0.3%.  That is a good message  to

send  across  and that a significant part of the  adjustments

will be through a performance related system.  This is a move

that should be lauded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question that many people will ask is not just

the  percentage of increment but the absolute amounts in  the

salary  increase.  Is it justified?  Yes, the sums are  large

and we must look at this in perspective.  We must be able  to

compare  apples  with  apples and  pears  with  pears.   Some

Members must have read in the last few weeks that there was a

report  in  the Straits Times that said that a  drop  in  the

share price of several electronic and manufacturing companies

on the Stock Exchange had resulted in a paper loss of tens of

millions  of dollars for these individuals.  I am also  aware

of   companies  where  employees  have  stock  options  worth

millions of dollars.  If we take the perspective that our top

Government  leaders  are the key drivers of  Singapore  Inc.,

then  certainly  they should deserve to  get  a  remuneration

comparable,  if  not  better than  those  given  to  the  top

management of these companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am especially pleased that even though the benchmarks

and  the formulas have been decided upon, the Government  has

been transparent enough to come forward to bring the issue to

the  forefront  and debate this again and  put  this  up  for

comments  by other Members of Parliament. If we  look  at  it

logically  and  rationally, these moves are  good  moves  but

there  are many emotional issues at hand and we cannot escape

from  these emotional concerns that will be expressed or have

been expressed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier, economic recovery is patchy and

there  are  sectors of the economy that have yet  to  recover

fully from the crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would it be a rational argument to say that the pay of

Ministers  and  civil servants should only be adjusted  after

all  sectors of the economy have been restored or  recovered?

I  do  not  think  so.   In fact, we should  ensure  that  we

continue  to  attract good talent into Government  and  civil

service  so that we can drive the economy to greater  heights

and  restructure  the economy to meet the  challenges  ahead.

This  would  be  a solution in helping those sectors  of  the

economy that have been weak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another emotive concern of many people is, I think there

is  not  a  small minority of Singapore households that  have

incomes at a low income range, and they will never be able to

get  even one year's remuneration of the top earners in their

whole  life time.  Hence, some people will argue, "Yes, there

will  be  too great an income divide between the top and  the

low income families."  This is a very emotive issue that will

find  favour  with many people.  It will pull  at  our  heart

strings.   Yes,  there  are  low income  families  that  will

certainly continue to require assistance.  If we look  at  it

in  a  more  rational way, we must ask ourselves whether  the

savings  that  can be obtained by not having a pay  increase,

what  will  it  do  to help them compared to  having  a  good

Government  and a first class civil service that can  attract

high  quality  investments  and help  workers  upgrade  their

skills.   That  is  a  better solution to helping  the  lower

income families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another emotive issue that the absolute amounts that the

Ministers   and  top  civil  servants  will  get   in   their

remuneration  package are so large compared  to  the  average

household  that it will be very difficult for them to  accept

these numbers.  These are million dollar numbers and some  of

them  in  their whole life time will never see these numbers.

I  do not disagree that these numbers may be mind-boggling or

seem very excessive for the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>



average families in Singapore.  Again, we have to try to  put

aside  our  emotions.  Five or 10 years down the road,  there

will always be low income families.  But there will always be

top  corporate leaders in the private sector that  will  earn

salaries  beyond  the  imagination of the  average  Singapore

families.   Should  we stop paying our top political  leaders

and  our  civil servants high salaries because there are  low

income  families who will not understand the quantum  of  the

pay?   Or  should  we  pay top political  leaders  and  civil

servants a remuneration that is close to the market  so  that

we  have  good people who will lead the country and  will  be

able  to  help  these  low  income  families   improve  their

standard of living?  I think the answer is obvious.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there are those who believe that, yes, politicians

are here on a calling and to be altruistic and therefore they

should sacrifice for the nation.  This sort of statement will

find favour with many people.  But we must ask ourselves, how

many of our top talents in the private sector will be willing

to  step  out of their high paying private sector  jobs  with

corporate  benefits and go into the political arena.   Do  we

sincerely believe that altruism alone can attract the best to

come forward and to run our country?  If we believe that,  we

must be mistaken.  I think to many Singaporeans, the concerns

and  worries  that  were present during  the  Asian  economic

crisis appear to have been an issue of the past.  In my  day-to-day  practice as a doctor, I continue to meet people  from

other  countries,  including Indonesia, and  they  are  still

significantly   affected   by   the   social   and   economic

consequences of the crisis.  Just this week alone, I met  one

who  said  that he had to relocate from his home in Indonesia

because  of the social unrest.  He has got to move  somewhere

else out of Indonesia to live with his daughter.  I have  got

another  patient  who came to me and said that  he  was  very

worried  because his land had been occupied by other  people,

and he feared for the safety of his family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These accounts by these patients remind me that I have

to count my

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>



blessings.  I do not take this for granted.  I am happy  that

I  have  a home, I do not have to worry for my safety  of  my

family, and I have a job and stable income.  And all this has

been made possible because we have a strong political climate

and a strong economy.  I do not take this for granted, but  I

am  thankful that we have a good Government that has made all

this possible for all Singaporeans to have a safe home and  a

prosperous nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that we should invest in our future, and

really  our  future depends on attracting and  retaining  top

talent  in  the Government and in the civil service  so  that

these talented people can continue to make Singapore the best

home for every Singaporean.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

very  difficult to do a benchmark and define a  formula  that

can  reflect  what  a  Minister or a  top  civil  servant  in

Singapore  should  be paid.  The general feedback  from  many

Singaporeans  is that we are paying our Ministers  and  civil

servants  too high a salary as compared to any other  country

in  the  world.  But the question we should ask ourselves  is

whether  we  can really make a fair comparison by looking  at

the  salary  scales  of Ministers and top civil  servants  in

other  countries.  My contention is that we cannot and should

not  because there is no other country like Singapore  around

the  world.   The  nature of things here  is  very  different

compared  to  those  in  any other countries.   So  Singapore

leaders  therefore  decided to define a unique  formula  that

suits  our  system and the system basically addresses  issues

like  corruption prevention, attracting the  best  talent  to

join  the  Government and compensating for what the Ministers

lose out by not participating in the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, we should look at the salary formula on a

stand-alone context of the Singapore environment and  in  the

context of addressing the issues that I just mentioned.  Just

as  the  board  of directors and the top management  of  each

corporation  or  company  will have  to  determine  the  best

compensation  package to attract and retain the  best  talent

and to motivate them to do well for the company, in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



same  way  the  Government  of  the  day  in  Singapore   has

determined  the salary formula and compensation package  that

the Deputy Prime Minister has just announced.  And it is best

suited  to achieve the objectives of recruiting and retaining

talent and to keep the Government clean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the man in the street, however, will see the

quantum of salary increases for the Ministers, as so huge and

unimaginable for them to achieve easily.  I do feel  for  the

man  in the street and therefore it is the responsibility  of

the  Government  to  ensure that every  Singaporean  has  the

opportunity to achieve their full potential and earn as  much

as  they deserve to earn.  Everybody should be ensured  of  a

good   quality   of  life  in  Singapore  and   it   is   the

responsibility of the Government and the Ministers to  ensure

that this happens.  If the Government fails to do so, and the

Ministers  fail to do so, then the people in  charge  do  not

deserve to be paid what they are being paid, just as  in  any

country,  where  the  CEO  and the top  management  are  held

accountable for their poor performance and their compensation

package is affected accordingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also feel that it is not useful to compare the quantum

of  the  Ministers' salary to that of the man in the  street,

because  if we do, then obviously there is a tremendous  skew

and  the gap will be really big.  I feel that we should  look

at the Ministers' compensation package on a stand-alone basis

based  on the responsibility they have been charged with  and

this cannot be easily compared with anyone else in Singapore.

We must look at the issue on an absolute basis.  Any relative

measurement  will result in too much of an emotional  debate,

as  my  colleague  Dr Michael Lim talked about  earlier.   In

fact,  it  will  be  emotional because of  our  inability  to

compare accurately the roles and responsibilities of the jobs

against which we are comparing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said that, it is also a common practice in

the  private sector for the top management to be paid a  very

high compensation package, as compared to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



the average worker in the company.  So a relative measurement

in such a situation is also not useful.  The relative measure

of  a  CEO's  or  Minister's  salary  should  be  really  the

competition  and  therefore a company or a government  should

continue to attract, keep and motivate them.  To be  able  to

continue  to attract, motivate and keep them in the  company,

the  compensation package should be more attractive  compared

to   the   alternative  employment  and  package   that   the

competition can provide.  In this case, for the Ministers and

top  civil  servants, the competition is the private  sector.

For our CEOs, it will be another company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the formula chosen by the Government basically aims

to  use the private sector as a benchmark.  I can accept this

formula  because the private sector does provide  alternative

employment opportunities for the Ministers and civil servants

and  therefore the competition is there for the same  talent.

However,  I  feel that the formula used in the past  was  not

quite  a  good  measure  of what salary  increments  the  top

private sector earners really received.  The biggest flaw  in

the formula was that every year, the top four earners in each

professional  group were most likely not the same  people  in

the  following year.  In fact, these people were probably the

outliers  within their profession and taking  an  average  of

such outlier numbers results in something that does not truly

reflect  what  the best earners in the private sector  really

receive.  And it does not really reflect the essence of  what

the formula was supposed to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the top earners in most cases made their money

as   a  result  of  extraordinary  performance  and  received

extraordinary bonuses or stock options, as the  Deputy  Prime

Minister  rightly  pointed out.   With  the  changes  in  the

formula   that   the   Deputy   Prime   Minister   announced,

specifically in increasing the total number of people used as

a  benchmark and using the median instead of the  average  of

48,  I  believe we should, to a certain extent,  address  the

issue  of  the outliers.  It is also prudent to discount  the

variable

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



component  of  the private sector salaries in  computing  the

benchmark  for  Ministers and civil servants, and  especially

stock options tend to really skew the data out of place.  The

reason  is that, as the Deputy Prime Minister mentioned,  the

point of exercise could be the result of stock option accrued

over  many  years of employment.  So, therefore, it  was  not

fair in the past to use this to compute the average.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, by making smaller increments in the basic

salary  and  by  allowing huge performance  bonuses,  we  are

getting closer to the private sector's method of compensation

where  it  is  more  equitable.  The  Deputy  Prime  Minister

earlier  announced  that  about  40%  of  the  increment   or

benchmark salary actually goes to the variable component, and

I  think it is a good move, and this will only be paid if the

performance of the Minister or the civil servant is good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Deputy Prime Minister to continue to

fine-tune  the  formula  so that we can  better  achieve  the

intended  goal  of  a private sector system  of  compensation

package.   I  especially  support  the  fact  that  should  a

Minister  or  civil servant do extremely well  and  typically

there  will  be just a handful of people each year,  then  we

should not shy away from giving them huge bonuses, be it  six

months,  10 months or even 20 months of bonuses, and this  is

what  is being practised in the private sector.  This is  not

given to everyone in the company, just a handful of them  who

really did very well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, since we have chosen a private sector

benchmark  for  the system of compensating our Ministers  and

civil servants, I feel that we should accordingly expose  the

Ministers  and  civil servants to the risk of employment,  as

faced  by the top management in the private sector.  So while

the  top managements in the private sector are paid very high

salaries, they face tremendous risk in whether their  careers

should  continue within the same company.  In my opinion,  we

cannot  just  adopt  the  good part  of  the  private  sector

practices and leave out the bad part.  I therefore feel  that

while we have accepted

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



a  transparent  system of compensating  Ministers  and  civil

servants, we should accordingly have a transparent system  of

how   their  performances  are  measured  and  how  they  are

penalised for their poor performances.  And penalising  means

not getting a bonus, and it may not be a sacking as you know,

it  takes time.  It is only fair that Singaporeans know about

this part of the formula and that we are sincerely practising

a system where people do not get rewarded even if they do not

do  their  jobs  well.  I know that this is a very  difficult

thing to do, especially for the Cabinet, but I would say that

this  comes as the hazards of the job, in return for such  an

attractive  compensation package.  If we  can  show  this  in

practice  that we are really compensating the good performers

and not rewarding the poor performers, then I am sure that we

will have no problems in getting Singaporeans to support  the

system  that  we are putting in place.  The problem  is  that

many  of them are just looking at the good part of the  story

and  not  the other part of where poor performers do not  get

rewarded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I support the proposal that the Deputy

Prime Minister has put up.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with the

Deputy  Prime Minister that we must have competitive salaries

for  Ministers and civil servants to maintain a competent and

honest  government.   Such  competitive  salaries  could   be

slightly   higher   than   the  average   salaries   of   the

professionals  in  the private sector  and  can  be  adjusted

regularly according to our economic performance, productivity

growth,  and  inflation rate in line with the recommendations

of  NWC.   The  aim  is to make sure that  they  can  lead  a

comfortable life financially commensurate with their official

position and status during their dedicated service in  public

office.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business community generally understands and accepts

this.   But what we are concerned is that, according  to  the

formula  given  by  the  Government,  the  salaries  of   the

Ministers and top civil servants will be based on the average

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>



income  of  a  few  top  earners who  are  the  exceptionally

successful   bankers,   accountants,   engineers,    lawyers,

manufacturers  or  MNC chiefs.  These top income  earners,  I

believe, are not mere wage earners like the Ministers and top

civil servants drawing a fixed salary with good job security,

regardless  of  the ups and downs of our economic  conditions

and the balance of payments.  They are, in fact, enterprising

businessmen and risk-takers who have to pay a high  price  in

terms  of financial losses and legal obligations in the event

of  their  business failures.  The incomes these top  earners

earn  from business success could be exceptionally  high  and

some of them might in future earn as much as Bill Gates or Li

Kashing.   We  therefore  have  to  ask  ourselves:   Is   it

appropriate  or  realistic for the Ministers  and  top  civil

servants to expect an income comparable with such top earners

in the private sector?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministers and top civil servants must strive to earn

their respect, trust and confidence from the people, in order

to have their continued support in policy implementation.  In

the  true  spirit of tripartism, the average businessmen  and

workers would expect the Ministers and top civil servants  to

set  a good example by putting the community before self  and

making  some personal sacrifices, in terms of time and money,

in  pursuit of national interests and issues.  How could  the

Ministers  and  top  civil  servants  continue  to  earn  the

respect,  trust and confidence from the people  if  they  are

inclined  to  demand a high income comparable with  those  of

Bill Gates or Li Kashing?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, businessmen and employers in private

sector are currently facing upward pressure of business  cost

arising  from  the economic recovery.  Any large  across-the-board  increase  in  the civil service salary  may  create  a

spiral  effect, leading to runaway increases in wages, prices

and  charges, in both public and private sectors.  This would

drive  up our total business cost, forcing many companies  to

close  down  or  relocate elsewhere in  the  face  of  fierce

competition from the regional economies.  This, together with

the  increasing cost of living, will cause even more hardship

to the low

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



income group.  The business community would therefore like to

urge  the Government to be more moderate in the upward salary

revisions for Ministers and civil servants and consider other

supplementary  incentives or rewards to  keep  the  deserving

staff in the civil service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you  for  allowing me to join in the debate.  Sir, I  support

the   Government   salary  revision.   In   particular,   the

Government  should be commended for taking the initiative  to

fine-tune the salary benchmarks and formula, making  it  even

more realistic and practical.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after suffering pay cuts and being held back, in

terms of benchmarking, during the Asian economic crisis,  the

question  is:  when  should pay be adjusted  for  the  public

sector?  Is it too soon?  Is it too much?  I think not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a good Government. A good Government that

shines  like a beacon of light in the darkest moments of  the

Asian  economic  crisis.   There  is  none  better  than  the

Singapore  Government.  It delivers.  The Government  brought

us  out of the economic crisis safe and sound.  And Singapore

is  well-positioned indeed to ride the next wave of political

and  economic  opportunities  in  the  region.   Whereas,  in

comparison,  our  neighbours  have  economic  and   political

upheavals.   We  have peace, stability and  economic  growth.

The Government has indeed given

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



us security, peace and prosperity for more than 40 years.  It

has  enhanced the assets of all Singaporeans.  What more  can

we ask of a good Government?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must pay well in order to have good men and women in

the  Government.  The good men and women would make  a  major

difference  to the well-being of the entire nation.   Let  us

not hold back but instead ensure that our country, Singapore,

is  in  good hands, and that we have a bright future to  look

forward to.  We can of course pay less, but we will get less.

Rather,  we  should invest in our future and  our  children's

future.  It is, in my opinion, a very small price to  pay  to

ensure  that we have good Government, and good men and  women

in the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC),

a  Hong Kong-based think-tank, ranked Singapore first for the

overall  qualities  of  the  political  leadership  and   its

successful  economic management of the country.  This  is  an

independent  research institution and it puts  the  Singapore

Government right at the top, well ahead of Hong Kong, Taiwan,

Japan  and  South Korea, with the rest of the other countries

in the region trailing far, far behind all of us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the real world. Let us not pretend that we

can   continue   to  have  good  Government  without   paying

appropriate  and realistic salaries.  You get what  you  pay.

This is the fundamental parameter and lesson from the private

sector.  We know it only too well because many of us are from

the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is indeed better to give realistic salaries to

the public sector than to end up as a broken-back country and

face the prospect of being refugees on the high seas, sailing

to nowhere, as we have witnessed in so many other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a new generation has grown up in Singapore,

fascinated  by  IT, the dot.com and the life  sciences.   The

Government  has  to compete for talents in the  open  market,

even more so in the knowledge-based economy.  Let us also not

forget that good talented Singaporeans can also go global,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



go  out of Singapore's shores to seek other opportunities  in

the brave new world outside.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to make one point about performance of the

public  sector  staff.   I  am glad that  the  Government  is

putting a greater portion of the pay into performance bonuses

and  incentives  but  I must highlight  the  perception  that

persists that the civil service is an iron rice bowl and many

can get by day by day.  The point here is that we must not be

seen to be harbouring poor performers.  We are not aware that

many  poor  performers are downgraded or removed, whereas  in

the private sector, the risk factor is much, much higher, and

staff  are  hired  and  fired according  to  performance  and

circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With higher pay, it is only right that we expect the

Government  to  be  more  stringent  in  the  selection   and

promotion  of  staff  in  ensuring  accountability  and   not

hesitating to act on non-performers. We must pay market rate.

That  is the right thing to do but, at the same time, market-related performance for the public sector staff must also  be

expected.  The  higher  the pay, the  higher  should  be  the

performance.   The  civil  service  should  not  forget  that

ordinary  Singaporeans,  the  men-in-the-street,  are  indeed

their pay masters, as well as their customers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is of concern to all Singaporeans is the

widening  income gap in the country, which is very much  part

of the global trend in the wake of the new economy, something

we  cannot  totally  avoid.  It is impossible  to  close  the

income  gap  completely  and  swim  against  this  tide   but

Singapore should do all we can locally to minimise the income

gap.  We  must  not  allow  the income  divide  to  become  a

political  divide of the haves and have-nots. We should  take

every  opportunity  to  emphasise  job  training  and  skills

upgrading  for  the bulk of the population, especially  those

older  workers who need to re-adapt and retrain for  the  new

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I dare say that we indeed have a good

Government  and  we should be thankful that we  have  a  good

Government, and we should support this pay revision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng (Minister without Portfolio) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister without Portfolio (Mr Lim Boon Heng):</b> Sir,

first,  let me give a short response to Dr Ong Chit Chung  on

the  point  about private sector jobs being more  risky  than

those  in  the  civil  service.  I am  not  sure  whether  he

intended  to  echo  what Mr Inderjit Singh had  earlier  said

about the job of political office holders - whether that  was

the real point.  But I think he will agree with me, observing

governments in different parts of the world, that there is no

riskier  job  than that of a political office.  I  think  the

risk may be different but the job is no less risky.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung</b> rose ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Would you like to make way for Dr

Ong?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Boon Heng:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I was not referring

particularly to the political office holders but to the civil

service as a whole.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Boon Heng:</b> Sir, I take the point. But now in the

PSL  scheme,  those  appointed  to  the  top  jobs  would  be

appointed  for 10 years and, after that, they would  have  to

leave.   Now  it is not quite the same as the private  sector

but there is a limit as to how long the person will serve  in

that  job  and  that does not mean that if the person  really

fumbles  in the job, he will not be removed. I do  not  think

that is the intention of the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this afternoon, Members debated a full hour on

the  widening income gap.  The numbers that were released  by

DPM BG Lee puts this in sharp focus.  Members

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



will  observe  how  much the income gap has  widened  in  top

talent  and the workers in the factory. This trend,  however,

is  not a Singapore phenomenon.  I have been associated  with

the  trade  unions for 20 years.  It is my  job  to  see  how

others  pay  workers  elsewhere and what  incomes  were  like

between  management and workers. I know that this  trend  has

its origins in the United States.  In the 1980s, US companies

restructured  and re-engineered to regain the competitiveness

they had lost to other MNCs, particularly the Japanese.   One

of  the  key  changes  they  made  was  to  provide  new  and

attractive  incentive  schemes to top  executives,  the  most

significant  of  which are stock options.  The  stock  option

message  is clear.  If you make the company grow, your  share

in it grows as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the 1990s, US companies had regained their vitality.

New  ideas  emerged, using new technology. As the revitalised

US  companies sweep the competition, MNCs elsewhere  followed

these successful United States models.  In Europe, the United

Kingdom  led  the way and these methods are now spreading  in

Western  Europe.  Indeed, there is an on-going debate  raging

in  some  continental European countries steeped in socialist

thinking.  They  ask:  are the wages of top earners  obscene?

European  MNCs  are  not waiting for the conclusion  of  this

debate  -  they  have  to survive, and  therefore,  they  are

fighting  for  their  share of top talent  who  will  make  a

difference to their future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the result? Under the administration of Tony

Blair's  New Labour, the income gap in the United Kingdom  is

now wider than it ever was during the Thatcher years!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French Socialist Finance Minister, Laurent Fabius could

not  persuade one top talent he wanted to join and  work  for

him.  Why?   He  was  locked up by  his  company  with  stock

options!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Japanese have taken notice. They too, are

beginning to embrace

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>



American methods. They have started to employ non-Japanese to

lead  their troubled companies and I am sure that  they  must

pay  top  wages to get those foreigners to work for  Japanese

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people ask: can we stop the income gap from

widening?   In  other  words,  let  the  Americans  and   the

Europeans  and even the Japanese go their way and let  us  go

our way. This is unrealistic. We cannot buck the trend.  Ours

is  rated  as  the  most globalised economy by  one  research

company,  AT  Kearney reported in The Economist.   Therefore,

what  happens elsewhere will come to pass here as  well.  Our

top  talent  will compete for jobs at top first world  wages.

Go to New York, Silicon Valley, London, Hong Kong or Tokyo  - you  will find some of our best talents there. They are  paid

what  top  talents in the world are paid.  Many of them  earn

several millions a year and they do so quietly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we want more of our top talent leaving to join first

world  companies? Are we satisfied that they do well  in  the

first  world countries, creating jobs there? Or  do  we  want

them   here,   developing  companies,   creating   jobs   for

Singaporeans?  I think we want the latter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, we still have most of our top talent here.

But try to narrow the income gap here by imposing a limit  on

top end wages instead of letting market forces work - we will

merely  see the migration of our top talent.  The cost  would

be  a  sluggish economy, higher unemployment and lower  wages

across  the board, not just low wages at the top,  but  lower

wages  also at the bottom. Far from helping the lower income,

we  will  be  consigning  them to third  world  standards  of

living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are concerned about the welfare of the less-skilled lower income families here, which, evidently many

Members  are, judging from the debate earlier this afternoon,

then we must not only retain our talent but also attract more

talent  here.  Only a thriving economy will create good  jobs

for all, including the less skilled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must have some of the best talent in Government and

in the civil service. Some

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



will  say that the wealth of the country is not due  just  to

the efforts of Government or the civil service but due to the

hard-work of the people of Singapore.  True, I agree but  our

hardworking people need leaders to show them the  right  way.

If  we do not have top talent to analyse the problems we face

and  devise the right policies and plans, all their hard work

will be in vain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made my first of several trips to Vietnam in 1992. I

was  deeply  impressed by how motivated and  hardworking  the

Vietnamese  people  are.  They had abandoned  the  centrally-planned economy, where everyone was paid almost the same  low

wages, for the market economy, following what other communist

countries had done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made my most recent trip two weeks ago. One

Vietnamese  asked what I think of Vietnam.  Well,  there  has

been  progress.  Some Vietnamese are better off.  They  drive

cars  or motorcycles. Their traffic jams in the evenings  are

not  due just to bicycles but also to many motorcycles.   But

they could have done a lot better, if their leaders have been

bolder  in  accepting market-oriented policies.   They  could

have  attracted  more investments creating jobs  in  Vietnam.

Instead,  today  they are planning to export 300,000  workers

overseas, the solution which Mr Zulkifli might have suggested

for  our lower income and low-skilled workers. But I  do  not

think  that is the way to go, because to send our low-skilled

workers  overseas  means paying them  wages  of  third  world

countries.  They get a better pay working here in  Singapore.

Vietnamese  workers,  I think, toil harder  than  Singaporean

workers but they do not enjoy the quality of life our workers

have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the difference? It is in the quality of

leadership - in Government and in the civil service.  Without

capable  leaders showing the right way, our workers can  work

hard but see no improvement in their lives.  I do not mean to

criticise the Vietnamese government.  The transition  from  a

centrally-planned economy to a market economy is not an  easy

one.  But the point is: hard work by the people alone is  not

enough; the policies must be right.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not want Singaporeans to toil hard for little

return.   We want them to have good jobs here.  We want  them

to  be  better  skilled, more productive and  earning  higher

wages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our economic recovery is firm, let us not

underestimate the problems that we face.  The transition that

we  have  to make into the knowledge economy is not  an  easy

one.   At  the  same time, many of the jobs we now  have  are

under threat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have done well in a number of areas. But this

success  does not guarantee the future.  We have  to  draw  a

lesson from the Fortune Top 100 list.  In 20 years, the names

at the top are quite different!  So even in the sectors where

we are rated among the best, we can be left behind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for example, the port of Singapore. It has been

our  lifeline  since  the founding of modern  Singapore.   In

recent years, we have seen how new ports close by can pose  a

real challenge to PSA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take Changi Airport. It has developed into the leading

hub  in  the region, even though, geographically, Bangkok  is

better  sited.  But this position may not last forever.   Two

days  ago,  I flew back from London.  The Singapore  Airlines

flight was almost full.  However, most of the passengers  did

not  stop  over  in  Singapore.   The  majority  changed   to

connecting flights to Australia.  Good business for  SIA  and

Changi  Airport, but not our hotels or shops.  The  same  day

(27th  June) at noon, I read in the New Paper that  with  the

new  Boeing  747-400 and flight paths over China, Qantas  can

fly  London-Sydney refuelling at Bangkok,  cutting  one  hour

from the journey.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is only the harbinger of things to come. In a few

short  years,  a new generation of aircraft can  fly  London-Sydney  non-stop.  So will most of those who commute  between

Europe and Australia over fly Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will Changi face the same fate as Honolulu? Honolulu

used  to  be  a  stop-over  for  trans-Pacific  flights,  but

aircraft  now fly non-stop across the Pacific.   Will  Changi

face the same fate as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



airports  in  the Middle East, once a necessary stop  between

Asia and Europe?  What implications have this development for

Singapore  Airlines?  What new strategies must  it  adopt  to

remain  one of the leading airlines in the world, maintaining

25,000  jobs it creates, mostly for Singaporeans, and we  are

not talking about jobs for the lower 10% of Singaporeans.  We

are talking about good jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take another example: the telecommunications sector.

Technology has changed so fast in this sector, and the ground

rules  have  likewise  changed.  Today SingTel  has  a  tough

challenge  to remain a national champion generating thousands

of  good  jobs for Singaporeans.  In order to strengthen  our

chances  of  remaining  our  telecommunications  hub  in  the

region, we have opened up the sector, adding greater pressure

on SingTel.  Better to open up, create jobs for Singaporeans,

even if they work for foreign companies, than to continue  to

protect SingTel and risk losing everything.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are but three examples. They show that we are not

just competing with countries in the region, we are competing

globally.   Therefore,  we need to get  the  best  talent  in

Government,   in  the  civil  service  and  in  our   leading

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If US companies, European companies and, most likely,

also the Japanese companies all pay top wages for top talent,

we  will  see top end wages here rise as well, if we  are  to

retain  and  attract our share of talent to  tackle  the  new

challenges before us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The income gap may widen, but it will widen because

wages  will rise much more slowly at the lower end.   But  it

does  not  mean that there is no improvement in the lives  of

those at the bottom.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the income gap stop widening? At this stage of our

development,  it will widen further, but it will  slow  down.

Even   in   the  United  States,  the  gap  will  not   widen

indefinitely.  It must also plateau off, even swing back  and

narrow somewhat.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>



Indeed,  the  dip in the Dow Jones index and Nasdaq  recently

has,  in  many  instances, reduced the variable payments  top

executives get.  One day it may be a more prolonged dip.   If

that  happens, it will happen here as well.  When  that  will

be, it is difficult to predict.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our task is to get people in Government and in the civil

service  to  devise policies that will ensure  that  the  low

income share in the progress of the country, even with  their

relatively  lower incomes.  It means successfully  attracting

investments  to  create good jobs for all  our  workers.   It

means  keeping  HDB  flats  affordable,  ensuring  that  good

healthcare is available to everyone, that children  from  all

families  get the best education they deserve.  For  now,  we

have  to  follow the world-wide trend and pay top talent  the

high  wages they can earn elsewhere.  But more of the  annual

wage  for them should be variable, as in the private  sector.

I  am  pleased that  the new wage structure that DPM  BG  Lee

announced matches more closely private sector practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from ensuring that our workers continue to have

good  jobs,  and  their families continue to enjoy  a  decent

life,   we   must  maintain  equal  opportunities  for   all,

irrespective  of family income.  This has been so  throughout

our  short history.  The children of poor families have  been

able to go all the way to university, and then into jobs.  It

is still so today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I left for London recently, one SATS employee, a

Muslim  woman,  assisted my mother-in-law with a  wheelchair,

pushing   her  to  the  boarding  gate.   I  had   a   casual

conversation with her, and found that she was going on  leave

next  month  -  on holiday to Canada.  It pleased me that  an

ordinary worker of SATS can afford to take a holiday  so  far

away.  But what pleased me much more was her telling me  that

she would be visiting her son who is there studying to become

a  doctor.   So our system today allows children from  humble

families  to  rise to the top!  We must make sure  that  this

remains  so.  And even if we may have to live with  a  higher

income disparity than we have been comfortable with, we know

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>



that  in  the  next generation, the children from  low-income

families  also have a chance to get to the top, and draw  top

wages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So our policies must not only ensure everyone has a good

job,  a  comfortable home and access to healthcare,  we  must

also  ensure  that  our  education system  remains  a  social

leveller that gives every child equal opportunities to go  as

far as his abilities allow him or her.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have taken this line in this debate because I

know  there  is a lot of concern for the plight of  the  low-income.   There  is concern about this sense  of  unhappiness

seeing  others  earn top wages, and that maybe  the  solution

could be to narrow the income gap.  But to me, after 20 years

working  with the trade unions, I know that the best  way  to

help  the low-income is to ensure that they have a job,  that

they  can earn a living and hold their heads high.  And  that

way is to make sure that we have top talent in Government, in

the civil service and also in our companies.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to

join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, salary revision both in the private sector and the

public   sector  attracts  tremendous  attention.   What   is

important for us is to ask ourselves whether salary  revision

is  essential.  I think it is essential in order that one has

to  provide some rewards and incentives to attract the  best,

and  one cannot escape this, whether in the low-income group,

the  middle  income  or  the  top bracket,  the  revision  is

essentially  necessary.   At the same  time,  we  should  ask

ourselves how can we attract good, honest people, people with

integrity  and  ability, into the various sectors.   I  think

that  is  the  basic question that we have to ask  ourselves,

that  if we do not pay respectable rewards and incentives  to

people, could we attract them, sustain them, or would  we  in

the long run be worse off?  These are basic questions that we

have to ask ourselves  and the answer is obvious.  If we need

to  have  a  versatile  organisation,  versatile  enterprise,

versatile Government, then we must try and attract  the  best

into the public sector and also into the private sector.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



private  sector always attracts the best all the time because

they reward the best through various measures and incentives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the world is changing. We are not competing

amongst ourselves.  We are competing with people outside  and

in  the  international arena.  The world has become  complex.

Knowledge  has changed.  There are now borderless industries,

ideas, travel and these are very complex issues that we  need

to  tackle.  And would Singapore and Singaporeans be able  to

face  these  challenges of a complex nature  and  how  do  we

prepare people and encourage and recruit people in the public

sector?   I think that is a very important question  that  we

all  have to ask ourselves.  The question is to try  and  see

how we can provide them respectable incentives and rewards in

order that we can get them to give their best.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the working class and the average workers and

the  families  in  the heartland, we have  to  ask  ourselves

whether  we  would  be better off if we  have  dishonest  and

incompetent  people managing the Government.  I  am  sure  we

would  not  be  better off.  We will be worse  off.   So  the

question  is: how do we, as Singaporeans, make sure  that  we

attract the best possible people into the public sector?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure Members will agree with me that an effective

civil service and a sound political leadership together  with

a  hardworking population are key factors to promote economic

and  social  progress  of  any nation.   We  have  seen  this

happening  in  the  United Kingdom.  They attract  reasonably

talented  people into the civil service. We  have  seen  this

happening  in  Ireland.  Ireland was at one time  not  really

making  progress  but it has reformed  and  changed.   It  is

making  very good progress today.  The United States,  Canada

and  new  emerging places have undergone reforms.   Even,  as

Members know, Poland, which was a very planned economy, today

has  changed.   The leadership has changed.  They  have  been

able  to  attract  talented people  into  the  Government  of

Poland.   Mexico is changing.  South Korea, in fact, is  also

undergoing  reform and changes, despite the problems  of  the

chaebo.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the problems have been created by all these

chaebos.   They are trying to clean it up.  As Members  know,

it  requires good people to think through what can  be  done.

Good  government is a valuable asset to people as  lives  can

become  better.  Therefore, it is very important  for  us  in

Singapore  to  attract people of quality  and,  I  say,  most

importantly,  people with integrity, into the  civil  service

and  politics.   In order to do so, we need  to  reward  them

adequately and also provide them incentives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good insurance for Singaporeans because we

continuously need honest and capable people in Government not

only  to  look  after  our assets but  to  build  our  assets

further.   We have accumulated more than $80 billion  but  we

will  have  to look after it to build it further so  that  we

will remain viable and versatile.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, imagine what poor government can do to the lives of

Singaporeans  when  dishonest  and  less  able   people   are

attracted into the civil service and politics.  Can  we  make

progress?  Not too distant time, we know of the Lim Yew  Hock

Government.   See what has happened?  We had a corrupt  civil

service.   We  had  inefficient  and  not  competent   people

managing  it.  Many Singaporeans suffered.  Their lives  were

no better until we had a change of Government in 1959.  So it

is  not too distant. We should remember that this is not  too

far  in  history and I hope people do not have short memories

that  such  a  problem can happen.  In many  places,  such  a

problem  has come about.  Our public resources and funds  can

be  squandered  by people who are dishonest and  incompetent.

We  will  all end up as losers as each of us has to carry  at

the  end  of  the day the public debt created by incompetents

who  have found their way into government.  This is happening

in  many places and I am sure Singaporeans can read about  it

and the problems are quite real.  We have seen this happening

right  now  in Latin America, in the Balkans, in  Africa,  in

Asia  and  nearer in our region.  People are suffering  as  a

result  of  rampant government corruption.  As a result,  the

better off will leave because of instability.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I studied in Hong Kong and I had lots of friends who

studied together with me in my post-graduate studies.   Prior

to 1997, many of my good friends have migrated because of the

fear  and  concern of political instability  in  the  future.

There  are a lot of talented people who have gone to  Canada,

the United States and Australia.  I have gone back to revisit

them  but  I could not find some of them.  This is  real.   I

shared,  studied and lived with them in the  hostel.   Today,

many  of  them are in many other places other than Hong  Kong

because of political instability.  As a result, Hong Kong has

lost many of its talents to many of the developed countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the end, I say that if we do not have good

people  in  Government and the civil service, we will  be  no

better  and  we cannot guarantee that this cannot  happen  to

Singapore  provided that we ensure that we have  good  people

who can be attracted into politics and Government.  If we are

not  careful, we will suffer the same fate.  So it is  better

that  we  give our able people in Government and the  private

sector respectable rewards and incentives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we reward the capable in Government, we

should also take care of the well being of the working class,

ie,  the  heartlanders.  The cost of living  is  expected  to

increase  and  it  is important that basic services  such  as

education,   health,  housing,  transport  and  PUB   charges

continue  to  be  affordable.  I would like to  ask  the  DPM

whether  such  costs will remain reasonable  and  affordable.

How would the Government continue to look after the interests

of the working class?  What plans does it have because we are

moving  towards  rewarding  good  Government  servants,  good

Administrative  Officers?  Therefore, can we ensure  that  we

have  in the civil service people who are of quality so  that

we are able to make further progress?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the salary revision and the increases have

implications  on consumer cost and create some inflation.   I

would  like  to  ask  the DPM whether  one  would  expect  an

inflationary  trend  which can affect  our  economy  to  some

extent.  With all these changes, would it have any spiralling

effect on the cost of living of the ordinary people?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last salary revision, have we been able to

attract  good  people  into  the  civil  service?   Are   the

attrition rates manageable?  What is more important  is:  are

we  getting people with good public service attitude into the

civil  service  since  the changes  instituted  at  the  last

revision?   Is the civil service showing dividend  in  having

made   further  progress  by  attracting  good  people   into

Government?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, we have to ask ourselves whether

a  better  civil service is a good insurance for the  working

class Singaporeans.  It is very important for Singaporeans to

examine  this.  I must say that it is very important, looking

at  the Hong Kong context and many other countries nearer our

region,  that when we cannot attract honest and  good  people

into  Government, ultimately even the poor  has  to  pay  the

price.   Many of the poor, the working class, are paying  the

price  for  having  incompetent people in Government  and  we

should not let this happen in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the salary revision proposed by the

Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in the past, civil servants gave  people  the

typical  impression that they were eating from an "iron  rice

bowl" that could not be broken, and the senior Administrative

Officers were holding  "golden rice bowls".  Today,  when  we

debate on the revision of the salaries of civil servants,  is

this  an  implication that more "iron rice  bowls"  would  be

turning into "golden rice bowls"?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the major reforms to the civil service in

recent years, with all the privatisation and corporatisation,

we  will  find that the various personnel incentive  policies

given to the civil service are gradually approaching those in

the  private sector. This is inevitable.  The main reason is,

in  this  era of globalisation and new economy, not only  the

various  countries  are  competing for  talents,  the  public

sector  and the private sector are also competing for talents

and  brainpower.   The Government must ensure that the  civil

servants, who are charged with the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



extremely    heavy   responsibility   of   formulating    and

implementing  public policies, are of the best calibre.  They

must  be  better than those personnel in the private  sector.

In  order  to  attain this fundamental condition,  these  top

civil   servants  must   be  rewarded  according   to   their

performance and even be remunerated substantially. Just  now,

DPM Lee mentioned that the PSL job cannot be permanent.  They

can   only  hold  the  office  for  10  years.   This  is   a

breakthrough.   It  is a compromise between  the  "iron  rice

bowl"  system and the high remuneration policy.   Perhaps  we

should  change  the title of "Permanent Secretary",  lest  it

gives  people  the  impression that the office  of  permanent

secretary   is so permanent that they continue  to  hold  the

office forever.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore want to have a good Government,

one  that is of high integrity, one that is honest.  As such,

in   1994  when  Parliament  debated  the  salaries  for  the

Ministers,  our  emphasis  was on "Competitive  Salaries  for

Competent and Honest Government".  I feel that even  in  this

new  economy  of  today,  this principle  remains  unchanged.

Today, as we re-debate this issue, DPM Lee introduced a  more

practical  and relevant formula.  As the Ministers'  salaries

are  equated  to the 206th and 367th ranking  among  the  top

earners in the private sector, I would be grateful if DPM Lee

could enlighten us as to what professions these corresponding

personnel  in  the  private sector come from.    If  the  top

management  staff from more professions and more corporations

are drawing this level of salaries, then our people will have

a better understanding and will be more willing to accept it.

Our Ministers would have no difficulty handling the types  of

jobs,  and  there  is  no  reason  why  they  should  not  be

remunerated  as well as the chief executive officers  in  the

private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this principle, we should also want to "cherish our

talents,  value  our talents and cultivate our talents".   We

want  not only a honest and far-sighted Government, but  also

capable  and efficient civil servants.  These are the  wishes

of the people of Singapore.  We are fortunate to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



have  both  a  good  Government and a  very  efficient  civil

service.  This is indeed most commendable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, in a certain country, although the central

government has absolute power, the local government officials

do  not  observe the rules as they are too far away from  the

controlling authority.  The officials collude with  the  rich

businessmen and the people are the ones who suffer.  The many

excellent  policies of the government cannot  be  effectively

implemented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another country, there is a perfect civil service

system.  The civil service is stronger and more powerful than

the  government.  The government is at the mercy of the civil

servants, and is entangled by money politics.  Likewise,  the

people suffer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, although we have a team of highly

efficient  civil  servants, there are  times  when  too  much

emphasis  is placed on efficiency at the expense of humanity.

They  have sacrificed the "human touch".   As such, while   I

support   paying good civil servants handsomely, I also  urge

the  Government to strongly promote the plan  to  send  civil

servants  to  the community to feel the pulse of the  ground.

They  must touch the ground, so that they can understand  the

feelings  of  the people.  In implementing its policies,  the

People's Action Party Government should make the people  feel

that  the  action is for the good of the people. Touch  their

hearts.   This  is what we call the "heartware".   Under  the

system  of  the new economy, the income gap between  the  top

earners  and the low-income group tends to become  wider  and

wider.    This  is  inevitable.   We  must  let  the   people

understand  that  for  all the policies  of  the  Government,

interest of the people is always the  prime consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this aspect, I wish to commend the performance of the

CPF  Board.   According to a report of Lianhe Zaobao  on  5th

April,  some 7,000  senior citizens, influenced by a  certain

rumour, rushed to the CPF Board to collect $250  because they

were under

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



the impression that they might not get the money if they were

to  go  there late. The staff from CPF Board manifested their

care  and concern for these old folks.  They not only saw  to

it  that these old people get the money immediately, but also

deployed extra helpers to move some chairs over for these old

people  to  sit  on and treated them very  well.   They  have

certainly put to full play the well-intentioned policy of the

Government  in a most vivid manner.  Otherwise, even  a  good

policy can turn out to be one detested by the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Service Improvement Unit appointed by Prime Minister

Goh  Chok  Tong  has  been  actively monitoring  the  service

standard  of the various Government departments, and proposed

many  people-friendly  services.   Being  a  member  of   the

monitoring unit, I am personally  aware of  many efforts  put

in  by  the  civil  service in this aspect always  with   the

interest of the people at heart.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While supporting the revision of salaries for civil

servants, I would also urge the Government not to forget  the

workers who may be drop-outs in our new economic system.   We

know  that  skill  upgrading is the  best  security  for  our

workers.   However,  many  older  workers   have   difficulty

upgrading  their  skills.  I hope that our  Government  would

review the various policies, so as  to be more focused on how

to  help  these workers who cannot keep pace with  the  rapid

changes  in  our economic system, in order that  these  older

workers could also have a stake in our prosperity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore generally understand and accept

the  principle  of  "competitive salaries for  competent  and

honest Government".  The workers of Singapore also understand

that  without  a  good Government and highly efficient  civil

servants,  we will not be able to attract foreign investments

and create job opportunities for our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, I went with a group of trade unionists to a

neighbouring country to attend a conference. While waiting in

the  holding room to board the aeroplane, I saw  a  group  of

labourers from that country who came to Singapore illegally

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



to  work, and had to be repatriated after being found out  by

the  authority.  Our workers understand  that if  we  do  not

have a good Government and good civil servants, they may face

the  same  predicament.  However, many workers,  particularly

those in the middle and lower income group, are perplexed  as

to  why many charges are being adjusted upwards before  their

wages  are adjusted and their CPF contributions are not fully

restored.   With the revision of salaries of civil  servants,

will it bring about another round of high-salary war when the

private sector boosts up its offers in order to lure the best

talents to its fold?  I hope that the Government will monitor

closely  the  development in this  aspect,  as  well  as  the

feelings of the people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  have heard the Deputy Prime Minister speak  on  why

civil  servants are to get more pay, and Ministers too.   But

after  all  the adjustments have been made, the  salaries  of

civil  servants  and  Ministers will  still  lag  behind  top

private sector incomes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people still ask why there is a need to peg the

salaries  of  senior  civil servants  and  Ministers  to  the

private sector.  But if we want good quality staff and people

in the Government, we have to pay the market salary or almost

near  market rates.  Senior civil servants play an  important

role  in  the  running of the country.  Ministers  have  even

heavier  responsibilities.  The decisions taken by  Ministers

have far-reaching implications, politically, economically and

socially.   With a good political leadership,  Singapore  has

achieved tremendous progress over the years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just look at the GDP for the last few years or when we

have  attained self-government.  At the current  prices,  the

GDP  in  1959  was $2 billion.  In 1969, it  went  up  to  $5

billion; $20.5 billion in 1979; $58 billion in 1989; and $144

billion  in 1999.  This means that from 1959 to 1999 the  GDP

has  grown 71 times, or in percentage terms, 7,100 per  cent!

This is not a small increase.  It is not a surprise that some

people think the success of Singapore is a miracle.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How has this been achieved? We have often heard of the

media hype about Singapore's economic miracle.  The truth  is

that  our economy has grown because Singaporeans as a  people

have  worked  together.  The Government is the one  that  has

brought  about  this  economic growth.   The  Government  has

brought in the confidence.  The data of the GDP that  I  have

tabled  before you are the achievement that has been  brought

about  by  the  Government  which  has  led  us  even  during

turbulent  times.   It is not only the economic  aspect.   We

also  have  political stability because we have a  Government

that is sensitive to matters in a multi-racial, multi-lingual

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We enjoy industrial harmony because our unions work

together,  and  not in conflict with employers.   Unions  and

employers  are  both  accepted by the  Government  as  social

partners.   There  are  not  many countries  that  have  this

collaborative  system  in  which  we  have  achieved.    Many

countries are trying to develop this partnership, which shows

that  the  benefits of such collaboration which we have  been

enjoying  are  recognised.  This cannot be  achieved  if  our

Government  does not have an open mind or has not  encouraged

such   cooperation   or   collaboration.    Therefore,   this

underlines the importance of good leadership.  As  a  result,

we  have  been  able to maintain social cohesion.   Over  the

years,  we have been able to put the social safety  net  that

has  provided the minimum standard of protection for society.

Public   housing,  education  and  health  care  are  heavily

subsidised.  So is  transportation.  Other than that, we have

also the asset enhancement scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a good government, we may not have good

governance.  Without a good government, it is impossible  for

Singapore  to  achieve  this level  of  social  and  economic

development.  Without a good government and civil service, we

cannot maintain this quality of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a trade unionist and also a former journalist, I have

visited many countries, rich, poor; big and small.  Generally

what  I  have noticed is that good governance is led by  good

government and it has helped

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



in the economic growth and social development of the country.

The reverse is true.  Here we have seen how the political and

economic structure may be demolished when a government closes

one  eye  on  corrupt practices or the leaders of  government

themselves are corrupt.  It does not happen in Singapore  and

we should not allow such things to happen in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in order to maintain good leadership in the

Government, our community must be prepared to pay  a  premium

to  attract  good  talent and high-calibre people  to  be  in

Government or in the civil service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not surprised at reading the report of the

Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) based in  Hong

Kong  recently.  According to PERC, the Singapore  Government

emerged tops among Asian governments for its effectiveness in

economic policies.  Singapore is also top in the banking  and

legal  systems.  Expatriates feel happy to work in Singapore.

It  clearly  shows that the Singapore Government has  brought

about a good life for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we be reluctant in giving this reward to the

leaders  of Government and senior civil servants?  I  do  not

believe  so.   If  we compare what has been  enjoyed  by  the

community with the salary scales that have been suggested  by

the  Deputy Prime Minister, it is not too much.  Would higher

salaries  for  senior  civil  servants  or  political  office

holders create a wider income gap in Singapore?  I think not.

Therefore, I support the Deputy Prime Minister's statement to

upgrade  the  quality  of leadership in  the  civil  service.

However,  this does not mean that we are not concerned  about

the  income  disparity which is a debatable  issue  recently.

Although  we  cannot  stop  this widening  income  gap  in  a

developing  economy, especially so in a KBE, we should  avoid

social  tension  as  a result of this income  gap.   We  must

always  assist the lower income group to upgrade  themselves,

to have good skills and a higher and stable income.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, I think people would not question the

salaries  of  Ministers or senior civil  servants.   But  the

people want to know if the Government would continue to  care

for  their  welfare.  Every citizen is important to  us  all,

whether  he  is  the  poor or rich;  the  educated  or  less-educated; or has skill or without skills.  We should help the

children  of  every  family to achieve the highest  education

according  to  their  ability.  We  are  fortunate  that  the

meritocractic  system  that is in  place  always  allows  the

children  of  the  poor  families  to  move  upward   through

education.  So no one needs to feel that they are caught in a

poverty   trap.   In  Singapore,  there  are   many   schemes

implemented  by  the  Government to assist  the  unfortunate.

When  we  have budget surpluses, the Government tops  up  the

CPF.  The grassroots bodies and charities also help the poor.

Trade  unions  also render their assistance.   On  the  union

front,  each year, the labour movement gives away $1  million

to  assist  the  children from poor families  in  educational

scholarships and bursaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government will continue to assist voluntary

organisations  and  the  trade  unions  so  that  they  could

continue to assist the lower income groups and also to

ensure  that  inflation is maintained at a  low  level.   The

Government  should  help these bodies  to  assist  them  face

inflation and the challenges of a knowledge-based economy  by

upgrading their skills so that they will be able to  maintain

and  have a stable job.  We are able to do all this and  also

to  avoid  adverse  social consequences if  we  have  a  good

government and a good civil service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal of the Deputy Prime Minister in this area

is good and I support it.  My hope is, as mentioned by Mr Lim

Boon  Heng earlier, that people should not be envious of this

situation  by  just  looking at the figures  that  have  been

proposed  for  the  senior civil servants and  the  political

leaders.   We should consider their responsibilities,  duties

and contributions and what they have to do to lead the people

of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the Deputy Prime Minister's

proposal.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Thank you, Mr

Speaker, Sir, for letting me join in this debate.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.31 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this mechanism in place about five years ago to pay

civil  servants and political appointees is now due for  some

review  and,  as  mentioned just  now  by  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister,  giving us some refinements and adjustments,  which

are  to  be welcomed.  First, in particular, I am very  happy

that there is a widening of this group of the top end of  the

income  earners to be included in this pegging  and  also  to

take  the  median as the average, instead of  just  a  simple

average.   I  would  like  to ask,  together  with  the  view

expressed by the previous speaker, Mr Seng, that in the light

of  this new pegging of the rate, at 2/3 of M48 plus the  50%

discount and 12% increase, at the 367th position of the  high

income  scale, what is the equivalent range of income earners

in this position?  What kind of people, what profession, what

category of employment do they belong to?  It would  be  good

if  the  DPM  can give us some information on this  range  of

income  earners  so  that  we can compare  and  see  how  our

Ministers  and civil servants are paid in relation  to  these

income earners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this new salary adjustment for civil servants,

two  particular groups of people would be looking at it  from

different  views.   One is the higher income  earners  -  the

professionals,  managers,  owners of  shares,  investors  and

enterprises - who are looking at it from one view.  And  then

the other view is really the ordinary man in the street.   It

is  to  be expected that these two views are quite different.

To  the  internationally mobile, the managerial, professional

type   with   professional  qualifications   and   managerial

competency  working  in  large  business  organisations,  the

figures  are  not  so  intriguing.  It  would  of  course  be

correlated  to the level of performance and reward.   And  in

the  high  level  of professional earnings and  international

MNCs'  top executive earnings, these figures are not  out  of

the realm, quite in the ordinary.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the point raised by one previous Member of

Parliament, Mr Inderjit Singh, about this hazard part of  the

salary  reward,  perhaps  the DPM could  clarify  at  another

occasion whether this hazard part is really taken care of  in

the performance-related part of the salary scale.  I believe,

if  I  am  not mistaken, that this performance is  almost  at

about  40%  of the salary.  So there is really quite  a  risk

part of the salary reward in this performance-related factor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a shareholder or stakeholder in a company were to

employ a staff or manager to run the corporation, it would be

quite rational for him to hire the best team who can deliver.

And  modern  governments and public services  really  require

knowledge,  skills  and  competency to  match  those  in  the

private  sector.  That is how the world is becoming more  and

more  global  and governments and business organisations  are

relating to each other more and more.  Can you imagine public

servants  in  the Ministry of Communications and  Information

Technology  or the Info-communications Development  Authority

who  are  not  able  to  match the  private  sector  business

executives,  the group that they deal with  every  day?   The

public  servants  would  be led around  in  circle  by  these

private  sector  business executives, doing no  good  to  the

public  interest.  And leaders of the Government of Singapore

must  also  deal  with many of the issues  impacting  on  our

stability,    economic   growth,   investments,   employment,

training,  retraining, rising standards of living  and  homes

for the people. These issues that the Government of Singapore

has tackled are proven.  The records speak for themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another good example was, what many Members of

Parliament have just now brought forward, how we came out  of

this  Asian  financial crisis with relatively little  damage.

If  you  were  to look at the performance of governments  all

across the world and see how a country came out of this  very

severe financial crisis with very little damage, and in  fact

much  strengthened,  then I can see that  there  is  a  great

justification to reward our civil servants.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having this mechanism in place is not really to just

reward   present  executives  or  public  servants   in   the

Government,  it  is really to attract top  flight  people  in

future  to join the Government as well as of course to retain

them.   And in Singapore, politics is not about the  politics

of  envy, but of governance to ensure growth, employment  for

50,000  entrants  to the labour market each year  and  rising

expectations  from an increasingly more knowledgable  working

population.   So  the demands are not really  so  simple  and

easy.   Competition  is  a fact of life  in  this  globalised

economy  and we are part and parcel of this.  We are  in  the

centre of it.  There is no choice.  MNCs compete and pay  for

human   resource,  not  manpower.   They  bring  these  human

resource talents from everywhere to anywhere, where they  can

maximise  their  returns  on their  business.   And  in  this

globalised economy, everyone is in competition in the market.

It  is world wide and everywhere, and we cannot run away from

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition for foreign investment is also world wide.

Countries  engage in this to generate growth  and  employment

opportunities    for   these   countries.    Investors    and

shareholders  want the best return.  Talents  also  want  the

best  reward.  So paying talent his worth ensures  worthwhile

value  performance.  However, this competition for investible

resource  is  only half the picture.  The other half  of  the

story  is what we have been talking about for some months  in

Singapore,  ie, to encourage entrepreneurship and  growth  in

our  economy, income and jobs for the local economy.  But  we

must realise this.  The same yardsticks apply - remuneration,

stock options for the local economy.  And what we can see  in

this  is  that the new global economy paradigm really  values

mobility.   Capital moves instantaneously to any place  which

gives its maximal return, even if briefly.  People move  from

where  they have been born to where their talent of worth  is

given  expression across national boundaries.  And we  cannot

prevent  that from happening in Singapore.  People come  here

to  work because employers find it worthwhile to employ them.

Singaporeans

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>



venture overseas because they are valued and are engaged with

the  special  skills and competitiveness and are  paid  their

worth  for  this.   We  cannot have  one  set  of  evaluation

criteria for people in the private sector and another set for

the Government public sector.  We are kidding ourselves if we

do,  particularly so in Singapore.  I have just read a report

yesterday.  The Singapore Government is again voted the least

corrupt in this index.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is running the Government the same as running a

corporation?   My view is that modern government has  changed

so  much because of technology, and public demands are almost

as  fickle  as  consumer  demands.   And  the  Government  of

Singapore is quite unique in this respect.  It owns  and  has

many GLCs.  I believe the contribution or size of our GLCs in

the  total  economy  is  of  very substantial  figures  which

operate  in the private sector.  When the Government servants

are  seconded for a term or two in the private sector in  the

GLCs  for exposure, as they do now, under this new scheme  to

train  and  expose  our public servants, can  one  imagine  a

senior  civil servant who, by his years of achievements  from

school  to  adult work, has to accept and work with  a  lower

salary  than  a  private  sector  senior  executive?   It  is

unrealistic, especially if he has to undertake more important

assignments  for the company or the shareholder  who  is  the

Government of Singapore.  How much more unrealistic to expect

the  bosses of these senior civil servants, the Ministers and

the office holders to be paid less than these executives?  So

there   must   be   a  scale  of  value  and   a   scope   of

responsibilities to jobs,  we must not be afraid to attach to

men  holding  these offices to safeguard our livelihood,  our

homes, our lives and our national well-being.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours is an upward mobile society. Just now, the

Secretary-General of the NTUC mentioned this point about  how

he  was so impressed by the lady who is working in SATS going

to  Canada  to  see her son who is studying to be  a  doctor.

There  are  many  examples of such cases in  Singapore  where

parents   and  children really move up very fast  because  of

their achievements.  And I can give another example.  In

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



Queenstown where I am representing  -  Queenstown is an  area

with  very  old  three-room flats  -  I have come  across  an

ordinary  police  staff with two children, one  graduated  at

Harvard,  another one graduated at Oxford, both on Government

scholarships.  It is quite unheard of anywhere in the  world.

But  our  society allows such people to come out and move  up

across the social structure by means of their achievement and

capability.  I hope the Singapore Government will make a  re-commitment to the mobility and flexibility in our society for

people to achieve and  maximise their potential.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not short-change our people who are in the

public  service by restricting their rewards and the  way  in

which  they can generate the income and wealth for their  own

families,  expecting  everything  will  fall  in   place   by

themselves.   Things may well fall apart.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to address the issue of income gap which

many  people  have been talking about.  The issue  of  salary

review  and adjustments for civil servants and Ministers  and

office  holders  really  should not  be  mixed  up  with  the

discussion  on  income gap.  And I perfectly share  the  view

expressed by Mr Lim Boon Heng that the income gap will not be

getting closer when there is economic growth.  In fact,  this

is a very common phenomenon.  Economic development economists

have   been  studying  this.   Whenever  there  is  sustained

economic  growth, income gap widens.  The only  countries  in

the  world  where  income  gap  is  narrowing  are  the  poor

countries getting poorer.  The gap is completely closed  when

everybody  earns  the  same  income.   Proponents   of   this

phenomenon remind me of some defunct ideology that  has  been

proven not to work.  The proper concern is really to level up

the  low  income  households, not to worry about  the  income

inequality  gap,  or to close it.  And this levelling  up  of

income households can be done by an appropriate wage increase

in  competition  in  the market and by  widening  our  social

safety  net infrastructure which the Government of  Singapore

has  been  adequately  providing.   But  the  Government,   I

encourage, should

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>



take  more efforts to examine these areas where there can  be

more  safeguards, more opportunities to allow for access  for

our  workers  to  good  public  health,  public  housing  and

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers should ask whether their income and employment

opportunities have improved over the past few years,  whether

their  companies have done better as a result of  appropriate

remedial policies of the Government in the wake of this Asian

financial crisis and the re-emergence of competition from the

neighbouring  countries especially with  a  new,  much  lower

exchange  rate  regime in these countries.  They  are  really

giving  Singapore  the  real  competition,  unless  we   move

ourselves  up  into  higher technology end.   And  Government

should respond by ensuring that there is room in society  for

everyone  to  be  upward mobile by education,  training,  re-training, skills acquisition, giving them equal opportunities

and  access to all levels of society by dint of their success

and achievements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Government for re-commitment for

maximising  the  potential of everyone  throughout  his  work

life,   to  have  the  necessary  skills,  preparations   and

opportunities  to stay employable, to have affordable  access

to  health,  education and housing.   And  I  ask  my  fellow

Singapore workers to be concerned about this rather  than  to

be concerned about closing the income gap.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government to re-dedicate ourselves to this

precept  of  Singapore 21 where every Singaporean matters  to

enable everyone to maximise and achieve his potential.  That,

to  me,  is a very tall order and I say let us hire the  best

people for the job.

<br><br><!-- Mr K. Shanmugam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. Shanmugam (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I have always spoken

in  support  of  pay rises for Ministers and  civil  servants

strongly, and I do so again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many will welcome or at least not question the rises for

civil  servants.   However, the focus will be  on  Ministers'

salary  rises.  This is a hot topic and has always  been  so.

On  this  topic,  there is really only one question:   do  we

accept

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>



that Ministers' salary should be referenced to top earners in

the private sector?  The answer is really a no-brainer.  This

is not a new point.  It was established in 1994 when salaries

were  linked  to  top  incomes outside.   But  despite  this,

questions  will again be asked when Ministers'  salaries  are

increased.  It is these three common questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two are questions of principle and the third

is the question of detail. The first question of principle is

a  suggestion by some that, in absolute terms, Ministers  are

already  earning  top  salaries and  that,  therefore,  their

salaries  should  not be increased further.  This  suggestion

overlooks a basic point.  That is the point about relativity.

Regardless  of actual numbers, can we have too  large  a  gap

between  public and private sector incomes?  If  there  is  a

large gap, then do we honestly expect to get the best for the

top  public sector?  In these matters, one has to  be  honest

and  not hypocritical.  We want the most talented in Cabinet.

Why not pay them what they would get outside?  $34 million is

cheap  to  pay  for  a corrupt-free, top quality  Government.

Look  around  in  both  developed  countries  and  developing

countries  and  see  what  happens  when  people  stinge   on

Government salaries.  You do not want your Ministers who take

favours  from private sector people to take free holidays  or

stay in their hotels, as has happened in developed countries.

That cheapens the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us pose the question another way. If we approach

the  question  de  novo and without political  consideration,

would  we  only  rank  that  a Minister's  job  as  being  as

important as that of the 200 top earners outside?  Should  we

not have people in the top 50, in fact, the top 20, and if we

have  such people in the Cabinet, is it then fair to pay them

what  the  200  earners outside earn?  Yet,  with  all  these

revisions, that is what the proposal aims at, and even  that,

it  will  only  be  achieved in the year 2003.   Any  private

organisation that does that will simply lose their talent and

will end up as a secondary organisation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, for the first question, the focus should not

be  on  absolute numbers.  It should be on relative  linkage.

Singaporeans have to realise that as a result of the  growing

economy, incomes have indeed risen and yes, there is a  large

income  gap.  It  is a fact. At the top, our  people  in  the

private   sector  command  world-class  income.   We   cannot

realistically pay our Ministers any less.  What  we  have  to

hope  for is that over time, the right policies and education

will  help a much larger proportion of the population to reap

the full benefits of becoming a world-class economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the second question that is often

asked.  Even among those who accept the principle that  there

should  be  a  linkage  between  public  and  private  sector

salaries, the question that is often asked is whether we  do,

in  fact,  have Ministers who command these incomes  outside.

It  is  a sensitive question but it misses the central  point

which  we  are  discussing now. The  point  of  principle  is

whether  we  accept  that  the Ministers'  salaries,  without

reference  to individuals, should be at least equal  to  what

the 200 earners outside earn, having regard to the importance

of  the  job  and the pressures of the job. If we agree  with

that  principle, then the salaries should be adjusted to that

scale.  It does not matter whether specific individuals,  who

are  Ministers,  would  be  able to  command  those  salaries

outside.   That  is  a systemic issue.  We  should  agree  on

principles    and   not   let   arguments   over   individual

personalities dictate the principles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On detail, the question that is often asked is, in the

private  sector, the list of individuals who are top  earners

may  change  from  year  to  year.   By  linking  ministerial

salaries  only  to  incomes,  the  question  is  whether  the

ministerial salaries are protected from the vagaries  of  the

marketplace which may affect top private sector earners,  and

whether  over time, the Ministers would, in fact,  earn  much

more than any specific individual outside.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, that question overlooks a central principle

whether there should be a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



linkage  between  a  Minister's job  and  his  specific  rank

outside.  It does not matter who the individuals are, whether

in  the  public or private sector. The salary of  a  Minister

should  be  linked to a range in the private  sector  because

that  is  what  the  Minister's  job  is  worth.   Then   the

Government  should  ensure  that its  Ministers  are  of  the

calibre  to  command  such  incomes,  whether  they  are   in

Government  or  out of Government.  It is  like  saying  what

salary will you pay a CEO of a major bank.  There will  be  a

base  which  will be high, regardless of the individual,  but

specific individuals may get differing bonuses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after all these revisions, frankly, the ministerial

salaries,  are still not competitive. The world  outside  has

changed and salaries are increasing outside and they are only

part  of  the picture. The investment opportunities that  are

available  to  private sector professionals  are  simply  not

available  to Ministers.  With the changing environment,  the

best outside can make a vast fortune in the new economy which

will make these ministerial salaries appear loose change.  Do

we  or  do we not believe that at least some of our Ministers

can make that kind of money if they went outside?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister's job is a thankless job if he looks at it

as   a   job.   The  pressures,  the  public  scrutiny,   the

imponderables are such that you have to really approach it as

a calling rather than as a job.  And this country, as most of

the  countries  now, is competing at an increasingly  complex

environment and without natural resources and with  only  our

people to go by, good stewardship is now at a premium and  it

is all the more important that we get the best.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me end by saying this. I have said it before

but  I strongly believe it and will repeat it.   When someone

suitable is identified and is asked to become a Minister, you

only want him to ask himself the following three questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Am I intellectually good enough?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Can I do the job?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Do I want to do the job?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not want him to ask a fourth question: can I

afford it?  If that question is asked, we have failed.   Sir,

I support the changes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  my  Parliamentary colleagues have brought  up  some

very important points in support of the Ministerial Statement

made by Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add a few points. Firstly, on CPF. In

1997/1998,  when  we were facing the Asian financial  crisis,

our  workers cooperated with the Government.   They  accepted

the Government's proposal to cut their CPF benefits by 10% in

the employer's CPF contribution.  Today, we are proposing  to

increase the salaries of our Ministers and civil servants  on

the premise that the economy has recovered.  On this point, I

would like to ask whether the Government has a specific time-table for this 10% cut in the employer's CPF contribution  to

be fully restored.  The economy has recovered and this is the

time we should seriously consider restoring the cut in CPF to

our workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, today, we announce the rise in the pay for our

civil  servants.  Tomorrow, this  will  be  reported  in  the

newspapers.  The  response from the market  is  usually  very

fast.  Even  before these announcements were made,  transport

charges,  PUB  charges,  taxi fares  have  already  gone  up.

Tomorrow, with the report of pay rise in the newspapers,  the

various  retail  outlets and the hawkers  will  spontaneously

jack up their prices.  As such,  I am worried that the salary

increase for civil servants in Divisions III and IV  may  not

be  able  to  match the price hike outside.   Although  their

salaries  have gone up, their standard of living may actually

take  a downturn instead.  I feel that for the civil servants

in  the  lower-income group, the increase in  their  salaries

should  not be computed in terms of  percentage points.   For

those  with  a salary of $10,000, a 10% increase  would  have

been $1,000.  But for those earning $1,000, 10% is only $100.

They  pay  the same 70 cents for the same cup of coffee.   We

should  give  them the increase in real terms  so  that  they

enjoy a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



real  raise in their income.  Although we may not be able  to

close  the gap between the high earners and the low  earners,

we should at least try to give the low earners a better deal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the principle for pegging the Ministers'

salaries to the top earners in the private sector.  In  1994,

it was pegged to the top 24 earners and today it is pegged to

the top 48 earners. This is an improvement.  But for those in

the private sector, those who are the top earners such as the

CEO  and  the  senior managers, they do not have security  in

their  work.  This year, they may have a high  pay  but  next

year, they may not get the same pay. So when we are pegged to

the  top  48  earners, they are actually a different  lot  of

people from year to year.  So next year, we may be looking at

another  group  of  people in the top earning  bracket.  Some

members  of  the  public feel that this is not  a  very  fair

method.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example. There are two aeroplanes

taking  off at the same time.  One aeroplane 'P' representing

the  public  sector and the other aeroplane 'M'  representing

the Ministers.  The two aeroplanes take off at the same time.

After  some  time, aeroplane 'P' has to land to  refuel,  but

aeroplane  'M' can have a refuel in mid-air and it  does  not

need  to  land for refuelling.  So in the long run, aeroplane

'M'  would  have gone faster and further away than  aeroplane

`P".   I  feel that we should peg to the same group of people

on  a long-term basis, rather than  changing every year.   In

this way, it would be fairer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our income varies according to our economic progress.

If  the  economy has gone up, then everyone will enjoy higher

income,  and  if the economy is not doing well,   the  income

will go down. It applies to everyone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, in this year's Budget, no mention was made of

this  proposed  increase in pay for our Ministers  and  civil

servants.   Since  this pay rise will take effect  from  July

this year, which is within the current fiscal year, will  the

increase to the civil servants' salaries affect the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



service  that will be provided to the members of the  public,

eg,   in  the  Ministry  of  Health,  the  Ministry  of   the

Environment  or  the Ministry of National Development?   Will

the  service quality be affected because they have  to  spend

more  money  to  pay  for the higher salaries  of  the  civil

servants?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, I am worried about those who are unemployed.

In 1997-1998, because of the financial crisis, quite a lot of

people   were  retrenched.   Many  people  could   not   find

alternative  jobs, particularly those who do  not  have  good

skills  or those who are more elderly.  They have tried  very

hard to apply for new jobs, but the success rate is very low,

mainly  because they are older.  They may be in their 40s  or

50s  or  they do not possess computer or special skills,  and

they are unable to secure new jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years have since passed. Even if they have some

savings, they would most probably have been used up  by  now.

Now  they  face  this problem of not having enough  money  to

support  themselves  and  their  families.   While   we   are

proposing pay rise to our civil servants, we should also take

the  plight of these people into consideration, and show some

kind of special concern for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have talked a lot about training and retraining. But

these training and retraining programmes do not benefit  them

physically unless they can have a job with income to  support

themselves  and their families.  First of all, the Government

should  have an overall plan to look after these  people  who

are  presently unemployed and to give them some free training

and  job  opportunities so that these  workers  who  are  now

unemployed would be able to find jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support what Minister Lim Boon Heng has said. We

must  make sure that everybody is employed.  The first  thing

is  to  have  a  job.  Salary comes second.   We  should  not

compare ourselves with others.  If you compare yourself  with

others, you will only be frustrated.  So long as you can find

a  job to support your family,   high pay or low pay does not

matter so much.  In fact, whether the pay is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



high  or low is a very subjective point.  One important thing

is  that  we must make sure that everyone has a job, so  that

his family can have food to eat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the wage increase

which was announced today is a good thing, in the sense  that

it   is   in   line   with  the  National   Wages   Council's

recommendation  which  actually  gives  recognition  to   the

sacrifices  of workers during the recession. The other  thing

is that it keeps faith  -  there is reward for sacrifices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I also accept the economic reality

that  you have to pay high salaries to attract and retain   - and the word used  -  talent.   But instead of using the word

"talent", I would prefer "people with the appropriate  skills

and  abilities" that can meet the needs for the work they do.

To  pay people their worth is definitely acceptable.  But  in

trying  to solve one set of problems, we must also  be  aware

that  sometimes we create other problems, and there are  also

concerns.  We also have to be aware of what the concerns  and

problems are, and try to resolve them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own mind, sitting there and listening, I can think

of  three  basic concerns which many people have.  The  first

one  is: who pays for the increases?  There are going  to  be

increases and it has to be paid.  The normal thing to ask is:

will  it  result  in  increases in  fees  and  in  Government

charges?  And a lot of costs of living are going up.  Will it

be more expensive for ordinary citizens of this country?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is: how do we measure talent? Who are

the  talents  -  the right people with the right skills?   We

bring in people with ability.  We talk about market.  We talk

about  efficiency.  And they are very high in IQ.  They write

good  papers and have good ideas.  But there is also  another

important  element, which is the feel for  the  people.   The

emotional  quotient  of  our  top  civil  servants  is   also

important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third thing is that, even at Question Time the

discussion and the debate were that it seems to be  that  the

demand for the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



skills  of  a few people at the top are going up.  Therefore,

their earnings are spiralling upwards, and they are going  up

and  up.  There are people at the lower level whose jobs  are

getting casualised, jobs are being outsourced and there is  a

spiral  downwards,  and the net result is  that  the  gap  is

getting  bigger and bigger. We heard that in economic  terms,

this  widening gap is inevitable.  But is this  socially  and

morally  acceptable?  Will it result in a change  of  values?

Are we only measuring efficiency in terms of dollars, and  in

terms  of  money?  I reflect on this and I think one  of  the

answers to some of these questions can be found in history.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask whether history can teach us some

things,  and  a  few things strike me.  One  is,  in  France,

during   the  time  of  Louis  XVI,  they  had  great  income

disparity.  When the Queen was told that the ordinary  people

did  not  have  bread, she said, "Give them cake!"   The  net

result was the French Revolution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;England, at the same time, was also in a similar

situation, but they did not have a revolution.  There were  a

lot  of  poor people.  Income gaps were very wide and leaders

were  out of touch.  I read somewhere that one of the reasons

why there was no revolution in England was attributed to just

one  man  who went from town to town, village to village,  on

horseback.   His name was John Wesley.  He basically  gave  a

lot  of  ordinary people hope  -  hope beyond their difficult

circumstances.   He did not just preach and  talk  about  the

world to come, but he also converted many of his ideals  into

practical help, in the sense that he built schools; he housed

people  who were in difficulty; he helped the poor;  he  gave

practical assistance, built orphanages and he helped.  At the

end  of the day, the ordinary working people in England  were

motivated to work hard, to save more, to earn more  and  also

from  their  earnings,  to give back  more,  and  the  social

standard  of living changed.  And that was a bit of a  social

revolution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing that comes to mind is that at the

beginning  of  the 20th century and at the end  of  the  19th

century, 1% of the US population owned 45% of the national

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>



wealth.   They had all the ingredients for a great revolution

or  uprising, but it did not take place.  Europe  had  lesser

differentials  but  they  had  revolutions   -   the  Russian

revolution and the Great War.  Why  did it not happen in  the

US but happened in Europe?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sit back and I think that one of the reasons is that

in  the  United  States, everybody had opportunities  through

education.   Europe was very class divided.  And one  of  the

lessons  that I learned and one of the key things is that  we

also  need  social  consciousness.  We  cannot  have  a  good

society  whereby people who are eligible and who are entitled

to  get  their worth is paid less than their worth.  I  think

people must get their worth.  But the people who get the high

pay,  who earn well, must also realise that they have to give

back  something  to society.  And there are also  people  who

have lesser abilities, lesser talent than them, and they have

to  be supported.  It is not just the creation of wealth  but

it  is also having the right social conditions and stability.

I  think  we must be aware of this.  When it is very  secure,

when  things  are  very smooth, when we  do  not  have  these

problems, many of us will not think about it.  But in  moving

forward  from these events, the difficulties of the  ordinary

workers  who do  find a lot of pressures of cost  of  living,

some  of  them find it very difficult to understand why  some

people  should earn so much more than they could spend.  But,

at  the  same  time,  if  these  people  do  explain  and  we

understand that it is for the overall good, it helps.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing we learn is that everybody should have

opportunities  to  move  up, and  the  best  way  is  through

education.   In the US and in many other places,  the  answer

was  education,  and there must be social mobility.   Because

when you move up the ladder of success,  sometimes the ladder

is  slippery,  you  slip.  But when you fall  there  must  be

sufficient  safety nets.  And along the way in working  life,

the  chance  to  move and upgrade is very  important  in  our

society.  Can we have that?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards social safety nets, I would suggest that we

also  relook  at our social safety nets.  We have  got  basic

safety  nets  of  health,  education,  housing.   These   are

important.   But what is poverty, what is poor, also  changes

the relative values.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when I was young, a lot of homes did not have

a  refrigerator.   The  telephone  was  not  in  every  home.

Television  was  not in every home.  But,  today,  these  are

considered very basic.  The UN says that the poverty line  is

US$1  a  day.   But  in our society, because  our  norms  are

different, the poverty line is also different, and it is also

relative.  If somebody has it, we also want to keep  up  with

the Joneses.  Therefore, we also need to relook at our social

safety nets as well as realise that because there is a lot of

casualisation of labour at the bottom end,  people feel  very

insecure.   We should increase protection for this  group  of

workers, because they do not have the bargaining power or the

skills to earn top wages and they need help.  And on help,  I

accept  that the best form of social security for anybody  is

social  security with dignity, and that is to have  jobs  and

have the pride of being self-reliant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is important that we help our people to

be  self-reliant and have the ability to move up.  Therefore,

the  key  for  the majority of us would be opportunities  and

that  the role of Government beyond economic growth  is  also

social  growth, social cohesion, and cost of living.  And  if

we  do  all  that, then I think we will have  people  in  our

society who are strong.  They get stronger, and we know  that

we  cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong.   The

strong  gets stronger but it is without weakening  the  weak.

If we have the right values, then I accept that we should not

have  the politics of envy but rather the politics of  saying

that "if this is something that everybody can achieve, I  too

have  the  opportunity to get it.  My children can also  have

the opportunity to have it" and therefore everybody wins.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I have no difficulty in accepting

that  anybody,  whether it is Ministers, civil servants,  the

private sector and ordinary workers, who deserves should  get

his fair worth.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



<br>5.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I rise to endorse

the  need  for sustaining a suitably and adequately motivated

public  sector and for retaining talent as well  as  to  make

specific  comments on the changes as outlined by  the  Deputy

Prime Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said by many of my colleagues on the

importance of good and honest Government to our economic  and

social  well being.  So I shall not belabour the point  about

the  adverse  consequences of having less  than  upright  and

incompetent  Government.   Equally  so,  attention  has  been

centred on the fast changing global economy and therefore  on

the  need for a dynamic, responsive and upright public sector

to enable us to cope and position ourselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, the public sector must continue to work

closely   with   the   private  sector,  embracing   economic

challenges together as one single team rather than two camps,

the  administrator, or even worse, the bureaucracy versus the

actual  doers.   Hence, the civil service needs  to  be  more

nimble-footed, more responsive and to be exercising foresight

as a matter of habit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should add here that we do not begin at zero base. We

do  have a civil service that we can justifiably be proud of.

However, the macro competitive landscape is imposing more and

more  demands  on  us.  This has great implications  for  all

levels  and  grades within the civil service  as  it  is  now

incumbent  on every public officer to take ownership  of  and

responsibility for his Ministry's or Department's mission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, as employer, must therefore in turn

ensure  that there is sufficient non-quantitative motivation,

guidance  and  counselling  to  enable  each  public   sector

employee to give of his or her best.  For the ones who  still

tend  to  "maintain the status quo" or hide behind a faceless

bureaucracy, they need to be guided on to individual and team

excellence.   Essentially, this is a change  in  culture  and

mindset.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards this end, the move to highlight and reward

performance  is inevitable and much needed. The  emphasis  on

nurturing  and  preserving credible and competent  leadership

cannot be overstated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is this very spirit of motivating public sector

employees  to  perform at their potential that should  arrest

our  attention.   The  absolute  numbers  and  the  size   of

increases  are,  of course, important and news  worthy.   But

what is more important is that essentially there is a need to

maintain  relativities  and  to  approximate  private  sector

practices, for example, that more will move into the variable

and  less into the fixed.  The sure thing in the form  of  an

iron  rice  bowl,  fixed  increments  and  salaries  is  fast

becoming scarce in the real world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now go on to make comments on the specific

changes to benchmarking and the emphasis on performance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, benchmarking. Two questions are frequently

associated  with  the  construction of  the  benchmark:   How

representative it is and the extent of risk that is embodied.

As  my colleague, Mr Chay, has also pointed out, by enlarging

the  pool  from 24 to 48 professionals and taking the  median

instead  of  the average, the modified benchmark  has  become

more   representative  and  reduces  the  risk  of   outliers

providing an upward bias to the numbers.  However, many  will

still  ask  why 48, not 96, or some other larger number.   In

this  regard,  I think it will be good for the Government  to

explain how the pool size is arrived at.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we note too that the Government recognises that

stock  options can substantially inflate overall compensation

and  has  therefore discounted this in the  benchmark.   Once

again,  is  halving accurate and will future  refinements  be

made to approximate actual proportions in the private sector?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the extent of risk assumption which is also

associated with the emphasis on performance.  Sir, many  will

ask how closely does the revamped compensation scheme for top

leaders

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>



resemble  that  of the private sector.  In other  words,  how

much  risk does a top public sector leader assume in his  job

and  career?  With more going into the variable and less into

the  fixed, the link to performance and overall economic well

being  is  closer.   This is a move to be  applauded  and  it

should not stop here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, as to what would constitute a good performance

measure, for example, using GDP growth as a proxy, there will

always  be the challenge of developing a measure that  has  a

more   direct  correlation  to  work  across  the   different

Ministries.   Otherwise, the lack of differentiation  at  the

individual  level  may  be  a  source  of  unhappiness.   For

companies,  whether  it  is sales or  profitability  targets,

there  is  usually  little ambiguity as they  can  easily  be

translated into individual targets as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, allow me to say that I recognise it is a

difficult  balance to strike between the need to  arrest  the

attrition  of  talent from the public sector and  harmonising

the  changes  with  the  overall wage climate  in  Singapore.

Whilst  it  is clearly necessary to check and debate  on  the

justification  for benchmarking, we have to be  mindful  that

the checking exercise does not become an emotional tussle and

derail  us  in our long term quest to be knowledge intensive.

As  my  colleague, Dr Vasoo, has alluded to, we would  always

have  to  ask  ourselves what the consequences of alternative

actions or the status quo would be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the larger scheme of things, where employment would

increasingly  be  less predictable and less  structured,  the

individual  Singaporean's worth will  increasingly  hinge  on

value  creation  for a fast changing economy  at  his  level.

Essentially, it boils down to having the appropriate attitude

and response regardless of where one works, whether it is  in

the public or private sector.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, I rise to support

the  spirit and principles behind the proposals raised by DPM

Lee today.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raising compensation levels of Ministers and senior

public  servants  has always been an emotive  issue  for  any

country.   Nevertheless, there is a  need  to  reinforce  and

understand the fundamental reasons why it is required at this

particular juncture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is not just an isolated nation in the rising

sea  of global trends facing all economies in the world.  The

effects of globalisation are being felt at the far corners of

the  world.   There is now a world benchmark for talent,  and

not  just a domestic one.  Mobility of people and the  growth

of  opportunities in the international arena have  spawned  a

whole  new level of the ball game in attracting and retaining

talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By many accounts, our Government and civil service have

been   very   successful,  transparent  and  progressive   in

transforming our country and citizens to the top tier in  GNP

per  capita,  in  education matters, health  and  many  other

services.   They  have indeed delivered for  the  nation.   A

hallmark  of  our  success has been the clear  incentives  in

rewarding  dedication, efficiency and  results,  with  market

benchmarks.  This has ensured that some of our very best  and

brightest  continue to serve our country for the  benefit  of

all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the Government and its bureaucracy have been

ranked  tops by many international benchmarks, not least  the

recent  Economist survey on e-Governments  for  which  it  is

stated  that  we have the largest potential in  enabling  the

successful transition of the economy and the nation into  the

new e-millennium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all recognise the lure of the dot.coms and its

ability   to  reward  richly.   Similarly  with  the   rising

prosperity  of the world and enlarged opportunities  for  our

limited  talent pool, the opportunity costs to those who  can

deliver for the nation have risen.  We can never compare  and

compensate  like  for like with the market as  there  is  the

noble  duty  of  public  service  attached  to  the  jobs  in

Government.   However, we can certainly give due  recognition

and reward in as fair and effective a manner as possible.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent PERC report as appeared in the Straits Times

today   ranked  Singapore  tops  for  its  leadership.    Our

Ministers  certainly  deserve  the  recognition.   They  also

deserve  the  adjustments  proposed  in  this  exercise.   In

particular,  I applaud the measures to phase the  adjustments

for  Ministers' salary over a 3-year period as  well  as  the

annual  review  to  better reflect the  fluctuations  in  the

market.   This is indeed a testament to the robust  integrity

of  the  way  in  which we scrutinise and refine  our  system

continuously in the public interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite the logical and rational reasons that had

been  debated  at  length in the past and  to-date  that  the

Government faces in attracting and retaining talent, we still

have to address some of the emotive and pertinent concerns of

our citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to raise a few concerns and seek

clarifications with DPM.  Sir, Singaporeans are  feeling  the

effects  of  the  recent  increase  in  fees  and  rates,  in

transportation,  utilities and other  basic  charges  in  the

economy.   There  is  a  fear that  there  could  be  further

increase  in  fees,  rates and other  charges  as  a  natural

consequence of raising public sector wages.  DPM  has  stated

earlier today that the proposed increases in salary of public

servants arising from this exercise will amount to some  $400

million.   I  would like to ask him if this amount  has  been

provided for in the current budget.  If not, where would  the

expenditure  be funded?  If yes, could we have the  assurance

from   him  that  this  exercise  would  not  lead   to   any

consequential  increases  in rates  and  fees  of  Government

charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timing of the exercise is also a source of concern

for  a large minority of our population who have yet to  feel

any tangible effects of the economic recovery.  These include

families  whose members have suffered retrenchments  or  SMEs

and  small  businesses that are still finding the environment

difficult to successfully operate in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask if the Government has done any

studies  into the potential impact on employment  and  wages,

ie, its

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



impact  on  our economic recovery arising from this exercise.

If  the consequence of benchmarking public sector wages leads

to pressure on the private sector employers to follow suit to

attract  and  retain their own talent by raising wages,  this

may  stifle the nascent and segmented economic recovery  that

we have benefited so far.  Will DPM comment on this concern?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a related note, rising wages increase the opportunity

cost  to relocate and discourage Singaporeans to take on more

entrepreneurial   roles   by  creating   more   "comfortable"

employees in both the public and private sectors.  This seems

to   go   against  the  spirit  of  entrepreneurialship   and

enterprise   that  we  have  been  trying  to  cultivate   so

aggressively in the last one year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater risk averseness and higher opportunity costs in

the  public and private sectors will reduce labour  mobility.

There   may  be  less  incentive  as  a  result  to   exploit

opportunities as fast as we should be.  Would  DPM  therefore

be  able to comment on any expected effects this exercise may

have on slowing the initiative for greater enterprise in  our

economic model, which is essential to our survival in the new

millennium?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the proposal but would like DPM to

address some of the concerns I have raised arising from  this

exercise.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, this is not an easy

matter  to debate.  Salaries of Ministers and civil  servants

are  a  matter of intense public scrutiny.  Public funds  are

involved.   Many  perceive Members of  this  House  as  being

judge, jury and beneficiary and ultimately it is an extremely

emotive issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore glad that the Government has chosen to

adopt  an open and transparent approach to this debate.   One

would  imagine  for  a  matter which  is  fraught  with  such

problems,  the instinct would be to shirk away  from  debate.

But  this Government has not done that and it has placed  all

the facts on the table for Singaporeans to look at openly and

consider.   It is typical of this Government's  style  and  I

welcome it.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the need for top talent in the public sector is, in

my  mind,  very obvious.  The public and private sectors  are

twin  engines of growth.  Public sector capacity is  critical

for  the  growth of our nation.  It is difficult to think  of

any country where the public sector has been weak or slovenly

in  its  response to challenges and which has yet managed  to

maintain  and  sustain  consistent growth  and  economic  and

developmental success.  There are a few where there  is  this

asymmetry and in those cases the benefits have been  in  very

narrow pockets and not sustainable.  The public sector  is  a

key  determinant  of  the  enabling conditions  for  economic

growth  and broad-based development.  These include not  just

physical  infrastructure but the laws and policies, education

system, law and order, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the bottomline is we cannot fly as high or as fast

with  only one engine firing.  If we accept the need for  top

talent in the public sector, we must be ready and willing  to

pay  competitively.  Only then can we hire the  best,  demand

the  best,  and  make  no  apologies  for  it.   Charity  and

sacrifice  is  best  left  to the individual  to  decide  for

himself or herself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think back to the time when I joined the

Administrative  Service in 1987.  Over a  period  of  six  to

seven  years, three-quarters of my cohort resigned  and  left

for  the  private sector.  This was before the civil  service

pay  adjustments  were introduced in 1994.   These  are  good

friends  and they are no less loyal to Singapore than anybody

in  this  Chamber or any other Singaporean.   But  they  left

because of the economic realities.  They too had needs.  They

had  families.  They had children.  They had mortgages to pay

and  they had expectations and aspirations commensurate  with

their  talent.   It was quite unrealistic to expect  them  to

take  a substantial reduction in pay when they could see what

they  could command out there.  So they left.  And they  felt

that  they could continue to contribute to Singapore in other

ways, and many of them still do.  But the bottomline again is

that  the civil service and the public sector was the  poorer

for their departure.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question then is how much is enough. Sir, this is

subjective.  We have a formula.  Is it too high?  Is  it  too

low?   Or is it right?  We could perhaps look at it from some

angles.   The  first  question to ask is  really:  have  they

delivered?  And I think it is generally acknowledged not just

by  Singaporeans or Members of this House, but globally, that

we  have  a  public sector that is amongst the  best  in  the

world.  The PERC survey that many Members have cited is  just

one  in  a  series of examples.  In the World Competitiveness

Reports, we have consistently been rated high and one of  the

critical factors has been governance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not just the quality of the leadership but also

the fact that it has been able to stay ahead of the curve and

not  just keep up.  More recent examples of that will be  the

manner  in which the economic challenges of the recent crisis

were  managed, the drive into a knowledge-based  economy  and

the initiatives in e-government.  Not many countries have set

the pace.  And we have to see what has all this cost us.   If

I  recall correctly, with all these pay adjustments, the  DPM

has  said the total cost will increase to $34 million.   This

is  less than 0.01% of our GDP. If you call it an investment,

I  think it is reaping good returns.  If you want to call  it

insurance, it is a very low premium to pay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the need for such competitive pay is

equally  obvious  if  we contemplate  the  alternatives.   We

should not measure the cost of public leadership in terms  of

just the salaries that the leaders earn but of the total cost

they could cost the nation, in terms of poor decisions or  in

terms of other unsavoury tendencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to focus on some aspects of this

review for further comment.  The benchmark that has been used

to  compute  civil servants and Ministers' pay has  been  the

object of much confusion and even mythology.  Does it include

foreigners?   Does  it  include stock options?   Is  there  a

discount?  How big a discount is it?  And does it include the

wages  or the earnings of banker entrepreneurs?  It has  also

been the object of criticism that the base that has been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



chosen  has  been too narrow and that Ministers and  the  top

civil  servants  are therefore not subjecting  themselves  to

adequate  risk in their earnings.  In that regard, I  welcome

the  broadening  of  the base from 24 to 48  for  the  higher

benchmark  and  the 50% discount from stock options.   It  is

also  laudable that most of these increases are going  to  be

channelled to the variable component and to increase it to as

much  as  40% of the total wage.  I think these are important

steps  to address some of the questions in the minds  of  the

public.   But  I  do  have some specific  questions  on  this

benchmark and its application.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One question really is the net effect of the entire

benchmark  and the discounting has been to peg the Ministers'

pay at 200, if you take the full amount of $1.21 million,  or

360,  I  think,  if  it  was taken at a discounted  level  of

$900,000.  So the question that begs to be asked is: could an

alternative formulation be considered, or maybe it  has  been

discarded, which is to consider a broader pool at the top of,

let  us say, the top 400, and then taking the median of  200?

The reason I say this, Sir, is in any statistical analysis, a

small   sample   tends   to  have  greater   volatility   and

variability.   To use that as a base to compute  a  benchmark

and  then to apply a discount is probably going to raise more

questions.  And perhaps if the net effect of all of these  is

to  peg the Ministers' pay at 200, then why not do that  and,

say,  take  400,  and  take  the median.   I  think  this  is

something  I  would just like to hear some clarification  on,

whether  this  has  been  considered  and  why  it  has  been

discarded, if so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue is the question of transparency. The

sceptics will say that this large variable component  of  40%

is  merely a device to camouflage the true extent of the  pay

rise accruing to the top civil servants and Ministers, and  I

think this needs to be addressed head on.  One way to do that

is  to be transparent about the range and performance bonuses

given  to  Ministers.  I do not mean by this that  individual

Ministers'  names be put and the bonuses be  stated  next  to

them.  But I think it would be a very strong effective signal

if

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



the  public  is  told that the range and performance  bonuses

earned  by  the Ministers is X to Y.  That would  tell  them,

first,  that  the  variability is  genuine  and  it  will  be

effected  at the top levels, and secondly, that the Ministers

are  subjecting themselves to the very discipline  that  they

expect  of  top  civil  servants as well,  in  terms  of  pay

variability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the final comment I have is on the issue of timing

and  sensitivity.   This  pay rise comes,  and  there  is  no

denying  this, at an awkward time, because CPF cuts have  not

been  fully restored and there have been recent increases  in

transportation costs and other charges.  One could argue that

there  is  never  a good time for such pay  rises.   But  the

quantum  is  significant and for many,  they  would  find  it

difficult  to  fathom.  I think it is very laudable  that  in

this exercise there has been a concerted effort to space  out

the   increase   and  minimise  the  upfront  increase.    It

demonstrates  that  a  lot of thought  has  gone  into  being

sensitive to average Singaporeans and their perception.   But

I  wonder whether an additional step in terms of accelerating

the  CPF  cut restoration could be considered.  I think  that

would demonstrate to Singaporeans that the leaders are in  it

with them and that when things get better, it gets better for

all.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, Deputy Prime Minister BG Lee Hsien  Loong  has

made a Ministerial Statement on the increase of salaries  for

the  Ministers  and  public servants, and  he  has  used  the

mechanism  deployed  in  the  previous  exercise  with   some

improvements, such as increasing the pool of top earners from

24  to 48 and using the median point, instead of the average.

These are good improvements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps some people may question whether this is an

appropriate  time to propose such a substantial increment  to

the  salaries of the Ministers and civil servants  given  the

present economic situation.  Since 1999, our economy has come

out  from the rock bottom situation.  Our exports have  grown

strongly,  particularly in the exports of  electronic  parts.

Last

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



year,  our  economic growth was 5.4% and the  income  of  the

professionals had increased substantially.  Since  the  civil

servants' salaries were pegged to the private sector, I think

it  is only fair that we look into increasing the salaries of

the  Ministers and public servants according to  the  current

market  trend.   But  now we are moving into  a  new  economy

whereby  the economic structure has transformed in such a way

that  many traditional industries are unable to pick up,  and

some  workers are unable to cope with the demand of  the  new

economy.  Many SMEs are not doing well, and many workers have

lost their jobs.   These are the people who suffer losses  in

income  and  they find it difficult to accept the substantial

increase  in the salaries for the Ministers at this point  of

time.   As  for those who are lucky enough to stay  employed,

the  cut in their employers' CPF contribution has yet  to  be

fully  restored  and they cannot help feeling  unhappy  about

this  increment  of  salaries to  the  Ministers  and  public

servants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pegging of salaries between the public and private

sectors is something which we have debated and accepted  many

years  ago. It is a very creative measure.  Singapore is  the

only  country  in  the world with such  a  formulation.   The

Government has pegged the public sector's pay to  the  6  top

earning professions in the private sector.  The public sector

has  been responsible for policies that govern the nation and

to lead us in our economic development.  In the meantime, our

Ministers'  pay  is  pegged at only  two-thirds  of  the  top

earners  in  the  private sector.  This is  very  reasonable.

With  the  economic  recovery, the earnings  in  the  private

sector have gone up.  So it is only fair and reasonable  that

we  make  adjustment to the public sector's salaries at  this

point of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the gap between the public sector and the

private  sector could even be widened because at  this  time,

everyone is fighting for talent.  In order to retain the  top

talents  in  the  public sector,  we have to  increase  their

salaries.  But in the private

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



sector, they would also take the public sector's salary as  a

benchmark as well.  They would also increase the salaries for

their own staff in order to retain their talents.  This would

bring  about a chain reaction and, in the long run, the  wage

cost  in  Singapore  would go up and this  would  affect  our

competitiveness.   The  only solution  is  that  we  have  to

improve  our  productivity  to  offset  the  adverse  effects

brought about by higher wage costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic recovery is not across-the-board. There

are  some  sectors in our economy, particularly in the  SMEs,

which  have  not  fully recovered, and the higher  wage  cost

would  be  an added burden to them.  However, if  we  do  not

increase  the  salaries of our talented  professionals,  what

would  have  happened?  Under the development of  information

technology, we are becoming globalised and our talents  would

easily be attracted by other countries, so long as they offer

better  terms of employment and better pay.  Many of our  top

talents would be attracted by the overseas employers, and  go

over there.  So we have to pay them good salaries in order to

retain  them.   This is a reality which we  cannot  run  away

from.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the salary in the public sector must

also be competitive so that we can retain the top talents  in

our public service.  Therefore, an appropriate adjustment  is

necessary  and cannot be avoided.  If we do not adjust  their

salaries,   many talents and top brains will be lost  to  the

private  sector.  If we do not have first-class  talents  who

can make decisions correctly and resolve all the difficulties

to  lead the Government, particularly in a time of crisis, it

will  certainly lead to disaster.  For example, in  1985  and

1986, when we faced such a grave economic crisis, if it  were

not  because of the Government's prompt action, we would  not

be  able  to  get  out of the crisis so quickly  and  emerged

stronger  than before.   So I think a high quality government

is  very  essential.  Only with a good government,  could  we

have  good economic growth and a good standard of living  for

our  people.  Of course, some people may argue that our first

and second generations of political

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



leaders had sacrificed themselves to serve the people without

insisting  on  good pay.  It is because of  their  sacrifices

that we are able to enjoy what we have today.  Then why is it

that we must now pay relatively high salaries to attract  and

retain talents in the Government?  I think the answer is that

we  are  now  living  in a different  era.   Our  society  is

peaceful  and  stable.  Our economy is  growing  rapidly  and

talents  are  easily  attracted to other sectors  because  of

their  market value.  Nowadays, when the young people  choose

their  courses of study, they always think in  terms  of  how

much  they  can  earn in the future.  This is inevitably  the

criterion for their choice of studies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In future, whether or not they are prepared to be civil

servants   or   political   leaders,   one   of   the   major

considerations  will be  how much they can get  in  terms  of

salaries.  If we compare the salaries of our Ministers to the

top  earners in the private sector, they are still  one-third

less.   This is a sacrifice that they have to make.   So,  in

future,  will  the  top  talents be  prepared  to  make  this

sacrifice  to  be in  the public service?    It  is  still  a

doubtful  point.   If we do not have good  salaries  for  the

Ministers, it would be very difficult to attract top  talents

to  form the Government,  and it would be a great loss to our

nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal raised by DPM Lee is not just for the

salary increase for the present batch of political leaders  - the  Prime  Minister, Deputy Prime Ministers and the  Cabinet

Ministers - it is, more importantly,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



a  preparation  for  the  future.   To  the  present  lot  of

Ministers  and  public  servants,  they  have  a  stable  and

adequate  pay.  A pay rise of 10% or 20% is not that critical

to  them.  In economic terms, the "marginal utility" of money

is getting lesser and lesser.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the important point is that we want to set up a

mechanism  to ensure that we have generation after generation

of  high  quality  people in the Government  to  promote  the

progress and development of the economy of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Deputy Prime Minister's statement.

Development if the Housing and Development Board  will  relax

and  simplify its policies and rules governing the resale  of

HDB  flats  to enhance their market value and make it  easier

circumstances to shift their place of residence  between  HDB

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB flats are built to meet the housing needs of

Singaporean  households.  They are highly subsidised.   Thus,

there is a need to have rules and conditions for the purchase

and  use  of  these flats to ensure that they are  for  owner

occupation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the minimum occupation period for new HDB

flats  and resale flats purchased with the CPF Housing  Grant

is  5  years, while that for other resale flats is 2.5 years.

These  rules  are intended to prevent rapid churning  of  HDB

flats  for speculation purposes.  They are not so onerous  as

to  prevent genuine cases of upgrading to take place, whether

to a bigger HDB flat or to a private property.

<br><br><b>GDP-related Bonus</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GDP-related bonus will directly link the pay of

political  and  statutory  appointment  holders  and   senior

Administrative Officers to the state of the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of the bonus will depend on the real economic

growth  of  the  economy. The bonus will be 1  month  if  the

Singapore economy grows by 5% in the calendar year, the  mid-point  of its estimated long-term growth potential (4 -  6%).

It  will be 0 month (the minimum) if the economy grows by  2%

or  less, and 2 months (the maximum) if the economy grows  by

8%  or  more.  In  between, it will vary  linearly  with  GDP

growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention is to eventually build up this bonus to an

average of 3 months, with a range of 0-6 months.

<br><br><i>Performance Bonus</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance bonuses were first introduced for Superscale

officers in the Administrative Service in 1989.  Since  then,

they  have been extended to timescale Administrative Officers

as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance bonus norms will be raised as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Political and statutory appointment holders and

Administrative  Officers in Superscale C and above  presently

receive  performance bonuses averaging 4  months  of  salary.

This will be increased to an average of 5 months for those in

Salary Range SR6 and above.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrative Officers up to Superscale D1 presently

receive between 1 - 2 months of performance bonus on average,

depending  on  their grades.  This will be  increased  to  an

average of between 3 - 4 months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many months of performance bonus an officer actually

receives  will  vary  from  person  to  person.  Those   with

unsatisfactory  performance will receive  no  bonus  at  all,

while an outstanding officer will receive much more than  the

average quantum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several appointments currently receive fixed bonuses

instead of a performance bonus: the President, PM, SM,  Chief

Justice, Speaker, Chairman PSC, Attorney General and  Auditor

General.   This  will  continue under the revised  framework.

Their  fixed bonus rate will be set at the average  rate  for

senior officers.

<br><br><i>Bonus Pool</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the bonus pool system, an officer will be paid

half  his  performance  bonus for the year  immediately.  The

Government will contribute the other half into a bonus  pool.

The  officer  will be entitled to receive the amount  in  the

bonus  pool in two equal instalments 12 and 24 months  later,

provided he continues in Service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers who resign or are dismissed from the Service

will  not  be  allowed to withdraw any balance in  the  pool.

However, officers who retire from the Service will be allowed

to withdraw the balance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bonus pool system will not apply for the President,

statutory appointment holders and judicial appointees.
