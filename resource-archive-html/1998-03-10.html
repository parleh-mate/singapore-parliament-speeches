<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the

1999." - [Minister for Finance].



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

for  the  benefit  of  those  who were  not  present  during  my

presentation yesterday, I beg your permission to give a  summary

of  what I said.  The main point that I put across was that  the

timeliness  and  accuracy of information for decision-making  is

extremely  important in this fast-changing world.  And  this  is

even  so in the preparation of a nation's Budget.  I touched  on

the  increasingly  alarming reports of the  banks'  exposure  to

regional  economies.   Malaysian  banks  also  sustained   heavy

losses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it looks like events are unfolding faster

than  information  can be gathered, analysed  and  disseminated.

Yesterday, we got the financial results of UOB.  The figure  for

their  classified loans for regional economies is $332  million,

out  of  the total classified loans of the bank of $991 million.

Since  this  is  the  first  time  the  bank  has  made  such  a

disclosure,  there  was  no historical data  with  which  I  can

compare  and  get the year-to-year difference.  But  it  may  be

sufficient  to  surmise  that the difference  between  the  $991

million  and $332 million, as just mentioned, was due  to  local

loans,  and  the difference is about $660 million.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir, $660 million classified local loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar analysis of DBS Bank gives us a figure of $735

million for classified local loans.  With just these two  banks,

the  combined figure is a staggering $1.4 billion.   I  wish  to

highlight here that the $1.4 billion for the two banks  must  be

telling  us  that  there are many local enterprises  who  cannot

service their loans any more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure will be bigger if we combine the results of all

the  big four, Hong Kong Bank, Standard Chartered, Citibank  and

other  banks that lend to our companies.  Further analysis shows

that  for  UOB, the $332 million classified loan is out  of  the

19.7%  of  total loans, and $660 million is out of  the  80%  of

total loans.  I may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>



surmise  that  the total loans' current status is only  half  as

good as those compared to regional loans.  And my guess here  is

consistent  with the survey results of the various  associations

that  our local companies are not doing well.  I hence  call  on

the  Government  to  get  the banks to make  quarterly  reports,

instead  of  half-yearly reports, to increase  transparency  and

market   efficiency,  and  to  work  more   closely   with   the

associations to feel the pulse and the health of our companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having cited these figures, I am concerned that the

proposed Budget is not meeting the needs of the current economic

situation.  The market has reacted so.  If the Government is not

reacting  fast  enough, would we get into deeper  trouble  which

will  cost  us more to get out?  The slow reaction  of  Japanese

Finance Ministry's officials to their country's economic problem

and  Japan's slow recovery has presented to us vividly a classic

example  of  why lagging and conservative policies  may  not  be

ideal after all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, I called on the Finance Minister to have a more

expansionary  Budget.   I urge the Minister  not  to  allow  the

current   economic   difficulties  to  deflect   our   long-term

infrastructure  development plans and, hopefully,  it  will  not

affect  the  construction of underground road  systems  and  the

facilities  needed  to  push  our vital  economic  sectors.   As

demonstrated by the first phase of our MRT project, kicking  off

big  infrastructure projects during an economic downturn enables

us  to  construct these facilities at bargain prices.  We should

capitalise  on the current situation by building more  MRTs  and

LRTs because construction costs are low.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another note, I would like to focus on one point which

is  related to private equity funds.  Although there are now tax

incentives  for this industry, there is still no clear  strategy

by  the  Government  to develop a vibrant  private  equity  fund

industry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the Finance Ministry has given incentives for

developing  Singapore into Asia's premier fund  management  hub.

This  is  to basically focus on promoting Singapore as a  centre

for  managing Asian marketable securities investment  portfolios

of  both  Asian  and  Western clients, and for  managing  global

marketable   securities   for   clients.    However,    specific

initiatives for developing Singapore as a hub for private equity

fund  management  industry seem to  be  one  thing  in  the  new

financial  sector policy announcement.  In this  connection,  we

should note that the private equity fund management industry  in

Singapore is much less robust than in Hong Kong.  There are much

more new equity funds founded there every year.  More funds  are

under  management  and  more  fund  management  companies   have

headquarters  in  Hong Kong than in Singapore.   Singapore  only

captures  a  very  small fraction of the  private  equity  funds

investing  in  the  region, although we are  strategically  well

located for such regional funds targeting for investment in  the

ASEAN countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, what plans does the Finance Ministry have

for  the private equity fund management industry?  What are  the

strategies in attracting more internationally reputable  private

equity  fund  managers or groups to establish their headquarters

here?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, many local enterprises are cash-squeezed, and news has

it  that Malaysian, Thai and Indonesian private companies are in

dire  need for capital injection.  It is clear that this  is  an

opportune  time  for Singapore to encourage more private  equity

funds,   big   or  small,  foreign  or  local,  to  have   their

headquarters  in  Singapore, so that  there  is  rapid  matching

between  private companies in need of funds and  those  who  are

willing  to invest in them.  Note that private equity funds  not

only have the advantage of not being able to make massive, rapid

pull-out, compared to those involving marketable securities,  it

also fuels growth for many start-ups, as everybody has witnessed

in  Silicon  Valley in the USA.  This will be  a  big  boost  to

entrepreneurship  and  is also consistent with  Singapore's  on-going strategy for regionalisation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, it may sound as if I am supporting the financial

sector  only.   But  actually a vibrant dynamic  private  equity

industry  would  benefit our SMEs more than just  the  financial

market.  And this brings me to the next point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is constant complaint among our SMEs that the

Government's policies, though pro-business, have always been pro-MNC and pro-GLC only.  EDB is the main Government body in charge

of  the promotion of SMEs and bringing our SMEs to the vision of

Singapore 21.  Yet there is no clear strategy outlined  in  this

Budget  regarding  this.  It may be an opportune  time  for  the

House  to consider the reorganisation of EDB so that fresh ideas

and  new directions can be injected to promote SMEs to cater  to

the new possibilities in the fast-changing global economy.  This

rejuvenating effort can only be good for the nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Inderjit Singh said that Taiwan has weathered

this  crisis better than others because they have a  strong  SME

economy.  And I hope the Government will take a serious look  at

this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last area I would like to touch is that I notice from

this  proposed  Budget  that no major  amount  is  allotted  for

manpower  training.   And  this is strange  because  many,  many

Members  of this House have repeatedly emphasised the importance

of  retraining policy, and there was even talk about  tripartite

cooperation   on  training.   Here,  I  call  on  the   relevant

Ministries  to  focus more on the specific plans  to  carry  out

training  to  avoid  structural unemployment  as  seen  in  many

developed countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the setting up of the Ministry of Manpower, I believe

the  policy of manpower training will be more comprehensive  and

effective.  Accordingly, more funding should be provided  as  an

off-Budget  measure.  Mr Speaker, Sir, it was reported  in  this

House  not  too  long  ago  that there are  700,000  workers  in

Singapore  who have had only up to secondary two education.   If

we  were  to train 5% of them per year, namely, 35,000  workers,

and it costs $2,000 per worker,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>



we  will need $75 million in total per year.  And that is a very

slow retraining process, because at 5% per year, it will take us

20  years to retrain all our workers and many of whom would have

retired  by then.  So I suggest that budget for training  should

be  in the region of $100 million to $200 million so that we can

cover 10-15% of the workforce per year.  And I believe this will

be  more beneficial to the economy than the $130 million  rebate

in  property  tax given to a handful of developers,  as  rightly

pointed out by Dr Lee Tsao Yuan yesterday.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, I believe that the Government should have their

operation orders ready to avert a developing crisis, rather than

wait  for  an  emergency  before thinking  of  remedial  action.

Through  off-Budget  measures,  the  Government  can  take   the

driver's seat in introducing more infrastructure projects,  more

manpower  training,  encouraging  more  private  equity   funds,

working more closely with SMEs, so that we can get the buzz into

our  economy, as what our Senior Minister has judiciously called

for.   Perhaps then, the people may be better helped in  getting

prepared to weather this crisis.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): First, I

would like to indicate my support for the Budget Statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the media reports, we can generally

see  that many in Singapore have expressed disappointment   over

this  year's  Budget.  Some business people have  expressed  the

view  that they are completely lost as to why there are no  off-Budget  measures as announced by the Minister.   The  small  and

medium-sized  businesses  are  even  more  so  in   this   case.

Generally, people feel that the Government must be more positive

in  helping  the economy, the businessmen and to  stimulate  our

economy  so as to enable us to tide over the storm in Singapore.

Right  now,  we  are very disheartened about the effect  brought

about  by  the economic turmoil and it is quite reasonable  that

the  business  people expect the Government to  announce  rescue

packages and measures for the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Leong Horn Kee that the Government must pay

closer  attention to the current developments  and  should  work

together  with the local organisations in business and  industry

to  maintain a continual dialogue with them.  I hope that, if it

is  possible, the Government should immediately set up a Special

Committee,  a Special Task Force, to prepare for the rainy  day.

This  Task Force or Special Committee should aim at helping  the

Government  to provide views and collective wisdom,  to  collect

feedback  so that Singapore and the country can go through  this

storm.   The members of this Committee should be representatives

from  the  Manpower  Ministry,  Ministry  of  Finance,  MTI  and

representatives of private sector organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, apart from increasing the tax cut for

income  tax  and  interest tax, etc, I hope that the  Government

will  help  those first-time buyers of properties to  give  them

special   attention  because  these  people  who    bought   the

properties  for the first time normally have financial  problem.

In  other words, they do not have adequate cash upfront  to  pay

for the properties.  So I do not know whether the Government  is

prepared  to consider allowing such people to make use of  their

CPF  money  to pay for the first downpayment of 20%.   Then  the

people  who  benefit will not be the first time property  buyers

but  also  others as well.  At the same time, I  hope  that  the

Minister  for  Finance  will  allow the  business  community  to

understand why there is so much prudence in the present  Budget.

Many members of the business community feel that, as compared to

our Budget, the Hong Kong budget appears to be more flexible and

better  able  to help the business community to  tide  over  the

crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me go to the next important topic. In

this  year's Budget, the emphasis is on education.  I feel  that

at this time of economic and financial turmoil, highlighting and

placing  emphasis  on  education is only  right.   I  feel  that

education is not only aimed at educating people in English,  the

Science subjects like Chemistry, Physics, etc, but equally



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>



important  is  the  need  to bring up  our  children  to  become

cultured,  civilised citizens with traditions.  In other  words,

we  must  also  have  moral education,  physical  education  and

community  education for our children.  If we over-emphasise  on

intellectual  education, concentrate only on how many  `A's  the

children can score,  and neglect the other aspects of education,

such   as   moral   education,  physical  education,   community

education,  then  you may end up with negative  results.   These

results  would be the production of a new generation  of  people

who  care only for their own self-interest and utilitarian value

of  life but do not care about respect for the old, the teachers

and  become  arrogant and swell-headed.  They do not  even  know

how to repay the society to serve the country and to be loyal to

the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, juvenile crimes seem to be mounting in

Singapore.   The  question is: is it  related  to  the  lack  of

promotion of moral education in Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this morning, the Lianhe Zaobao published

an  article by Mr Lee Ther Sen, who is an educationist.  In  the

article,  the  importance  and effect  of  moral  education  and

community education is emphasised.  The article highlighted  one

important  point.   He said that community education  is  social

education.  The problem to be solved is to correct the  conflict

of interest between the individual, the society, the country and

the  community.   It  is  to overcome  the  problem  of  extreme

individualism so as to provide social cohesion and harmony.   So

community  education is not only a question of relation  between

the  individuals  and the society to promote solidarity,  it  is

also  an  important  key  and  a  collective  will  to  overcome

difficulties  and  crisis.  Therefore, he  said  that  community

education  is  an  indispensable link of  the  five  aspects  of

education which must be given its due respect and importance.  I

entirely agree with what he has said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that, Mr Speaker, Sir, if we neglect this invisible

asset,  we  will  only do so at our own peril.   We  should  not

neglect  the nurturing of our children in this aspect.  We  must

bring up a next generation of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans  so  that we do not produce zombies.   Some  people

have  described  that our future generation will  be  just  like

zombies  or  robots.   They  only  know  Science,  Biology   and

Chemistry.   They  do not know about their oriental  traditions,

culture  and  roots.  They do not even know the virtues  of  the

oriental  societies.  The Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong,  has

already mentioned in one of his recent speeches that we must not

only emphasise intellectual education, we must equally emphasise

the  other  aspects  of education.  I therefore  hope  that  the

Government  will pay due attention to this aspect, ie,  physical

education  and  moral education to bring about  a  better,  more

suitable and relevant education system for Singapore, and with a

proper strategy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, sometimes I cannot help thinking whether

we  should have an overall comprehensive review of our education

system, especially for the primary level.  What is taught at the

primary   level  might  be  an  over-emphasis  on   intellectual

education  and forgetting about good citizenship,  moral  values

and  ethics.  These are important lessons that they  must  learn

for  their foundation in life.  At the same time, I do not  know

whether the Government or the Ministry of Education should think

more  about  our mother tongue education.  If our mother  tongue

education  is  not made more interesting and popular,  then  our

children may not be able to directly understand and get  a  feel

of  our  own culture and tradition.  So I think it is  necessary

for   the  Government  to  review  comprehensively  the  primary

education.   This kind of intangible asset is a  very  important

motivating force for the progress of our country.  Of course, we

cannot  live  without money.  But you also cannot  live  without

these  virtues.  Without such virtues, I think the prospects  of

our country would be jeopardised.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Thank you for allowing me to

join  in  this  debate.   Sir,  I rise  to  support  the  Budget

Statement presented by the Minister for Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current regional crisis has seen our political leaders

and  Government  acting  in a rational and  sensible  manner  in

dealing with the difficult and complex issues



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>



confronting the region.  This Budget is another example  of  the

prudent  approach that needs to be adopted to ride through  this

crisis.  The Budget is conservative and prudent and rightly  so,

in  the  light  of  the present economic, political  and  social

uncertainty  facing the region as a whole.   We  must  not  lose

sight  of the big picture that we are in the midst of a regional

crisis of unprecedented proportions.  The outcome of this crisis

is  not at all clear and is impossible to predict because it  is

dependent on a multitude of factors and variables, many of which

are  beyond  our  control.   We must be  prepared  for  whatever

situations  that may arise.  But, in the meantime,  to  dedicate

resources  for  longer  term strategic  investment  in  defence,

education, economic infrastructure and skills upgrading and  the

promotion of high growth industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the dedication of resources for long-term strategic

investment  makes sense for the whole country  as  a  whole,  it

sounds a bit hollow to the business people who are facing  cash-flow  problems and having difficulties in staying afloat in  the

short to medium term.  Businesses would only benefit if they are

still  in business when these long-term investments bear  fruit.

All these improved economic infrastructure would mean nothing if

the  business folds up before then or is so sapped of energy and

resources  that  they  cannot take  advantage  of  the  eventual

recovery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues confronting businesses are more short-term in

nature.  They are looking for and expecting something more  from

the  Government  to help them tide over these difficult  periods

and survive.  They feel that the policy measures adopted in this

Budget did not reflect the severity of the current situation and

question  whether the Government's assessment of  the  situation

was  based on old statistics compiled a few months ago.  But  if

one  had just visited the Travel Fair over the last weekend  and

see the hoards of people snapping up holiday packages, one would

never  have  imagined  that we are in the midst  of  a  regional

crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, notwithstanding the difference in assessment, I am

gratified to note that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>



Minister  for  Finance has assured us that the  Government  will

monitor   the  regional  environment  and  economic   conditions

vigilantly  and  keep in touch with the private sector.   Should

the  circumstances turn for the worse, other off-Budget measures

could  be  taken  to address the situations  as  and  when  they

develop.   However,  for the present, people  are  shouting  for

help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many businesses and workers had hoped for a cut in tax

rates.  It seems logical that during hard times like these,  the

Government  should help by collecting less taxes so that  people

can take home more.  To someone who received a smaller bonus  or

no  bonus  at  all last year, or got a small or no pay  increase

this year, the natural tendency is for him to wish for a cut  in

income tax or an increase in tax rebate to cushion the impact of

the  reduction  in  income.  But we must  not  forget  that  the

Government has already introduced substantial tax cuts over  the

last  12  years.   Currently, only about 30% of individuals  pay

personal  income  tax  and  corporate  income  tax  is  paid  by

companies  which are doing well enough to generate  the  profit.

These  individuals and profitable companies should not shy  away

from their responsibility at a time like this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminded me of the thoughts of our Senior Minister on

the  fragility  of a multi-racial society which he  shared  with

journalists and diplomats at a dinner in June 1996.  He pondered

the  question  of whether the Singaporean would share  with  his

neighbour  who is of a different race in times of severe  stress

and  starvation.  If there is only one bowl of  rice,  will  the

Singaporean share with his neighbour?  We are not in the kind of

crisis which the Senior Minister had in mind.  Far from it.  But

are  the more fortunate Singaporeans willing to share with their

fellow Singaporeans who are not so fortunate?  This is a test of

our  cohesion and our ability to stay as one nation in times  of

difficulty.  The top income earners who are fortunate enough not

to lose their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



jobs and corporations that are making profits must do their part

by contributing their share in building a better tomorrow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also told that the two major problems that

business  people are presently confronted with are weak regional

exports  and low domestic demands for their goods and  services,

and the high cost of doing business in Singapore compared to our

neighbours.   On  the  first problem of weak  demand,  there  is

little  that we can do right now if the other regional countries

cut back on their imports because of their economic downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the domestic front, consumers have every reason to be

careful  in  their  spending during times of uncertainty.   Some

friends  of  mine have told me that in austere times like  this,

they  have to do their marketing and shopping outside Singapore,

where  their  Singapore  dollar carries far  greater  purchasing

power and goes much further.  Another group of friends I chanced

upon  at the Travel Fair last weekend said that they could  only

afford  to take a short holiday this year in the region, because

the  tax  rebate was only 5%.  If there had been a  cut  in  tax

rates or larger rebate given to them, they would have more money

to  spend on a longer holiday to Europe or to the United States.

These  comments  lead me to wonder whether our  retailers  would

benefit  from any fiscal measures to increase disposable  income

at this point in time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second problem of high cost, we cannot compete with

the  other regional countries based on cost alone.  Before  this

crisis,  they  were Asia's tiger economies capable of  producing

and enjoying many years of high economic growth.  As a result of

this  crisis,  their currencies have devalued and  the  cost  of

their  exports had correspondingly decreased.  If and when  they

get their acts together, restore confidence, put their economies

back  on track, they will emerge as formidable competitors.   We

need  creative solutions to tackle our problems.  We need to  be

more  productive and highly skilled so that customers  can  find

good value in the goods and services that we produce.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training and skills upgrading for our local workforce are

therefore   very  important.   However,  training   and   skills

upgrading  are often seen by businesses as cost items and  often

the first expense to be cut when business is down.  Manpower  is

our  only  resource  we have as a nation.  We  must  continually

upgrade  the  skills of our workforce.  In a  downturn  such  as

this,  many companies are experiencing the slowdown in  business

activities  and  workers  are not fully  occupied.   Instead  of

keeping the workers idle or retrenching them, sensible employers

would want to take this opportunity to release them for training

or  retraining.   But many can ill afford the training  cost  in

difficult  times like this when budgets are tight.  More  should

by  done  by the Government to help defray the cost of  training

and  to  further streamline the procedure for making claims  and

reimbursement to ease the employers' cash flow situations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training and skills upgrading should not be confined to the

low  skilled  workers, but must be carried out  at  all  levels,

especially at the time when globalisation and global competition

compel us to attract the best and the brightest to come here  to

work, at the top end of the workforce, the professionals and the

managerial executives.  We can expect very high calibre  foreign

talents  coming  here  from the more developed  countries.   Top

talents  are  a  mobile lot.  They go where their  services  are

needed and where there is money to be made.  For example, during

the  boom  years  of this region, many project  finance  experts

worked  out  of Singapore to advise on projects in this  region.

Now  that  these projects are shelved, these experts  have  been

redeployed  to  other parts of the world where there  are  still

projects   to   be   financed.   In  the  meantime,   the   debt

restructuring,  corporate recovery and  insolvency  experts  are

being  redeployed from other parts of the world to  this  region

because  their expertise is in short supply here  and  they  are

needed to do work.  We cannot therefore be forever dependent  on

foreign  talents,  just  as we cannot be  dependent  on  foreign

borrowings  to  drive  our  economy.   Although  talent,  unlike

capital cannot be moved away at the mere push of a button



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>



or  click of the mouse, they can still swiftly take flight  when

the  country becomes unattractive.  We must therefore  build  up

our  core  competencies, skills and expertise, just as  we  have

built  up  strong monetary reserves over time.  Whilst  we  need

foreign   talents  now,  our  local  workforce  must  take   the

opportunity to assimilate knowledge, upgrade our skills  and  be

competent to do the job ourselves, in the event that we are left

to pick up the pieces.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst much has been said about retraining and upgrading of

our  older  less skilled workers, I feel that not much attention

has  been  given to white collar workers, even though they  face

the  same  uncertainty and problems of retrenchment.  I  know  a

young  graduate bank officer who has worked for 5-8 years as  an

Assistant  Manager  in  the corporate banking  department  of  a

foreign bank.  New banking facilities are now put on hold.   She

is  fearful that she would be retrenched because of a world-wide

cost  cutting programme implemented by her head office.  I asked

her  what  she  would  do if indeed she  were  retrenched.   She

replied  that  she had no idea, as there was an over  supply  of

people  with her skills.  Perhaps she would sell insurance.   If

the worst comes to the worst, she may have to give piano lessons

to earn a living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to believe that being educated, they should

be  able  to  take  care  of  themselves  and  find  alternative

employment  for  themselves.   But  my  feeling  is  that  many,

especially  the  younger ones, simply do not know  what  to  do.

Many  who  are  in their early to mid-30s have  joined  a  tight

labour  market after the last recession in 1985.   Their  skills

were very much in demand but they enjoyed good job prospects and

uninterrupted high earnings for more than a decade.  This is the

first  difficult  period  that they are  encountering  in  their

career.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the employees in the financial services sector,

and  banks  are streamlining their operations and cutting  back,

similar difficulties are faced by conveyancing lawyers, who  are

affected  by the drop in property transactions, property  agents

in  a  lacklustre property market and many others.  I would urge

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>



Government  to do more and provide more guidance  to  help  them

cope  with  the crisis.  At the same time, I believe  managerial

executives and skilled workers must also be realistic.   Instead

of twiddling their thumbs and waiting for the return of the good

old days, they must proactively retrain to do other work or find

work  elsewhere.  Employers and corporate executives  of  search

firms have lamented in the past that Singaporean executives were

spoilt and fussy, and it was very difficult to get a Singaporean

to  be  posted  to a developing country like China,  Vietnam  or

Myanmar.  Singaporean executives can no longer be choosy.   Like

our  counterparts from the developed countries who go where  the

business is, they must be ready and prepared to be redeployed to

places where we can leverage on our expertise and make full  use

of  it.   This  is especially so now when there  are  many  good

investments  to  be found in the region and skilled  people  are

critically needed to manage them and bring out the true value in

these investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a clear underlying message in this budget is that in

view of the uncertainty, we must keep our resources and reserves

so  that these can be used at the appropriate time.  Ever  since

independence, we have been constantly reminded of  the  need  to

save for a rainy day.  We have done so consistently and built up

strong  reserves.  Many are now asking whether this is the  time

to  use  what  we  have saved for so many  years.   The  present

situation has been described as the worst in decades.   Is  this

not   exactly  the  situation  which  we  have  consciously  and

painstakingly  prepared  for?  Have  the  rains  which  we  have

prepared for arrived?  Sir, I believe that we should continue to

be  prudent and watchful, because the situation may not have hit

bottom  yet.   And it is impossible to predict how  events  will

unfold  in  the near future.  We must therefore be prepared  for

any eventualities and keep some resources in reserve in case the

situation  turns  for the worse, and heavier storms  of  greater

ferocity  hit  us  in  the  future.  In these  difficult  times,

Singaporeans must stand by each other.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>



This  is  the  test  of  our cohesion and our  ability  to  work

together and stay together as one nation in times of difficulty.

We  must  remain confident and do our part in building a  better

tomorrow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion standing in the name of the

Minister for Finance.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

usually difficult to speak of long-term plans when the issues at

hand  appear overwhelming.  There are numerous illustrations  of

this around us.  It was under such an uncertain economic climate

that the budget was presented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The virtues of planning for a sound economy cannot be over

stated.  It has been this constant push towards identifying  key

areas  and  then  providing a conducive business environment  to

facilitate growth that has enabled us to have a stable  economic

framework.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has added yet another boost to the financial

services  sector  amid  concerns  that  some  quarters  may   be

experiencing extremely tough business conditions.  In fact,  the

current  economic  crisis  is testimony  to  the  importance  of

charting longer-term growth paths that are sustainable, and also

the  cost  of not doing so.  For us in Singapore, where  we  are

small  and  we have no natural resources, we simply cannot  wait

till the storm is over to resume long-term planning.



<br><br><i>Incentives for the financial sector</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is with this perspective that I support the thrust

of   the   financial  sector  reforms,  as  manifested  in   the

comprehensive  range  of initiatives, including  the  incentives

contained in the Budget Statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short-term, although business prospects look

daunting  within the Asian region, and concerns mount  over  the

viability  of major financial institutions, Singapore  continues

to  be  well-positioned to play a significant role  in  regional

finance.  The financial sector reforms will pave the way for  an

even bigger role, particularly when regional economies begin  to

recover.   The  benefits  can be tremendous.   At  the  national

level, there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>



further  growth  impetus to the financial  services  sector  and

together with multiplier effects, to the economy at large.  Once

we  have  formed  a  critical mass, we will find  it  easier  to

sustain stability in growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the industry level, financial institutions can innovate

to  a greater degree in products and services, thereby enlarging

their  business potential.  Companies, in turn, will  have  more

avenues  of  raising funds for business needs  and  consequently

realise an enhanced return on their investment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the individual? As retail customers, we can

enjoy  more  choices  and  newer, more sophisticated  investment

opportunities.  We will no longer be restricted  by  a  lack  of

choice  to  leaving savings as idle deposits.  Instead,  we  can

gradually   choose  to  diversify  across  different  investment

instruments, other than just stocks, or even across the  region,

if  we  so wish.  We can also avail ourselves of more innovative

loan schemes for our different needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our local financial institutions, I believe the reforms

can  cut both ways.  Competition from non-local institutions who

have  expertise  gained elsewhere will no doubt  intensify,  but

Singapore  banks  can  capitalise on their  long-standing  track

record  and  intimate  local  knowledge  to  consolidate   their

positions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changing landscape means that Singapore banks will

increasingly  find  the  traditional  banking  businesses   more

challenging, as companies, especially the bigger ones, no longer

rely  solely  on  direct borrowings.  They may choose  to  raise

capital on a wider scale, via, say, convertible bonds or  borrow

in  foreign  currency for offshore needs.  The  availability  of

alternatives  will  increase competition  for  bank  loans  and,

consequently, lower spreads on these loans that the banks make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither will companies nor individuals simply leave their

surplus cash as fixed deposits, which have hitherto been a major

source  of funding for banks.  This may raise the cost of  funds

for banks and, similarly, squeeze their spreads again.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>



Given both these projected trends, there may then be pressure to

keep  loan volumes up by changing the loan mix towards more real

estate  or property, or by simply assuming more risk.   If  this

were  so,  the  resultant bias in asset quality is something  we

would have to  be vigilant about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local banks can and should capitalise on their strong

market  presence  in  Singapore to  extend  more,  if  not  new,

products and services.  There needs to be, to borrow the cliche,

"a  paradigm shift", in terms of redefining the reliance on  the

traditional bread-and-butter lending business.  They should also

not  shy  away from importing the necessary talent to make  this

quantum leap.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst it is inevitable that for Singapore to realise the

benefits  of  these  reforms,  we  would  have  to  tap  foreign

expertise, the Government should ensure a sufficient  supply  of

manpower  resources,  suitably trained, to  support  the  larger

financial  role envisaged.  This is to enable more  Singaporeans

to partake of the growing significance of the financial services

pie.



<br><br><i>Proactive stance towards assisting troubled sectors and companies</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like my fellow GPC members and Parliamentary

colleagues, I would like now to dwell a little on the issues  at

hand, particularly the plight of the smaller local companies who

are  bearing the full brunt of the regional crisis.  As you have

heard,  not only are they experiencing a drastic drop in demand,

but  also  are they saddled with bad debts and a credit squeeze,

which all conspire to result in a serious cash flow crunch.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has promised that the Government

will  monitor  the  current  regional  turmoil  vigilantly   and

implement  off-Budget measures should the situation  deteriorate

even   further.   This  is  a  promise  which  I  believe  many,

especially the smaller companies, are clinging on to.  There  is

concern, Sir, however, that the speed of deterioration  is  such

that  we  do  not have the luxury of reaction time to  anecdotal

evidence.   Swift  measures may have  to  be  taken  to  counter

anticipated untoward effects.  To ensure the timeliness



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>



of  these  measures, a proactive stance is necessary to  prevent

problems from being full-blown.  I would therefore like to  urge

the Government to consider extending more assistance, especially

towards  easing  cash flow for companies.  This could  take  the

form  of allowing companies to defer tax payments for a specific

period or increasing the quantum of rebates on property tax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the financial policy of the

Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

join  my  colleagues in supporting the Budget Statement.   At  a

time  like  this  when all our neighbours are  tightening  their

belts, I think we are very fortunate to have a budget with  $2.7

billion in surplus, no increase in taxes (except on cigarettes),

but  on the contrary, we have new tax concessions to promote the

financial sector, the transport and logistics sector, exhibition

organising,  cyber trading and even the recruitment  of  foreign

talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this very difficult period, the people in the

neighbouring  countries are rallying behind their leaders.   The

Thais,  for  example, have their "Thai help Thai" campaign,  and

the Indonesians have their "Love the Rupiah" campaign.  Perhaps,

we  in  Singapore,  should also have an  "Appreciate  Singapore"

campaign  to  drive home the message to younger Singaporeans  on

the  need  for and the benefit of hard headed economic,  social,

political  and financial policies, which have stood us  in  very

good stead in this current turmoil, but which have been the butt

of  many criticisms at many other times.  Having said that  half

in  jest, I must add that we must be careful that while  drawing

lessons from the current Asian economic and currency crisis  for

the education and edification of our young, we must be sensitive

to the needs and feelings of our neighbours.  In fact, we should

certainly  use  the occasion to extend a helping hand  to  them,

within our means, of course, whether in monetary support  or  in

kind.   Such financial support, I presume, will not be reflected

in the Budget, but off-Budget,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>



in  our  balance  sheet at the appropriate time.   I  think  the

people of Singapore should support our leaders as they try to do

this as sensitively as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget has been viewed by many again as a "Shenton Way

Budget" for the many financial and tax incentives it contains to

bolster  the banking and finance sector.  In my view, we  should

not  begrudge  the additional fiscal measures the Government  is

introducing  to  attract  even  more  financial  activities   to

Singapore so as to make it even more competitive than the  other

Asian  cities.  In fact, having been in the banking and  finance

industry personally, I can tell you that the feedback from  many

financial  institutions in the last Budget was that the  ceiling

for  some  of these incentives was set so high that only  a  few

bigger  fund managers benefited.  I am glad that in this Budget,

the  Minister for Finance has lowered the threshold  requirement

for  fund  managers to qualify for full tax exemption  from  $10

billion to $5 billion of non-resident funds for a period of five

years.  This will allow more fund managers to take advantage  of

the incentives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must point out that many fund managers move to,

or  increase their operations in Singapore not only  because  of

tax  incentives, but also in the hope of getting more funds from

the Government, statutory boards and Government-linked companies

to  manage.  In this respect, the fund managers have been a  bit

disappointed  with the great caution, or reluctance  with  which

funds have been farmed out to the private sector for management,

even   after  the  Senior  Minister's  announcement  of  greater

liberalisation in this area a few years ago.  I am happy to note

that  the  Government has given renewed commitment to liberalise

the  fund management industry and allow the private sector  fund

managers to manage more Government funds.  This will go  a  long

way  to help our fund management industry to grow and strengthen

further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our bond market is in an even greater stage of infancy as

the  Government which normally provides for the backbone for the

bond market in most countries does



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>



not borrow from the public.  I welcome the package of incentives

to   promote  the  development  of  an  active  bond  market  in

Singapore.   We  certainly need a more active and  vibrant  bond

market if we want to be a premier financial centre in Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the incentives to promote our financial industry

have been targeted at companies, ie, only the companies are seen

to  benefit from the tax concessions.  I have been told by  some

people  that this alone may not be adequate to entice  companies

to move to Singapore because employers are still finding it hard

to  convince  their employees, especially those  based  in  Hong

Kong,  to relocate to Singapore because they would be worse  off

in  Singapore in terms of personal tax status.  Some  have  even

suggested  perhaps that the Government should give  special  tax

concessions for such employees to entice them over to Singapore.

Personally,  I  do  not support this suggestion  as  this  would

result  in reverse discrimination, ie, foreigners would enjoy  a

better  tax package than locals.  I believe strongly in a  level

playing  field  for  both  locals and foreigners,  whatever  the

origin.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to express my support for the

Government's  decision  to  keep  a  tight  lid  on  operational

expenditure, but increase capital expenditure in the  key  areas

of  education,  economic  infrastructure  and  defence.   It  is

certainly   an   ideal   time   to   accelerate   key   economic

infrastructure  projects like the reclamation  at  Changi  East,

Jurong  Island Phase 3,  the upgrading of industrial  facilities

at  Tuas, and even the construction of the North-East MRT  line.

The  efforts  to  boost  the  economy  through  counter-cyclical

spending will not only save taxpayers' money during the regional

downturn,  but  also be appreciated by all in the  building  and

construction industry.  Having said that, I would like  to  make

an observation that we have been building many 5-star facilities

such  as the Changi Airport and so on, when we could afford them

in  better  times.   No doubt these facilities  have  helped  to

establish  Singapore  as  No. 1 in many  areas,  from  the  best

airport  to  the best port in the world.  During this  downturn,

however, as part of our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>



austerity  drive, perhaps 4-star quality may suffice, especially

for facilities for internal use which are not open to foreigners

or  tourists.   For example, tiles should be used  in  place  of

marble  or  granite  in some places.  This would  also  send  an

important  message  to the young that we should  learn  to  live

within our means and tighten our belts when necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I congratulate the Finance Minister for finally

agreeing  to abolish stamp duty on all instruments,  except  for

those   which   relate  to  stock  and  shares,  and   immovable

properties.  I had brought this up last year in the Committee of

Supply  and  I  thank the Minister for his quick  response  this

year.   I  am sure this move will go a long way to reduce  costs

and inconvenience to businesses and members of the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to comment on the Electronic Road

Pricing and vehicle tax rationalisation.  The ERP rates and  the

vehicle  tax  rationalisation  scheme have been  announced  last

week.   Although I am happy that the exercise would  be  revenue

neutral  in  about  eight years, I must say that  I  was  a  bit

disappointed  that the Ministry did not take  advantage  of  the

occasion  to  simplify  the road tax structure.   The  structure

today  is  still  very  complicated, and I believe  the  complex

structure  was a result of the need to include a wealth  tax  in

the  formula.   My  question  is this:  would  it  not  be  more

efficient to collect the wealth tax upfront one-off in the  cost

of the car, for example, the Additional Registration Fee and the

COE,  than to do this every year through the road tax?  The road

tax,  as we all know, is not really a usage tax.  It is a  fixed

cost  that we have to pay every year, much like a flat fee, just

like  the registration fee.  The only real usage taxes  that  we

have  are the ERP and the tax on petrol because they go up  with

greater  usage.  So the ARF and the COE, in my view, could  have

been used as the sole wealth tax that vary with the OMV cost  of

the  car.  Strictly speaking, a larger engine capacity of a  car

does not necessarily mean that the car is more luxurious.  So my

message   here   is:  in  formulating  taxes,  I   believe   the

consideration  for equity should be balanced  by  the  need  for

simplicity.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Budget.

<br><br><!-- Mr David T.E. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David T.E. Lim (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, before I speak, I

would  like  to  declare  my  interest  as  Special  Adviser  to

Chairman, EDB, for Regional Projects and Software Transfer,  and

also  as  Executive Vice-President, Special Duties, in Sembawang

Corporation.  In both these organisations, Mr Philip Yeo is  the

Chairman.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members of this House have spoken against the EDB's

and  the NCB's actions to name three scholars who chose to break

their  bonds rather than to return home to serve.  Collectively,

they  have  put  forward a number of arguments to support  their

stand.  To paraphrase, these are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, that scholars who break their bonds will still

return  to  serve  Singapore in other ways.  By  pursuing  their

interests  and  developing their talents, they  are  of  greater

service to Singapore, not lesser.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, breaking a bond is not such a big issue that such

scholars  should  be  named  and humiliated  in  public  and  so

discourage others from taking up scholarships.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, that a practical solution to this problem would be

for organisations to increase the number of scholarships so that

the  net  number of returning scholars would still be sufficient

for the organisations' needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who hold these views are saying that the scholarship

is  just  a  commercial agreement which can be  set  aside  when

expedient  and  settled  by the payment  of  money.   But  every

scholar  knows  that  this  is not true.   They  know  that  the

prestige and honour that accompany a scholarship carries with it

an  equal  measure of responsibility.  The more prestigious  the

scholarship  the  greater  the responsibilities:  to  return  to

serve,  to  lead,  to  benefit future  generations.   These  are

unwritten  obligations  but  well-known  to  both  scholar   and

sponsor.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My view is that EDB and NCB did the right thing by naming

the  scholars  who broke their bonds before they even  completed

their  studies.   By  so doing, they affirm the  high  standards

which  they  expect  of these scholars and the  importance  they

place  on  their  moral  values in addition  to  their  academic

abilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the arguments which were raised by the MPs

who disagree with this stand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first argument that scholars who break the bonds will

serve  society  better  in other ways  fails  to  recognise  the

importance  of integrity.  To unilaterally break a  bond  is  to

dishonour  a  promise.  This is not a small matter.   For  if  a

scholar  decides not to keep his promise now, how can we  depend

on  him when he promises to do more later?  He may be smart  and

well  qualified.  But how will we know that his new promise will

not  be broken as well?  Integrity once broken up is like Humpty

Dumpty - hard to put together again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second argument that bond-breakers are publicly

humiliated  when their names are published is inconsistent  with

itself.  If the scholars argue that they have done no wrong, why

do  they  consider it a shame to have their decisions  noted  in

public?  If, indeed, they had the greater interest of society in

mind  when  they  broke their bonds, why  do  they  object  that

society should know?  By that logic, they have discharged  their

obligations by paying their bonds.  By the same logic, should we

not  tell the public that they have given up their scholarships,

just  as  the  public was told when they received their  awards?

And  if  this policy discourages those who have no intention  to

ever   serve  their  bonds,  would  we  not  have  created  more

opportunity  for  others  who  are  ready  to  put  country  and

corporation before self?  If there is shame in public naming, it

is  only  because the bond-breakers know that they have  done  a

dishonourable thing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion that we should offer more scholarships so

that  bond-breakers  will  not impact the  sponsors'  deployment

plans will only make matters worse.  Consider this analogy.   Do

we employ



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>



more  road-sweepers if pedestrians throw more litter?  Or should

we  find  ways  and  means to remind pedestrians  that  throwing

litter is wrong, and to penalise those who do so?  The more road-sweepers we employ, the more litter will be thrown.  Do we  then

keep  on  employing road-sweepers?  Will we become a  nation  of

road-sweepers?   In like logic, if we signal that  bond-breaking

is  acceptable, will we not only be encouraging more scholars to

break their bonds?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, EDB and NCB have not taken the stand that bonds can

never  be  broken.   Indeed, I am told that EDB  has  allowed  a

number  of scholars to break their bonds, some even before  they

completed  their studies.  There were various reasons for  this,

such  as  ill  health or family problems, or poor organisational

fit.   And EDB has also exercised flexibility when scholars have

wanted  to  stay on to further studies or to transfer  to  other

organisations.   But  what  is not acceptable  to  them  is  for

scholars  to unilaterally discharge themselves simply by  opting

to  pay  off their bonds, and in the case of the three  scholars

named, without serving even one day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has benefited from the many thousands of scholars

who  have  come back to serve their bonds.  Since Mr Philip  Yeo

joined  the  EDB, more than 300 new EDB scholarships  have  been

awarded.  These are precious opportunities.  EDB's scholars  owe

a  debt  of  gratitude to a selfless and tireless  Chairman  who

canvassed  far  and wide to convince corporate sponsors  of  the

value of investing in Singapore's young.  They would do well  to

repay it by not breaking their bonds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who says that the Chairman of EDB has become too big

for  his  shoes  does not know the man nor his  heart.   I  have

worked  for him for 20 years.  He is demanding, and in  his  own

words,  a  slave  driver.   But  he  has  a  heart  that  cares,

especially for his staff and his scholars.  We have heard strong

accusations about his improper conduct, within the protection of

this  House.   But we did not hear why he said,  what  he  said.

Those who presented the story half-told would do justly to  tell

the other half.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Koh Buck Song of The Straits Times was right in saying that

bond-breaking  is  really  about bigger  issues,  by  attracting

talent and heartware.  It is these things and more.  It is about

our values.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we look for reasons to break a promise, we will

always find one.  Integrity costs.  But unless we are willing to

pay  the  price, not in dollars, but in self-sacrifice, then  we

should not be so quick to make the promise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A' level results are out, and scholarship season is now

open.  My advice to would-be scholars is to choose carefully and

wisely.  Do not take a scholarship just for the perks.  Choose a

scholarship  based  on  what  your  interests  are   and   which

organisations you are willing to commit to.  Remember,  that  in

three,  four  or five years' time, you would have to  return  to

face  yourself, whether to honour your promise or to  find  some

excuse to go your own way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I thank the Minister for Finance for giving us a

Budget  that  recognises  our immediate  needs  and  which  also

continues  to  provide  for  our future  growth.   I  share  the

sentiments of my many colleagues who have highlighted  the  need

to  pay  closer attention to small businesses which are  failing

and  workers in danger of losing their jobs.  The help which  is

needed  goes beyond tax reliefs and rate cuts.  It is  important

at  this  time that every Government agency also pays particular

attention  to  the  myriad  problems  which  will  arise.   Some

companies  may  take advantage of the situation to  curry  extra

favours  from  the  Government.   But  many  will  face  genuine

problems   from   rules  and  regulations  which   were   merely

inconvenient  when  times were good but which  may  now  make  a

difference  between break-even and bankruptcy.   At  this  time,

more than ever, the public service needs to be alert to the need

to  reinvent  itself to ensure that its policies and  procedures

are sensitive to the problems faced by the business community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever surprises the future may hold for us, we have

a strong economic foundation to meet these challenges.  But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>



whether  or not we succeed does not depend on just our financial

strength  but  also  on the integrity and  loyalty  of  all  our

people.   As individuals and as a society, let us pull  together

and  act  with purpose, not out of fear nor merely for  monetary

gain,  but  because we are committed to do right and  worthwhile

things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> A point of clarification.

I have listened to David's comment.  Unfortunately, Chng Hee Kok

is not here.  Can I take it from him that he is saying that Chng

Hee Kok did not tell the complete truth?  This is important.  He

is  a  Member of Parliament, and I would expect him to tell  the

truth.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, I think this is an important point, and

I hope the Member involved will clarify the matter.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Maybe he wants to ask Chng Hee Kok to

clarify the matter.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, I was not present at the breakfast

meeting.   What  we heard in the House was the reaction  of  the

Chairman  of  EDB to statements that were made at the  breakfast

meeting, but we do not have the benefit of those statements.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> So if you were not present at that

meeting,  I  was  wondering how did you come to that  conclusion

that Chng Hee Kok's statement was not the complete truth.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, I am Special Adviser to Chairman, EDB.

I have spoken with him.  I have heard his side of the story.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> If I can clarify, Mr Speaker, Sir, that

Chng Hee Kok's point was the issue of the Chairman asking him to

resign, and also those MPs, who concurred with him on that view,

to  also  resign.  So as a Parliamentarian, and  he  is  also  a

Parliamentarian,  telling me this story, I believe  him.   I  am

asking whether that issue is right or wrong.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> So the question is: why such a question was

posed, why such a statement was made?  Why did the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>



Chairman of EDB ask a Member of Parliament to resign?  I do  not

know  if  Dr  Tan knows the reason.  But if he does, perhaps  he

will share it with this House.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> He asked him to resign because he said,

and  he  told  me,  that, first, he is a  Government  Member  of

Parliament, and that the issue is a Government policy,  and  for

those two reasons, he asked him to resign.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, that is not my understanding of what

transpired.   [Interruption.]  But the Member, who was  present,

is not here in the House now.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Yes, it is unfortunate the Member ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Dr Tan, I have allowed you to seek

clarification on the speech which Mr David Lim has made.  But  I

do  not  think we should be going into what transpired  at  that

meeting, because none of you was present.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Thank you, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> So have you anything else to clarify? No, all

right.  Mr Zainul Abidin.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

after  hearing Mr David Lim, I would like to venture  to  answer

his  question,  whether we need to be a nation of road-sweepers.

I think we would not need to be a nation of road-sweepers.  I do

not  think we need to.  Neither do I want to appear sweeping the

issue  under the carpet, for I agree with him that the issue  is

not  just about scholarships and bond-breaking, but it is  about

our  greater  values, our social and national  bonding.   And  I

trust there will be another occasion, perhaps with all those who

have  spoken on this matter present, and we will thrash  it  out

once  and for all, for it is a very important issue, and I think

we should not take it lightly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise in support of the Budget presented by our

respected Finance Minister, Dr Richard Hu.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all kinds of labels have been given to Dr Hu and his

budget over the years that the latter must by now surpass many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>



of  the  clever  images and adjectives chosen for branded  goods

normally given by the media and the commercial jargon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Lim Boon Heng, Minister without Portfolio and

Secretary-General of the NTUC, said in the latest NTUC News, why

call  it  prudent, as though Dr Hu's Budget had  been  imprudent

previously.  True, the Finance Minister has always been prim and

proper, and precise to the needs of the day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know that Dr Hu is no prima donna. Dr Hu has

always  been  patient and open to suggestions and  we  therefore

appeal  to his good sense to prevail.  And also since Dr Hu  has

promised that the Budget is not the-all, and that the Government

will  respond  with  off-Budget measures,  we  stand  reassured.

After all, Dr Hu said, "we have more than adequate resources  to

cope  with  any  eventuality."  But, like Dr Lee Tsao  Yuan,  Mr

Inderjit Singh and many others, I would rather like to see  more

of those off-Budget measures soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the comment that we do not need a `crisis'

budget,  but  neither should we be near `complacent'  about  the

possible  effects of the economic uncertainties of  the  region.

In the words of the cool, calm and collected Dr Richard Hu, this

economic outlook is "volatile and unpredictable."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to continue to monitor the situation closely and

respond  accordingly.  After all, being nimble has  always  been

Singapore's  forte.  But allow me to reiterate,  the  signs  are

telling  us  that  we  would be better off with  the  off-Budget

measures sooner than later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it was only eight months ago that quite a

few  Members in the House questioned the need for the Government

to  keep  such  a  large current surplus for Fiscal  Year  1997,

suggesting  more  could  be done with  the  money  to  help  the

business and the people to be more productive.  Dr Hu stood  his

ground, reminding us of the need for prudence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo and behold, soon after the debate, regional events began

to unfold exposing the fragile nature of the region's financial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>



foundation.  The currency and economic turmoil that followed was

unprecedented.   The  ramifications are  serious  and  the  full

effects are yet to unfold.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the budget surplus proposed for Fiscal Year 1998 was

reduced  by  about 50% compared to Fiscal Year  1997,  ie,  from

$5.09  billion to $2.73 billion.  This looks credible.  This,  I

believe, is for good reasons.  It has allowed a budget that will

result  in  a 25% increase in development spending and  selected

tax reliefs, especially in property and banking.  However, since

these are high growth sectors, the ripple effect will be felt by

many, not only in `Shenton Way' but also by workers at large.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True to Singapore's economic development philosophy, we

find spending money on productive forces more effective than  on

the consumptive nature.  Put simply, it follows more of teaching

them  to fish rather than providing the fish itself on a  silver

platter.  That, I agree, is a good line for a better catch.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, my concern is, do enough Singaporeans

appreciate  and  understand  the  seriousness  of  the   ongoing

regional  and  economic  turmoil since  last  July.   As  Dr  Hu

suggested  in  his first two sentences of the Budget  Statement,

Singapore's  7.8% growth in the economy in 1997 did not  reflect

the seriousness of the situation.  The question now is: does the

proposed 1998 Budget help to do so?  Yes, there is less surplus.

Yes,  there is more on development spending.  Yes, there is  tax

relief for selected sectors.  Yes, Dr Hu has promised more  help

in case of any "sudden downturn", but could not more be done now

to  help  drive  home  the point about the  seriousness  of  the

situation and to better prepare the population to take advantage

of  the opportunities later?  We can also ask: is the Budget not

too  prudent?  When we are expecting a possible growth  rate  as

low  as 2.5%, should not more pump-priming be done?  Do we  need

all the over $2 billion surplus in difficult times?  Surely,  we

do  not  want  to  be  caught again like in  the  mid-80s.   For

example,  why  was  the  individual  tax  rebate  for  Year   of

Assessment 1998 be reduced by half to 5% only?  Many people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>



are  asking: is that the way the Government wishes to help  when

times were to get difficult because of the currency and economic

turmoil in the region?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that there is this promise of off-Budget measures

if  and  when the situation worsens but Singaporeans are anxious

to  see  the kind of immediate signals the Government  would  be

willing to show or give in terms of budgetary/fiscal measures to

help  alleviate the position of those affected, especially those

from the lower-middle and lower income groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area of immediate concern is the fate of workers who

may  be  retrenched,  which  we are  told,  whose  numbers  will

increase.   There  is  room  for more  assurances  and  concrete

programmes  to  help them.  The Government should also  consider

funding  CDCs  to monitor the situation at the grassroots  level

and  to coordinate the assistance programme necessary.  This  of

course  could  be done in conjunction with the new  Ministry  of

Manpower  and NTUC.  Of course, we would like to see help  being

given  especially to those who want to be helped.  Generally,  I

gather  Singaporeans have three to six months  of  savings,  and

when  the  situation worsens, especially for  those  retrenched,

what kind of safety net can we help them with, without of course

succumbing  to  welfarism.  In this context,  many  workers  and

union leaders are also wondering what signals the Government  is

sending  for  worker training and skills redevelopment.   It  is

hardly  visible  in  the 1998 Budget.  In fact,  a  most  marked

omission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More can and should be done for skills upgrading. The

Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP) deserves more attention and

financial  back-up.   SRP  is  currently  helping  to  speed  up

development  of a national skills certification and  recognition

system  in Singapore and promote industry-wide collaboration  in

skills upgrading and certification.  These projects initiated by

NTUC and supported by EDB, PSB, ITE and Polytechnics show



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>



promise  and should therefore be given further financial  boost.

And  I am not talking of a token allocation.  This should  be  a

big billion dollar item for the medium and longer term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should team up with the labour movement and

employers  to  instil  a  greater sense of  urgency  for  worker

training and upgrading.  This calls for a significant commitment

from the Government in terms of funding.  More could and must be

done  for  worker  training and skills  upgrading,  through  SRP

particularly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the cool, calm and collected Dr Richard Hu is back

in  the House, I hope he will be creative in dishing out  a  sum

that will help reflect and send a "collective will" message that

we  are serious about skills upgrading.  After all this, we want

our  workers and economy to come out leaner and fitter  and,  in

fact, more resilient.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Can I get a

clarification from Mr Zainul?  If I heard him correctly, he says

that,  as regards retrenchment, he wants the Government to  fund

CDCs  and coordinate at grassroots level.  I would like  to  ask

him   how  does  funding  of  the  CDCs  help  workers  who  are

retrenched.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are two

points  I  mentioned  in that statement.  One  is  for  CDCs  to

monitor the situation at the grassroots level, in terms  of  the

effects  of  the economic turmoil in the region and once  it  is

felt  by the people who are retrenched and they are feeling  the

hardship, the CDC will be close enough to the ground to  monitor

and  see  what  kind  of  problems the  economic  situation  has

created.   The  other  point  is in terms  of  coordinating  the

programmes and the Government could help either through NTUC  or

the  Ministry of Manpower and the CDC, again being close to  the

ground, could also help to coordinate these programmes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I get a further clarification? He

does  not  seem to give me an answer.  I would like to ask  him:

how  does giving more money to the CDCs help retrenched workers?

That is my point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> I do not think he got my point.

I was saying that the CDCs could help in terms of monitoring and

also  coordinating the programmes.  To do that, they  will  also

need some funds.  But the actual programme of helping retrenched

workers will come through SRP, retraining and upgrading of their

skills.  That was also tackled in my speech.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  under  the  shadow  of  the  regional  financial

turmoil,  the Minister for Finance announced the 1998 Budget  on

27th February.  But in this Budget, the measures relevant to the

business  community are inadequate.  This can be  borne  out  in

three  areas.   Firstly,  there  is  a  wide  gap  between   the

"purchase  order"  placed before the Budget  and  the  "delivery

order"  given  after the Budget.  Secondly, on  2nd  March  this

year,  there  was  a significant drop in the share  market  that

shows the disappointment of investors over the Budget.  Thirdly,

the  reaction  as reported in the media showed  that  there  are

voices  of  disappointment everywhere and the voices  are  quite

loud indeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I would not be so naive as to indulge in wishful

thinking  that  the  Government will deliver  according  to  the

"purchase order".  Based on our trust in the Government, we  can

put ourselves into the shoes of the Government and look from  an

overall  angle the intention of the 1998 Budget. We cannot  deny

that  the  1998 Budget, being extremely conservative, does  have

certain positive implications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, firstly, it conveys the full confidence of the

Government  in not allowing the little boat of Singapore  to  go

adrift  in  a  big storm as it firmly controls  the  rudder  and

remains on  course towards our long-term objective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, before the uncertainties of political and

economic  factors outside Singapore are resolved,  any  measures

put  up  by  the  Government could turn out  inadequate  or  not

directly  relevant.   So  instead  of  indiscriminate   use   of

medicine, it is better that we watch and monitor the development

of events and situation before prescribing the right medicine to

cure the disease.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here, in the midst of disappointment, we have not

missed  the  promise  of  the Finance  Minister  for  off-Budget

measures.  Therefore, we have turned our disappointment over the

Budget into new hopes that the Government, presently taking  the

"containing   motion  with  quietude"  stand,  will   definitely

introduce appropriate off-Budget measures at the right  time  to

help the local industries and enterprises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the business community has always been

faced  with  the heavy cost of doing business in  Singapore  and

they  have to cudgel their brains.  The business people have  to

face  the  problem  of lower sales and the  pressure  of  rising

business  cost.   This is what we call "adding frost  to  snow".

According  to  the Economic Intelligence Unit's  survey  report,

Singapore's  cost  of business is ranked No. 10  in  the  world,

comparable  to that in Europe and America, and much higher  than

our   neighbouring  countries  like  Malaysia,   Indonesia   and

Thailand.  I think that the most important task ahead is that we

must  lower the cost of doing business here.  This is an  urgent

task to us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Government can look into the direct costs

of  business  like  factory rentals, shop  rentals,  wage  cost,

Government taxes and charges, transportation cost, etc.  If  all

the  Government agencies can look into the situation and quickly

adjust  such  costs  of businesses or to suspend  collection  of

certain  charges, it will help our local businesses  and,  to  a

certain degree, restore the confidence of the business people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the budget, HDB and JTC have already

announced the freezing of rentals for one more year.  Of course,

freezing  is better than no freezing.  We appreciate that.   But

just  freezing  alone  is  not enough.   The  Government  should

consider lowering the rentals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January, the House already approved the motion tabled by

Mr  Cyrille  Tan  on tripartism.  The Government's   refusal  to

reduce  rentals  appears to go counter to this  spirit,  because

just freezing rentals is not enough.  In good times, enterprises



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>



move forward.  The rentals go upwards.  But now through no fault

of  ours,  but  because of the effect of the regional  financial

turmoil,  business  suffers losses.  We move  backward  and  the

Government just freezes rentals.  That is "running on  the  same

spot".   When  the economy prospers and the businesses  recover,

the  Government will not stand there and wait for the businesses

to  catch up.  Instead, it will immediately raise rentals.  This

amounts  to  sharing  prosperity  in  full  while  only  sharing

hardship  in  part  and will delay the recovery  of  businesses.

Such  practices  do not seem to be totally consistent  with  the

spirit of tripartism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from rentals, another burden on the businesses in

Singapore  is  the  wage  cost.  Compared  to  our  neighbouring

countries,  our  wage cost is already quite  high.   The  recent

devaluation of the currencies of our neighbouring countries  has

made our companies and businesses even less competitive in terms

of  wage cost.  In the long run, this will be detrimental to our

exports  and  to our foreign trade.  I feel that the Government,

apart  from  encouraging our businesses and workers  to  enhance

productivity, should also help to reduce the wage cost  for  our

businesses.   So  I  would again appeal  to  the  Government  to

exercise restraint on wage increases in the public sector, so as

not  to create a vicious competition that may push up wage level

in the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government levy on foreign workers is aimed at

preventing undue increase in foreign labour and social problems.

This levy is to control the demand for foreign labour.  But  now

with  this  economic turmoil, our demand for foreign labour  has

dropped.  So this is the right time for the Government to  lower

such levy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, faced with the financial turmoil sweeping

across  the  region, we should all be united together  with  one

heart to make the necessary sacrifices and preparations to avoid

an  economic  recession.   If  this  negative  situation  should

persist or even worsen over the next few



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>



months,   I   would  urge  the  Government  to  decisively   and

immediately adjust the CPF contribution by employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1998 Budget contains an increase of 30% on education

expenditure.   But  no  new measures have  been  introduced  for

retraining  of  employees.   As  the  Government  has  said,  an

economic slowdown is the best time for retraining of our workers

and  employees.  Our labour market is highly flexible,  allowing

free competition to determine the allocation of human resources.

As such, if company A pays for training an employee, the benefit

may  go  to a new employer, company B.  This is to say that  the

value-added to the employee will not necessarily go back to  the

employer  paying  for it.  But for the whole of  Singapore,  the

nation   for  sure  benefits.   In  other  words,  like   formal

education,  staff  training is also to  some  extent  a  "public

good".  Therefore,  in terms of staff training,  the  Government

must  play a greater role and give more incentives.  I think  it

is very much the Government's responsibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Government taxes and charges by the

statutory bodies have also become a rather substantial  part  of

the  business cost.  Therefore, the Government should constantly

review  such  taxes  and  charges and  evaluate  their  negative

effect.   And, if necessary, the Government must take off-Budget

measures  to  reduce the company tax, GST,  road  tax  and  port

charges,  etc,  to  ensure  that  our  competitiveness  can   be

sustained.    As  encouraged  by  the  Government,  many   local

enterprises  have gone regional.  But, unfortunately,  they  are

suffering heavy losses in this financial turmoil.  Not only have

they failed to get proper returns, they also suffer great losses

and heavy setbacks because of the currency turmoil.  In order to

maintain  their  morale  and  to  help  them  go  through   this

difficulty,  I  think  the  Government  should  liberalise   the

corporate  tax  system  and give the enterprises  the  necessary

assistance  by allowing companies to deduct losses of subsidiary

companies  overseas from their group profit.  In  addition,  the

Government  should  also  grant them  double  tax  deduction  in

respect of wage cost overseas and other related costs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Government reduced the property tax to 12%

in  order to help lighten the burden of property owners.  At the

same  time, however, the Government, raised the annual value  of

properties so that the quantum of tax paid has actually gone up.

Now,  property  prices have already come down.   The  Government

should also correspondingly lower the annual value of properties

and  the  quantum of property tax.  I hope that  the  Government

will  further  reduce  property tax to 10%,  so  as  to  further

lighten  the burden of the property owners and, thereby  helping

the property owners to maintain their confidence in the property

market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's motor vehicles are the most expensive in the

world.   Everybody  knows  that.  From  the  point  of  view  of

economic  theory,  we can say that when the price  is  low,  the

demand will be high.  When the demand is low, the price will  be

high.   This is indisputable.  Given that the Government  adopts

the   COE  system  to  restrict  the  increase  in  the  vehicle

population,  the high cost of motor vehicles naturally  follows.

The  Government  has  already started to increase  the  cost  of

vehicle  usage and,  proportionately reduce the cost of  vehicle

ownership.   Still, I feel that basing the costs  of  owning  or

using motor vehicle completely on economic efficiency and market

pricing has its drawback.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a rich man is prepared to spend $100,000 to

buy  a  car  for  his  university-going daughter  to  avoid  the

inconvenience of using the public transport. On the other  hand,

a  small  businessman can only afford $80,000 to buy  a  vehicle

indispensable  for his business. Under our present  free  market

competition  framework, the businessman will  lose  out  in  the

competition,  and the rich man's daughter will get  to  use  the

car.    Is   this  outcome  optimal  for  Singapore's   economic

development?  I doubt very much.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a simple issue. Precisely because many

Government policy issues are not simple and need talented people

to  work out good solutions that we whole-heartedly support  the

Government's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>



high-pay  policy  to  recruit talents into  the  Government.   I

believe the Government has the means and the ability to think of

a  better  way  to  lower the transportation  costs  to  a  more

reasonable level, so as not to hurt the competitiveness  of  our

businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the announcement of the budget, the Singapore

Chinese  Chamber  of  Commerce and Industry conducted  a  survey

among  its members.  The result shows that many enterprises  and

businesses  have suffered as a result of the regional  financial

turmoil.  We know the Government's economic policies are  driven

by  strategic  long- and medium-term plans and objectives.   For

many  years,  we  have  accepted the Government's  self-reliance

principle,  ie,  within the law, everyone pursues  his  profits,

enjoys  the fruit of his success, but also bears his own  risks.

We  also understand that, to do business in Singapore, you  must

depend  on  yourself.  So this survey should be  interpreted  as

reflecting  the true difficulties faced by the business  people,

rather  than  attention-seeking sort of "groaning without  being

ill".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of the financial sector is very important.

There  is  no doubt about it.  If Singapore can become a  world-class  financial  centre,  then  local  enterprises  will   also

benefit.  To a very large extent, multi-national companies  have

their own intra-trading.  I think this has provided some cushion

for  Singapore's  economy in this financial  turmoil.   We  also

concur with the Government's call for local enterprises to  pool

their  resources  together  to go  into  the  so-called  sunrise

industries such as telecommunications, high-tech, logistics  and

transportation, and electronic-commerce, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would again appeal to the Government not to neglect

the  SMEs  in  Singapore.   They are important  and  special  to

Singapore  as a nation and Singaporeans as a people.   First  of

all,  the  small  and medium-sized enterprises,  just  like  the

Government-linked companies and some large companies such as Yeo

Hiap Seng, are "our own". When Singapore is in trouble, they are

the people who will remain in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>



They  have  no other places to run to, and they do not  wish  to

run.   They  are local indigenous businesses.  The big companies

also started off as small companies.  So if we neglect the small

and   medium-sized  enterprises,  then  you  will  be  doing   a

disservice to the entrepreneurial spirit of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, because the SMEs have not reached the economic

scale,  they are at a disadvantage.  But, of course,  they  also

have  the  advantage of being a small boat which  can  manoeuvre

with  a lot of flexibility. But, more importantly, they are  the

symbol  of  Singaporeans', especially the  young  Singaporeans',

entrepreneurial spirit.  We have been alarmed that this kind  of

spirit  is  gradually fading away.  So we cannot  just  pay  lip

service  that we encourage entrepreneurial spirit. In  terms  of

policy   and   taxes,   Government  should  substantially   give

reasonable  or long term assistance to these local  enterprises.

We  do not expect the Government to over-zealously help them. We

know  that  will be quite futile. The Government will  also  not

oblige.   What we are asking the Government to do is to  realise

that the SMEs are not fully grown as yet.  They are still in the

seedling stage.  We must care more for the SMEs.  Because  their

roots  are  short  and small, the Government should  help  these

companies  to  grow  faster  by  giving  them  more  water   and

fertilizer.  Otherwise when the leaves of big trees cover up all

the  sunlight and their thick roots obstruct the tiny  roots  of

the  SMEs,  even if the latter's seedlings are of good  quality,

they  cannot  survive  and will seek better  and  more  friendly

fields elsewhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, some statutory boards published the names of bond

breakers.   Although I may not agree with this, from the  debate

on  this matter and my own experiences, I feel that it is  quite

true that the "me-first" attitude of the younger generation  has

reached  the extent that we cannot afford to overlook.  From  my

own  humble  view,  I  feel  that in  our  economic  development

process,   we  have  over-emphasised  efficiency  and  financial

benefits.  This is one of the reasons why



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



young people care more for benefits but less for the spirit.  In

helping our SMEs, in terms of transportation cost, it would  not

be  enough for us to just talk about economic benefits.  To make

it  even  clearer, certain things may not be competitive  enough

today. But their values in the long term may be very high. So in

our   economic   calculation,  we  should  not  under-rate   the

importance  of  future value.  The Government's economic  policy

has  been  well  founded  and far-reaching.  In  this  financial

crisis,  foreign countries have already praised us for  what  we

have  been  doing.  It is based on this Government's outstanding

achievements that I sincerely hope that the Government  will  be

able  to  introduce off-Budget measures to encourage  our  local

small  and  medium enterprises and to lower the  cost  of  doing

business in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

ask  my  friend  for  some  clarification  on  one  issue?    He

the  views  he has expressed are also the concerns of the  other

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan:</b> The answer to that is yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I am obliged to him, Sir.



<br>2.20 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support of the motion in the name of the Minister for Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the long term is made out of a series of short terms.

To  survive  the long term, we need to grow in the  short  term.

Likewise, to grow in the long term, we need to survive the short

term.   In  this  regard, I am very impressed  by  Budget  1998,

because it addresses both the need to survive the short term and

the  need  to grow over the long term.  In particular,  I  would

like to highlight three areas where I am very impressed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, during this period of economic slowdown, many

companies are facing problems with cash flow and profitability.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>



The  various  measures announced by the Minister to contain  the

rising cost of doing business in Singapore will go a long way in

helping  businesses  to survive the short term.   Secondly,  the

small  and  medium enterprises, together with the  manufacturing

and  services  sectors, are the key source of  employment.   The

review of the Local Enterprise Financing Scheme (LEFS) is a very

timely  move by the Government to support more SMEs during  this

period  of  difficulty.  Thirdly, Asia, in  the  year  2000  and

beyond, will be a very different Asia.  By then, many countries,

if  not  all of them, would have turned around from the  current

turmoil.  It is very important that Singapore is well positioned

for the 21st century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, I am very impressed by the various

incentives  and measures announced by the Minister  to  position

Singapore as a global hub in Asia in the 21st century  in  terms

of  being  a  financial  hub, exhibition hub,  information  hub,

technology hub, electronic commerce and so on.  So all  in  all,

as  I say, Budget 1998 is a very good budget and I would like to

congratulate the Minister for coming out with such a good budget

in such a difficult time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a saying that we are able to refine better than we

are  able to create.  Now that the Minister has created  a  very

good  budget,  as  a humble MP, I would like to contribute  just

some ideas on how this good budget can be refined a little,  for

the better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, imagine we have a plane that is normally full. In

fact,  there are times when we even have to add extra  seats  to

cater  for  the  over  demand.  All of a sudden,  one  day,  for

whatever reason, the passenger load drops, and we end up  having

many empty seats.  This is a situation we are not used to.   But

for  the airline, when they see all these empty seats coming up,

there are a few things they can do.  The first thing they can do

is  to  lower the fare, make it cheaper so that many people  can

travel.  The second thing they can do is to do some promotion to

attract new passengers, people who have no intention to  fly  on

their  airline  and  bring  them to  their  airline.  The  third

approach is to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>



target certain special groups and give them special fares, maybe

tourists,  for example, so that in that way they fill  up  those

seats.  But why do airlines make all these extra efforts to fill

up  all  the  empty  seats?  The answer is simple.   Because  if

nothing is done, by the time the flight is over, the empty seats

are  gone  forever.  There is no way you can recover  the  empty

seats.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Use a smaller plane.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Mr Low Thia Khiang says, "use a smaller

plane".   I suppose you can.  But the problem is that  later  on

when the business picks up again, what do you do?  Do you change

back  to  a  bigger plane?  Of course, it costs money to  change

from  a big plane to a small plane.  Therefore, I would like  to

offer  this  suggestion because whatever we do now under  Budget

1998,  it  is  quite clear that the economy is  likely  to  grow

between  2.5% and 4.5%.  It can be 2.5% or 4.5%, maybe lower  or

higher.   But  whatever it is, I think it is quite safe  to  say

that  in  1998  and 1999, we are not going to be able  to  fully

utilise our full potential because the Singapore economy has the

potential to grow at 5% to 7% a year.  But this is not likely to

happen  in 1998 or 1999.  Therefore the question is: what should

we  do with this slack in the national economy?  What should  we

do  with  this  spare capacity?  Because, like the  airline,  if

nothing is done to make full use of this spare capacity, by  the

year  2000,  I  think we will look back with  a  lot  of  regret

because what is gone is wasted forever.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to put forward this suggestion that there

are  two  ways we can make use of this spare capacity.   Various

Members  of  this House have suggested that we should  introduce

some stimulation  package to stimulate the economy.  That is one

way  of  helping the companies to survive, to keep  them  alive,

keep  them  above the water, so that hopefully when the  economy

turns into high growth again, they can move on.  The second  way

is  to  look at it in a more proactive and constructive way  and

ask  ourselves:  can  we  turn  this  spare  capacity  into   an

investment for the future?  What I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>



am  saying  here  is this.  I am not talking about  giving  more

incentives  and subsidies to help companies to  survive.   I  am

proposing that we help companies to become stronger so  that  by

the  time the economic crisis is over, companies will  be  in  a

better position to compete in a more competitive Asia.  This  is

theory.  This is concept.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn this into some concrete ideas. We can turn

this  spare capacity into an investment at three levels: at  the

national economy, the company and the individual worker's level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, at the national level. We always think that in a

crisis  like this, investment will drop and therefore we  should

expect fewer investments to come to Singapore, and be ready  for

the  hard  time.  I think otherwise.  Recently, I met  a  senior

executive  of a leading MNC of the world and I asked  him,  "How

are you doing in Singapore?"  He said, "Well, not too bad, quite

tough  though.  Profit margin is low.  Singapore dollar is  high

and  therefore  you are more expensive.  But  I  think  we  will

survive."   Then I said, "How about investment  plans?   Do  you

think  you  will do something this year?"  He said, "Oh,  it  is

interesting   that   you   ask  this  question.    Because   our

headquarters  just  did a review.  They come to  the  conclusion

that  by  the  year 2000 the Asian market will grow  and  expand

again."   Which  means  they have to do  something  in  1998  to

prepare  and position themselves for the year 2000.   They  look

around in Asia.  They concluded that at this moment in 1998, for

their   capital-intensive,   skill-intensive   and   technology-intensive   investments, in fact, there are not many  places  in

Asia  they  can put their money now.  Because of the uncertainty

in  the  economy and the political situation, in fact, Singapore

is  one of the very few countries where they can invest today to

position  themselves for the year 2000  And  he  said  that,  in

fact,  this year they are going to increase their investment  in

Singapore.   They  are  going to undertake  more  operations  in

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I believe that we can turn this financial crisis

into an opportunity for Singapore to move further ahead provided

that  we are prepared to set aside more resources to incentivise

these investors so that they can do more in Singapore.  In  this

regard,  I  would like to suggest that the Minister for  Finance

may  wish  to  consider  allocating a  supplementary  budget  to

economic  agencies like the EDB  under the Economic  Development

Assistance  Scheme (EDAS) so that agencies like EDB,  TDB,  NCB,

PSB  and  NSTB  can make use of this slow growth period  in  the

Asian region to go all out to attract more companies to speed up

their investment into Singapore.  So that by the year 2000  when

the  market  returns,  Singapore would be  in  a  much  stronger

position to capture this Asian market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, at the company level. Again, many of us would

imagine  that  during a period of slowdown, companies  would  be

talking  about retrenchment, downsizing, cost-cutting.  I  think

we may be 70% right because out of every 10 companies, I am very

optimistic  that  we can find two to three who are  prepared  to

look  ahead to the year 2000 and beyond and ask themselves  what

they  can  do  during this period of slowdown with  their  spare

capacity  within the company to reposition themselves  to  build

new capabilities to compete in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I visited a few companies and, some of them are

Japanese companies.  They mentioned to me that this is a  period

where  they will focus in three areas.  First, quality;  second,

productivity;  and the third area, innovation.  Their  point  is

that  by the year 2000, if their operations are going to survive

in  Singapore, in terms of quality, productivity and innovation,

they  must  be so far ahead of their competitors in  the  region

operating  at  a lower cost location.  During good  times,  they

have  no  time  to go through this re-engineering.     But  now,

during  a slowdown, time is on their side.  So instead of asking

workers  to  stay at home, take a pay cut, they are now  turning

this spare capacity into an investment for new capabilities  for

the  future.  However, many of them told me that it is easy  for

them to secure additional resources from the headquarters during

good times to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>



fund  investment  upgrading.  But during this difficult  period,

when revenue is down, profit is down, it is a big challenge  for

the   executives  in  Singapore  to  convince  their   corporate

headquarters  to  invest  during this difficult  period.   Their

suggestion is, how they wish the Government can do its part  too

to  co-fund,  to  incentivise them, in some of  these  upgrading

programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in that regard, my second humble suggestion to the

Minister  for Finance is that I hope the economic agencies  will

not  scale  back  their level of incentive support  during  this

difficult  period.   Instead, I think they should  increase  the

level  of  support so that companies which are  prepared  to  go

through the process of re-engineering to prepare themselves  for

the year 2000 and beyond, should be given more encouragement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, at the individual level, and I think the Minister

is  aware that this is the level where I am most concerned.  For

many years, we have complained that workers are not committed to

training.   Why?   During  good times, they  have  no  time  for

retraining, because workers would like to work overtime, because

overtime  brings  extra  income to the  workers.   And  this  is

something  we can understand.  Now we are in not-so-good  times,

overtime has been cut back.  In fact, quite a few companies  are

now  going  on shorter work week where factories open  for  four

days, and workers are asked to take compulsory leave and stay at

home.   In  a  way,  this spare capacity is  now  being  wasted,

because workers are now staying at home doing nothing.  Here  is

a  situation  whereby during good times, they have no  time  for

training.   Now they have time for training, companies  have  no

money  to  send them for training.  So we are always  caught  in

this no-time or no-money situation.  I feel very sad that we are

not  taking the bold step to break away from this no-time or no-money situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For companies, many of them, I believe that if we are

prepared to co-fund training with them, many more employers  are

prepared  to  re-train their workers.  The Skills  Redevelopment

Programme is spearheaded by the NTUC, co-funded by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>



EDB,  PSB,  and supported by the training facilities offered  by

ITE, Nanyang Polytechnic and Temasek Polytechnic, and so on.  We

have demonstrated that, given a sufficient level of support, the

employers  are  prepared to retrain their  workers  during  this

period  of  slowdown.  And many workers, the older workers,  the

not-so-young  workers, the under-educated workers, are  prepared

to respond to training.  Under the SRP today, more than half the

workers  are more than 40 years old, and more than  70%  of  the

workers  undergoing  training  have  less  than  secondary   two

qualification.   We  believe that, if given  sufficient  funding

support,  we  can expand the SRP to beyond the unionised  sector

into  a  national programme, so that we can turn this period  of

slowdown  into a period for investment, retraining,  and  skills

upgrading  of  the  workers, so that  our  workers  will  remain

employable in the next century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are my three suggestions which I hope the

Minister  will consider.  But having said all this, I think,  at

the  end  of  the day, whether Singapore would do  well  in  the

future  depends not so much on how much money we have, how  good

is  our  strategy,  but  on  what kind  of  people  we  have  in

Singapore, what kind of Singaporeans we have in Singapore,  what

kind of leaders we have in Singapore in the future.  And here  I

am  not  talking  about  leaders  who  have  the  knowledge  and

expertise.   I  think  equally, if not more important,  we  need

leaders  with the right value system.  In that regard,  I  think

the  debate  on the scholarship is a very relevant issue  within

the  context  of Budget 1998.  Because if the young  leaders  of

Singapore,  the  leadership  of  the  future,  have  only   good

knowledge  but  not  the  right value system,  I  do  not  think

Singapore can sustain our growth in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members here mentioned that we must invest in the

young  Singaporeans, in the citizens of the future, and I  fully

endorse  this.   I would like to cite Chairman, EDB,  Mr  Philip

Yeo,  as an example of a person who really believes in investing

in  the  young  Singaporeans.  I must at this stage  declare  my

interest.  Firstly, I am the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>



Chairman  of  the  National  Computer  Board  (one  of  the  two

statutory  boards  that  is  involved  in  this  whole   issue);

secondly,  I was MD of EDB, and I am now still on the  Board  of

EDB; and thirdly, I am a scholar, and I have been bonded to  the

Government for 11 years, and I am proud to say I am not a  bond-breaker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Philip Yeo believes in developing the

talents for the future.  So wherever he goes, he makes sure that

there  is  a scholarship system in place to invest in the  young

Singaporeans.  In 1981, when he became Chairman, NCB, he set  up

the  NCB scholarship.  In 1986, when he became Chairman, EDB,  I

think  not many people are aware, he secured a $50 million  fund

from  Glaxo to set up the Glaxo-EDB scholarship.  When he became

Chairman,   Sembawang,  again,  he  expanded   the   scholarship

programme.   Why?   Because he believes that  for  Singapore  to

sustain  our  growth in the future, we need to have young,  good

and  capable  leaders.   To have good leaders,  he  believes  in

giving them the best education you can find in this world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me highlight this. For a long time, the Government has

a  lot  of  reservations about sending scholars to  America  for

study  and allowing scholars to go beyond the basic degree.   Mr

Philip  Yeo  changed all that.  He was the first  to  allow  NCB

scholars to study in US, to do Masters, and likewise, in EDB, in

Sembawang.  Why?  Because his belief is that you must give  them

the  best.  If the best is in USA, let them go to USA.  When  he

became Chairman of Sembawang, I was told that some of the  staff

asked  him:  why  are you giving all this money to  scholars  to

benefit just a few persons?  And he explained that the future of

a  good  corporation  depends on having good  leaders,  but,  in

return, he would expect a lot from the scholars.  I was told - I

was  not there - that once he met up with Sembawang scholars and

he  told them, "I hope everyone of you will remember - that this

scholarship  money  is not my money; it  is  not  the  money  of

Sembawang  management; it is not the money of the  shareholders,

but this is the workers' money."  Because as the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>



Chairman   of  Sembawang,  he  could  have  declared  all   this

scholarship money as bonuses and wage increase for the  workers.

But  because he is looking ahead to the future, that is  why  he

puts  the money to fund scholarships.  And he told the scholars,

"I  hope  everyone of you will appreciate that  the  workers  of

Sembawang  are funding your education.  I hope you do your  very

best  when  you go to school.  And I hope that by the  time  you

graduate from school, you will come back to repay these  workers

of Sembawang by giving your very best to Sembawang Corporation."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I think what he said to the Sembawang scholars is

equally applicable, whether it is at a statutory board level  or

at  the national level.  Yes, we have bond-breakers.  But we are

not talking about the same kind of bond-breakers.  Mr Leong Horn

Kee  mentioned that he served 10 years before he broke his bond.

There  is  nothing wrong with that, because he served 10  years.

After  breaking his bond, he is still contributing to Singapore.

But what we are talking about here are scholars who did not even

serve  one day and who decided to break their bonds.  Of course,

many  will  argue  that after five years, 10  years,  they  will

return  to  be  better persons.  Time will tell.   But  at  this

moment, in 1998, if we look back at what happened the last  five

to  15  years, under NCB, six scholars broke their bonds without

serving a single day.  And at this moment, out of the six,  only

one is serving in Singapore.  The other five are now in USA.  At

least  one of them has already sunk roots in USA.  He has got  a

good job, a good family, and he has no intention to return.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the point here is this. It is like what Mr Philip Yeo

told the Sembawang scholars: this is the workers' money.  And I,

as  a  labour  MP,  would  like to tell all  the  public  sector

scholars  the same thing: that every single cent that goes  into

scholarships  belongs  to  the taxpayers,  to  the  citizens  of

Singapore,  and, therefore, when they take on a  scholarship,  I

hope  somewhere  in  their heart they  remember  that  when  the

Government  or  a  statutory board gives them a  scholarship  to

create a better future for themselves, they will in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



return think about how they can create a better future for   the

average Singaporeans, for the common Singaporeans of Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support  the  Budget  Statement presented by  the  Minister  for

Finance, Dr Richard Hu.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, after this year's Budget Statement was delivered

on  27th  February 1998, a Member of this House remarked  to  me

that  he  wished he was working in the financial  sector.   This

summarises a commonplace perception that this year's  Budget  is

primarily  aimed  at bolstering the financial  sector.   Perhaps

given  the  economic  downturn and  the  difficulties  faced  by

certain financial sector players, this emphasis on the financial

sector  is  understandable.  But the economic  downturn  is  not

restricted  only  to the financial sector.   Hence  there  is  a

perception that the Budget does not go far enough to help  other

sectors of the economy and the ordinary man.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to express my concern here, especially

for  small  and medium-sized companies.  The move to expand  the

scope  and range of the Local Enterprise Financing Scheme (LEFS)

is indeed welcome, given the credit squeeze companies are facing

today.   Companies  benefiting from this scheme  are  invariably

small  or  medium  sized.  However, some have expressed  concern

that  the smaller SMEs may also be "squeezed" out by larger SMEs

who  are  expected to enjoy the lion's share of the benefits  of

this new initiative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Government to ensure that all deserving

companies are able to enjoy this scheme without regard to  their

size.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I spoke about the need to encourage SMEs to

undertake  research  and development  work.   I  wonder  if  the

Minister  could  enlighten the House on  the  successes  of  the

programmes  undertaken  by PSB to help SMEs  grow  and  develop.

Such successes would show that these programmes can assist these

companies in building their core capabilities and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>



developing  adequate in-house expertise that will help  them  to

ride out the economic crisis that may hit us this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same point, Sir, I am somewhat disappointed that

there are no special provisions in the Budget to assist SMEs  to

become more competitive.  I understand that the LEFS scheme is a

useful device to help companies continue their operations.  This

is  important.   But can we do more to help these  companies  to

grow and develop core capabilities?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I share the view of the Finance Minister that the role

of  government  is  to  ensure  that  good  business  conditions

prevail.  Given the current regional economic crisis, shaping up

confidence internationally and domestically has become  all  the

more  important.  Yet it may appear to some SMEs that confidence

domestically does not seem to come their way.  For any  SME,  an

investment into a new product or service is a major undertaking.

In this time of uncertainty, they would be cautious as any wrong

move may wipe out their entire operations.  While we do not want

SMEs to go into bad investments, we also do not want them to  be

overly  cautious.  An undue fear of risk ultimately may  not  be

good  for  their continued good and development.  The Government

is in a good position to assist SMEs in this area and to bolster

confidence  in their potential.  I share what Mr  Lim  has  just

spoken.   Sir, can the Government consider increasing  funds  to

the SMEs to allow them to invest in new areas so as to stimulate

the economy?  I am not advocating corporate welfarism.  Perhaps,

we  could  consider  an  arrangement where  both  the  SMEs  and

Government share the risk in new areas of investment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as noted by the Minister, small companies still

lag  behind in the area of worker training.  I hope  we  can  do

something  to  ensure that SMEs do not lag behind even  further.

We must not allow some SMEs to dismiss as a hollow platitude the

Government's   view   that  during  this   period,   we   should

consolidate,  build up our core capabilities and strengthen  our

fundamentals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the role of Government to ensure that confidence in

the economy and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>



market  place  is restored quickly.  Everyone and not  just  the

business  community must feel confident.  I  agree  that  it  is

important  for  the  people to support and have  faith  in  this

Government's  ability  to  govern  and  to  protect,  especially

people's  livelihoods.   But how do we achieve  this  with  this

Budget?   How, to borrow a term from Admiral Teo, do  we  ensure

that  our  people sector can ride out the coming storm and  come

out of it better off than they were before?  What can Government

do  to  encourage optimism, strengthen resilience,  and  promote

strong work ethos among the people in this difficult time?   The

last thing we want is for the people to throw in the towel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial incentives to encourage workers to train are one

good  way.  The ordinary worker, however, may feel hard  pressed

to  go  for two or more jobs during this period instead of going

for  some training programme.  Training programmes for some will

be  at best a difficult option with uncertain payoffs.  And what

about people who do not require training?  What about people who

stay  put  in their job and help their companies to grow?   What

about those who choose not to migrate but instead decide to hang

in here with all of us?  What can we do for these people?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I do agree that we must all realise that things will

be difficult this year.  But the Government can do little things

to  calm  our  financial jitters and to allow  us  to  face  the

expected  difficult  time in a stronger psychological  state  of

mind.   Can  we  consider,  for  example,  increasing  childcare

subsidies  so that working parents can concentrate  on  doing  a

good job at their work place?  Can we not delay the increase  in

the  maid levy?  I am sure we can find other ways to bolster the

staying power of our fellow Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the Government's move to continue investing

in  the  young.  I see there are many students in the Strangers'

Gallery.  Spending on education will not be reduced despite  the

economic uncertainty.  This emphasis on the continued importance

of human resources is the right signal to send to the ground.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, measures must also be introduced to

continue  to  protect our young from unhealthy addictive  habits

such  as  smoking.  I am glad to note that duties on  cigarettes

will be increased in line with our national policy to discourage

smoking, especially among the young.  Sir, I would encourage the

Government to increase the duties even further.  Despite all the

campaigning to discourage smoking, anecdotal evidence shows that

it is on the rise.  All in all, smoking is something we can have

less  of  and  even  possibly eradicate from Singapore.   But  I

understand  that  Singapore  being a  cosmopolitan  society  and

wanting  to  attract  foreign talent  must  be  careful  not  to

unnecessarily    alarm    people   with   draconian    measures.

Nonetheless,  Sir,  I  would support any  further  increases  in

duties  on  cigarettes  if it helps to protect  our  young  from

wasting  their  health and damaging their  future.   The  income

earned  from  such duties could be put to good use,  perhaps  in

some of the areas I have mentioned earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the move to continue giving rebates on HDB service and

conservancy charges and rentals to citizens is indeed welcome by

many.   I noted some unhappiness among citizens living in 5-room

flats  as  to  why they have been left out.  Given  the  current

economic  difficulties, they too would feel the pinch.  However,

I am sure they would understand that these measures are meant to

help citizens in certain income brackets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, a group of people which I am concerned

about.   These  are the very poor, perhaps destitute  who  often

have  no social networks to rely upon.  Some, I believe, are  on

public  assistance.   The full impact of the  regional  economic

crisis  could lead to price increases.  In this regard, I wonder

if this group of people would not be affected.  I would urge the

Government  to consider increasing the public assistance  amount

to  this  group  of  people.  It would  show  that  despite  our

difficulties, this Government does care for those who are really

in need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the week after the Budget was announced, I came across

two groups of people wanting to see me during my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>



meet-the-people  session.   The first  was  a  group  of  people

running small businesses at HDB shops and the other was a family

running  a  stall  at a wet market.  The former was  complaining

about  fines  levied  on  them for displaying  items  along  the

corridors fronting their shops.  They complained bitterly  about

poor  business and how it was difficult to make ends meet.   The

latter  group wanted to give back their stall to HDB due to  bad

business.   Bad  or slow business seems to be a recurring  theme

whenever  I  do  my market visits.  I know that all  businessmen

complain  of bad business even in good times.  It is a  business

strategy to evoke sympathy from potential customers.  But  I  am

not  sure that given the current regional economic crisis, their

complaints are merely strategic hyperbole.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our petty traders are feeling the pinch. They do not make

a lot of sales, yet their business costs seem to be high.  In my

area  several stalls have closed down.  We need to do  something

for  these people.  I would urge the Government to consider some

help for these people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am tempted to appeal to the Government to consider a

balanced budget.  Many in this House have spoken about the  need

to stimulate the economy.  However, it is also good to have that

small  budget  surplus for this coming year.   The  Minster  has

assured  us that off-Budget measures will be considered  if  the

situation  warrants  it.   In this instance,  the  surplus  will

definitely come in handy.  On the other hand, using part of  the

surplus to assist companies to grow and develop, as well  as  to

help  families  tide over their finances during  this  difficult

period,  is  an  investment in a better  future  for  all.   The

question is how much of the surplus to use now or later.  If  we

use  all of it now and things get worse, we may end up facing  a

negative growth with no surplus to fall back on.  If we  tighten

our  belts  too much, we may end up with heavy pockets  but  the

economic  flu  may  turn to pneumonia.  We  need  to  avoid  the

temptation  of  emptying  out our  pockets,  but  we  must  take

measures  to  stimulate the economy so that we  are  in  a  good

position to strike at the next economic boom.  I support the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>



overall  thrust  of  the Budget, but I urge  the  Government  to

address some of the concerns I have raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget Statement.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  rise  in support of the motion.  Sir, a few days ago,  I  was

trying  to  think of what to speak in this debate.  Actually,  I

was  thinking  whether I should speak on the tax incentives  for

the  bond market.  But, Sir, given the fact that the bond  issue

has  changed quite somewhat, I thought I would leave  it  to  my

more learned, able and articulate colleagues to talk about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my first reaction to the Budget was that it was a good

Budget  against the backdrop of our uncertain regional  climate,

the  storm  that  is looming, the gloom and  doom.   The  modest

surplus  budget, to me, was just as pro-business as it was  pro-worker.   If it is pro-business, then obviously it must be  pro-worker.  But there are gaps, in fact, some big gaps in the sense

that  it is not pro-worker because it is not addressing the plea

to  increase funding for skills upgrading of workers and  it  is

not  so  pro-business in the sense that not much help  has  been

given  to  SMEs other than the enhanced LEFS scheme and  nothing

much  has  been done for manufacturing companies.  Nevertheless,

Sir, the Budget is a people's budget in the sense that there was

something  for  everyone.  And here, I was quite surprised  when

the  Straits  Times  the  next day said something  like  "Dr  Hu

unveils  a  prudent Budget", implying as if the previous  years'

Budgets were not prudent.  As far as I have been in this  House,

every  year  it  has  been a prudent Budget. Anyway,  Sir,  many

Singaporeans, given the current economic situation, do not count

the  blessings of a reasonably good budget in bad  times.   They

forgot that the Indonesians, Thais and Malaysians are not having

it  as good, and they will never have as good a budget for  some

years to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke to some of my friends when I got home two Fridays

ago.   First, I spoke to a fellow unionist, a university  hostel

friend who works in a bank, and to some other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>



friends from the corporate world.  The unionist told me that  he

was  somewhat  disappointed with the Budget.  He said  that  the

Budget was not good because the income tax rebate was only 5%, a

reduction  from  10%  the  previous  year.   Then  I  asked  him

curiously whether he pays income tax.  He grinned and said  that

he  did not pay income tax, but was just reflecting the views of

what  his  manager  at his workplace had told him  over  coffee.

Most  Singaporeans, Sir, are second-hand complainers!  They  are

just  gracious  enough to complain on others'  behalf  and  lend

empathy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, this friend went on to a more substantive reason as

to  why he was disappointed with the Budget this year.  He  said

that  instead of giving a big financial boost to the efforts  of

NTUC  in skills upgrading, the Government had chosen to say that

it  wanted companies to spend on training like the way it  spent

on  education of our young, our school children.  His point  was

that  while  it  was correct to ask companies to spend  more  on

training  and  upgrading  the skills of our  workforce,  without

strong financial incentives from the Government, it is going  to

be  foolhardy  to ask companies, especially small companies  and

local  enterprises, to spend more on training.  For  most  SMEs,

the  opportunity costs of training their workers, both in  terms

of  time  away from work and the costs relating to  payroll  and

training, can be very significant and Mr Lim Swee Say has spoken

eloquently  about  it.  It also means that the  small  companies

cannot  meet  their production schedules on a daily  basis.   If

they cannot meet the production schedules on a daily basis, what

it  means  is that their companies would be rendered financially

not  viable  both in the short term and in the long  term.   And

especially in times like this, the consideration of the CEOs  in

SMEs is business survival.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless and until Government starts to spend as much on our

workforce  as it does on our school children, it is the  workers

of  Signapore, especially the workers in our SMEs who are  going

to suffer and face the future consequences of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>



structural  unemployment.  While my fellow unionist agrees  with

Dr  Hu  that `nobody can expect lifelong job security', he feels

strongly that many under-educated workers in Singapore  had  for

various reasons lost out on a basic education.  He wants to  ask

Government to play an active role to help provide the funds  for

them  "to learn how to fish for they cannot just depend on their

companies to provide their fish for a life time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my own response to this call by my fellow unionist is

that  he  is  right  to ask the Government for  more  money  for

workers'  skills upgrading but, at the same time,  I  feel  that

companies   cannot  shirk  their  responsibilities   in   worker

training.   I think the Government can encourage SMEs  to  spend

more  on  training  by  taking a lead in the  same  way  it  has

developed  financial  incentives as  a  catalyst  for  SMEs  for

business upgrading activities.  Sir, for example, the Government

used to bear up to 90% of the financial costs if SMEs embark on,

say, ISO 9002 consultancy.  This encouraged SMEs to venture into

such business consultancies.  When this attracted many SMEs, the

Government gradually lowered the percentage subsidy, I  believe,

to  70%.  Likewise, the Government should entice companies  into

training  their  own workforce.  Already, such an  incentive  on

training and payroll costs exists in the scheme initiated by the

NTUC  - the Skills Redevelopment Programme.  What the Government

needs  to  do is to elevate it to a national scheme, as  Mr  Lim

Swee Say has pointed out, so that more funding will be available

to training and more SMEs can be encouraged to join the scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, then there was this other friend that I spoke to who

helps  the Handicapped Welfare Association.  He told me that  it

is  time  that  Government increased handicapped  earned  income

relief  given  the fact that the costs of living  have  actually

increased for the handicapped, especially for those who need  to

employ  a maid to look after them or those handicapped who  need

to  own  vehicles as they  are unable to take public  transport.

He  suggested that the maid levy can be reduced for this special

group and on a case-by-case basis.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>



It is felt that the $3,500 tax relief is insufficient to pay for

the  maid levy and her salary.  On Sunday morning, I flagged off

a  Handicapped Welfare Association's "Wheel, Walk or Jog" event,

and  many  in  the Association have made a plea and  sent  me  a

detailed  proposal which I will be happy to pass  it  on  to  Dr

Richard Hu.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was another friend who had always felt that it

was  time  that  the Government listened to some  feedback  from

young  Singaporeans.   He had attended the Institute  of  Policy

Studies  (IPS) Young Singaporeans Conference last  October.   In

fact,  I  too was invited to attend one of the feedback sessions

together  with  some  of the younger MPs  in  this  House.   The

participants  included some 50 very bright and  upwardly  mobile

younger  Singaporeans holding key positions both in the  private

and public sectors, and they were all largely in their 30s.   My

friend  reminded me that the conference had brought out a strong

message  that  young  Singaporeans like  them  wished  that  the

Government  moved  away  from  the preoccupation  with  economic

growth  and development as the predominant basis of all national

activity and sense of nationhood.  I asked him what had that got

to do with the Budget Statement.  Sir, before you rule me out of

order, his response was that these were fundamental issues  that

public  policy  makers had to reconcile before  public  policies

took root through the Budget Statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have recently received from the IPS a summary of the

deliberations and I think it is worthy for me to highlight  some

of  their thoughts for the Government to consider.  It was  felt

that if the country would become solely a function of `making  a

living',  then the nation would lose its function the  moment  a

better  living can be gained elsewhere.  Economic  logic  is  no

respector  of  national  loyalties.  A sole  preoccupation  with

economics as a basis for nationhood could even undermine  it  in

the long term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it was acknowledged that economic progress was a

necessary  component  for  nationhood  and  social  cohesion  in

Singapore,  more  should  be done to strengthen  the  intangible

sense of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>



citizenship  and belonging.  A sense of attachment to  Singapore

would  hinge on the citizens' sense of fulfilment of their lives

here.   Some  participants  bemoaned  the  fact  that  life  was

stressful  and  driven  mainly by  the  need  to  `pour  on  the

concrete'  with little or no time to `smell the  roses'.   There

seemed  to be a trade-off between productivity and leisure.   It

was  felt that just like productivity, indicators of quality  of

life  need  to be introduced in Singapore.  Some felt  that  the

stresses  and strains that the middle class subjected themselves

to, to attain their material `lifestyle' aspirations were pegged

to  the  patterns of consumption of the developed nations rather

than to the small resource poor city-state of Singapore.  Hence,

"the  pressure is about how to increase comparative  consumption

advantage over one's neighbours."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although not explicitly stated in the conference, the

new  policy to attract foreign talent into the economy must have

provided  a  question posed at the conference, ie, "is  there  a

difference between a Singapore citizen and a permanent resident?

If  the  difference is negligible, should we then just privatise

citizenship?"  If it were perceived that some of the  privileges

of  citizenship  could  be  had for one's  contribution  to  the

economy,  and  gain what a speaker referred to  as  `value-added

citizenship',  it  would  not  be a  large  step  to  eventually

commodifying citizenship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was felt that there was now a sense of cognitive

dissonance  over the Government's discourse on  Singapore  as  a

corporation  and  Singapore  as a  nation  state.   The  current

foreign  talent policy has sent the signal that citizenship  was

valued   by  the  nation  state  according  to  one's   economic

contribution,  but  yet the demand on the Singaporean  has  been

that  he  or  she  should relate to the  nation  state  with  an

emotional  sense  of attachment.  So this issue  of  scholarship

bond is only symptomatic of a bigger problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I quote another person at the forum and he said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`What we suffer from is a contradiction in roles and

responsibilities  ..   If  you  look  at  it  from  a  country's

perspective, issues that you need to consider are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>



unlike  those  of a company's perspective. . From the  company's

perspective,  it is up to the employee to upgrade himself.   [Of

course,   with  some  Government  help.]   From  the   country's

perspective,  we expect the country to upgrade  us  to  be  more

competitive.  If Singapore Inc. were to go to the extreme, there

may  be  [social] fallout, people structurally unemployed  as  a

result of cost-benefit analysis.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was also a need to remember that what may prove

to  be  valuable  in building a nation and in explaining  how  a

society  functioned  could  not be priced  or  quantified.   The

orientation  towards  an  economic cost-benefit  analysis  or  a

managerial approach to governance would overlook these.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other principle to consider, therefore, as we seek to

truly  release  new  energies  for  our  thrust  into  the   new

millennium  could  be  to  choose total,  holistic,  system-wide

solutions over piecemeal sub-optimal ones.  This must begin with

a  rigorous intellectual review of governance and public  policy

in Singapore today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to my philosophical friend, I asked him

that  given this gloom and doom, is there any public policy that

the  Government can review to show that it cares  more  for  the

young   Singapore  professionals  vis-a-vis  attracting  foreign

talent  from  elsewhere?  He said, "I can think of  one  thing."

And  pointing  to me, he said, "and you had spoken  passionately

about it in Parliament two years ago."  He was talking about  my

speech two budgets ago about young professionals' aspirations to

own a landed property or private condominium and their dream  to

own was slipping away from them.  He felt that this was the time

when  property prices have come to a halt, but prices are  still

high.  They are still at the 1995 price levels.  He felt that if

the Government is serious about creating a national identity for

Singaporeans to be rooted to this soil, then this  is  the  time

when  they can help upwardly-mobile young Singaporeans to   sink

their  roots  here.   And he was quick to add  that  he  had  no

pecuniary  interest  as  he  was  already  living  in  a  landed

property.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, he felt that the Government can meet the

aspirations of these young professionals, instead of  trying  to

attract foreign talent, by relaxing the 20% cash downpayment for

the  purchase of private property to, say, 10%.  This is because

many young professionals do not have much cash.  They have a lot

of  assets, but, very often, it is not in cash.  This is a  time

when  the  market is soft that good buys can be  made.   Waiting

for another two to three years will enable them to save and have

more cash, but the market will unfortunately catch up with them.

If  the Government does this by reducing the 20% downpayment  to

10%,  it  will not only win the hearts and minds of these  young

professionals to go beyond Singapore Inc to feel for the country

and  to sink their roots here, but it will also, as a byproduct,

help  breathe some life into the market, though personally I  do

not  like to speak for property developers.  But that is another

story!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me end my speech by wrapping up the view of my

friends  with  a simple story that you might have heard  before,

the  story of the Elephant and the Six Blind Men.  Once  upon  a

time,  there  were  six blind men who wanted  to  know  what  an

elephant  looked  like.   They  wanted  to  learn  by  feel  and

experience  and satisfy their mind as to what an  elephant  was.

So  an  elephant was brought to them.  Mr Lim Swee Say is  here.

He likes to hear jokes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first blind man, who stood near the broad and sturdy

side  of  the elephant, said that the elephant was like a  wall.

The  second  blind man felt the tusk and said that the  elephant

was  like  a spear.  The third felt the trunk and said that  the

elephant was like a snake.  The fourth man touched its  leg  and

knee and said that the elephant was like a tree.  The fifth  man

touched  the ear and said that the elephant was like a big  fan.

The  sixth  blind man touched the tail and proclaimed  that  the

elephant was like a rope.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the moral of the story is this. Like the blind men,

my friends are relating only the aspects of the Budget Statement

that  affect them from their personal perspective.  Other things

are not relevant to them and do not seem to matter and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>



therefore  their  perspective may be somewhat myopic,  from  the

perspective  of a person with a clear vision to see  the  entire

elephant.   But  their  perspectives  are  not  wrong  but  just

incomplete.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Richard Hu and the Government have a clear vision and

can  see  the  big  picture of the elephant,  ie,  the  holistic

picture of the country and they have come up with a budget  that

has  something, however small, for everyone.  While it  may  not

satisfy any one more than the other, it is the right vision  for

Singapore given the regional backdrop.  It is a cautious  budget

and  rightly so.  But, as Dr Richard Hu has said on TV on Budget

night,  the  Government can still make a  number  of  off-Budget

pronouncements  when the course of the sail becomes  calmer  and

less  choppy.   And  I hope that the Government  will  give  due

consideration to some of the perspectives of the `blind men' who

may  have something to add to the big picture.  The blind,  such

as  those  in  my  anecdote, have other sensitivities  that  are

heightened, such as the sense of touch and the aural sense.  For

those of us who can see, but only from our limited perspectives,

it  might  be wise for us to listen and reach out to those  with

heightened   sensitivities  and  needs,  whom  we   might   have

overlooked and not heard diligently enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Bukit Timah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I support the motion standing in the name  of  the

Minister for Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial and currency turmoil that engulfs the whole

Asia  has  caught many people off-guard.  Although the situation

has  somewhat  stabilized,  stock markets  and  currencies  have

collapsed  and there is no sign that recovery is in  sight.   We

are   quite  apprehensive  about  what  is  happening   in   our

neighbouring  countries.  I believe Members have read  from  the

newspapers that in certain countries tens of millions of  people

have  lost their jobs.  The loss of jobs also means the loss  of

incomes.  Furthermore, there is no social welfare system to take

care of them.  The depreciation in their currencies coupled with

two-digit   inflation  could  only  cause   the   situation   to

deteriorate further.  This situation will remind elderly  people

of  the days in the 50s and 60s when there was high unemployment

and  inflation.   We  hope international  financial  authorities

would give a helping hand to these countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been spared this financial and currency

turmoil.   Many  Singaporeans are confident about  their  future

because  we have a strong foundation.  Though affected  by  this

regional crisis, we have been able to withstand it.  Why  is  it

that  when  our  neighbouring countries are going  through  such

economic  crisis we come out unscathed?  Singaporeans  ought  to

ponder  over  this matter.  In the last few years  our  regional

economic  situation  has been good.  We have  surpluses  in  our

budgets.  Many people were rather critical about such surpluses.

Had  it not been for the surpluses we have accumulated over  the

past  few  years  we would not have been able  to  maintain  our

currency  value.  That we are able to keep our Singapore  dollar

strong  is  due  to the fact that we have massive  surpluses  to

support us.  We do not have natural resources, for example,  oil

or  timber.  We cannot support our currency with oil or  timber.

This goes to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



show  that  our Government is correct in accumulating surpluses.

Perhaps now is the time to use some of the surpluses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past 10 years our Finance Minister has worked very

hard  to  give us prudent budgets year after year.  The regional

financial turmoil has taught us a few lessons.  That is  why  we

must  have  able  political leadership  and  a  sound  political

structure.   Economic and social development should go  hand  in

hand.   The  crisis has also put our stamina and mettle  to  the

severest  test  in the most trying conditions.   We  have  shown

ourselves to be able to withstand such buffets and storms.  This

could be attributed to our sound economic and social structures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every election, our Government has been able to recruit

able people to join the Government.  In other countries, leaders

are created by opportunity.  We have been able to carry out self-renewal  in  leadership.  The current budget shows that  we  pay

great  attention  to  the education of our young.   While  other

countries  have  cut  down  expenditure  on  education  we  have

increased it.  When we talk about education we do not  mean  the

acquisition of knowledge only.  We mean the nurturing of an all-rounded citizen.  In the last two days we have been debating the

issue of bond breakers under the EDB scholarship scheme.  If  we

had  strengthened  our moral education such incidents  need  not

have happened.  I hope that the Minister for Education would use

this  precious  expenditure to nurture our next  generation  who

should  not only be well versed in knowledge and technology  but

who are also imbued with sound moral values.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This budget is a very pragmatic and prudent one. It

reflects the Government's steadfastness in the midst of changes.

If  we are united and work for a common purpose, we will be able

to  weather such crisis.  The last two days saw many MPs  asking

the  Finance  Minister  to  tell us more  about  his  off-Budget

measures to help our business community.  I personally feel that

the Minister has already got such plans to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



help  our  business community.  When the time is right  he  will

announce such measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from education, I would like to talk about investing

in  economic infrastructure.  We should be bolder in making such

investments.   Also the business community should  make  use  of

this  opportunity  to better prepare themselves  for  the  years

ahead  when  the  economy turns around.  Another  issue  is  the

training  of  our  workers.   I am a  bit  disappointed  by  the

insufficient  provision for the training of  our  workers.   The

Government  has expressed that more funds will be provided  when

the  need arises.  Some Government agencies have formulated well

thought-out  plans  to get workers to go back  to  training.   I

would  like  to speak at greater length on this issue  when  the

allocations  for the Manpower Ministry come up  for  debate.   I

hope the Minister would be more generous in allocating funds for

this item.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While doing everything we can to promote economic

development we must not neglect social development.   We  should

set  up  a good and sound social safety net.  This social safety

net  has a wider meaning.  It encompasses several aspects.   The

first safety net refers to full employment for the workers.   As

long  as  we  have  sound economic policy and measures  and  our

workers  are prepared to upgrade themselves we will be  able  to

achieve  this  first  safety net.  At present,  this  is  not  a

problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect refers to the need for workers to

continue  to  make themselves employable.  We are worried  about

structural unemployment.  The kind of investments we see in  the

future  require  a  highly  skilled workforce.   The  Government

should not neglect this problem.  Therefore, workers should  try

to  make  themselves  employable as long as  they  are  fit  and

healthy  and  their  skills  be  made  relevant  to  the  latest

technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third aspect of the safety net is rather passive. The

first  safety net is to ensure full employment for  our  people.

The second aspect refers to the need for workers to continue  to

upgrade themselves to be employable throughout life.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>



The  third aspect is social protection.  I do not mean  that  we

should adopt the western welfare system; we should not fall into

such quagmire.  I am referring to our CPF.  Many people make use

of  their  CPF balances to invest in this and that.  Apart  from

purchasing  homes,  we  also use our CPF  balances  to  pay  for

education,  medical  expenses and for our  old  age  retirement.

During  an  economic  crisis,  our  CPF  contributions  will  be

reduced.  What I would like to suggest is that when a worker  is

retrenched something should be done to assist him.  I would like

to  propose the setting up of a livelihood protection net.  When

we  are  in  an  economic crisis, when we  are  having  negative

growth, we can use this sum of money.  How is this operated?  We

can  encourage  employers  and employees  to  co-pay  into  this

livelihood insurance (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). They can use their

CPF  money  to  pay into this fund just like paying  into  their

MediShield  or  MediShield Plus.  When  they  are  not  able  to

maintain their basic living, they can use this money to pay  for

their basic living expenses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I want to talk about is: how are we going to

help  those elderly workers when they are retrenched?  The  NCMP

mentioned  about  our Secretary-General's talk on  retrenchment.

He  said  other  countries  are doing something  to  help  their

unemployed  workers.   What about our  Government?   I  want  to

explain  to him.  Our stand is that the best guarantee  for  the

workers  is  to upgrade their skills and to give them  training.

When  a  company  is faced with retrenchment or downsizing,  the

company   will   retain  only  those  highly  skilled   workers.

Therefore,  we  have  to  continue to urge  our  workers  to  be

upgraded, trained and retrained.  If our local workers' skill is

as good as that of the foreign workers, we will retain our local

workers  unless the foreign workers are better skilled than  our

local  workers.   For  those who are  in  the  unions,  we  have

approached  the  employers  to  devise  other  ways,  eg,   wage

reduction, reducing the number of working days to cope with  the

downturn  in  the  economy.   Should  they  be  retrenched,  our

Industrial Relations Unit also helps them to find new jobs.   We

also help them to go for retraining.  We will pay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>



for  their training expenses.  So I would ask the NCMP  to  read

more of our union's magazines to have a better understanding  of

what we are doing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we adjust our budget, we should not neglect the

importance of workers' training.  It is important that while  we

should do everything we can to strengthen our infrastructure  we

should  not neglect the importance of spiritual development.   I

am  talking about the safety net provided by the family.  In the

past  we  used to receive support from the family, but  nowadays

the  small  nuclear families account for 80%  of  our  household

number.   The close family ties have been eroded.  I would  urge

the Minister to provide more funding to MCD to strengthen family

bonding.   Therefore,  the  Budget should  provide  support  for

technical  education  as  well as  social  education  and  moral

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With better political leaders, better economic policies, I

believe  Singapore  will  convert  this  economic  crisis   into

opportunities  so  that  the people and the  Government  can  be

united  to upgrade themselves to move into the 21st century  and

we will emerge stronger than ever.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I would, first, like to compliment the Minister for coming

up with a good Budget during such a difficult time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would personally describe the Budget that was unveiled as

focused and strategic, one that has laid the foundation for long-term  recovery, productivity and competitiveness.  However,  for

the  short  term,  the Budget has failed to meet  the  immediate

concerns   of   the  general  public  and  business   community,

especially  the  small and medium enterprises who  hold  a  more

pessimistic  view  of the economy.  Quite naturally,  Sir,  they

cannot appreciate the long-term benefits if they are worried and

do not have confidence in the short term.  Instilling confidence

is  crucial  to  business.   You cannot  do  business  by  being

pessimistic.  We need to give businesses enough assistance  that

while they prepare for the worse, they can have enough hope  for

the best.  Unfortunately,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>



the  Budget  fails  to provide the badly needed  stimulus.   The

Minister  diagnosed a mild prescription for an economy many  see

in  dire  need  for stronger dose of economic  stimulant.   Off-Budget  measures are indeed necessary and reassuring.   However,

the fear, as has been expressed earlier, is that it could be too

little,  too  late,  to  help  cushion  the  impact  of  further

deterioration in the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to touch on three main areas of emphasis

in  this Budget, as they really reflect our long-term priorities

and strategies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, education. Investment in education is crucial in

good and bad times.  The emphasis is, therefore, appropriate  at

least in keeping with tremendous momentum to prepare and develop

Singapore into a knowledge-based economy.  $1.3 billion has been

set  aside  for  development expenditure to pay for  new  school

building programmes, media resource library, IT Master Plan, and

a  new polytechnic.  Appropriately, there has also been a strong

recognition  that  education is a continuing process  throughout

life,  from  pre-school to adult worker training and retraining.

But  I would like to highlight the need for more to be done  for

teachers  by  providing more resources in terms of training  and

development.  Most of the training is now provided  through  the

training and development budget.  For in-service training,  this

can be increased and its availability be made more flexible,  so

that  teachers  can  benefit from more resources  and  expertise

outside the Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to suggest greater emphasis be given for

parents  to  be more involved in their children's  education  by

having  them  involved  in new structured school  programmes  to

emphasise the participatory approach, and that education of  our

young is a joint responsibility for all of us to shoulder.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, defence. While it is tempting we should not be

lulled into thinking that defence priorities can be scaled down,

when pressing economic challenges make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



resource  allocation  and  competition  with  other  social  and

economic  priorities  more problematic, it is  precisely  during

these  times that the lack of emphasis on defence can send wrong

and unnecessary signals about the seriousness with regard to the

defence of our nation.  It is during these times that it is more

urgent  for  Singaporeans to remain vigilant and  aware  of  the

vulnerabilities of our nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a more practical note, Sir, I would like to ask for more

resources,  under  public  relations  budget,  to  ensure   that

operationally  ready  units  take  on  a  more  active  role  in

communicating  with NSmen, their families and  their  employers,

instead of living it entirely to otherwise unknown officials  or

bureaucrats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, socio-economic. I would like to touch on a few of

the  specific incentives introduced and highlight  some  of  the

wish  lists  I have here.  Firstly, while the freeze in  rentals

for   HDB  and  JTC  premises  is  a  welcome  move,  there  are

indications  that it may still be higher than  some  in  private

sector  rentals  which are more responsive  to  changes  in  the

economy.   Therefore,  the Government  should  not  hesitate  to

introduce  rental reductions, if this is necessary.   Government

operating  in the open market should be equally responsive  when

this is needed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the tax concession for the transport and

logistics industry is timely in view of the efforts to reinforce

Singapore's  position  as a global city of international  trade.

However,  a foreign industry whose future survival is  dependent

on  its  ability to globalise its operation, incentives to  help

and  encourage  local  companies to globalise  through  mergers,

acquisition  and  establish  global  linkages  would   be   more

significant.  Such incentives are absent from this Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, adjustment to land sales would help to ease the

already excessive supply of private residential properties.  One

estimate  puts it that it would take about three years to  clear

the  existing supply of properties.  Perhaps, the Government may

want  to review the whole issue of Executive Condominiums.   The

inherent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



restriction  on  foreign property ownership and  limitations  on

Singapore  dollar borrowing by foreigners for property  purchase

could  perhaps be reviewed in the light of the current  property

crisis.   The review is also timely in view of moves to  attract

foreign  talents  to  settle  in Singapore.   I  appeal  to  the

Government to now consider allowing CPF monies to be used to pay

for the initial 20% downpayment for property purchase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the increase in development expenditure. As it

is   a  prudent  move  and  would  maintain  stability  in   the

construction industry, it is also more cost-effective  to  carry

out  major  infrastructure and land reclamation works  during  a

period  of  economic slowdown.  I support earlier  proposals  to

reduce  corporate  taxes  and  freeze  public  sector  fees  and

charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that we do not forget those who face problems

during  these  difficult times.  Charitable  organisations  will

find fewer generous and willing corporate sponsors to fund their

various  social and community programmes.  Children and students

whose families may have lost their jobs, though temporarily,  we

have  the responsibility to ensure that they continue to  go  to

schools   and  higher  tertiary  education  through   bursaries,

scholarships,  loans  and grants.  More  funds  should  be  made

available,   for  example,  through  the  Community  Development

Councils to fund these programmes as CDCs too will find it  more

difficult  to  raise funds through voluntary contributions  from

the public.  Employers will face retrenchments, not just skilled

or   unskilled   workers  facing  structural  unemployment   and

therefore requiring retraining, but also white collar staff  and

professionals  who need to acquire new skills and  knowledge  as

their   specialist  knowledge  and  expertise  now  find   fewer

alternatives and opportunities.  I am sure we have the necessary

resources to help these people should and when the need arise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But most important of all, Sir, is the need to galvanise

our  people  during  such  times, for example,  to  help  social

community organisations.  It must be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



made a parcel of every Singaporean life to contribute to society

in  whatever form.  There is enough goodwill in our people  that

we  can  win  their  hearts and minds to help make  Singapore  a

better  place  to  live by helping our friends,  neighbours  and

communities.  Therefore, social community programmes  should  be

enhanced and not reduced.  We should not let the economic crisis

make  us  more  selfish, insular and damage the social  progress

that  we have made so far.  We must come out of this crisis  not

only  to  be  economically stronger but  also  to  be  socially,

culturally and racially more cohesive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br>4.05 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

thank  you very much for allowing me this opportunity to add  my

support  to  the Budget Statement.  37 hon. Members have  spoken

before  me.  There have been a lot of specific suggestions  made

to  Minister Dr Richard Hu.  Let me now confine myself  to  some

general comments on the Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world and the market see our Government as rational and

take the decisions it makes and what it says seriously.  This is

our strength and a national asset.  We have worked very hard  to

achieve this image and confidence.  The Budget encapsulates  the

Government's  view of the economy of Singapore  for  this  year.

The  firmness  and  prudence of the  Budget  reflect  the  quiet

confidence  of the Government.  The market has read  the  signal

and  shares this sentiment.  Hence, the Singapore dollar and the

Stock Exchange of Singapore have remained relatively calm.  I am

also  happy  that  the Government has kept open  the  option  to

introduce  off-Budget measures later should the regional  crisis

worsen and our businesses and industries need help.  This  is  a

much  welcomed  assurance which further enhances  confidence  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two sides to a crisis. Because of the pain

and suffering that accompany it, we tend to see the gloomy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



side.   But there are silver linings to it, especially  for  the

strong  and the prepared.  As a nation and a people,  there  are

useful  lessons to be learned from the crisis.  These are life's

lessons of hard knocks.  If we imbibe these lessons, it would be

like  a  body  developing antibodies after a bout  of  sickness.

With  the  antibodies,  the  body  is  strengthened  and  better

prepared should the disease strike again

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy to share with the House my experiences of

many  discussions  on  the  regional economic  crisis   with  my

residents   and  grassroots  activists.   They  understand   the

regional  crisis  and appreciate its effects.  It  has  affected

them,  their relatives and their friends.  But there  is  little

discontent or moaning.  They have taken it stoically.  They have

hunkered  down.  They have not blamed the Government.  In  fact,

they  praise the Government for its foresight.  Many  said  that

they now appreciate the correctness of Government policies,  the

importance of good, competent, frugal and honest governance with

a long-term view and a sound financial and banking system to the

country.   They understand that this is what has saved  us  from

the  worst  of the crisis.  They also realise the importance  of

individual  responsibility, prudence and thrift.  We  must  take

this opportunity to drive home these lessons, the importance  of

good  governance  and  individual responsibility,  prudence  and

thrift, clear to our people, especially our young.  This is also

a  time  to unite our people.  Once we have experienced  such  a

crisis  and understood the causes and the defence, these lessons

become part and parcel of our psyche as a people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisis is a costly lesson for the region and for us.

We  must  learn and benefit from it.  We must not let slip  this

oppportunity.   An economic system goes through cycles.   It  is

the  law of nature.  Good times follow bad times and vice versa.

We  should  not  be surprised by it.  What we should  do  is  to

prepare  for  the bad times and for the opportunities  to  surge

forward  to  greater height on the rebound.  During good  times,

even the weak do well because there is plenty to go



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



round.  However, economic inefficiencies set in as resources are

not efficiently allocated.  This will go on until the system can

no  longer  sustain  the  growing inefficiencies.   An  economic

downturn  occurs.  When this happens, the weak are  weeded  out,

clearing the way for the survivors to push the system forward to

a yet higher level of performance on the upturn.  The cycle will

go on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the market must be allowed to do its work. The system

must  be allowed to rejuvenate itself for the next cycle.   This

is  not the first crisis that Singapore has faced nor will it be

the last.  In the same vein, the good time enjoyed by the region

and  Singapore is not at an end.  We will rebound and  the  next

stage of our prosperity will be even higher if we can seize  the

opportunities.   To do this, we must keep our  head  during  the

madness  of  the crisis.  We must plan and prepare to  ride  the

next  crest  of  the wave.  In this light, I am assured  by  the

Government's   allocation  of  more  resources  for   education,

security and economic infrastructure development.  This will put

us  in  a  stronger  position to tap the future  growth  in  the

region.   This  is  a  rational and correct decision.   However,

these  are expenditures that many countries in similar situation

have  chosen to cut down as they appear less urgent.  This would

be a mistake.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not be complacent that we have weathered the crisis

better  than  others and allow hubris to blind us.   Comparative

advantage  is  relative.   We  have benefited  from  the  weaker

systems  of our neighbours.  Their deeper problems in comparison

add  to our competitive advantage.  But this is temporary.  When

they recover, their systems will be stronger.  In the long term,

this  will  reduce our advantage and our efforts to  keep  ahead

will  become more difficult.  We must take this opportunity  now

to  move  faster ahead.  We must review our systems, assumptions

and  fundamental  beliefs and make changes  to  strengthen  them

further to make them more robust.  In any case, we need to carry

out  this  exercise regularly, especially now that the world  is

getting   smaller  and  changing  faster  all  the  time.    The

Government has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



been  doing  this.  An example is the announced changes  to  our

financial  system.  The Minister is right to provide  incentives

to develop the financial sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another is the announcement of the modification of the

entry  requirements  of the universities,  something  which  was

viewed almost sacrosanct.  This will give added credence to  our

profession  of  creativity and innovation.  Yet another  is  the

recent  announcement changes to our road tax  structure.   These

are  but three examples.  These are glaring testimonies  to  the

ability and the willingness of this Government to meet difficult

but  necessary changes for the future.  We may need to do  more,

much more in this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I reflect the impact of the regional crisis on our

people,  I  am  reminded  of  the  fable  of  the  ant  and  the

grasshopper.  During the warm summer, while the ants steadfastly

prepared  for  the cold winter, the grasshopper went  about  his

carefree  ways.   The pains and the joys change position  during

winter.   The  colony  of ants knows this and  has  imbibed  the

lesson.    They  will  survive.   I  would  like   our   people,

institutions,  businesses and industries to be  like  the  ants.

During  the good times, we should work hard and prudently  build

up  our  reserves in anticipation of the bad times.  If the  bad

times do not come, we will have extra reserves and resources and

we  would  have  lost nothing.  But when winter  comes,  we  are

prepared  for  it and we will survive in relative comfort  until

spring comes around again.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

allow me to add my support to the motion standing in the name of

the Minister.  At this time of economic contraction and regional

political  uncertainties, I believe it is wise for the  Minister

to be prudent and conservative.  While no recession is in sight,

the   situation  could  be  changed  unexpectedly  if   economic

upheavals rock those Asian countries hitherto unaffected by  the

Asian  flu.   There are lingering uncertainties  as  to  whether

China  could  avoid devaluing its currency in  order  to  remain

competitive.   The  IMF has withheld the release  of  additional

funds for Indonesia as the conditions for market discipline  are

not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>



being  met.   As we read from the papers, President Suharto  has

declared  that  the  mandated  IMF  measures  are  against   the

Indonesian  constitution, perhaps indicating to the market  that

more shocks are in store for the regional economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, Sir, our treasury therefore must have

sufficient  surpluses  to  instil confidence  in  our  financial

system  and to react to unseen circumstances.  Many Singaporeans

are experiencing pains when the growth slows down in the current

time,  and are urging the Government to provide stimulus to  the

economy.  In my view, given that Singapore has experienced  more

than 10 years of double-digit growth, it is not necessarily  bad

to  pause  for a breather and to wring out the excesses  in  our

economy  that  had  happened in the last two years.   Indeed,  I

applaud  the  Minister  for  resisting  calls  for  measures  to

stimulate  the  economy the very moment we  have  encountered  a

small correction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me now turn to the findings of

the  Feedback  Unit.  Last week, the Feedback Unit  conducted  a

series  of  five  sessions with the business community  and  the

general   public.   I  chaired  the  session  for  the  business

community  and would like to take this opportunity to provide  a

summary  of  the reactions of the business community.   In  this

particular session, representatives were drawn from the  various

Chambers  of Commerce, small and medium enterprises as  well  as

selected corporations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general consensus of the budget is that the Minister

for  Finance  has  adopted a reactive rather  than  a  proactive

posture  in  this uncertain time.  Given this mental  framework,

the resultant budget is actually reasonable despite its lack  of

financial   stimuli.   However,  participants  have   questioned

whether  the  Minister  has taken into  consideration  that  the

economy  has contracted rapidly in the last two months,  and  is

indeed  much  worse off than the time the budget  was  prepared,

given that the budget was probably prepared in December and then

reviewed  in January.   The Singapore International  Chamber  of

Commerce's  representative highlighted that there are  instances

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



indicate  that  MNCs  are  repatriating their  expatriates  from

Singapore and taken this as an indicator that the trend has been

going downwards rapidly and is still accelerating.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, all the participants felt that the budget is

biased  towards  helping the financial  sector  and  not  enough

attention has been paid to the manufacturing sector.   In  fact,

several  participants even mentioned in jest  that  perhaps  the

financial sector has the ears of the Government.  So I think  it

is important for the Minister to dispel this misperception.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of helping small and medium enterprises,

participants felt that increasing the risk sharing of  loans  in

the  Local  Enterprise Financing Scheme (LEFS) by the Government

is  laudable.  However, the relaxation of this scheme should not

be  viewed  as  tantamount to extending greater  help  to  SMEs.

Relaxation in qualifications for LEFS only increases the  number

of firms that will qualify for this scheme, in particular, those

with higher turnover and those who are probably already stronger

than others.  But it did not increase the benefits for those who

are already qualified but need greater assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most participants have looked forward to the Government

helping to reduce the cost of doing business in Singapore.  They

felt  that the rental freeze by HDB and JTC and the 15% property

tax  rebate,  while welcome, do not truly address this  problem.

The  reason  being that rentals have been on the downward  trend

for more than half a year.  So the rental freeze for another  12

months  is  a  non-event.  For those renting private  commercial

properties, they would typically enjoy little or no spin-off  as

a result of the 15% property tax rebate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of property tax, several participants took the

opportunity  to  point out that the Government's  action  is  an

irony,  in the sense that IRAS has sent out recent tax  increase

notices  for residential properties.  Yes, they understand  that

such notices are sent out after tracking the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



market for several months, but the action is still contradictory

to  current trends and also adds to the financial burden of  the

taxpayers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has encouraged companies to deal with

excessive labour cost by trimming the variable component of  the

flexi-wage system.  Several SME representatives pointed out that

in  the boom years, small companies have been forced to pay high

wages  to keep their workers, and they did not develop a  flexi-wage system, as the Government encouraged them to do and as  the

larger  companies  have already implemented.  They  pointed  out

that  it is not accurate to assume that all companies can adjust

their wage cost by adjusting the variable component of the flexi-wage  system.  Perhaps these companies have themselves to  blame

for getting into this current state of affairs.  But that is the

reality  of  the  labour market and they continue  to  urge  the

Government to look into the reduction of the employer's  portion

of  the  CPF  contribution as an option to help them  to  reduce

business cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the challenge of workers' training and

retraining,  most participants, including those from  the  SMEs,

believed that the current lull period is the best opportunity to

train  our workers in preparation for the upturn in the business

cycle   which  will  inevitably  return.   With  lower  business

activities, employers could release workers for training without

missing   their   deliverables.   And  workers'  loyalty   could

therefore  be  enhanced  and cemented.  Participants  urged  the

Government  to support the call by the unions to fund additional

workers'  training and retraining.  They also urged the relevant

fund  administrators to speed up the reimbursement  of  training

grants  so  that their cash flow problems could be  reduced,  as

interest  cost  has become quite volatile and has  increased  in

recent months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is obvious that the retail

sector  will  be  facing  another year  of  worsening  business.

Participants expressed surprise that the Government would reduce

consumers' disposable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>



income at this juncture, when in fact the reverse should be  the

case  to help the retail sector.  Their rationale is as follows:

for several years now, the Minister has granted one-off personal

income  tax  rebate of 10%.  It has almost become  part  of  the

income  tax structure.  Therefore, this year's one-off 5% rebate

is equivalent to an increase of personal income tax and the $130

million  of  disposable  income  has  been  withdrawn  from  the

economy.   If  the  Minister has retained  the  traditional  10%

rebate,  it  would  only reduce the $2.7 billion  surplus  by  a

minuscule  5%.  This percentage is not very significant  to  the

surplus but very important to the domestic retail sector at this

very difficult time.  Hence, most of the participants could  not

understand  what moved the Minister to take this  step  at  this

point in time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the feedback session, the Singapore Chinese Chamber of

Commerce  and  Industry  reiterated its request  for  a  central

committee  to  coordinate all Government fee increases  so  that

their impact could be moderated over time.  In this respect, the

Singapore Power's recent rate increase of 5% is being held up as

an  example, and most people felt that the increase is untimely.

Electricity  being essential and unavoidable to all  businesses,

the  electricity rate increase adds to the burden of enterprises

and  manufacturing  precisely at a time when cost  reduction  is

what  all of us should be concerned with.  Many wondered whether

the  corporatisation  of  Singapore  Power  with  its  goal   of

increasing its return of assets is the real reason for the  rate

increase,  rather  than  the higher fuel  cost.   The  Singapore

Chinese  Chamber  of Commerce and Industry also  reiterated  its

call for the Minister to make use of some of the $2.7 billion to

assist businessmen at this time.  And my colleague, Mr Tay  Beng

Chuan, has gone into it in detail, and I would not do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the regional economic crisis also brought difficulties

for  small  traders whose businesses have always  been  done  on

credit.   Their  businesses have been squeezed by  the  regional

economic crisis.  And with the collapse of the Indonesian



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



rupiah,  the  credits extended to their Indonesian clients  have

turned  into  bad debts.  This problem has already dragged  down

the  profits  of  the  big four banks.  The  small  traders  are

suffering in silence.  They are hoping that the credit guarantee

scheme  proposed  by the Prime Minister could be  put  in  place

quickly to enable them to continue their business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many companies have ventured overseas in response to the

call  by  the Government to sprout a second wing, and many  have

suffered   losses   in   their   overseas   subsidiaries.    The

participants would like to appeal to the Minister to allow these

companies  to  make use of such losses in their subsidiaries  to

offset taxable profit in the Singapore parent company.  They are

aware  that the Minister has not been sympathetic to this appeal

in  the  past.  But they would like the Minister to  review  the

situation,  as  much of the losses recently is not  due  to  bad

business judgment but circumstances beyond anyone's anticipation

and control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that summarizes the feedback of the business community

in   the  Feedback  Unit's  discussion.   I  believe  the  views

expressed are fairly representative.  Everyone present was  very

grateful  for the undertaking given by the Minister to make  use

of  off-Budget measures to assist the businesses if the  economy

takes an unexpected turn for the worse, although they would like

to  know  what  those  measures  are  likely  to  be.   What  is

interesting to me is that everyone has an unshakable  confidence

in the Government's ability to turn the tide if the need arises.

Maybe that is a compliment to the Minister for Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an additional comment on the timing of the feedback, the

Singapore  International Chamber of Commerce and Industry  feels

that  it  would  be more meaningful to have a session  with  the

Ministry  before,  rather than after the Budget  sessions.   The

practice by the Hong Kong and Malaysian authorities was cited as

examples of other governments' practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be a disservice to the participants if they came

across as being too parochial in their views.  Therefore, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>



would also like to reflect their attitude when other aspects  of

the  budget  are being touched on.  When it was pointed  out  to

them  that  the  Government  indeed  increased  allocation   for

infrastructure expenditures such as Jurong Island,  Changi  East

as  well  as  provision  in the Ministry of  Education  for  new

schools,  they agreed that these are important stimulus measures

albeit  confined to the construction sector of the economy.   It

is  also useful to note that they have no issue with the defence

expenditure, despite its substantial increase from 4.4% to  4.6%

of  GDP.   Indeed,  they were very supportive  of  the  need  to

maintain  defence  capability,  especially  at  this   time   of

uncertainty.  They generally feel that their concerns would pale

against  the  consequences  of  potential  social  upheavals  in

Indonesia  if  riots  over  cost  of  basic  necessities  become

widespread  and  uncontrollable.   Put  in  this  context,   all

participants agreed that the Minister for Finance has achieved a

judicious  balance between being conservative and  proactive  in

managing our nation's finances at this juncture when the  future

is so uncertain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to compliment the

Minister  for an excellent budget, giving something for everyone

although  the  amount given out is a little bit less  than  last

year.  At a time when other Finance Ministers in the region have

to scramble to keep their nation's finances afloat, our Minister

can  still  boast  a budget surplus.  He must  be  the  envy  of

Finance Ministers everywhere else.  If any Singaporean still has

doubts  of  the  effectiveness and  the  farsightedness  of  our

political  leadership and of the PAP Government, I believe  that

this budget should dispel all such doubts.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, this year's budget can be said to be a  sure  and

steady budget.  It is like a description in the Chinese kung  fu

story: "when a blow is delivered, only 50% of the power is  used

with  some power kept in reserve.  Contain motion with  quietude

and  counter changes with no change."  I support this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



kind  of  budget.  When we make the offensive,  we  must  always

reserve some strength for the defensive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the positive side, this budget seeks to strengthen the

financial  services sector which is the first to bear the  brunt

of the regional financial crisis.  The financial services sector

is a high-value added industry.  It provides the impetus for the

other trades and industries to progress and to ensure their long-term steady growth.  It has the greatest effect in promoting the

overall  economic  development and to provide job  security  and

good remuneration for the workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this year's budget, emphasis is given to the areas of

infrastructure  construction, education  and  defence.   At  the

present stage, these are the areas which need to be strengthened

to enhance our competitiveness.  It is a wise move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, enhancing the skills of our limited human

resources and their employability is also a task which brooks no

delay.  Can the Government consider increasing the allocation of

funds  to support those who are willing and prepared to  upgrade

their skills, so that they can  go for training to enhance their

employability?  Just as my colleague, Mr Lim Swee Say, has  said

just  now,  this is in line with the long term interest  of  our

economic development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the recession in the 80s, we came to know of an

effective  and  not too painful way to help the nation  and  the

people to tide over the crisis, ie, the flexi-wage system. Where

necessary, the flexi-wage system can help lighten the burden  of

labour  cost of the investors without affecting the basic  wages

and   income  of  our  workers.   Can  the  Government  consider

introducing  some  measures to encourage the private  sector  to

fully adopt the flexi-wage system?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the time being, Singapore's economy has not gone into

a  recession  as  in  the  80s.  I urge the  Government  not  to

consider  reducing  the CPF contribution  rates  on  either  the

employers' or employees' sides.  I hope the Minister  will  give

our workers an assurance that until and unless all other options

are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>



exhausted,  the Government will not reduce the CPF  contribution

rates for the employers and employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the effect of the financial and currency crisis, and

the   uncertain   market   situation,  the   voluntary   welfare

organisations  (VWOs) are heading for a  hard  time.   They  are

facing  tremendous  pressure in trying to meet  the  target  for

their  fund-raising efforts.  The Chinese characters for raising

fund  are chou kuan [               ]. The first character  chou

sounds  exactly the same as the Chinese word [            ]  for

worry  or  anxiety.  To these VWOs, to raise fund is  to  "worry

about  the  fund".  It is like the Chinese saying: "the  worries

reflected  on  the frowning brows strike deep into  the  heart".

The   famous female poet Li Qing Zao from the Song Dynasty  once

wrote  a  well-known line: "All the boats on the two rivers  are

not  enough  to ferry all my worries."  Many of these  voluntary

welfare  organisations may be paralyzed because they are  unable

to raise enough funds to attain their target.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, organisations which provide convalescence

service,  recuperative service for the chronic sick or day  care

service  for  the  aged, enjoy a uniform 50%  subsidy  from  the

Government.   Can  the  Government consider  granting  a  higher

subsidy to the financially troubled organisations such as  those

providing these convalescence or recuperative services?  Can the

Government  increase the subsidy from 50% to, say, 65%?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a Chinese idiom kai yuan jie liu [

],  meaning, increase income and decrease expenditure.   If  the

Government  is unable to provide more subsidy, ie,  to  increase

their  income,  then  perhaps  it may  consider  setting   up  a

special task force to help these voluntary welfare organisations

improve    their  efficiency  so  as  to  reduce  the  recurrent

expenditure.  Can  they be given higher rebates on the road  tax

of their vehicles?  This will help to lighten their burden.  The

Government  may  also consider providing some  professional  and

less  expensive  medical  supplies to reduce  their  operational

cost.

Finally, I hope that despite the shadow of this economic crisis,

the Government may seriously consider introducing some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>



measures  to  allow  the  cultural organisations  to  have  some

discounts  when they rent the venues for  performances  to  send

the signal  that the Government's effort to promote the arts  to

develop Singapore into a gracious society will not be slackened.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise

in support of the motion proposed by the Finance Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's budget is indeed a prudent and focused budget.

The  budget signals to all Singaporeans to be prudent  in  their

spending in view of the current regional financial turmoil.   As

highlighted by the Finance Minister, and I quote, "The  regional

crisis is far from over."  Singapore  must be both mentally  and

financially prepared to overcome this crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget has also taken the opportunity to further

increase  the economic competitiveness and capabilities  of  our

country.  The 24.9% increase in development expenditure  clearly

shows  the  Government's commitment and long term strategies  to

position Singapore as a global player in the next millennium.  I

fully  support the increase in capital expenditure on education,

defence and economic infrastructure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now discuss the details of the budget.



<br><br><i>Rebates for individuals</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the regional crisis, Singaporeans, especially

the low income earners, will face tougher times ahead.  Some may

even  face  unemployment or disruption in their monthly  income.

During  such  times, they would need every assistance  rendered.

Being  a  people's Government, this Government must  offer  more

financial  assistance in whatever forms to help Singaporeans  to

tide over the crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about 3,000 families living in 1-, 2- and 3-room

HDB  flats which will be affected by the rental and S&C rebates.

The S&C rebate ranges from 0.5 months to 2 months.  In many town

councils,  arrears for S&C charges range between  10%  and  15%.

The  majority  in arrears owe one, two or three  months.   Thus,

rebates



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>



for  S&C  as  provided by the budget will not  have  any  direct

benefit  to  these families except helping the town councils  to

improve their financial position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Government gave $36 million in rental and

S&C  rebates, which have benefited many Singaporeans.   I  would

like  to  urge  the Finance Minister to consider increasing  the

rental and S&C rebates for 1-, 2-  and 3-room HDB residents.  We

should provide at least three months' rental and S&C rebates  to

1-, 2- and 3-room flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, a more direct way of providing assistance to

the  low-income earners is to increase the utilities rebate  for

these families.  Low income families, in particular  those  with

large families, will encounter much difficulty to cope with  the

increase  in  utility rates.  I do not think  the  provision  of

utility  rebates  will  hamper  efforts  by  the  Government  to

encourage Singaporeans to save water and energy.  In fact,  many

of  these families are very careful in the utilisation of  water

and  energy, as many could not afford to pay high utility bills.

Thus, I would urge the Finance Minister to at least provide $300

for utilities rebates during this difficult period.



<br><br><i>Property tax for residential properties</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the budget provides a 15% property tax rebate for

commercial and industrial properties, no relief was provided for

home-owners.  Many home-owners, especially those in the  private

residential,  are facing high costs of servicing their  property

loans due to rising interest rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993, the Government introduced the GST to widen our tax

base,  and  focused on taxing consumption instead of income  and

investment.   Traditionally,  property  tax  provides  a   major

revenue  source to the Government and enables the Government  to

stimulate  investment and encourage development in the  country.

With  the  introduction  of GST and the Government's  thrust  on

asset enhancement, the role of property tax must be reviewed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, over 90% of Singaporeans are homeowners as a result

of  the efforts of our Government. To levy a 4% property tax  on

owner-occupied  properties  amounts  to  taxing   90%   of   all

Singaporeans.   This  works against the GST taxation  philosophy

and the asset enhancement programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the computation of property tax, which is

based  on  annual  value  valuation, has  resulted  in  lots  of

unproductive  administrative work and unhappy  home-owners.   In

the  last recession in 1985, there were 20,285 objections raised

by homeowners on the annual value valuation of their properties.

Just  imagine how much time and efforts were spent by the Inland

Revenue  Authority  of  Singapore  and Singaporeans  to  resolve

these objections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to urge the Finance Minister to

take  the  drastic  step  to initiate  a  gradual  property  tax

reduction mechanism which will finally remove property  tax  for

owner-occupied properties.



<br><br><i>Development expenditure on education</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend the Finance Minister for allocating a generous

budget for the Education Ministry.  I fully agree that we should

continue to invest and upgrade our educational system to produce

a  quality workforce which will spearhead our country's  economy

into the international market in the next century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of $847 million has been allocated for the

upgrading/rebuilding  and  construction  of  schools   and   the

provision of IT resources.  While it is good that we continue to

strengthen  our  education  system, we  should  also  take  this

opportunity  to increase the capabilities of our  own  local  IT

firms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special tie-ups with the Local Enterprise Financing Scheme

could  be arranged to allow small and medium IT firms to provide

services  to  the  Education  Ministry.   These  exposures  will

definitely  increase  the innovative, creative  and  competitive

capabilities of our IT firms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I hope the Finance Minister would further expand the

Local Enterprise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>



Financing  Scheme to give priority to local IT firms  which  are

keen to serve our Education Ministry.



<br><br><i>IT grant for pre-school centres</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to develop a national attitude of "Thinking

Schools,  Learning Nation", we need to initiate  programmes  for

our  children  at  a very young age.  IT provides  an  excellent

means  to  arouse  interest in creative  learning  and  develops

thinking skills for our children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to start early, and pre-school education plays an

important  role  in  facilitating the  IT  Master  Plan  of  the

Education Ministry.  The PAP Community Foundation, NTUC and some

private   kindergartens  are  providing   excellent   pre-school

education services to prepare our children for primary schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 80,000 students are enrolled in the PAP Community

Foundation  pre-school centres and kindergartens each  year.   A

large proportion of these students enter the main stream primary

education yearly.  However, not all pupils have the privilege to

learn  IT skills in these centres.  The PAP Community Foundation

and  NTUC  are  non-profit making organisations  and  thus  have

limited  financial resources.  As a result, they are  unable  to

provide   computer-aided  instruction  facilities  to  all   its

education centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the Education Ministry would like to

concentrate on main stream education, and let the private sector

provide  pre-school  education  services.   But  the  Government

should   provide   support  to  encourage   private   pre-school

institutions to improve their teaching facilities, especially in

IT-related areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Finance Minister to provide

capital  grants  to  approved pre-school  institutions  for  the

setting up of IT teaching facilities. To further encourage Total

Education of our children, the Government should also set  up  a

Pre-School  Edusave  Fund.  This fund can  provide  subsidy  for

pupils  in pre-school institutions to take up enrichment courses

such as IT, music, thinking skills, and drama to further develop

the potentials of our children.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I hope that the Finance Minister will seriously

consider  providing more rebates for the 1-, 2- and 3- room  HDB

flats,  increase the utilities rebates, reduce property tax  and

provide  grants  for  pre-school centres  to  improve  their  IT

facilities.   If  this cannot be done now, I  hope  the  Finance

Minister  will  take  off-Budget measures to  provide  financial

assistance  to low income families when the full impact  of  the

regional crisis takes place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

support  the Budget.  First, I would like to extend  my  sincere

appreciation  to  the  Government and,  in  particular,  to  the

Minister  for Finance for the prudent fiscal policy  implemented

over the years.  This can be seen in the degree to which we have

been  affected by the on-going economic crisis and  how  we  are

able  to weather the present crisis.  Many Singaporeans in  many

feedback  sessions  have stated that they now understand  better

and, in fact, appreciate the Government's foresight and prudence

in building up the large reserves over the years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the current Budget. The Budget

has  been  hailed by some as a thinking man's  Budget.   I  wish

instead  that it had been everybody's Budget.  While  I  commend

the  Government for being prudent, I feel that this  time  round

the  Government  has  been far too conservative  in  its  fiscal

policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the regional economic environment has turned for the

worse.   The  latest delay in the review of the IMF package  for

Indonesia  and  the disbursement of the second tranche  of  loan

will mean that the political, economic and social environment in

the  region  may get worse.  The latest earnings  warnings  last

week  from  big US electronics corporations will mean  that  the

outlook for the local electronics sector, which makes up half of

the  manufacturing  industry,  will  not  be  too  bright.   The

regional  economic  climate,  the  local  retail,  tourism   and

property  slowdown, coupled with the high interest rates,  lower

incomes,  and  high Government charges, fees and  rentals,  will

only add to the economic slowdown.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some fiscal stimulus was introduced by increasing

capital  expenditure, I was disappointed by the lack  of  fiscal

stimulus   in  increasing  personal  consumption.   I  certainly

expected  more preventive medicine to prevent the  economy  from

getting sick.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I commend the Government on continuing with its long-term objective of developing a good educated workforce, an

excellent  economic infrastructure and a strong  defence  force.

These  are  basics  which  are vital for  our  survival  and  in

maintaining our economic competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to some of the budgetary issues

that are of concern to Singaporeans.



<br><br><i>Income tax rebate for individuals</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue, Sir, is the income tax rebate for

individuals.   There was general disappointment in  the  smaller

amount of income tax rebate that was given to individuals.  Many

have  expected a 10-15% income tax rebate.  Many feel  that  the

tax  payable  will  become an increased burden  in  the  present

environment,  as many Singaporeans use their current  income  to

pay last year's income tax.  Many find it hard to understand why

the  Government is less generous this year when the  economy  is

slowing  down  and many are expected to earn less,  or  even  be

jobless.   The Government could have been more generous  as  the

budget surplus is usually underestimated in the Budget.



<br><br><i>Local Enterprise Financing Scheme</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the second issue, which is, the Local

Enterprise  Financing  Scheme.  Our businessmen  appreciate  the

recognition  by Government of the difficulty in getting  capital

and  the  increased  cost of capital to support  their  business

activities.  The increase in provision from $760 million to $1.1

billion  looks  substantial  on  first  sight.   However,   some

businessmen  have expressed concern that the impact  on  smaller

companies would be negligible for the following reasons:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, there will be an increase in the number of

companies  which will qualify for these loans as the eligibility

threshold has been increased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there may be a tendency to devote more of these

new loans to the bigger and better capitalised companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, banks have already become very stringent in their

lending and smaller businesses would find it even more difficult

to obtain these loans from banks which administer the scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge the Minister for Finance to ensure that

the following requests be looked into:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, that small and big companies are equally assisted

under  the expanded LEFS scheme to avoid complaints of any  bias

towards the bigger companies.  The Minister may perhaps consider

imposing  a  quota on the total amount that can be disbursed  to

the  bigger companies to ensure that smaller companies  are  not

left out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, that banks are not too conservative in setting

the criteria or standard in considering these loan applications,

in  view  of  the present business conditions.  In view  of  the

Government sharing a greater part of the risk in the LEFS scheme

under  the Budget, I think the Government should play  a  bigger

role  and  have  a  greater  say  in  the  credit  analysis  and

disbursement of these loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would request that a Government-nominated

officer  sit  in  the credit committee of the banks  considering

loans  under  the  LEFS  scheme, so that Government  can  gather

faster  feedback on the criteria and standards set by the banks.

This  would  enable  the Government both  to  monitor  the  loan

disbursing  process  and  make  changes  in  the  criteria   and

standard, if necessary, to assist local companies.  Such  timely

feedback  would be essential as companies' financial  needs  and

problems must be attended to promptly before they go under.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to another topic.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>No increased taxes on alcohol</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has traditionally sent a strong message

to  discourage  cigarette smoking by increasing  the  duties  on

cigarettes.   However, I was disappointed  that  the  Government

does  not  view the serious consequences of alcohol consumption.

It   is   becoming  increasingly  clear  that  more   and   more

Singaporeans are consuming alcohol.  Even the young are starting

to  consume  alcohol at a younger age.  By keeping the  duty  on

alcohol  at existing rates, the Government is sending the  wrong

message  to the population, particularly to the young.   I  must

express  my  disappointment that the  Government  has  not  made

alcohol  more expensive and help prevent many Singaporeans  from

getting into this habit which is seductive in the short run, but

addictive  in  the  long run.  Sir, I hope the Government  takes

further measures to highlight the health hazards of alcohol  and

the problems of alcoholism.



<br><br><i>Mortgage interest relief scheme</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the fourth issue, ie, the

mortgage  interest  relief scheme, which was introduced  in  the

Hong  Kong  budget.   One of the consequences  of  the  property

bubble  until  May  1996  has  been  the  increased  number   of

Singaporeans who have committed to property.  Many middle income

families, particularly those with fixed income, are affected  by

the sudden increase in the mortgage repayment amounts.  Some are

tiding  over  with savings.  Some have surrendered and  let  the

banks  repossess their properties.  With the continuing economic

uncertainties,  more  may not be in a position  to  repay  their

property loans.  The general feeling among Singaporeans is  that

local  banks are quick to raise interest rates on loans but  are

very  slow in reducing them.  It may perhaps be some time before

interest rates on property loans come down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would go a long way if some form of mortgage interest

relief  scheme could be extended to residential property owners,

if not as a permanent relief, at least as a temporary relief, on

a year-to-year basis.  Such a scheme could for a start be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



extended  to owner-occupied residential property and be  limited

to  one  property.  I hope the Minister could  consider  such  a

scheme to help residential property owners.



<br><br><i>Help for manufacturing sector</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, Sir, in respect of help for manufacturing sector,

many in the manufacturing sector have criticised the Budget  for

focusing  too much on the finance sector.  Their criticisms  may

not  be  totally  unjustified.  The Minister  may  perhaps  have

chosen  to  wait for the report of the Committee on  Singapore's

Competitiveness  before introducing more measures  to  help  the

manufacturing  sector.   I  would  urge  the  Minister  and  the

Government   to   hasten   the  Committee's   Report,   as   the

manufacturing community is becoming more worried each  day  with

economic  conditions turning for the worse.  So when the  Report

does  come  out, I hope the Minister will move equally  fast  to

implement the recommendations to help the manufacturing sector.



<br><br><i>Freeze on increases in Government fees and charges</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the sixth issue is the call for a freeze on increases

in  Government  fees and charges, which was also highlighted  by

two  other MPs in their earlier speeches.  In the light  of  the

continuing  deterioration of economic conditions,  it  is  quite

clear that the incomes of Singaporeans would remain unchanged or

even  drop.  Government leaders have already agreed  to  a  wage

freeze.  It is quite clear that the private sector will take the

signal  and  follow  suit.   It  is  important  that  Government

Ministries,  statutory  boards, autonomous  agencies  and  other

Government agencies freeze any increase for the next  12  months

until   the  economic  outlook  changes  for  the  better.    If

Government  and related agencies increase fees and  charges,  it

would naturally mean a drop in real income for Singaporeans.  It

will also send the wrong signal to the private sector that it is

okay to increase their rates and charges.  Sir, here, I hope the

Government  can set an example and lead.  On this note,  I  must

say  that  the recent increase by Singapore Power in the  tariff

for electricity did not go



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>



down  with  businesses and Singaporeans at large.   I  hope  the

Minister can implement a policy to freeze all increases for  one

year and not restrict them to JTC and HDB rentals.



<br><br><i>Feedback from business and ordinary Singaporeans</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the seventh issue which has been covered by the Deputy

Chairman  of  the Feedback Unit, Dr Wang Kai Yuen, is  basically

that feedback from the business and ordinary Singaporeans is not

obtained  before the Budget is finalised.  Even if the views  of

businesses  and ordinary Singaporeans are not acceded  to,  they

are  by and large generally happy to at least feel that they had

their  fair  share in giving their opinions and views.   I  must

agree that timely feedback from the interested quarters may make

a  difference.   For  example, the Minister and  his  officials,

while preparing the Budget some time back, may be of the opinion

that  matters have not deteriorated to warrant further  measures

in  this  Budget.   However,  the business  community  which  is

involved  in  the day-to-day running of business will  tell  you

that  matters are deteriorating too fast and that urgent  action

needs to be initiated before many go down.  I would like to urge

the  Minister  to initiate dialogue and feedback  sessions  with

various  interest  groups  prior to the  preparation  of  future

Budgets.  This will certainly enable more timely feedback to  be

obtained  and  enable the Minister to formulate  a  Budget  that

takes  into  account all views and opinions.  It will  certainly

create  a  sense of participation by all Singaporeans  in  their

national Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, let me say that this year's Budget will

certainly   benefit  our  country  and  enhance  our   long-term

competitiveness.   I am confident that Singaporeans  will  rally

behind  the Government in these uncertain times.  Many  business

sectors and individuals will be affected by the ongoing regional

economic  crisis.   I  urge  the  Minister  to  act  early   and

generously to help the affected groups and individuals  as  part

of his off-Budget measures before it becomes too late.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  it  is always difficult to be the last speaker on  such  a

well-responded  debate,  with  so  many  eloquent  and   capable

speakers  before me.  Every aspect of the Budget is  covered  in

such  great  depth  and detail.  Nevertheless,  being  from  the

private sector, I have to join in with those Members who  appeal

to  the  Minister for more speedy and positive response  to  the

current economic turmoil.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax incentives given to the financial sector are most

generous  but  will only yield results in the long  term  basis.

The business sector needs more immediate stimulation.  There  is

a Chinese saying, "Yuan shui bu neng jiu jin huo" [ ] - roughly

translated, "Distance water

cannot fight close fire".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am alarmed at how fast and unpredictable events have

deteriorated  during the mere one week after  the  Minister  has

introduced  the  Budget.  Conflicts have  surfaced  between  the

Indonesian  government  and the IMF.   The  possibility  of  IMF

withdrawing its rescue programme is very real.  The  rupiah  has

plunged  to  more than 12,000.  The whole region's currency  and

equity market is going into another tailspin.  In Singapore, our

banks'  profits  drop  sharply and the international  investment

services  have  lowered the ratings of our top  six  traditional

solid   banks,  from  stable  to  negative.   Corporate  results

released are disappointing.  And the likelihood of us going into

a recession in all probability may become a reality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the building industry which I have very close contact

with,  the  situation  is  far from stable.   Some  construction

companies  are  already in danger of going into liquidation  and

have  assigned their existing work for others to carry on.  Most

of  the consultancy firms in this industry are actually engaging

in  retrenchment  exercise.  Some have gone  into  restructuring

where they combine retrenchment and overall pay reduction in the

hope  that  they can preserve as much as possible  the  existing

organisation  structure.  Although this is a move in  the  right

direction, how long and to what extent they can last



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>



remain  a very pessimistic question.  Although it should be  the

Government's  responsibility to ensure the  success  of  private

enterprises, in times of very unusual crisis like  this  one  we

are  confronted  with,  the Government can  be  instrumental  in

assisting them to survive through this difficult period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a question of propping up the interest of a few

individuals  but  rather  how to ensure our  long-term  national

interest  can  be safeguarded.  For example, if  the  Government

introduces measures to stabilise the property market, it  should

never  be  seen  as an act of helping a handful  of  developers.

Their individual survival is inconsequential, but for the reason

that  a  complete collapse in the property market will not  only

affect  nearly  90%  of our people who are home-owners  and  the

implication  of  such  fall-out will also have  a  very  serious

negative domino effect on our economy.  One only has to look  at

what  is  happening  in  the property market  in  Indonesia  and

Thailand to realise the serious consequences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have always taken comfort in the fact that we have built

a strong foundation in Singapore through having good governance,

developed a world-class infrastructure and cultivated  a  highly

educated and skilful workforce.  This is the reason why we  have

achieved  phenomenal  economic  success  in  the  last   decade.

Therefore,  it  is  of  paramount importance  to  preserve  this

irreplaceable asset, be it in the private or public sector.   We

have to ensure that in coping with the inevitable crisis in  our

economy during the next few years, we must do everything we  can

to  keep the infrastructure in all our businesses, manufacturing

and professional sectors intact.  It has taken us the last 20 to

30  years  to  build up this infrastructure and  much  has  been

invested in time and money to build up the hardware and software

as well as to develop to the fullest the human resources.  If we

allow  it  to  disintegrate, the implication  can  be  extremely

negative.  Not only all this talk about the advantages  we  have

over our neighbours in being able to jump start our economy when

the region's economies recover will be neutralised, but our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



achievements in the past three decades may be just mere  history

and our vision for the future may never be a reality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is essential for the Government to act now to

induce  greater  confidence into the already depressed  business

climate.   Much  more can and should be done  in  terms  of  tax

reduction,  rebates or any measure to reduce the cost  of  doing

business.   We  must  help  to lift the  sentiment  and  restore

confidence  in  the  market.  We must position  ourselves  as  a

strong  economic force to ride the wave of recovery.  Otherwise,

we  will have to join our neighbouring countries to struggle  to

rebuild our economy long after this crisis is over.  I have full

confidence  that, with sound and decisive Government action  and

our  resilient population, we will be able to ride through  this

storm.   All  we need is for the Minister to provide  some  high

octane fuel to keep our economic engine running.

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I would first like to thank all Members  of  this

House who have spoken on the Budget over the last two days.   As

usual,  time  will  not allow me to respond to  all  the  issues

raised.   I  will therefore focus on the main issues  and  leave

other  matters  of  details  which  are  under  the  purview  of

individual Ministries to the Committee of Supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have reflected the sentiments of businesses

that  the  economic situation is worse than what the  Government

had  thought, and that more should have been done  now  to  help

companies  and  individuals cope with the  difficulties  brought

about by the regional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>



crisis.  There were also comments that the Government should  be

proactive  rather than wait for the economic climate  to  worsen

before  reacting.   A  number  of Members  have  also  expressed

concerns  that  the Budget has not offered enough  help  to  the

manufacturing  sector and the small and medium enterprises,  and

that  there were not enough new initiatives to give a  boost  to

the  training and  retraining of our workers.  I will deal  with

these issues in turn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first address the concern that the Government does

not seem to realise the full extent of the difficulties faced by

businesses  and  that it is overly sanguine about  the  economic

outlook.  The Ministry of Trade and Industry's forecast that the

economy will grow between 2.5% and 4.5% in 1998 was made against

a  volatile  regional  backdrop.   It  was  based  on  the  best

available  data  on  business  and economic  conditions  in  the

future.  Besides timely hard data on the overall economy and the

major sectors compiled on a monthly and quarterly basis, it  has

also taken into account the qualitative first-hand feedback from

businesses  and  surveys  of  business  expectations.   Relevant

statistics on the economic performance of the OECD countries and

the  regional  economies  are also being  closely  monitored  to

ensure early assessment of changes in the economic climate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI's assessment is that while the overall economy is

expected  to slow down significantly this year, the impact  will

be  uneven  across sectors and businesses.  Businesses servicing

the  region  will be affected the most.  Those with revenues  in

regional  currencies will experience exchange losses.   However,

multi-national  companies  and  businesses  servicing  the  OECD

markets  in  the West will not be affected as much.  Those  with

revenues  in  US  dollars  may in  fact  have  gained  from  the

appreciation of the US dollar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many SMEs service the regional countries, they have felt

the  brunt  of  the regional crisis almost immediately.   It  is

therefore not surprising that feedback from local businesses  is

that they are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>



already  feeling  the  impact  of  regional  economic  problems.

However,  many  MNCs  and their supporting companies  which  are

servicing  the  US  and  EU markets are still  enjoying  healthy

growth.   The  US and EU economies are expected to grow  between

2.5% and 3% respectively this year.  With about half of our non-oil  domestic  exports destined for these markets,  the  current

assessment  is  that  overall economic growth  this  year  would

remain  positive,  although significantly lower.   According  to

MTI,  although  the  January trade and production  figures  were

weak,  that  was partly statistical, as there were less  working

days  this year due to the festive period. Preliminary estimates

for  the  two months of January and February this year  indicate

that  non-oil domestic exports grew 11.6% compared to  the  same

period  last year.  There is therefore little evidence  at  this

point  in time to suggest that the economy will go into negative

growth in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is against this backdrop that we have come up with the

current   package   of  relief  measures   for   companies   and

individuals.  For businesses in general, which are  expected  to

continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate, we have provided some

relief  in the form of property tax rebate, abolition  of  stamp

duty on most instruments and rental concessions by  JTC and HDB.

For the property sector and SMEs which have been more badly hit,

we   have  implemented  additional  measures  to  address  their

specific  concerns.  These include scaling back the  release  of

Government  land and reinstating the property tax exemption  for

land under development.  We have also significantly enhanced the

Local   Enterprise   Finance  Scheme  to   address   the   SMEs'

difficulties in obtaining working capital.  For individuals  and

households,  despite slower revenue growth,  we  have  continued

with  the  income  tax rebate and the S&C rental  and  utilities

rebates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs have expressed the view that the tax and non-tax

rebates  should not have been revised downwards  from  the  last

Budget, especially when they are most needed by people in  these

more  difficult  times.   There is also a  suggestion  that  the

rebates should be based on per



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



capita  income.  Tax and non-tax rebates were given in the  past

for  good  economic performance and when budget  surpluses  were

healthy.  They were like bonuses given out by companies in  good

years.  Generally, in difficult years, no bonuses will be given.

These  rebates should not therefore be taken for  granted  as  a

permanent feature of our budget.  Even without the rebates,  our

personal income tax rates are already amongst the lowest in  the

world.   The rebates should be seen for what they are -  bonuses

given  in good years.  Although we expect much slower growth  in

1998, nonetheless a rebate has been given this year, but more as

a  measure  of relief to individuals.  In a period  of  economic

downturn, we should expect some belt tightening all round.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members felt that the rebates should have been higher,

citing wage cuts and retrenchments as reasons.  But we have  yet

to  see across-the-board wage cuts and widespread retrenchments.

There  have been some lay-offs, but the retrenched workers  have

found  alternative jobs without too much difficulty.   There  is

therefore  no  need for significant additional rebates  at  this

time.  I  have said that the Government is prepared to  increase

the rebates at a later stage if it is necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the suggestion that the rebates be based on per

capita  household income of HDB households rather than  by  flat

size, I agree that  rebates based on per capita income would  be

more equitable, but the administrative cost of ascertaining  the

household income of every HDB household will be prohibitive.  We

have  therefore opted for the simpler method of  going  by  flat

size as a proxy for household income.  HDB's survey results have

shown  that the per capita household income generally  increases

with the flat size.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The package of relief measures announced in the Budget

should be adequate if the economy does indeed grow between  2.5%

and  4.5% this year, especially if the actual growth is near the

upper end of the range.  However, the Government also recognises

that  the  economic  outlook  is very  uncertain.   If  economic

conditions should deteriorate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



sharply, further relief measures would obviously be called  for.

I  have  therefore taken pains in my Budget Statement to  stress

that  the package of measures is based on current assessment  of

the  economic  situation.  If there should be a significant  and

sudden  downturn,  the Government will not hesitate  to  respond

with  off-Budget  measures.   I  want  to  reiterate  that   the

Government has ample resources and is ready to implement further

relief measures where necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of Members have asked what these additional

measures  would be. These could take the form of  deeper  income

tax   and  property  tax  rebates  as  well  as  other  measures

implemented during the 1985 recession.  There could even be  new

measures  tailored  to  meet the specific  needs  of  particular

sectors  of the economy.  We will closely monitor the indicators

for  any  signs  of deterioration and are prepared  to  step  in

quickly to cushion the economy from any sudden shocks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have also said that the remedial actions taken

by Government may come too late.  They prefer Government to take

a  more  proactive approach and do more now, rather  than  react

passively  to  developments.   But  the  Government   has   been

proactive  in putting together the current relief  package.   We

would  have taken further actions if, by themselves, they  could

have   prevented  a  deterioration  of  the  external   economic

environment.  We must remember that, unlike the 1985  recession,

we  are  not trying to correct structural weaknesses within  our

economy  which require immediate adjustments on our  part.   The

problems  we  are facing are externally imposed and  beyond  our

control.   Given the nature of the problem, we should not  over-react  and  direct  our  resources  aimlessly  now  to  mitigate

problems that have yet to arise.  Instead, we would do  well  to

wait  for  developments to unfold and then  act  decisively  and

purposefully to offset the impact on the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have asked if there is a threshold GDP growth

rate which must be reached before the Government would act.   In

other words, would the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>



Government intervene only if there were a recession.  I can  say

that  the  Government  does not have a  particular  or  absolute

threshold GDP figure in mind.  As I have mentioned earlier,  the

impact of the regional problems on the economy is expected to be

uneven.  If the situation for certain sectors should deteriorate

rapidly,  we  do not have to wait for the whole  economy  to  be

similarly  affected  before taking action.   Further,  while  we

would want to base our actions on some hard numbers, instead  of

relying  just on anecdotal evidence, we do not have to wait  for

all  the  hard  numbers  to come in if  the  feedback  from  the

business   community   corroborates   the   available   economic

indicators.  In deciding what additional off-Budget measures  to

introduce and when to introduce them, we will have to be  guided

by  both  qualitative and quantitative factors.  The  Government

will  keep in close touch with the business community  and  will

not hesitate to respond quickly with the appropriate measures as

and when necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal specifically with the concerns of the

manufacturing  sector  and the SMEs  over  the  absence  of  new

incentives for these two sectors.  The perception is that the FY 1998

Budget continues to favour the financial sector  and  that

not  enough has been done for the other two groups.  The  reason

for  the  Government's  focus on the financial  sector  and  its

seeming  neglect  of  the  manufacturing  and  SME  sectors   is

straightforward.   There  already  exists  a  plethora  of   tax

incentives and assistance schemes created for both manufacturing

and   the   SMEs   over  the  years.   Pioneer  tax   exemption,

concessionary tax rates and other tax incentives which are  only

now  being extended to new areas in financial services and cyber

trading  have long existed for the manufacturing sector and  the

SMEs.   All these incentives have worked very well for  the  two

sectors.   To illustrate, the various tax incentives granted  to

the  manufacturing sector has resulted in revenue loss  of  more

than $500 million in Year of Assessment 1996.  To help companies

in their business development and skills



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>



upgrading,  a  block vote of $1.3 billion for  grants  and  $3.3

billion  for  loans  have  been set  aside  under  the  Economic

Development Assistance Scheme.  In 1994, we also started the  $2

billion  Cluster  Development Fund to  enable  EDB  to  go  into

business  partnerships with companies that  are  venturing  into

promising  new  areas of business.  To-date,  a  total  of  $794

million from the Cluster Development Fund has been committed  to

various   projects,   of  which  $780  million   was   for   the

manufacturing sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SMEs have long enjoyed Government support. There are

currently  more than 60 programmes to assist SMEs  at  different

stages  of  development.  The two flag ship programmes  are  the

Local   Enterprise  Finance  Scheme  and  the  Local  Enterprise

Technical  Assistance Scheme.  In 1997, applications  under  the

two  schemes increased by 13% to about 2,000 compared  to  1,700

applications  in  1996.  To-date, a typical  SME  applicant  has

received,  on  average, about $800,000 in loans and  $41,000  in

grants.  In the FY 1998 Budget, I have announced that the  scope

of the Local Enterprise Finance Scheme has been extended to make

short term loans even more accessible to SMEs to help them  cope

with the unexpected economic downturn.  Altogether, $1.1 billion

has  been set aside for this purpose.  Other forms of assistance

are  also  available,  such  as the Local  Enterprise  Upgrading

Centre,  which  is a first-stop centre to assist SMEs  in  their

development programmes.  Since its establishment two years  ago,

the  Centre  has  handled more than 6,000 cases  of  assistance.

There  is  also a host of training programmes specially tailored

to meet the needs of SMEs.  A great deal of effort has been made

to   promote  these  training  programmes,  such  as   providing

simplified bilingual application forms and holding of  seminars,

conferences and the distribution of brochures and so forth.   As

a  result  of these efforts, more than 9,500 SMEs have benefited

from  the  training programmes funded by the Skills  Development

Fund in fiscal year 1996.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members were disappointed that JTC and HDB are only

freezing posted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>



rentals  and moderating rental adjustments for existing tenants.

They  would  have liked to see JTC and HDB rentals  reduced.   I

would  like  to  assure Members of the House that  JTC  and  HDB

rental  reductions are not precluded if conditions  warrant  it.

For  the  present,  the  freezing  of  posted  rentals  and  the

moderation of rental adjustments where existing rates are  below

the posted rates is considered sufficient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members have also spoken on the need to give greater

support  to training and retraining.  Let me reiterate that  the

Government  fully  recognises the  importance  of  training  and

retraining.   As  our economy continually restructures  to  move

into  more higher value-added activities, constant upgrading  of

the  skills of our workforce is paramount.  I will touch briefly

on  a  number of new training schemes launched recently  or  are

under consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC first launched the Skills Redevelopment Programme

(SRP)  in 1996 to equip lower educated workers with the relevant

skills needed to enhance their employability.  The programme  is

supported  by PSB, EDB and ITE.  The SDF provides up to  80%  of

the course fee and EDB defrays up to 70% of the absentee payroll

through  its INTECH grant scheme.  Some 50 companies, mainly  in

the electronics industry, have signed up about 5,000 workers for

the SRP.  Around 1,000 workers have started training.  More than

50% of the trainees are aged 40 and above.  The expansion of the

SRP into a national programme is now being considered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A "People Developer" Scheme was launched in December 1997

to recognise companies with comprehensive systems for developing

staff.   SDF  is  providing  80% of  the  consultancy  cost  for

implementing  the  scheme.   A new National  Skills  Recognition

System  will be piloted in the second half of 1998.  The  system

will  certify worker skills and provide a progression  path  for

the workforce, thereby encouraging workers to raise their skills

base  and help employers reward skill attainments.  PSB is  also

working  on  a  Critical Enabling Skills  Programme  (CREST)  to

prepare



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



the workforce for a knowledge-based economy.  The programme aims

to equip 50% of the workforce with competency in key skill areas

such  as  learning-to-learn,  group effectiveness,  organisation

effectiveness and leadership by the Year 2005.  It  is  expected

to  be  launched  in the second half of 1998.   A  Job  Redesign

Programme   is   also  being  redeveloped  to   help   companies

restructure  their jobs and processes for greater  productivity.

PSB   will   provide  training  and  consultancy  to   companies

interested in the programme with funding from the SDF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the SDF provides between 50% and 80% funding for

the  course  fees  of the programmes it supports.   Total  grant

commitments  made  by SDF in the fiscal year 1996  rose  to  $72

million compared to $68 million in FY 1995.  Should there  be  a

dip  in  the  pace of training over the next one  or  two  years

because  of  the  economic slowdown, SDF  is  also  prepared  to

increase  its  support level selectively in  critical  areas  of

training.  Government will also consider supplementing SDF  with

additional funding, if necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before I move on to address other concerns by Members,

allow  me to restate the basic tenets of the Government's fiscal

policy.  In years of strong economic growth, our aim is  to  run

budget  surpluses to augment our foreign reserves.  The reserves

are  a buffer against unforeseen shocks to our economy.  Members

will   have  seen  how  important  financial  reserves  are   in

instilling  confidence among investors in our economy.   If  not

for our large stockpile of reserves, we would have been buffeted

much more by the regional turmoil.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accumulation of reserves, however, is not achieved at

the expense of heavy taxes that burden the economy.  This is  in

line with another basic tenet of our fiscal policy, which is  to

maintain  a  competitive tax regime which taxes the  factors  of

production as lightly as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our fiscal policy has served us well. When times are not

so  good, as is now, we will be prudent and target for a reduced

surplus.   But  when  times are bad, we are prepared  to  run  a

budget deficit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



and  draw down on reserves, as we did during the 1985 recession.

Over the years, we have also lowered our tax rates progressively

to  ensure that they remain competitive.  Our current tax regime

is  still  competitive.  We have a wide range of tax incentives,

which  means that the actual average rate of tax is  lower  than

the  corporate  tax rate of 26%.  Our extensive network  of  tax

treaties  also help to lighten the burden of companies operating

in  Singapore.   We  have  been  consistent  in  maintaining   a

competitive  tax  regime  and will not hesitate  to  adjust  the

corporate  tax  rate  if  there is  a  need  to  strengthen  our

competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now turn to specific concerns raised by other

Members.  But first, I will deal with some misplaced suggestions

from  the  NCMP and the Opposition Members.  Both  Mr  Low  Thia

Khiang  and  Mr Jeyaretnam have asked that the GST be suspended.

Mr  Jeyaretnam claimed that GST would raise prices significantly

but  that Government had nonetheless introduced the tax  because

it  would generate significant revenue.  He also suggested  that

basic necessities be exempted from GST.  Mr Jeyaretnam may  like

to  know that the Cost Review Committee had in 1996 studied  the

impact  of  GST  on  the  cost of living of  Singaporeans.   The

Committee  concluded that GST did not cause prices to shoot  up.

Instead, it resulted in only a one-off rise in the CPI  in  1994

of  less than one percentage point.  Inflation in that year also

remained low at 3.1%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the claim that the Government had introduced GST to

raise  additional  revenue, I would like to point out  that  GST

has  remained revenue negative every year since its introduction

in  1994 because of the accompanying cuts in direct and indirect

taxes  and the generous GST offset package introduced.   In  the

four  years  between FY94 and FY97, total GST  collections  were

$6.7 billion.  But the total revenue loss in the same period was

$8.2  billion.   The  net revenue loss to  Government  was  $1.5

billion  in the last four years.  If we were to suspend GST,  it

would result in a further revenue loss of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>



$2  billion a year.  Even if we need to stimulate the economy by

$2  billion, suspending GST across the board may not be the best

way  to  do  it.   We would do better to adopt a  more  targeted

approach  and apply the money judiciously to specific areas  and

groups which are more in need of help from the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Mr Jeyaretnam's suggestion to exempt basic

necessities  from GST, the matter has been discussed  at  length

before  the implementation of GST.  But I will repeat the  basic

considerations here for his benefit.  The GST is designed to  be

comprehensive to keep the GST system simple, thereby the cost of

administration  low.   To single out items for  exemption  would

complicate  the  entire  GST system and  increase  the  cost  of

administration  of  the tax.  This has been  the  experience  of

other  countries where such exemptions are allowed.  It is  also

not  an  effective way to help the lower income  households.   A

survey  on the expenditure of households conducted prior to  the

introduction  of  GST  showed  that  exempting  food  and  other

necessities  from GST will benefit the more well-off  much  more

than  the  lower  income households.  According  to  the  study,

exempting food as a whole from GST will benefit the high  income

households   3.5  times  as  much  as  from  the  lower   income

households, and exempting health expenses or education from  GST

will  benefit high income households eight times as much as  the

lower income households.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam also asked whether there was a need to

continue  with the water conservation tax now that there  is  no

longer  any  threat that our water supply will be cut  off.   He

also  asked what the $2.3 billion of "Other Taxes" meant.  Water

is,  and will always remain, an important strategic resource for

Singapore.   The water conservation tax was intended to  promote

water   conservation  and  slow  down  the   growth   in   water

consumption.   The  objectives of the tax  remain  relevant  and

there  is  no reason to abolish it.  The "Other Taxes" which  Mr

Jeyaretnam referred to is mainly foreign workers' levy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang has said that rebates to individuals are

not significant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



and  that the assistance to businesses also did little to reduce

their fixed operating costs.  On personal income tax rebates  to

individuals,  I would like to remind Mr Low that the  5%  rebate

given  is at the same level of that which was given between  the

years  1990 and 1994.  It was only in recent years that we  have

given  a  rebate  of  10%.   A  5%  income  tax  rebate  is  not

insignificant.  And as I have said, the Government  is  prepared

to  increase  the  rebate  if this was found  to  be  necessary.

Likewise,  for  assistance  to companies,  the  Government  will

provide more relief measures, if these are needed.  But  Mr  Low

is  correct that there are certain costs faced by companies over

which  the  Government can do little.  These include wage  costs

and interest costs which are determined by market forces.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong has berated the Government for stopping

transfers  to  Edusave and Medifund in this  year's  Budget.   I

would like to remind Mr Chiam that in FY97, the Government  made

its  final contribution of $500 million to the Edusave Endowment

Fund  to reach the targeted fund total of $5 billion.  Mr  Chiam

should  congratulate the Government for the early fulfilment  of

its commitment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Medical Endowment Fund, I have already informed

the  House  in  my  Budget Statement that  there  is  more  than

adequate  income from this fund to meet projected  disbursements

in  FY98.   Hence, there will be no curtailment in disbursements

from both the Edusave and Medical Endowment Funds this year  for

lack of funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam has also suggested that the Government allow

retrenched workers to draw parts of their CPF.  Mr Chiam must be

aware  that  the  CPF savings are meant for members'  retirement

needs.  Allowing withdrawals of CPF savings for short-term needs

will severely affect the retirement needs of Singaporeans in the

long  run.   Easy  withdrawal  of CPF  may  also  undermine  the

incentive for workers to seek alternative employment or  undergo

training and upgrading in the event of unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam has also accused the Government of not keeping to

its electoral



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



promise  of  continuing  with the Main Upgrading  Programme.   I

would  also  like  to  remind Mr Chiam that the  Government  has

always  said that the pace of the Main Upgrading Programme  will

be  determined by the size of the budget surplus.   With  slower

economic  growth and lower budget surpluses, the MUP  programmes

have been adjusted downwards, but Mr Chiam should note that  the

Government will continue to spend a substantial $480 million for

the Main and Interim Upgrading Programmes in this year's Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few Members have also expressed concern that the Budget

had  not  offered  much  assistance to the  retail  and  tourism

sectors, and that the reduction in personal income tax rebate to

5% would, in fact, withdraw greater liquidity and further dampen

the  retail sector.  As I have said earlier, the personal income

tax rebate is a reward for good economic performance.  Moreover,

given  the  current cautious consumer spending mood,  I  do  not

think  that a higher income tax rebate would offer much help  to

the retail sector.  Government already has various programmes in

place  which provide assistance in funding for both  the  retail

and   tourism  sectors.   For  instance,  Government  has   been

enhancing retail infrastructure and providing upgrading in areas

such  as stock control, shop management and staff retraining  to

improve  the  competitiveness and resilience of  our  retailers.

For  the tourism sector, the Singapore Tourism Board also  helps

industry  members  to  obtain financial  and  manpower  training

assistance  from  schemes  such as  the  Innovation  Development

Scheme  and Initiatives for New Technology (INTECH) Scheme.   In

addition,  approved  tourism  projects  can  also  qualify   for

Industrial   Building  Allowances,  Investment   Allowances   on

approved expenditure as well as property tax concessions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Swee Say has asked whether more funds could be

allocated to the EDB and other economic agencies, to enable them

to take the opportunity to attract



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>



more investments into Singapore.  I would like to assure Mr  Lim

that  the Government is always open to opportunities to  attract

investments  into  Singapore.  In FY98,  $176  million  will  be

provided for EDAS grants, compared with $131 million in FY97,  a

34%  increase.  We are prepared to increase the funding if  this

should prove necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo has asked for rebates or concessions to be given

to  promote  savings.  As a general rule,  we  do  not  want  to

distinguish between different types of income for tax  purposes,

as  it  could  otherwise  result in  economic  distortions,  for

example,  it could skew investment decisions if interest  income

was  favoured  over, say, dividend income.  There  is  also  the

question of equity.  Generally, those who derive the same income

should  pay the same amount of taxes.  If we were to selectively

exempt certain types of income, we could have an anomaly of high

income  earners  paying very little taxes  if  their  income  is

mainly from tax-exempt sources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Ravindran have suggested that we

provide relief for mortgage loans, similar to what Hong Kong did

in  its FY98 budget.  I should point out that in Hong Kong, most

people  live in privately owned housing which is very expensive.

Because  of  Hong  Kong dollar's peg to the US dollar,  interest

rates  are  also much higher than in Singapore.  Hong Kong  home

owners,  therefore,  pay hefty mortgage  rates,  hence  mortgage

relief  is needed.  In the case of Singapore, more than  85%  of

our  population  live  in  HDB  flats  and  they  already  enjoy

subsidies,  not only on the purchase price of their  flats,  but

also on the low mortgage interest payments.  Therefore, there is

no need to provide further tax reliefs on mortgage loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad has asked that a multi-tier corporate tax

system,  with lower tax rates for smaller companies, be adopted.

This was raised in last year's Budget debate and I would like to

reiterate that a multi-tier tax system will create opportunities

for tax planning, such as a breaking-up of companies to pay less

tax.   To  guard  against these, elaborate tax  rules  would  be

needed, which will lead to higher tax compliance cost.  Having a

low



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



tax  rate  may also not help smaller companies in their start-up

phase  anyway, since they will not be paying much taxes  in  the

first place during their start-up phase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin has asked why the property tax rebate was

extended only to industrial and commercial properties,  but  not

residential properties.  The property tax rebate was granted  to

ease  the  cost  of  business.  In the case of  individuals  and

households,  it is more meaningful to extend income  tax  rebate

and  rebates  on  service  and conservancy  charges  and  rental

charges.  Home owners are already taxed at a lower concessionary

tax  rate  of  4%  on  the  annual value  of  their  properties.

Further,  with  the  property tax rebates given  since  1994  to

offset GST, currently the majority of HDB households living in 1- to 4-room flats do not pay any property tax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also spoke on the unhappiness of house owners in

having to resolve disputes over their annual value of properties

with  IRAS.  It is the duty of the Chief Assessor to ensure that

the  annual value conforms to the statutory definition of  being

the  estimated annual rental that the property can fetch in  the

market.   Home  owners  can object to any adjustments  of  their

annual  value within 21 days of the notice to adjust the  value.

Home  owners  simply  need to complete a one-page  form  stating

their grounds of objection.  The Chief Assessor will review  and

adjust  annual values accordingly if there are valid grounds  of

objection.  If home owners disagree with the valuation, they can

appeal to an independent Valuation Review Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan and Dr Wang Kai Yuen expressed concern

over  the  recent upward revision on the annual values  of  some

properties.   Since  January this year, IRAS has  been  actively

reviewing  properties  with  a view  to  reducing  their  annual

values, where warranted.  To-date, IRAS has reviewed some 22,000

cases  and  reduced the annual rental values by  more  than  $78

million.  This reduction in annual values came from 37%  of  the

cases  reviewed.  63% had their annual values retained and  only

1% of the cases had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



their  annual  values increased based on market evidence.   IRAS

will  continue  to  further reduce the annual values  where  the

market  warrants  it.  Property owners who  have  reduced  their

rentals  could  also inform IRAS so that IRAS could  initiate  a

review and reduce the annual values promptly and accordingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has commented that there is too much

Government  intervention in the property market.   He  commented

that  Government should just set the overall framework to  guard

against  asset inflation and leave the market to just  find  its

own  level.  Mr Singh, Mr Simon Tay and Mr Chuang Shaw Peng also

echoed  the  sentiment  that too much may  have  been  given  to

developers  which are still expected to make reasonable  profits

even after making loss provisions on unsold units.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's long-term strategy is to supply sufficient

land at a steady pace to meet the aspirations of Singaporeans to

own private residential properties.  However, given the cyclical

nature  of  the property market, it is inevitable that  property

prices will rise and fall.  The Government will not intervene in

the  property  market  except when  it  is  necessary  to  avoid

excessive  market volatility.  This is because extreme  ups  and

downs  in  the  property market could have  a  severe  and  long

lasting   impact   on  the  real  economy.   Hence,   Government

introduced  anti-speculation measures in May 1996 to  prick  the

speculative  bubble  and to cool down the  residential  property

market.  Similarly, in the present downturn, attributable to the

regional economic turmoil, Government has adjusted its land sale

programme to avoid exacerbating an over-supply situation.  It is

not the Government's intention to ensure that developers make  a

profit.   Like  any other businesses, they will have  to  assess

business risks and face the consequences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan has commented that many younger

Singaporeans who are graduates find that they still cannot  meet

the  20%  cash  payment  for the purchase  of  private  property

despite  the  falling property prices.  He  suggested  that  the

Government should allow for a reduced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



10% cash payment for first-time owners of private property.   Mr

Choo Wee Khiang and Mr Zulkifli both suggested allowing the  use

of CPF for the down-payment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 80% limit on bank financing of property purchases is a

prudential measure to ensure that the banking sector is not over-exposed  to  the  property sector and that home owners  are  not

heavily  geared  and  hence vulnerable to  a  fall  in  property

prices.   In  countries  such as Hong Kong  and  Malaysia,  even

stricter  limits  are  imposed on banks  in  financing  property

purchases.  It would not be prudent to relax the 80% limit, even

selectively  for first-time buyers.  To do so would  reduce  the

buffer  which  banks  have in the event  of  default  where  the

pledged properties have to be disposed of at lower prices.   CPF

savings cannot be used as the buffer because they go back to the

buyer's CPF account if the property is resold.  Furthermore, any

concession to be granted to only a select group of buyers  could

easily  be  subject  to  abuse.  Home  buyers  should  therefore

consider their financial position carefully before purchasing  a

property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann has commented that GLCs should be subject

to  greater  accountability  to  make  sure  that  public  money

invested in GLCs is well spent and that there should be  greater

disclosure  on  their investments as recommended by  the  Public

Accounts Committee.  Government is conscious that a considerable

amount  of public money has been invested in our GLCs.  I  would

therefore like to assure Members of the House that our GLCs have

been  profitable and represent good investments of public money.

Although  some  of  the investments made by our  GLCs  have  not

turned  out  as  expected, we should not over react.   Many  are

public  listed companies and their accounts are open  to  public

scrutiny.  Most of these have performed well over the years  and

have contributed substantially to public coffers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo has asked whether greater efficiency has been

achieved  as  a  result  of  the corporatisation  of  Government

agencies  and  whether the interest of the consumers  have  been

protected.  The objective of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



corporatisation programme is to enable the service  provider  to

operate  as  a  business entity so that it  will  be  efficient,

bottom-line driven and be responsive to changes in a competitive

environment and the demands of its customers.  Towards this end,

Government has been liberalising the telecommunication  industry

in a gradual manner and we have clearly seen and experienced the

benefits  in  terms  of  more competitive  pricing  and  greater

consumer  choice.   However,  in situations  where  there  is  a

corporatised  monopoly, as in the case of Singapore  Power,  the

Government  regulatory body, in this case,  PUB,  would  play  a

critical  role in regulating tariff charges to ensure  that  the

charges are fair.  I would like to assure Members of this  House

that  our  regulatory bodies are vigilant in ensuring  that  the

interests   of  the  consumers  are  safeguarded.   During   the

transitory  period between corporatisation and the  introduction

of competition, the regulator will monitor the situation closely

to keep tab on charges and service quality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few Members have asked whether Government would freeze

utilities charges and other Government fees to reduce the burden

on  businesses and individuals.  Government fees and charges are

revised only to keep pace with cost increases.  If cost had  not

increased, fees and charges would also not increase.  Our policy

has  been  to  revise  fees and charges regularly  so  that  the

increases  can  be kept small.  The revisions  ensure  that  the

Government  services  are  properly  priced  to  guard   against

misallocation  of  resources.   However,  the  Government   will

continue  to monitor the situation closely and will  review  the

fees and charges if there is a need to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Inderjit Singh have commented

on the depreciation of regional currencies against the Singapore

dollar and said that it is now an opportune time to escalate the

pace  of  regionalisation  and  promote  the  establishment   of

manufacturing  bases in the region.  The recent  devaluation  of

regional  currencies  relative  to  the  Singapore  dollar  does

provide opportunities for our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>



companies   to  further  invest  in  the  region.   Whilst   the

Government  can give assistance to our companies by highlighting

the  opportunities  that  are  available  and  facilitating  the

investments, ultimately the companies themselves must assess the

risks involved and decide whether it is commercially viable  for

them  to  expand their activities in the region.  For those  who

are  willing and able to undertake further regional investments,

there  already exists a comprehensive range of tax and financial

incentives   to   assist   them.    Incentives   such   as   the

Regionalisation  Financing  Scheme,  Local  Enterprise   Finance

Scheme,  Overseas  Enterprise Incentive and Overseas  Investment

Incentive have been used extensively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon has asked whether Government would

consider allowing workers to use a portion of their CPF  savings

for  an unemployment benefits scheme as part of a crisis package

to  be  invoked  only when there is a severe economic  downturn.

There  are  no  plans to set up such a scheme at  present.   The

proposal has to be carefully considered in view of the long-term

implications  on the labour market and costs of employment.   In

times of economic recession, the best way to help workers is  to

help  them get jobs and upgrade their skills so that they remain

employable.   Currently,  there are more  than  450,000  foreign

workers  in  Singapore.  In an extreme situation, we can  adjust

the dependency ratio to reduce the influx of foreign workers and

to  assist  our  own  retrenched  workers  to  find  alternative

employment.  These measures would help our workers cope  without

having  to establish an unemployment benefits scheme as a  basic

safety  net.  Experience in other countries serves to remind  us

that  the best security net for Singaporeans is not unemployment

or   welfare   benefits   but  constant  growth   and   manpower

development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo has also commented that as manpower development

is critical, the Government should allocate sufficient resources

to the new Ministry of Manpower (MOM).  As part of the effort to

build  up  Singapore's  global competitiveness,  Government  has

decided to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



place  all manpower planning, development and management  issues

under the charge of a single Ministry.  As a central agency, the

new  Ministry  will  be in a better position to  coordinate  all

critical  manpower  planning  and management  issues.   The  new

Ministry  will  also put greater emphasis on collaboration  with

its  partners, which include the private sector, the unions  and

Government  agencies,  so that it will  be  able  to  align  the

efforts  of  all  stakeholders to our national manpower  vision.

Government is committed to the development of manpower and  will

ensure that sufficient financial resources are made available to

MOM.   If additional funds are required, my Ministry is prepared

to consider such requests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang has noted that MCD had the second lowest

budget  and had urged the Government to allocate a larger budget

for  the  community services sector.  She further observed  that

MCD's  budget  was even lower than that of the  Police  Division

under  MHA.   Instead of allocating a huge budget to  MHA  whose

focus  is  on  remedial action, resources should be  shifted  to

preventive action undertaken by MCD.  But I would like to  point

out  that  MCD's  budget  alone is  not  representative  of  the

Government's   spending  on  community   development.    Besides

Community   Development,  Government's  spending  on  Education,

Health, Information and the Arts, Environment as well as  Public

Housing all contribute to the social and community well-being of

Singapore.  Total Government's spending on social and  community

services,  which include these six named areas, will  amount  to

$10.3  billion  or  37.6% of FY1998 Budget.  The  community  and

social   services  sector  in  fact  will  receive  the  highest

allocation of resources in FY1998.  Further, it is incorrect  to

say  that MCD's focus is on taking preventive action while  that

of  MHA is on remedial action.  A very significant proportion of

the  Ministry of Home Affairs' resources has always been devoted

to  preventive programmes, such as crime prevention, fire safety

and  drug education.  We should see spending in these programmes

as  complementary  to the other programmes  in  the  social  and

community services sector.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chiang would also be pleased to know that MCD would be

embarking  on a national study on the state of our families  and

another  on the impact of maids on childcare.  In addition,  MCD

has  increased the number of neighbourhood centres which include

childcare  centres,  youth drop-in programmes  and  centres  for

elderly  services.  MCD will also be looking into  the  manpower

needs  for the social service sector and will be working closely

with the voluntary organisations in this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay has urged the Government not to neglect

building  up  the softer aspects of life through involvement  in

charity and the arts, and has suggested that Government maintain

its  commitment in these areas during these hard times.  I would

like  to  assure  the  Member that sufficient  funds  have  been

provided to arts and culture and community development and  that

there  is  no cut-back on Government's commitment in  these  two

areas.   For the voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs)  of  the

Ministry  of  Health and the Ministry of Community  Development,

Government  is  providing $140 million of grants  in  FY1998  as

compared to $96 million provided in FY1997.  As for the Ministry

of  Information and the Arts, the FY1998 budget is $381  million

as compared to $318 million in FY1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past two days of debate, several Members have spoken

on the subject of bond-breaking by public sector scholars.  I do

not  propose to comment on this issue.  However, DPM BG Lee will

be making a Ministerial Statement on this subject tomorrow after

Question Time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me sum up by emphasising to Members of

this  House that the Government is fully aware of the extent  of

the economic slowdown and is carefully monitoring its impact  on

the  population and the different sectors of the  economy.   The

crisis  has not run its full course and we must maintain a  cool

head  to  anticipate and deal with developments as yet  unknown.

In  this  respect,  I  thank  the  Members  of  this  House  for

signposting  possible areas of concern.  At the  same  time,  we

should use the opportunity to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>



improve  our  competitive weaknesses and position ourselves  for

the  impending recovery of the region.  Together, I am confident

that  we will weather the storm and learn valuable lessons which

will  stand  us in good stead for the challenges of the  future.

[Applause.]
