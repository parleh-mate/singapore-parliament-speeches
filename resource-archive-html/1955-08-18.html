<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE COLONY ORDER IN COUNCIL, 1955, (INTERPRETATION)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Message from the Governor)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Hon. Members, I have a message from

His Excellency the Governor dated the 18th August, 1955. This is the message:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In my message to the Legislative Assembly of

the  2nd August, 1955, I said that I hoped to  be

able  on  the  18th  August,  1955,  to  send   a

substantive reply to the Resolution passed by the

Legislative Assembly on 25th July, 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to be able to inform the Assembly

that,  since  the  return  to  Singapore  of  the

Secretary   of   State   last   Monday    further

discussions have been held between him, the Chief

Minister, the Ministers and myself, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



a   result  of  which  the  constitutional  issue

arising  over  the  exercise  of  the  Governor's

discretionary powers has been resolved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her Majesty's Government, while upholding the

interpretation placed by me on those sections  of

the  Singapore  Order  in  Council,  1955,  which

empower  the  Governor to act after  consultation

with   the   Chief   Minister,   has   considered

representations  made by the Chief  Minister  and

has  also taken into account my own view that  it

is  preferable,  at  this  stage  of  Singapore's

constitutional  progress, if  the  present  legal

requirements connected with the exercise  of  the

Governor's     discretionary     powers     after

consultation with the Chief Minister are modified

in certain respects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, Her Majesty's Government has

undertaken  to  give  me forthwith,  through  the

Secretary of State, as provided in Section  7  of

the    Singapore   Order   in   Council,    1955,

Instructions  that  wherever  in  the  Order   in

Council  and in the Royal Instructions, with  the

exception  noted  later  in  this  message,   the

Governor  is  empowered to act after consultation

with   the  Chief  Minister.  I  shall   act   in

accordance with the Chief Minister's advice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Instructions do not apply to Section 67

(1)  of the Order in Council, which provides  for

the prorogation and dissolution of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in regard to constitutional matters,

including  the fourth point in the Resolution  of

the  25th  July, I am authorised to say that  Her

Majesty's  Government will be glad to welcome  to

London   at  a  suitable  date  a  representative

delegation   from  Singapore  to   consider   the

situation in the light of a year's working of the

constitution."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the message. I have copies made, and

they will be distributed now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of the Governor's message distributed to hon. Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, this is a very important  message,

and  I  know hon. Members will wish to  study  it

before  proceeding  further.  May  I  crave  your

indulgence, Sir, to suspend the sitting for, say,

20  minutes? I understand that is suitable to the

other leaders.



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think it is a proper occasion

where  I  should suspend this sitting  for  about

half  an  hour.  I will take the Chair  again  at 10.30 a.m.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended</i></div>

<div align="right"><i>at 10.05 a.m. until 10.30 a.m.</i></div>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 10.30 a.m.</i></div>

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the House would be obliged if the Hon. the

Chief Minister could give us a statement on  what

meaning  this message from His Excellency conveys

to  his  Government.  I think  it  is  important,

before we discuss any motion arising out of  this

message that we should know what the person,  who

has    been   negotiating   for   this   message,

understands it to mean.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

indeed my intention to give all the facts that  I

can  to  hon. Members, and I intend to  make  it,

Sir,  in  the course of my address to  you  which

will  culminate,  I hope, in a motion  that  this

House may find acceptable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to me, as I see it, this is indeed a happy

day for the people of Singapore. It marks the end

of  the  first phase of our struggle for freedom.

It  marks the beginning of a new era. The present

constitution  infused  by  the  spirit  of   this

message, which you have read, marks, if I may use

the  Royal phrase, "a significant advance" in our

constitutional development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently I read in a Nanyang Siang Pao

editorial,   which  advised  patience   in   this

constitutional  crisis, a delightful  phrase.  It

said,  "He who soweth abundantly shall also  reap

abundantly."  Sir, today's harvest  is  a  goodly

one.  In  so far as this message deals  with  the

constitutional   issues,  the  victory   is   the

people's - a  complete, a clean and an exhilarating

victory!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most understanding summary of these issues

that  I  have  read I saw in the Times  of  India

published in Delhi on 1st August, 1955, and  with

your  permission, Sir, I should like to read just

two paragraphs from it:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The constitutional crisis is not, as has been

made  out, merely a somewhat exaggerated reaction

of the Governor's insistence on his discretion to

accept or reject the Chief Minister's advice  and

recommendations.  It is not  merely  an  unseemly

squabble  over  the  question  of  whether  there

should  or  should not be four Under-Secretaries.

More fundamental principles are involved, and  an

obsession  with  constitutional  legalities   has

tended



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>

to  obscure  the force and extent of  nationalist

sentiment.  As Mr Marshall has pointed  out,  in

the  present  condition of rapid  development  in

every  part of Asia towards self-government,  the

British  Government is under a moral,  if  not  a

constitutional,  obligation to  adopt  'the  most

liberal   construction  legally  permissible   in

favour of elected representatives of the people'.

Where  the Governor enjoys discretionary  powers,

these   powers  should  obviously  be  exercised,

wherever possible, in accordance with the  wishes

of  the  elected representatives. It is  on  this

basic issue that considerable resentment has been

aroused,  and  the  reality  of  this  resentment

cannot  be  evaded  by  insisting  on  legal  and

constitutional rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor's recent intimation that in the

view  of  the  British Government  the  Singapore

constitution provides for slow rather than  rapid

progress  towards self-government was  completely

out of joint with the sentiment of the times, and

confounded  those who had hoped that the  present

constitution   was  a  framework   within   which

encouraging   strides  could  be  made   in   the

direction of early independence."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the message that we have before us lies

that  assurance, in the words of  this  editorial

writer,  'that  the  present  constitution  is  a

framework within which encouraging strides can be

made in the direction of early independence'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We based our request, as you will remember, on

two grounds when approaching His Excellency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, that the interpretation proposed by us

is  the legal constitutional interpretation;  and

secondly,  that in any event it was an  untenable

position  that  we,  who  had  to  shoulder   the

responsibilities,  should have inadequate  powers

to meet those responsibilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer we have today, Sir, is in effect

this:  we  are wrong in our legal interpretation,

but  in  the light of the people's needs, and  in

view of the sense of responsibility already shown

by  the  people's representatives, Her  Majesty's

Government  cedes  the  point  and  accepts   our

interpretation,    even    though    the    legal

justification is missing. This is significant. We

have  asked  for  a spirit of goodwill.  We  have

asked   for   a   spirit   of   co-operation   in

interpreting the constitution so as  to  make  it

workable.  Since Her Majesty's Government  denies

the  legal  justification for  our  request,  the

concession granted in this message gives concrete

expression of a spirit of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>



goodwill and a desire to co-operate that is truly

warming  and encouraging. Not only as a  harassed

Chief  Minister, but as a citizen,  I  am  deeply

appreciative  of the action of the  Secretary  of

State  as  indicated in this message. I  am  also

happy to say that I have established relations of

mutual  confidence with him, which may,  to  some

extent,  have  assisted in the  decision  he  has

taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is an exception in this message, the

exception  of  section 67 (1), but I  trust  that

hon.  Members  will  not  be  distracted  from  a

realisation  of  the extent of  the  co-operation

received and the goodwill shown because  of  this

exception. If the section is read, and  carefully

re-read, it will be seen that whichever way it is

interpreted,    whether    according    to     my

interpretation   or   to  the   Colonial   Office

interpretation,   the   practical   results   are

absolutely identical. The procedure is  a  little

different, but the results are identical,  and  I

am  quite happy to accept this exception,  which,

in  any  event,  merely formalises  what  is  the

position in the United Kingdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not prepared to go so far, Sir, as another

Member  of this House, who told me that we  have,

by  this message, achieved within four months the

complete  internal self-government  which  I  had

promised  to  work for under the old apple  tree,

within  four years. Nor am I prepared  to  accept

the  suggestion that the only veto power left  to

the Governor is the power to dismiss me. We are a

far  cry  yet, certainly, from complete  internal

self-government.  At the same time  there  is  no

need  to minimise the fact that today, by  virtue

of  the  new  spirit that moves this constitution

without  any  amendment, we have very substantial

power,  and the welfare of this territory is,  to

an  appreciable extent, in our hands and  in  the

hands  of the civil servants who have to  execute

our  policies.  It is not merely that  irritating

controls  have been removed. It is  rather,  Sir,

that   there  has  grown  a  new  and   wholesome

relationship  of  mutual  respect   between   Her

Majesty's   representative   and   the   people's

representatives.  I am aware  that  I  have  been

accused  of being unsporting in wishing a  crisis

on  His  Excellency  within three  weeks  of  his

arrival. I did not wish it on him, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



on  the  principle,  Sir,  that  the  tone  of  a

marriage is set on the wedding night, I  am  very

happy that it did happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad, because on present indications, my

colleagues  on the Front Bench and I  have  every

reason to look forward to an era of fruitful  and

friendly co-operation with His Excellency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that there can be any person,

however   ill-intentioned,  who,   reading   this

message,  would not but admit, particularly  when

recognising the fact that the Secretary of  State

and  His  Excellency are sincerely of the opinion

that  there  is no legal justification  for  this

interpretation,  that in so far as  the  original

issues  are  concerned, this is a  most  generous

concession; and I am not ashamed to say that I am

grateful  for  this  attitude,  this  display  of

goodwill by the Colonial Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now come, Sir, to the second part of this

message. It arises, if you will remember, from an

amendment to the original motion inspired by  the

truly  remarkable gentlemen who were called  this

morning  by  one of the newspapers the  "Progressional Party". I understand, Sir, that that  is  a

marriage    between    the    Progressives    and

professionals. Now, you will remember, Sir,  that

on  the  Friday, the original day of the  debate,

these    honourable,   these   truly   remarkable

gentlemen  warned  this  House  of  the  dreadful

disaster  that would follow upon any increase  of

the  Chief Minister's powers; but seeing that  no

one  heeded, such was their burning love  for  me

and  their  ardent desire to see that I  was  not

further  burdened with greater powers, that  they

were   prepared  to  throw  political   integrity

overboard  and came forward with a motion  which,

according  to  their  own  representatives,   was

calculated   to  make  it  impossible   for   the

Secretary   of   State  to  pay  any   respectful

attention to, and in this way they hoped to  save

the  people  from  the dire  consequences  of  an

increase of the Chief Minister's powers.



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. The Chief Minister

seems  to be very near imputing improper  motives

to  Members of this House. Will he please be more

"choosy" with his words?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I am indeed indebted to you,

Mr   Speaker,   Sir. I  have   very   carefully

considered my words. I know, Sir that at times  I

feel      with      such     truly     remarkable

gentlemen - exceptional should be the word - that  we

should  have exceptional rules! But I  have  been

careful, and I have only imputed to them, Sir,  a

desire  to  save the country from  the  chaos  of

increasing  my  powers by a  particularly  clever

political manoeuvre. Nothing more than that!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what the "Progressional Party" did not know

was  that  I had weeks ago asked, when I  learned

that  the  Secretary  of  State  was  coming   to

Singapore, that an item be placed on the  agenda,

and that item was a discussion for the fixing  of

a  date  for  complete internal  self-government.

That  item  was  already on the  agenda;  and  by

changing  just  one  word in  their  very  clever

amendment,  the result was that this  House  gave

such  a  remarkable demonstration of the urge  of

the   people   for   freedom   that,   far   from

handicapping me, I was strengthened, not only  in

my  original motion but in broaching the question

of  fixing  a  date for complete  internal  self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on that aspect, Sir, today's reply is not

all  that  anyone of us could wish,  barring  the

hon.   Mr   Sutherland.  But  looking   at   the

background against which this message is given, I

consider it an appreciable concession. I  believe

I know the mentality of the Colonial Office. Yes,

to  it haste is something indecent. Every time it

takes  a  step forward, it looks to see that  the

foot  is firmly planted, and it is unquestionably

notoriously  allergic to time-tables  and  fixing

dates  for independence, or even self-government!

Against  that  background, Sir, and  we  have  to

acknowledge  its  existence; we  must  judge  the

assurance  given that our request  for  immediate

self-government  will  be considered  within  the

next  nine months. I want no misunderstanding  on

this,  and  it  may  well be  that  this  is  the

clarification that is being sought; but I made it

quite  clear  to the Secretary of State  for  the

Colonies that when we do go to England - and,  Sir,

if  I  may,  for a moment, go off  at  a  tangent

here - it  is  my  intention  that  the  delegation

should be not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>



merely a coalition delegation, because to me  our

self-government  is  not  a  question  of   party

politics,  but I intend to invite some  of  these

'fire-eating  tough  guys',  if  I  may  use  the

phrase,  from the opposite Benches  to  join  us.

When we do go to England within nine months,  the

very first item on the agenda is going to be  the

question  of  a date for complete internal  self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a lawyer, Sir, I am conscious that the

framing  of  the last paragraph can  be  said  to

leave  a  very  wide loophole  to  Her  Majesty's

Government    should   its   intention    be    a

Machiavellian one; and that, in fact, if  we  are

to  go  to England next spring it can be said  to

us,  "Well,  you  have  been  so  inept  in  your

government" - (whether  we  have  been   inept   or

no) - "that it is absurd to consider the  question

of giving you complete self-government, and there

the  matter can rest." I will say this, Sir, that

I would consider it regrettable that there should

be  this suggestion of putting us on trial, as it

were, to prove ourselves worthy of freedom. A man

has  a  right to freedom in the same way that  he

has  a  right  to  walk  straight,  and  we  walk

straight,  by  the  grace of God  and  thanks  to

nobody.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a perfect world, Sir, there would be no

question  of  domination of  a  people,  nor  any

question of exploitation of a people. But I am  a

practical person, as I hope are all hon.  Members

who  are  representatives of the people  in  this

Assembly.  I  recognise that  we  are  not  in  a

perfect  world.  I  recognise  that  the  British

people   have  considerable  interests  in   this

territory   that   are   vital   to   their   own

welfare - military  interests,  Sir,  as  well   as

commercial interests - but, if I may, Sir, I think

it  might  be helpful if I were just  to  read  a

short paragraph from the Economist of the 6th  of

this  month  to give an idea of the feeling  that

they  have  about  what is  transpiring  in  this

territory:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was never expected under either the Malayan

or   the   Singapore  constitution   that   self-government would come anything but gradually, and

it  was assumed that the process of achieving  it

would  destroy  support  for  Communism  in  both

countries. But, in fact, the very first elections

to be held and the entry into office of the first

locally-elected Government have been  the  signal

for a claim that the process shall be completed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>



at   once,  that  its  transitional  stages   are

unworkable.   The   newly-elected   Members   see

themselves as constituting national assemblies of

impatient,   sovereign   peoples   rather    than

parliaments-in-training," - and this  is  the  rub,

Sir - "and   yet  it  is  far  from  certain   that

Communism   could  not  rapidly  undermine   both

countries."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is genuine anxiety - and not only

abroad - about  our  ability to maintain  a  stable

democratic  government in the face of the  strong

interest shown by international Communism in this

strategic  area.  I believe the  Colonial  Office

recognises  that we are sincere in abhorring  the

thought of being a satellite of Moscow or  Peking

on  the one hand, or even of London on the other.

But it is our internal administration, which they

wish  to  see  stable before they  give  us  this

complete  power. It is seriously suggested,  Sir,

that   if   our   internal   administration    is

ineffective, we could make it impossible to  hold

this  territory for democracy. I and, I know,  my

colleagues and those who know Singapore well  are

confident  that  we  can  maintain  an  efficient

administration  and achieve worthwhile  progress,

and  because of this confidence, I say if we have

to  wait  nine  months, we can wait nine  months.

Quite  apart from anything else, Sir, we have  no

option - let  us  face  it as practical  people - and

even  if  we have the option, even if we had  all

hell's  armoury,  I would  prefer  the  peaceful

process of waiting nine months. The suggestion of

being  put  on  trial  irks  our  pride,  but  if

humility for nine months will gain us a date  for

freedom,  I  can and will swallow  my  pride  and

wait.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept the good faith of the assurance given

us today. It is in our hands, Sir, to act soberly

and  within  nine months to bring home  the  Holy

Grail. I believe the people of this country would

wish  us  to  be  patient and would  wish  us  to

recognise  generously the solid  achievements  of

today as embodied in this message. It is in  this

spirit, Sir, that I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Mr Speaker do express to His Excellency

the Governor our appreciation of his message, and

request  that  His  Excellency,  on  our  behalf,

should thank Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of

State   for  the  Colonies  for  his  sympathetic

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have handed copies of this motion to two

of the leaders opposite. I hand a copy to the

Clerk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy of the Chief Minister's motion handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam (Pasir Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise to second the motion of thanks to His

Excellency by the Chief Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In doing so, I would like to say that the

Coalition Government's request, as contained in

our Resolution, has been completely satisfied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the amended Resolution put in by

the  Progressive Party, we are prepared to accept

in  good  faith that our delegates  to  meet  Her

Majesty's  Government to discuss  the  Resolution

will also result to our satisfaction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, we have received the Governor's message this

morning.  Our  Chief Minister has  had  the  good

fortune   of  meeting  the  Governor  and   other

important  people from London for  the  last  few

days  and  has had all that put to him.  But  the

Members  of this Assembly only received  it  this

morning. The man in the street will not  be  able

to read it until the papers have published it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that this is a matter, which is very

important  to  Singapore.  I  believe  that   all

political  Parties should be consulted and  their

opinions  aired.  Therefore, Sir,  I  feel  that,

instead  of going on with this motion, we  should

adjourn  it  for a day for public opinion  to  be

aired.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  support the motion that we adjourn for one day

to  consider His Excellency's reply given  to  us

this morning. The Government -



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. As I understand it,

there  is  no motion for adjournment  before  the

House.  If  the hon. Member cares  to  move  that

motion, then, of course, he can proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> The Member for Serangoon (Mr

Lim Choon Mong) is moving that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> rose



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> You have spoken, Mr Lim Choon Mong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems the

unique role of the People's Action Party to  come

to  the rescue of one Party after another.  If  I

may  be  of some assistance to my friend  on  the

right-hand  side of my side of the House,  may  I

formally move, Mr Speaker, Sir, that this  House

do  adjourn  till  tomorrow morning  for  further

business?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before I formulate that motion

in writing, may I say that-



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. Under the Standing Orders, no Member can move the adjournment of

this House except a Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would be

obliged  if  you would refer me to  the  relevant

section of the Standing Orders.



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No. 17.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Mr

Speaker, Sir, if no one wishes to speak, can we

proceed with the business of the motion?



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Would the Chief Minister mind if I

give   the  Opposition  time  to  consider   this

question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I refer

you to Standing Order 21, paragraph 3:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unless Standing Orders otherwise direct, notice

shall be given of any motion which it is proposed

to move with the exception of the following: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A motion for the adjournment of the Assembly or

of any debate."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the motion which I wish to put

forward  is  that  this  debate  on  the   motion

introduced by the Chief Minister, and seconded by

the  Member for Pasir Panjang (Mr Wong Foo Nam),

be adjourned till tomorrow at 10 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I have that in writing?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the debate on the motion moved by the Chief

Minister  be adjourned to 10 a.m. tomorrow,  19th

August, 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir-



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. Can I consider this?

I  take  it  that the hon. Member is  moving  his

motion under Standing Order 20?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Indeed, yes, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In that case, will the hon. Member

reconsider this motion of his? I think it will be

in  order if he just moves that the debate on the

motion  moved by the Chief Minister be adjourned.

The  date  will  then be fixed by the  Member  in

charge if that motion is accepted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> As you please, Mr Speaker,

Sir. I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the debate on the motion moved by the Chief

Minister be adjourned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we on this side of the House,

and  indeed many on the other side of the  House,

did  not  have the advantage - I am almost inclined

to  say the privilege - of having been consulted on

the reply that was sent to us this morning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I venture to suggest that a considerable degree

of  meticulous care and attention has  gone  into

the framing of this message, and I feel we should

do   it   the  courtesy  of  giving  it   equally

meticulous scrutiny and attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have had the advantage now of hearing

the explanation given by the Chief Minister as to

what  he understands this message to mean.  At  a

glance,  I would agree with him that, so  far  as

the Rendel Constitution is concerned, we now have

the  Marshall version of the Rendel Constitution.

It  is a completely different one from the C.  C.

Tan  version; unfortunately, the person for  whom

it  was  tailored  was  not fortunate  enough  to

receive  the applause and to warm the  seat  that

was  prepared for him. How much this reply really

means, and in particular what that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



last passage in this reply really signifies, is

a    matter    which   deserves   more    careful

consideration.  I agree with the  Chief  Minister

that those first few paragraphs, relating to  the

exercise of the Governor's discretion when he has

to   consult  his  Chief  Minister,  do  mean   a

considerable concession - I would not  myself  like

to  use  the word capitulation. However, I  would

suggest  to  him  that it was not  humility  that

obtained that capitulation, as the Chief Minister

perhaps would now like to imagine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But may I refer to the last passage which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Finally, in regard to constitutional matters,

including  the fourth point in the Resolution  of

the  25th  July, I am authorised to say that  Her

Majesty's  Government will be glad to welcome  to

London   at  a  suitable  date  a  representative

delegation   from  Singapore  to   consider   the

situation in the light of a year's working of the

constitution."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of us may have forgotten the actual

words  of  the fourth point in the Resolution.  I

think  it might be useful if we were to refer  to

it briefly now. It was in these terms:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And that in the opinion of this House the time

has  arrived  for a transfer of power  from the

Government of the United Kingdom to the people of

Singapore, that a new Constitution providing  for

self-government  should be  granted  immediately,

and  that such view be conveyed by His Excellency

the  Governor to Her Majesty's Secretary of State

for the Colonies;".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To that we have received a careful reply clouded

with  calculated ambiguity. There is no admission

that  Her  Majesty's Secretary of State  for  the

Colonies acknowledges and encourages this  ardent

desire,     which    we,    as    the    people's

representatives,  have  expressed  on  that  last

occasion.  In  fact,  as I understand  the  Chief

Minister  to say, he understands it to mean  that

in nine months' time-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose --



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order, Mr Chief Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Point of order, Mr Speaker,

Sir. I  would  enquire whether  the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar  (Mr  Lee  Kuan  Yew)  is  rather

speaking against the motion than in favour of the

amendment?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I gather, Mr Chief Minister, that

the  Member for Tanjong Pagar is  explaining  why

he wants an adjournment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was trying

to  explain  the  difficulties  which  I  am  now

encountering. My colleagues on this side  of  the

House,  not necessarily my comrades-in-arms,  are

at  present considering this message. This is not

a  trifling  matter to be treated in a  frivolous

fashion. A message has been delivered, if  I  may

say  so,  after  the greatest circumspection  and

care,  after roughly a month from the  time  when

the  crisis  first  arose. If  nothing  else,  we

should  give  it  the courtesy  of  very  careful

scrutiny and decide what it actually means before

we  go  into  whoops of jubilation, and  ask  you

again,  Mr Speaker, to convey a message  of  our

appreciation to His Excellency, and to thank  Her

Majesty's Secretary of State. We shall be falling

over  backwards  in no time at the  rate  we  are

going!  Let us know where we are going first.  It

is not a matter, which should be rushed. I myself

would  have been prepared, if the Chief  Minister

so  wishes, to go on this afternoon, after having

an  opportunity to consult not only my colleagues

in  this  House, but my Party officials who  have

very    strong   views   as   to    what    their

representatives do on important matters  of  this

nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We take a stand. We do not express just our

personal   likes  and  dislikes,   and   personal

inclinations and animosities, and it is important

that   the   message  should  receive   its   due

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I remind the Chief Minister that not so very

long  ago  in  this House he was  bewildered  and

perplexed  at  the  very  short,  simple  interim

message  that was received from the  Governor  on

that  occasion? If I could just quote him on that

occasion,  he  said, immediately after  you,  Mr

Speaker,  had  delivered the  Governor's  interim

reply:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Speaker, Sir, I have some difficulty in

understanding  the  message,  and  with  respect,

before  we do adjourn, I would like, if possible,

to clarify the position."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say, in not exactly the same words, that

we also have a certain difficulty in appreciating

the significance of this message, and that we are

in  the position he was then, of not sharing  the

Governor's  confidence  before  the  message  was

delivered. On that occasion I think it was a much

more attentive Chief Minister who waited for your

words and who was wondering 'Whither are we going

after  this?' If we are rushed into this  motion,

then  we,  on this side of the House, might  well

make  a  wrong  decision, or commit ourselves  to

some  statement of policy to which we may at some

later date wish we had never committed ourselves.

I  think  it is not altogether wise to treat  the

Opposition,  now  that  the  Chief  Minister   is

assured of his majority, in this fashion. We, who

have  a more disinterested view of these matters,

would  like more care and deliberation before  we

commit ourselves. I would say -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> To say 'Thank you'.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It is important how we say,

'Thank  you',  just  as it is  important  to  the

Secretary of State, the Rt. Hon. Mr Lennox-Boyd,

to  say,  not, 'I will receive you in spring  and

will  talk about self-government, and I  am  sure

you will be very pleased with it all'; but to say

in  a  most  carefully formulated  piece:  'I  am

authorised  to say that Her Majesty's  Government

will  be  glad to welcome to London at a suitable

date    a    representative    delegation    from

Singapore,' - what for? - 'to consider the  situation

in   the  light  of  a  year's  working  of   the

constitution.' Now, Mr Speaker, Sir,  the  Chief

Minister  understands that to mean that  for  one

year  we  should,  in his own words,  accept  the

position  with humility, and humility will  bring

us  success. We must accept the position that  we

have  no  choice but to behave ourselves for  one

year.  We  are  on trial, and when the  hon.  Mr

Sutherland is pleased with our behaviour  and  is

pleased  to communicate his pleasure at our  good

conduct  to  his  friends in Whitehall,  then  we

shall proceed further.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is a position that no self-respecting

Malayan  can accept. I am sure the Chief Minister

would like us to consider carefully the extent of

the  qualification  which has been  so  carefully

hedged round this message before we tell you, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, again to run an errand for  us  to

Government  House and ask the Governor  again  to

run  an errand for us in delivering a message  to

the  right honourable gentleman who has  been  so

kind  to  visit us so shortly after he came  into

office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we must not forget how that fourth part of

the  Resolution  came to be introduced  into  the

Chief  Minister's motion on that last occasion - he

had  tried  to  explain it earlier this  morning - that it was quite accidental. It seems to me that

all  the things in this House happen accidentally

because  so  little  thought  is  given  to  them

beforehand. Four junior Ministers, and we are  in

the  middle of a constitutional crisis! We get  a

mad  Party that does a double somersault, and  lo

and  behold, we are on the threshold of immediate

independence!  From immediate  independence,  the

Chief  Minister  at  once  said  immediate  self-government!  From  immediate self-government,  we

are to thank the Principal Secretary of State for

the  Colonies for taking us one step back. We are

to  thank him for asking us to go to London  next

year,  at  some indefinite date, to  talk  things

over!   Not   to   talk  about  immediate   self-government, but 'to consider the situation in the

light of a year's working of the constitution.'



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Read the whole paragraph!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> 'To consider the situation-'



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Read the whole paragraph!



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Indeed I will, Mr Speaker,

Sir.   'Finally,   in  regard  to  constitutional

matters,  including  the  fourth  point  in   the

Resolution  of the 25th July, I am authorised  to

say that Her Majesty's Government will be glad



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>



to  welcome  to  London  at  a  suitable  date  a

representative  delegation  from   Singapore   to

consider the situation...' What situation? Perhaps

we  may  have changed our minds by then!  We  may

want self-government in ten years' time! But  let

us   remember  this:  that  we  are   a   serious

deliberative  Assembly, and although  things  may

happen - indeed   so  many  things  have   happened

fortuitously - when we have passed a Resolution, it

is not to be discarded lightly. Progressive Party

Members  on this side of the House had said,  "We

want immediate independence." Then, no doubt like

the P.A.P., for the sake of seeking common ground

with  all  the other political Parties that  were

not  prepared to go as far as they would go, they

reluctantly accepted a step backward to immediate

self-government. We all joined in on that  common

ground.  So  far as the people of Singapore  were

concerned,   we   took  that  step   because   we

understood  exactly how they felt and  what  they

would  have  done to us if we had  flouted  their

wishes   and   gone  back  to  meet  them.   That

Resolution,  whatever  its  origins,  was  passed

after  careful deliberation. Indeed, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  on  that occasion I tried my very  best  to

prevent  a hasty amendment to that Resolution.  I

failed  then. I sincerely hope that  I  will  not

fail  today  in preventing a hasty discussion  of

this  motion.  I  am confident that  I  have  the

support of all those in this House who would  not

wish  to  be used, as someone has said it,  as  a

rubber-stamp  to this motion. Although  I  myself

would  have  been  prepared to go  on  with  this

motion  this afternoon after consulting  with  my

colleagues  on the actual wording  of  this  last

paragraph, speaking for my friends on  this  side

of  the  House, if this motion is proceeded  with

today, we on this side of the House will take  no

part  in  the proceedings. I hope Members  on  my

side  of the House will leave the Hon. the  Chief

Minister in no doubt that on this occasion  I  am

speaking for all of them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I second the

motion just moved by the Member for Tanjong Pagar

(Mr Lee Kuan Yew) for an adjournment until

tomorrow morning at 10 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. It is not till

tomorrow morning. It is just adjournment.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Adjournment, Sir. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  twenty-five elected voices in this Assembly

passed  a  motion that self-government should  be

granted immediately, to which we have received  a

reply, which is of great importance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reply has been considered by the Chief

Minister  and  his  Party, but  we  have  had  no

opportunity  yet to consider it. I am  myself  an

Independent, but we have got political Parties on

this  side  of the House and, as the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar  has said, they  have  to  consult

their Parties, and it is a very fair request that

this should be adjourned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> I am astonished, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  at the very low and degraded opinion  which

the  Opposition apparently have of themselves.  I

cannot accept their views and I cannot understand

their  almost unanimous endeavour to adjourn,  on

the  grounds that they cannot understand  a  very

simple  form  of words for which a very  detailed

explanation has been given by the Chief Minister.

I  do not think there is anything in that at all.

They  do  understand  perfectly  well:  there  is

nothing they can possibly misunderstand. There is

no  interpretation which they can possibly add to

this by days, weeks or months of further thought.

The interpretation remains precisely the same  as

it  has  been  outlined already. They  cannot  go

beyond   it   except  by  possibly  getting   the

Secretary of State to talk to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What lies behind this, Mr Speaker, Sir, is very

much more serious. It is not incompetence or lack

of  intellect in the Opposition that we  have  to

face, but a complete misunderstanding of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>



democracy. They apparently intend to run back  to

their    Parties.    They   are    the    elected

representatives.  I am not - I am  nominated.  But

they,  the elected representatives, have not  got

the  courage  or  the  conviction  of  their  own

ability to make a decision. They have got  to  go

back.  They  have  got to hear what  the  Straits

Times says, or the Sin Pao says! They have got to

see what Raffles Place or what Middle Road has to

say!  And then they will come back to us and say,

'Yes, we have now, as democratic representatives,

made up our minds.' I say that they must make  up

their minds for themselves, without reference  to

people outside this Assembly, and I say that with

full  conviction  that  that  is  the  democratic

principle.  They  are elected  to  represent  the

people,  but they are not elected to  go  running

back  to individuals and pressure groups to  seek

support  for  doing what they know in  their  own

conscience is right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  do  not see any reason for such  violent

accusations  on  the part of the Front,  although

we,  the  four  of us here, are not  in  complete

agreement  with  most  of  what  the  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar has said just now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are only asking for a little time to consider

this very important reply from His Excellency the

Governor. We are unable to understand why, if the

Government side has been postponing the  business

of this House for days and weeks, there should be

so  much  antagonism when we ask for 24 hours  to

consider this very important step in the progress

of this country.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b>, Mr Speaker, Sir,

I   am   convinced  that  this  reply  from   His

Excellency   the  Governor  would   satisfy   the

constituents in my division. I feel that we  will

not be able to get any further clarification from

Her Majesty's Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, since Members of the various

political Parties have the responsibility to seek

advice  before  they can debate  this  motion,  I

cannot  see any objection why this debate  cannot

be adjourned. I hope and believe that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>



the  Government would extend an olive  branch  to

the  Opposition  and give them an opportunity  to

express  whatever they want to  express  on  this

debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see no reason why any Member of the Government

should  lose  his  temper  over  this  matter  of

adjournment. We should ourselves feel that we are

matured politicians, and I think Members  of  the

Government,  as  well as the  Opposition,  should

deliberate on this matter with maturity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the hope and belief that the Government

would  agree to an adjournment, I resume my  seat

with  a  request  once again that the  Government

should not lose its temper over this issue.  They

are not going to lose anything by adjourning this

motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  am  very  deeply surprised to hear the  attack

launched  at  us  by the Hon. the  Minister  for

Communications and Works (Mr Thomas). It is very

well for him to stand up and say that he need not

go back and consult his Party, because he is only

a  nominated Member of the Assembly. But  we  are

the elected representatives of the people, and we

have to consult our people because-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order, Mr Thomas?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Point of order, Sir. Mr Speaker,

the  hon.  Member has misunderstood what  I  have

said. I would like to clarify it. [Interruption.]

The  point  I  wish  to make was  this:  that  an

elected  representative is elected on a  platform

and  he carries it out; but how he carries it out

is  not  to be decided by reference back  to  the

backseat  drivers.  This was established  in  the

18th  century  by Edmund Burke when  he  was  the

Member for Bristol. He very clearly laid it  down

to  his  electors that if they elected him,  they

showed  their confidence in him, and he  was  not

going to run back and ask them, 'What shall I  do

about this or that?' But rather, 'I shall do what

in my judgment is right.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



To  hand  over  your judgment, gentlemen  of  the

Opposition,  to the backseat drivers  is,  in  my

view - and  I  am saying this without any  loss  of

temper  but  I wish to say it with all  vehemence

because  it  is  not  a  trifling  matter - a  most

dangerous  infringement  of  the  principles   of

democracy. You cannot hand over your judgment  to

the    backseat    drivers.   You    must    take

responsibility yourselves. To go back to somebody

behind  and say, 'What shall I do?',  that  is  a

complete  dereliction  from  your  true  duty  as

elected representatives.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very

well  for  him to say that he need  not  go  back

because he has already had news of the contents-



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> He has not!



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. Mr Tan, please

continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

surprised  that the hon. Members on the  opposite

Bench  have already been told of the reply  which

the  Chief  Minister received from His Excellency

the  Governor,  and  they have already  consulted

each  other. It is well and good for them to come

here today -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a point of information,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  The Ministers  received,  in

common  with  all other Members,  information  of

this  message  when copies of it were  handed  to

them this morning.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> - and it is only fair that we

should  have more time to consider the reply  we

have received.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  think all will agree with me that everyone  in

his right senses will not refuse a request for an

adjournment if good reasons are set out for  such

a  request.  I believe, and I think I know,  that

Members  on  this side of the House  are  all  in

their  right senses, and we cannot see  any  good

reason for a request for an adjournment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar in his speech made

it  quite clear that he understood even the  last

paragraph of His Excellency's message. The only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



reason  left, therefore, for this adjournment  is

for  some Members on the opposite side to consult

the  persons  who put them into this  House.  The

Minister for Communications and Works has made it

quite clear that it would be unparliamentary  for

them  to  go back to these people and say,  'Look

here,  we  are faced with this problem.  What  is

your opinion on this?' It only shows the lack  of

confidence in themselves.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at long last I can now

heave  a  sigh of relief that the unholy marriage

between  the P.A.P. and the Coalition  Government

is  no  more! I am indeed very glad because  that

was a very dangerous marriage, and now the P.A.P.

wants  to enter into another marriage, a marriage

with  somebody  whom they have described  in  the

most bitterest of terms!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members over the other side say they want

an adjournment in order to consult their Parties,

their constituents, and maybe the people who have

been  guiding  them.  Yet, when  the  Progressive

Party moved an amendment which has now become the

famous  fourth point in the Resolution, they  did

not  say, 'Wait, Mr Speaker, this is a very  big

issue.  The Progressives want independence.'  The

Chief  Minister being, as described by the Member

for Tanjong Pagar, a political innocent, moved an

amendment  for  immediate  self-government.   The

Progressives  then did not raise their  hands  in

horror  and  say, 'Mr Speaker, Sir,  please,  we

must  have time to go back and consult our Party!

Please,  we must have time to go back and consult

our  constituents!' They did  not  do  that!  Why

should  they  want to do it now, Sir,  over  this

issue  of  an expression of thanks for a  message

that has been delivered? Of course, they say that

the  fourth  part  has nothing definite.  Surely,

Sir,  in  our  right  senses it  has  never  been

anticipated  by  any of us that we  could  get  a

definite yes or no today? An answer can  only  be

given   after   consultation.   Where   is    the

consultation to take place, Sir? It has  to  take

place in London. With whom, Sir? Not with us, but

with all of us!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



Is   that   not   enough?  Is  not  that   answer

sufficient? You must have consultation before you

can  get a definite answer from the Secretary  of

State for the Colonies; and yet we are threatened

by  the  other side that unless we  agree  to  an

adjournment,  they  will not  take  part  in  the

debate. We are not perturbed, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the fourth point that has been the

source  of all this trouble. It was put into  the

Resolution  by the Progressives. It  started  the

trouble  on  25th July. The trouble continued  on

2nd August, and now the trouble is still with  us

today. I find it very difficult to appreciate the

stand  taken  by the Progressives in moving  that

amendment.  They opposed the original  motion  of

the  Chief  Minister, and yet they  suggested  an

amendment,   which   was  intended   to   achieve

something,  which they never dreamed of.  It  was

intended  to  go  beyond what  was  meant  to  be

achieved  by  the original motion  of  the  Chief

Minister.   Yet   today,   when   we   have   got

satisfaction on the original motion of the  Chief

Minister, and also satisfaction in the sense that

in  regard to this fourth point we will be having

consultations in London, leaving only the date to

be fixed, they feel that they should want time to

go  and consider something about which they, I am

sure,  have already made up their minds. I oppose

the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It is distressing, Mr

Speaker, Sir, that on a day which should be a day

of   joy   for   all  Parties  that   are   truly

representative of the people, we  should  have  a

debate   degenerating  on  a   basis   of   party

antagonisms and jockeying for political position.

I have not looked at this victory as a victory of

the  Coalition Government. It is a great victory.

I do not want to crow about it. I am grateful for

it - a   victory,  I  should  have  thought,   that

everybody  would have joined happily  in  saying,

'Thank you' before I asked.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not true that hon. Members opposite have

had  no inkling of what was coming. The hon. and

learned Member opposite, who did me the courtesy,

as  a true Malayan, of joining me in the original

motion, I thought should have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



reciprocal  courtesy, and I did indicate  to  him

yesterday the identical terminology of the  reply

to  the fourth point. The suggestion about having

to consult Middle Road is an absurdity. This is a

surrender  of their duties as representatives  of

the  people. This is done intentionally: it seeks

to  destroy  the  impression of what  is  a  true

achievement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they have before them is not difficult. The

whole  issue  has  been before this  country  and

before  this  Assembly for almost  a  month.  The

reply   is   in  simple  language,  and   it   is

admitted - no one seems to have the courage to deny

it,  not  even the Progressionals - that  it  is  a

complete vindication of our original stand and  a

complete acceptance of this House's request for a

generous spirit of interpretation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth issue, there is far more than we

had  thought  of. Much less than  we  asked  for,

admittedly. But it is a step forward,  a  radical

step  forward, a healthy step forward. 'You  come

in spring and we will discuss it.' And in view of

the spirit in which the other concession has been

given,  it is churlish to see mala fides  in  the

phraseology.  I  understand,  Sir,  there  is   a

disgraceful threat from hon. Members opposite who

intend    to    abdicate   their    rights    and

responsibilities to this House by walking out  if

I refuse-



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Definitely!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> You can, Sir, I shall never

miss you. I ask hon. Members opposite to have  a

sense of responsibility-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Indeed we have!



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Not the way you are talking!



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> There is nothing in this

motion,  which  is difficult to understand.  Hon.

Members opposite have had half an hour to look at

it,  to  peruse it and to discuss it. I say,  Sir

that this ganging-up for an adjournment is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>



unworthy of hon. Members. It is unworthy  of  the

people of this Colony on a day that should  be  a

day of rejoicing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is it unworthy to have time

to think?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I ask you, Sir, to look at

that  motion  which is simply  an  expression  of

thanks.  One does not need time to think  and  to

know  whether  one should say, 'Thank  you.'  One

needs no time particularly when it is confessed - I

use   the   word  'confessed',  Sir,  since   the

admission seems to have been extracted - that there

has  been a very generous gesture on the part  of

Her Majesty's Government. All I say, Sir, is that

I  shall  deeply regret an action which I believe

must  be construed abroad as showing a lack of  a

sense  of responsibility on the part of  a  major

section  of  the  population if  this  threat  of

abdication-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Protest, not abdication!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> - were to be carried out. There are democratic means of protest - the right

to vote and the right to speak -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> And the right not to speak!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> - and I ask them to

reconsider and to admit frankly that there is not

a single thing there that they do not understand.

Apart   from   what  may  be  the   directionless

Progressionals  who  may  wish   to   get   their

directions abroad, hon. Members should have their

own  opinions  and  should have  the  courage  to

express  them, without having outsiders  to  hold

their  hands. This is not a small issue, Sir. If

it  were, I would certainly cede. This is nothing

but a manoeuvre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the debate on the motion moved

by  the  Chief Minister be adjourned,"  put,  and

negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Division, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am afraid, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, that

according  to Standing Orders your  claim  for  a

division  is a bit too late. The votes have  been

fully



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>



taken. Unless you can persuade me otherwise - I  do

not  want  to  deprive you of the  benefit  of  a

division, but according to Standing Orders,  once

the  vote  has been fully taken, in other  words,

when I said 'The Noes have it', that was the  end

of  it. If you had wanted a division, you had  to

claim it before I said 'The Noes have it'. I will

give you time to think about that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if your

decision is that I had interjected too late, then

I will have to submit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original Question again proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereupon a majority of the Members on the

Opposition Benches left the Chamber.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Now that, Mr Speaker, Sir,

the hon. Members of the Opposition have sought to

transfer  this  matter from the proper  place  of

discussion  to  the  back parlours  and  upstairs

rooms that they will find elsewhere, it is proper

that  we should still continue to give our  minds

to  it,  and  there  are some things  arising  in

connection  with this debate which I should  like

to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been extremely significant to see the

actions and hear the words of the Opposition  and

to  see how very vigorous must be our struggle to

maintain the principles of democracy and freedom.

It  is  perfectly clear now that there are forces

in  Singapore,  which are seeking to  direct  and

control  the Members of this House. It is  not  a

question  of  a  colonial  power  directing   and

controlling;  it is a question of  anonymous  and

hidden  forces without which some Members of  the

House feel they cannot take a decision, and  that

is  a situation, Mr Speaker, which will call for

the  most devoted efforts of all of us if we  are

to find a happy solution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see another sad thing. We have from the

Secretary  of State through the Governor  a  most

welcome concession, a most welcome realisation of

the feelings of the people and of the justice  of

our  claims. It appears - and I am sorry  that  the

Opposition  have not remained here to make  their

position clear about it, but in their absence,  I

can only give



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>



the  interpretation that seems to me  to  be  the

only possible interpretation - that some Members of

the  Opposition are unwilling to take the  course

of  co-operation and goodwill. They seem to  feel

that   unless  a  thing  is  achieved  at   great

suffering by violent methods, by the shedding  of

blood,  by  death and agony - unless those  methods

are used, a real victory cannot be won.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It used to be a favourite saying of the extreme

Left,   of  the  Communists  and  their   fellow-travellers,  that "property will shoot",  meaning

that you may talk to your exploiters, you can get

nice  words from them, but when it comes  to  the

real push, they will fight sooner than yield  one

inch  to your demands. That phrase "property will

shoot"  was  used again and again to justify  the

theories  of violent revolution, and  I  have  an

unhappy  feeling that that same idea is operating

in  the minds of some of the Opposition. They are

unable to accept a gesture of goodwill; they  are

unable  to  believe that anybody can be  trusted;

they are unable to believe that the Secretary  of

State  and  the  Government behind  him  and  the

British  people  behind  them  have  any  genuine

willingness  to  concede the principle  of  self-government to us. They have no grounds  for  that

disbelief: they have got example after example of

the  territories  which have  been  granted  full

independence - India,  Pakistan,  Burma,  Ceylon,

Australia and Canada. We heard them all from  the

Commissioner-General  in  his   birthday   speech

yesterday, but they cannot believe, in  spite  of

that,  that  the  same thing could  happen  here.

Consequently, I very much fear that there will be

people who may seek to prejudice this victory, to

misrepresent it, to try to turn it into  a  means

of strife and violence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to say this, Mr Speaker, because I am so

profoundly  convinced that  in  most  situations,

reason and good sense and perseverance can  solve

one's  difficulties  and  that  the  desire   for

violence  is a psychopathic desire which  is  not

necessary  for achieving a victory  such  as  the

Chief  Minister has been able to  bring  to  this

House today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Mr Speaker do express to His Excellency

the Governor our appreciation of his message, and

request  that  His  Excellency,  on  our  behalf,

should thank Her Majesty's Principal Secretary  of

State   for  the  Colonies  for  his  sympathetic

approach to our aspirations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for

aware  of the recent protest, made by the  S.I.T.

tenants  of  Bendemeer  Road  to  the  Government

rentals charged by the Trust; and will he  please

state what action has been taken in the matter.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  yes,  I  am aware that such representations

have  been made. The matter has been investigated

and  it  is  considered that,  for  the  type  of

accommodation provided, the rents charged are not

excessive,  taking  into consideration  the  fact

that at the time these houses were built in 1951,

building  costs were at their peak. However,  the

whole  question of reducing S.I.T. rents  is  now

receiving the closest attention of Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

agree  that  the  rents  for  S.I.T. houses   at

Bendemeer Road are not excessive at all, but I am

happy that the Minister is considering the matter

and will put up some facts later.

<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the establishment of the new Public Housing

over  the  assets  of  the Singapore  Improvement

and many other details will have to be defined by

comprehensive  legislation. All  these  questions

are  now  being examined, but it is not  expected

that  it  will  be possible to  set  up  the  new

Authority before the end of the year. Until these

questions  have  been decided,  I  am  not  in  a

position   to  give  details  of  how   the   new

organisation will function.

<div align="center"><b>(Recruitment)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland</b> asked the Chief Secretary whether, in view of the shortage of radiologists in Singapore, any attempt has been made to obtain the services of an experienced radiologist from the Federation of Malaya; and whether the appointment of such a person with the necessary qualifications would be considered regardless of whether or not the applicant is an expatriate.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr W. A. C. Goode:</b> There are 4 vacancies for Radiologists: one Senior Radiologist and 3 Radiologists. For the post of Senior Radiologist all qualified officers were considered including those in the Federation but since a locally domiciled officer had already been sent to the United Kingdom to obtain the requisite qualification it was decided to postpone filling this post.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 3 posts of Radiologists applications have been invited and are awaited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the statement of policy given in the Governor's speech to the Legislative Assembly the appointment of expatriate officers (including officers from the Federation) is subject to prior reference to the Council of Ministers.
