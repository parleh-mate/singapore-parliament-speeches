<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>ASSISTANCE FOR THE UNEMPLOYED</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Acting Minister

for  Manpower,  with the unemployment  rate  forecast  to

creep  up and perhaps even surpass the levels experienced

in  the 1998 downturn, will his Ministry consider further

interim measures to help the unemployed, at least  for  a

period, subject to suitable means

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2259</b></font><br><br>



testing,  until  they  are  able  to  become  financially

independent again.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Acting Minister for

Manpower  in  view of the current unemployment  situation

and projected pessimistic employment forecast, whether he

will introduce additional financial assistance schemes to

help  those  who  are unemployed and who  face  financial

difficulties.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Acting Minister for

Manpower  (a)  whether  he  is aware  that,  despite  the

Utilities Save scheme introduced in the Budget, there  is

a  substantial number of households who are unable to pay

utility  bills  and have had their supplies disconnected;

and  (b)  whether he will introduce measures  or  provide

specific assistance schemes to help these households.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Acting Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I would like to

take Question Nos. 1 to 3 together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Because the Questions have been asked

from various agencies, this reply is with the inputs from

the   Ministry   of   Finance,  Ministry   of   Community

Development  and Sports, Ministry of the Environment  and

Ministry of Trade and Industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member rightly pointed out, since 1998, as

economic  conditions worsened, the Government appreciated

that  more  would  face hardship.  In  response,  several

measures have been introduced to help lower income groups

and  unemployed  workers cope with the  difficult  times.

These  measures  involved  not just  temporary  financial

assistance, but also job matching and placement services,

and  specific  schemes and programmes to  facilitate  re-entry into the workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On financial assistance, the Government works

closely  with Community Development Councils  (CDCs)  and

voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) to tailor

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2260</b></font><br><br>



the  assistance to households in need.  For instance, the

unemployed who have a low household income can apply  for

interim   financial   assistance   at   their   Community

Development Councils.  Short-term financial aid  will  be

granted  for six months, subject to a review every  three

months.   In  FY2002, 6,700 unemployed Singaporeans  were

helped by this scheme.  88% of them managed to get a  job

within three months and become financially independent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, families who live in 1-, 2- or 3-room

rental  and  purchased flats who have  difficulty  paying

their rental, utilities or conservancy charges can obtain

short-term  relief to tide over temporary  crises.   They

may  apply for monthly subsidies for rent, utilities  and

service  and conservancy charges, up to a maximum monthly

cap  of  $90  for  utilities  and  $35  for  service  and

conservancy  charges.   For those lower  income  families

that  are unable to pay their utility bills - this is  in

reply  to  Mr Low Thia Khiang -  PUB has already  adopted

the  practice of thimbling their water supply instead  of

cutting  it  off  completely since late  2002.  This  has

enabled  them  to continue to have access  to  a  minimum

supply  of  water for basic needs.  PUB will extend  this

practice until the economic situation improves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for facilitating job placement, between December

2001  and  last month, 152,000 visits for job  assistance

under  MOM's Career Link and its Distributed Career  Link

Network  were  recorded;  of these,  19,600  people  were

placed  into jobs. Recently, we have seen an increase  in

take-up   rate  and  this  is  encouraging.    MOM   also

introduced  a  number of industry-targeted programmes  to

place and train or convert job seekers for jobs in growth

or  strategic sectors.  More than 1,200 Singaporeans have

benefited from such programmes so far.  Further, training

programmes  are  in place to ensure that  workers'  skill

sets  develop  in tandem with the economy.  About  80,000

workers  have  benefited  from the  Skills  Redevelopment

Programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share Members' concern on the impact of a further

rise  in overall unemployment rate, as pointed out by  Dr

Amy Khor.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2261</b></font><br><br>



Hence, MOM is working towards introducing more place  and

train   programmes  in  other  sub-sectors  which   offer

employment opportunities.  We will support retooling  and

upskilling workers and later I will be introducing a Bill

which  will  enable us to start the CET statutory  board.

These developments will enable MOM and its partners to be

more effective in helping the unemployed find jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various financial, training and employment

assistance measures which I have just described provide a

sound  and holistic framework for helping unemployed  and

low-income Singaporeans in this downturn. We will have to

calibrate the extent of assistance depending on  economic

circumstances, and feedback from MPs, VWOs, and  officers

on the ground.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, our experience shows that despite the

difficult  conditions,  there are  jobs  which  companies

still  cannot  find  Singaporeans  to  fill.  Hence,  the

Government  will  need to tighten the connection  between

financial   assistance  and  efforts  on  the   part   of

individuals  to  look for jobs, take  up  jobs  that  are

available and undergo training.  We will monitor  closely

how  well  the existing schemes are working and, wherever

necessary,  to  streamline  and  improve  the  assistance

framework to make it more effective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, jobs and self-reliance are the best

guarantee of financial independence, self-confidence  and

personal  dignity.  I urge Singaporeans who  are  out  of

work  to  be  flexible and realistic in their search  for

jobs.  They should not turn down job opportunities  which

may  not  be ideal, but which can financially  tide  them

over this downturn.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, I would

like  to  ask the Minister specifically about  the  white

collar workers.  It has been reported that about half  of

the  currently unemployed are white collar workers.   Are

there any specific measures in place or being planned  to

help this specific group of workers, especially they  are

reporting

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2262</b></font><br><br>



that  they  are encountering resistance from  prospective

employers  due to cynicism about their over-qualification

and possible change of job when the economy turns around?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, saying that half of the workers

unemployed  are white collar workers does not quite  lend

equanimity  to  the  situation.  Let me  give  a  clearer

picture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the unemployed residents - if we take the

overall global number of those who are unemployed  -  the

unemployment  rate for degree holders is 3.8%,  in  other

words,  96%  of  those with degrees  are  employed.   For

diploma  holders,  it  is  3.5%; upper  secondary,  3.4%.

Nonetheless, we do agree with Dr Amy Khor that more needs

to be done to help every sector of the unemployed and our

programmes  are  crafted not so much at  either  blue  or

white  collar workers but industry-specific, to  look  at

areas  where  there is growth and to enable  workers  who

have  been  unemployed or retrenched from one  sector  to

convert to another sector.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, I would like to

ask  the  Minister how he would facilitate the employment

of  young graduates who are today finding themselves very

disillusioned  when  they graduate from  the  university,

especially  when  they  are losing  out  to  the  diploma

holders as well as the ITE graduates.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, I think the Member has touched

on  the issue of job vacancies.  Let me give some numbers

again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of March 2003, there were still about 12,000 job

vacancies  in the private sector.  There are still  about

31% or 4,000 jobs for professionals, managers, executives

and  technical  vocations.  Also, in the  public  sector,

there  are  about 1,800 jobs available for  professionals

and  associate professionals.  It is not only a  question

of  the grade of jobs but also the industry.  Yes,  there

is  disruptive  unemployment, in other words,  particular

sectors have shrunk so that those who work in one  sector

cannot go back to that sector and they have to convert to

another   sector.   We  have  created  specific   schemes

targeted

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2263</b></font><br><br>



at  this  group.   One particular scheme  is  called  the

Strategic Manpower Conversion Programme and it  is  aimed

especially  at  professionals to help them  change.   For

example,   an  executive  who  is  retrenched  from   the

electronics  sector can switch to the healthcare  sector.

There  are  these schemes available.  We also  work  with

professional  organisations, such as SHRI  and  SPEC,  to

help them help professionals to make this conversion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> I would like to ask

the  Minister  whether  he deems the  current  assistance

schemes  for the unemployed sufficient and able  to  help

them.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, the Member fully appreciates

that  the word "sufficient" is subjective.  Let  me  give

some  objectivity to his question in terms of  those  who

are  in  utility account arrears, which he has mentioned.

Yes, for everyone who suffers hardship, we empathise, but

we  need to be mindful of the numbers.  The percentage of

households  who have arrears on utilities is  1%  of  all

accounts.  Even in the 1-room and 2-room HDB flats, it is

around 5%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Energy Market Authority has set for itself

particular  targets to try to bring down  the  number  of

accounts  in  arrears to reduce the  figure  to  pre-1999

level,  which is 0.2% eventually.  So that is the working

target internally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have also mentioned, PUB, instead of

disconnecting  supply,  has agreed  that  they  will  use

thimbling so that their essential water requirements  are

still  met.   We will work hard and, as I said,  we  will

calibrate the financial assistance schemes with our  CDCs

and  VWOs  to respond to those in need.  But  the  number

suggests that there is a declining trend of those who are

in arrears.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, while we are asking the

workers to change their mindset to accept other jobs, has

the  Ministry  any  plan to also  work  at  changing  the

mindset of some employers who are against employing older

workers who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2264</b></font><br><br>



would otherwise be more than qualified for the job?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, we actively do this, but to

really  get  the effect, my Ministry has decided  that  a

holistic approach is better, which means that not only we

work on the mindset of all those parties involved but  we

also introduce enabling schemes.  One particular enabling

scheme, as I have mentioned previously in this House,  is

the    People-for-Jobs   Traineeship   Programme    where

Government  will  fund half of the  worker's  salary  for

about six months or $2,000, whichever is less.  This will

facilitate,  if  you  like, the employer  to  accept  the

employee and for Government to show its support  and  for

that six months for the employee to be tested in the  new

job.   I  am sure that those who have signed up for  this

scheme will prove their own worth in due time.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister   how   successful  has   this   People-for-Jobs

Traineeship Programme been.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, I do not have the exact number

but,  from  my recall, about 4,000-odd people  have  been

placed  on  this scheme since it was introduced.   But  I

would have to check the number.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Minister said that the

Ministry would calibrate the assistance schemes.  I would

like  to  ask  him  whether or  not  the  Government  has

calibrated  the  latest  employment  situation  and   the

financial  assistance schemes and whether he is satisfied

that  the current financial assistance schemes -  despite

the  number  that  he  has mentioned  about  the  arrears

position  in utilities - such as the Rents and  Utilities

Assistance  Scheme  as  well as other  interim  financial

assistance  schemes, are actually helpful and  sufficient

to take care of the unemployed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Before I answer Mr Low Thia Khiang,

my other more learned colleague has told me that actually

10,000  people  took  up the People-for-Jobs  Traineeship

Programme,  of which 4,000 stayed on.  I will again  have

to check on the numbers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2265</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it sufficient? It is a relative word. I would

rather  give the Member numbers so that we know where  we

are  now  and  in the future.  As I said, the  number  of

accounts in utility arrears is 1%.  The average amount of

arrears for each account is about $1,000 and the trend is

down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we satisfied? Can anyone be satisfied? We will

work  with  our  CDCs and VWOs and we  will  monitor  the

situation and calibrate the assistance in tandem with the

hardship  felt  on  the ground and  in  tandem  with  the

economic conditions.

<div align="center"><b>WAGE RESTRUCTURING</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Acting Minister for

Manpower    in   view   of   National   Wage    Council's

recommendation  for  wage restructuring  and  the  global

competition that our companies are faced with,  (a)  will

his  Ministry facilitate the review of wages in  both the

local  and  global industries and provide a  database  of

such  reviews  for  companies to make informed  decisions

timely;  and (b) how can his Ministry be better poised to

partner  industry  players to  carry  out  job  profiling

exercises   which   are  essential  in  supporting   wage

restructuring  and minimising tensions between  employers

and unions during restructuring exercises.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Member

rightly  pointed  out,  in  the  face  of  stiff   global

competition, the NWC has, in its wage guidelines for July

2003  and June 2004, urged companies and unions to  speed

up  wage  restructuring to enhance wage  flexibility  and

competitiveness.    It  has  also  recommended   that   a

Tripartite  Taskforce be set up to drive this process  of

wage restructuring.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has accepted these recommendations

and  a  Tripartite  Taskforce has been  set  up  to  help

companies in their wage reform. This Taskforce is chaired

by   my   Permanent  Secretary  and  will  also   include

representatives from the unions and employers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2266</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the Member for her inputs and agree that

more   information  regarding  wage  reviews  should   be

provided  periodically to industries.  We have recognised

that  this is a deficiency and we will work towards that.

In  other words, we will provide market information  more

readily to companies to see what the hiring salaries are.

We will take her inputs into account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Taskforce will provide companies with relevant

information and analysis on wage cost, formulate flexible

and   competitive   wage  models,   and   highlight   the

experiences  of  companies in  their  wage  reform.   The

Taskforce  will also recommend measures and options  that

companies  and  unions can adopt in  restructuring  their

wage system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together with the tripartite partners, my Ministry

will work closely with industries, companies, unions  and

professional societies to implement changes to their wage

systems  and  look  into  skills upgrading  and  industry

transformation  that would complement wage  reform.   The

successful   implementation  of  wage  reform   and   the

upgrading of our workers' capabilities will help  enhance

the competitiveness and employability of our workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Taskforce is expected to release its final

report within six months.

<div align="center"><b>ADOPTION OF ALTERNATIVES TO RETRENCHMENT</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam</b> asked the Acting

Minister  for  Manpower what steps his  Ministry  has  in

place to (i) ensure that employers use retrenchments as a

last resort to save costs and (ii) encourage employers to

use  other strategies such as job-sharing, part-time work

or  cutting back on frills such as company cars as  cost-saving measures.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, MOM has been providing

retrenchment advisory services to help companies  explore

feasible alternatives to retrenchment, as Ms Braema Mathi

has suggested.  We have asked

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2267</b></font><br><br>



them to carry out retrenchment only as a last resort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the recommendations of the Tripartite

Panel   on   Retrenchments  in  June  1998,   a   special

Retrenchment  Advisory Unit under  the  Labour  Relations

Department of the Ministry was set up. This Unit monitors

retrenchment    trend,   advises   companies    on    how

retrenchments can be carried out smoothly and  fairly  to

the extent possible, provides conciliatory assistance  to

resolve  disputes, disseminates information  relating  to

retrenchment  through brochures and leaflets.   The  Unit

also  manages a Retrenchment Assistance Hotline to enable

employers  facing excess manpower to seek  timely  advice

and  assistance  on retrenchment issues.   Companies  are

urged  to  retrench  workers as a  last  resort  and  are

advised  to consider the following alternatives  if  they

have excess manpower.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, take the opportunity to train and upgrade their

workers'  skills under the Skills Redevelopment Programme

(SRP),  which  is  exactly what we did in  terms  of  our

assistance schemes during the SARS crisis for tourism and

hospitality-related sectors.  The Government issued a $57

million budget for training and for some sectors, as  you

might have read, the uptake was significant and did allay

further retrenchments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, look for alternative areas of work within the

company   to   deploy  the  surplus  workers,   including

implementing job-sharing and part-time work, as  well  as

other cost-cutting measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, implement shorter work week or temporary lay-offs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four, if it has a flexible wage system in place, use

it to adjust its wage cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help promote the adoption of the above-mentioned

alternatives  to  retrenchment, the Ministry  proactively

visited companies with excess manpower.  In other  words,

we  do  not  wait  for them to call us.  We  monitor  the

trends  and  then  we go down to the ground  and  try  to

manage it.  Between March and October

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2268</b></font><br><br>



2002,  MOM  visited 110 companies ranging  from  SMEs  to

large firms employing over 500 staff.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the implementation of the various alternatives

to  retrenchments, many jobs have been saved as companies

could  avoid  retrenchments  and  where  retrenchment  is

unavoidable,  the  number of workers  affected  could  be

minimised.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2268</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Liberalisation on use)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Acting Minister for

Manpower  will  the Government consider liberalising  the

use  of  Central Provident Fund (CPF) monies for purposes

of  (i) supporting overseas education of children who are

not  able  to  gain admission into local universities  so

long  as any housing loan owing has been paid up  by  the

CPF account holder; and (ii) subsidising the start-up  of

a small business (up to a comfortable limit as determined

by  CPF)  as  part of the Government's encouragement  for

self-employment by the unemployed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the primary

objective  of the CPF is to help members save  for  their

retirement,  healthcare and housing needs.   While  often

stated  in  these  simple terms and  often  repeated,  we

should  be  reminded again that our CPF system remains  a

cornerstone  on  which  we build our  social  and  indeed

economic   well-being.   We  should  resist   strenuously

attempts  to adulterate the original aims and intents  of

the  CPF system.  Yes, from time to time, we may have  to

recalibrate  the amount we put aside to meet these  basic

needs  because  there  is a trade-off  from  too  high  a

statutory  burden  for  wages.   We  risk  becoming  less

competitive and thereby restrict employment creation,  we

create  less jobs.  In other words, we should  make  sure

that  the majority of the population has enough to  cover

these  basic needs and we should neither under  or  over-provide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Education Scheme was introduced in 1989 as a

special concession to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2269</b></font><br><br>



help  lower-income families support themselves  or  their

children through full-time local tertiary education.   To

allow  CPF savings for overseas tertiary education  would

be  a  further deviation from the aims of the CPF scheme.

It   would   also  introduce  opportunities   for   over-consumption.  For example, an overseas engineering course

could  cost  as  much as $58,000 a year  as  compared  to

$5,650 at the NUS for the academic year 2003/2004.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, if we did allow it, this availability of

the  use  of CPF savings would put unwelcome pressure  on

parents to fund an ever-increasing aspiration of children

to  pursue  a tertiary education.  I am not  for  it.   I

would rather we hold the line than ask parents to do  it.

There  are other avenues of scholarships and loan schemes

available  to  good students who would  benefit  from  an

university education, anywhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this same reason of remaining pure to the

original  and focused aims of the CPF scheme  that  I  am

against allowing the early withdrawal of CPF savings  for

business start-ups.  There is no certainty that all start-ups will thrive and indeed data proves the contrary, that

the  majority of start-ups fizzles out.  We run the  risk

of many members losing their retirement savings for a few

to make good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those intending to start their own businesses,

they  could  look to the Government or private incentives

and  financing  schemes for assistance.  The  Micro  Loan

Programme, for example, administered by SPRING  Singapore

and offered through participating financial institutions,

is  a fixed interest rate financing programme designed to

help  the very small local enterprises gain better access

to financing.  Other assistance for start-ups include the

Franchise   21  Assistance  Programme,  Local  Enterprise

Financing   Scheme  (LEFS)  and  New  Business   Creation

Incentive.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, I would like to check with

the  Minister  whether he could verify and  clarify  that

investment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2270</b></font><br><br>



in  overseas education of children can be reclassified as

a  form  of  investment,  just as  we  have  CPF-approved

investment  schemes. Similarly, whether small  businesses

could  also  be classified as such under the  Government-approved  small  business scheme.  And  if  they  can  be

classified,  then  why  is  it  that  a  portion,   under

qualified conditions of CPF, could not be utilised  as  a

form of subsidy for such investments?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, I agree wholeheartedly that

education  is an investment.  The question is whether  we

should allow CPF to be used for that investment.  And  as

I  have  said,  we  should stay sharply  focused  on  the

original  intent of the CPF scheme, which is, retirement,

housing  and healthcare.  If we have provided enough  and

it  is  a  big "if", I would tell Members that currently,

only  42%  of  CPF members meet the $40,000 Minimum  Sum.

And  this $40,000 Minimum Sum is not calculated from  the

air, but in adequacy terms, if we withdraw annuities,  in

other words, monthly payments based on the principal sum,

it  only  yields about $238 a month.  It is not  a  large

sum.   It is enough to keep body and soul together.   42%

of CPF members reach this amount.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the sense of under-provision, I would say

that  the  urge  for the CPF system is to really  provide

adequacy and not to increase the avenues for consumption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the specifics of the small businesses, I would

have  to  look into the specifics and answer the question

from the Member separately.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> I would like to seek a clarification with the Minister.

He  said that the objective of the CPF is for retirement,

healthcare  and  housing.  Would the CPF  Board  consider

expanding  its objective to include loans  from  the  CPF

Board for rainy days to CPF members, especially when they

are unemployed?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, I mentioned that there is a

trade-off  in  terms of the statutory burden.   In  other

words, over-consumption, over-saving or over-investment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2271</b></font><br><br>



from the CPF has to be measured against the trade-off  of

wage  rigidities and employment creation.  If  we  impose

too high a statutory burden on wages, we are going to  be

less  competitive.   So  the first  premise  we  have  to

understand  is that, while we want to put aside  for  our

retirement,  healthcare and housing  needs,  there  is  a

trade-off  in terms of what we get in terms of employment

creation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first objective is to arrive at whether we have

provided  enough for these three essential aspects.   And

as  I  have  said, the figures tell us that we  have  not

quite  provided  enough.  Having said that  we  have  not

quite  provided  enough,  it really  makes  no  sense  to

further  expand the opportunities in which the CPF  could

be  consumed because the first task is to make sure  that

we  have provided enough for the majority.  If we do not,

there will be serious implications downstream in the long-term.     We   would   have   conscribed   our   economic

opportunities,  we  would have forced  ourselves  into  a

tighter fiscal position and we would have engendered  and

encumbered   future   generations  with   our   problems,

something which we would not want to do.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, if the CPF member has

enough  funds in his CPF account and, in times  of  need,

why  can he not borrow from his account which he  has  to

return  back when he is gainfully employed?  This is  not

over-consumption.  Is it not better that he borrows  from

his  CPF  account at a marginal interest than  to  borrow

from some loansharks or maybe from the banks at very high

interest rates which he will have to return? It is not an

over-consumption issue.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> I agree with Mr Chia in principle

that  if,  and it is a big "if", a particular member  has

accrued  enough  Minimum Sum, we could consider  that  he

could  dip  into that pool.  But it is a big "if"  for  a

very   small  number  that  exists  currently.   And   in

individual  cases, we will look at it, but as  a  general

principle,  as I have said, only 42% of CPF members  meet

our  Minimum Sum which, I will tell Members, is an under-provision,  even as it stands.  Because  the  way  it  is

structured

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2272</b></font><br><br>



currently,  we  have  not  asked  members  to  fulfill  a

Medisave  minimum sum before the amount goes  into  their

Ordinary  and Special accounts.  So while we  say  it  is

provision  for medical care, that is not even taken  care

of.  So there are these real limitations that we need  to

solve  before  opening  up the CPF  scheme  and  allowing

members to further diminish that amount.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> I would like to

seek  a clarification. The Minister talked about CPF  for

retirement, housing and medical needs.  But today, we are

also  using it for purchasing of shares, unit trusts  and

bonds.   But  because of the lack of  adequacy  that  the

Minister talked about, is the Minister signalling a shift

in the Government's policy on the use of CPF because - it

is   a  very  important  principle  along  the  lines  of

discussion that is going on - to me, education is as much

less  a  risky investment compared to shares,  bonds  and

unit trusts.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> The Ministry will take Mr Inderjit

Singh's  comments about investable amounts  into  stocks,

shares and loans when we review the policy.

<div align="center"><b>HDB'S MAIN CONTRACTORS AND SUB-CONTRACTORS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development,  in view of  the  recent  problems

experienced  by the Housing and Development  Board  (HDB)

with its construction and upgrading projects and in order

to  avoid  the  future occurrence of such problems,  what

steps  have been taken or are being taken in relation  to

(i)  the HDB's internal systems and processes to evaluate

tenders  and  manage main and sub-contractors,  (ii)  its

communication  with  affected  lessees;  and  (iii)   the

tendering procedures and registration of contractors  for

HDB  and other public sector projects administered by the

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Miss Penny Low</b> asked the Minister for National

Development whether the recent failures of the HDB's main

and  manages its contracts in relation to (i) its  tender

system   and  (ii)  its  timing  of  payments  to   these

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development  (a) why about  560  HDB  flats  at

Punggol Field were not completed on time and abandoned by

the  contractor; and (b) whether compensations were  paid

or will be paid by the HDB to purchasers of those flats.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to take

Question Nos. 7, 8 and 9 together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the construction industry is

currently  going  through some  very  tough  times.   The

demand is weak and competition in the industry has become

more  intense.  As a result, some contractors are  facing

financial  difficulties and have been unable  to  fulfill

their  contractual obligations. This has  disrupted  some

public sector construction projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have asked whether these problems are due to

HDB's  tender  system.  Let me first  explain  the  HDB's

process for selecting contractors.  There are three steps

in the procurement process:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, contractors are pre-qualified based on their

financial  resources,  their professional  and  technical

qualifications and track record, using the  Building  and

Construction Authority (BCA)'s Contractors Registry as  a

guide.  HDB will specify the category of contractors  who

are  eligible to participate in the tender based  on  the

estimated project value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, after the close of the tender exercise, HDB

will  verify that the tender proposals fully comply  with

the  tender requirements.  The tender proposals are  then

evaluated  based  on  their price competitiveness,  their

conformance   to   the   required   specifications,   the

tenderer's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2274</b></font><br><br>



ability  to undertake the project, his financial solvency

and his performance in other public sector projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third and last stage of the process is for the

HDB  to conduct due diligence on the tenderers and  their

tender prices.  All things being equal, HDB will award it

to  the lowest tenderer who can do the job.  If HDB finds

that  the lowest tender price is significantly below  the

other  tender bids as well as its own estimates, it  will

interview the tenderer and ask him to re-examine his bid.

If  he  decides  to  withdraw from the tender,  HDB  will

recall the tender or award it to the next lowest bidder.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the objective of the tender system is to award

the   contract  to  the  company  that  offers  the  best

combination of price, quality and reliability;  in  other

words, best value for money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has to do so in a way that is objective and fair,

to  ensure  that there is transparency and accountability

in  the use of public funds.  On the whole, the system is

sound  and working well, as shown by the large number  of

contracts   which  have  been  awarded  and  successfully

completed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While HDB has put in place a rigorous selection

process,  there is no guarantee that selected firms  will

not  run into difficulties later, especially during  this

economic  downturn.   HDB will monitor  the  contractors'

performance   closely   during  construction.    If   any

contractor is in trouble, HDB will take immediate  action

to  minimise  the  impact  on residents.   For  upgrading

projects,  HDB will activate a contingency contractor  to

complete   the  essential  works.   It  will  also   keep

residents  informed through circulars and  house-to-house

visits.  For construction projects of new flats, HDB will

keep  buyers informed early if there are changes  in  the

estimated completion date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, in view of recent concerns, MND and

BCA   are   presently   seeking   views   from   industry

representatives and key Government agencies, to see

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2275</b></font><br><br>



whether  and  if  so,  how  the  system  can  be  further

improved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address the specific questions raised by

Members.  Dr Amy Khor asked about the management of  main

and   sub-contractors.   In  HDB's  projects,  the   main

contractor   will  choose  and  manage   his   own   sub-contractors, but they must be registered either with  BCA

or the Singapore Contractors' Association Limited (SCAL).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low asked about HDB's timing of payments

to  its  contractors.   HDB is  prompt  in  its  progress

payments and usually pays its contractors within  two  to

three  weeks after they have submitted their  claims  and

their  claims  are  validated.  If  the  Member  has  any

specific  information to the contrary,  she  can  let  me

know.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam raised a question on the delay of flats at

Punggol  Field.  HDB is legally required to complete  new

HDB flats and deliver them to flat buyers by the Delivery

Possession Date (DPD), which is provided in the Agreement

for Lease.  Besides the DPD, HDB also informs flat buyers

of  an  Estimated Completion Date (ECD), which it reviews

and updates as construction progresses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the flats at Punggol Field, the

novated  contractor ran into financial  difficulties  and

stopped work in January 2003.  After several unsuccessful

attempts  to  resume work, HDB terminated and re-tendered

the  contract.   A  new contractor was engaged,  and  the

blocks  are now expected to be completed between  January

2004  and  September  2004, instead  of  August  2003  to

October  2003,  which  was the  original  estimate.   HDB

notified all affected buyers of these changes in February

2003,  so  that  they could adjust their  housing  plans.

Those  who  require urgent alternative accommodation  can

approach HDB for assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flats will all be completed before their

respective DPDs, which range from August 2004 to  October

2004.   Thus,  the issue of compensation to  flat  buyers

does not arise.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2276</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister  on the registration of contractors by the  BCA.

How   is  financial  standing  and  solvency  of  a  firm

evaluated?  I would also like to ask the Minister  if  it

is  indeed the case, as reported, in the press  that  the

current registration system, which is fundamentally sound

and  rational,  is subject to abuses and,  inadvertently,

encourages   some  unhealthy  practices,  such   as   the

contractors  who are financially unsound  shifting  their

monies  around just for registration as well  as  bidding

for  jobs at very low or tiao lao bids.  Again,  this  is

just to ensure that they can qualify for registration.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the BCA's Contractors'

Registration Scheme (CRS) was aimed at making  sure  that

there   is   a   certain  minimum  qualification   before

contractors are allowed to tender for public sector jobs.

I  believe  the  CRS is also being used as  a  basis  for

contractors  to  tender  for  private  sector  jobs  but,

essentially, it is for the public sector to find a way to

prequalify contractors.  Contractors are graded based  on

several  factors  -  financial strength is  only  one  of

them.  Other criteria include track record, whether  they

have  been  debarred  in the past,  etc.   So,  financial

strength  is  only one of the factors but it  is  a  very

important factor.  Because, as the Member would  probably

realise, the construction industry is very much driven by

cash  flow.  And if contractors do not have the requisite

financial   strength,  they  would  find  themselves   in

trouble.   That  is  the reason why the  BCA  requires  a

certain minimum financial strength before they are put on

the  registry.  And then within the registry,  there  are

different  grades  -  A1 to C3.  A1 and A2 would  be  the

highest grades, followed by B1, B2, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A question arises: what happens if a company

qualifies  for  the  registry and thereafter  shifts  its

funds around?  There are certain mechanisms in place, eg,

accounts have to be audited at certain regular intervals.

Obviously, within those regular intervals, something  can

still  take  place but the BCA does try  to  ensure  that

those intervals are reasonable for the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2277</b></font><br><br>



contractors as well as reasonable for the BCA  to  check.

Having  said  all that, of course, it does not  guarantee

that  the  system is foolproof.  It is a fact that  there

have  been  some  abuses  of the  system  but,  like  all

systems,  if  abuses are detected, then severe  penalties

will result.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the so-called tiao lao bids or suicide

bids?   I  must  say  it is not a good  practice  in  the

industry to have such bids.  I am equally concerned about

such bids which are unrealistically low.  But having said

that,  I  think we must realise that the contractors  are

professionals.   They are going in for  a  bid  with  the

intention  of  getting that contract.   They  do  not  go

putting  in  a  bid  which they would  have  to  withdraw

subsequently.  So, it can be for several reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is that they are trying to buy market share, or

they could be trying to establish a track record, or they

could  be going in because they want cash flow,  or  they

may  have made a genuine mistake.  So, for these reasons,

HDB  takes  the view that it does not benefit anybody  to

award  a  tender to a bid which, in its opinion,  is  too

low.   That is the reason why if a bid comes in which  is

below  the  others  or  which  is  way  below  HDB's  own

estimates, it will, as I explained earlier, call up  that

tenderer and conduct an interview to see whether the  bid

that  has  been put in is a genuine bid.  In some  cases,

the  tenderers,  after going through the  specifications,

decide  to  withdraw  their bids.  If  the  tenderer  had

proceeded with the bid, the chances are that he will  not

be able to complete that job.  And who would benefit from

such a situation?  HDB would not benefit.  The contractor

would not benefit and, certainly, the residents would not

benefit.  I think it is in nobody's interest to  award  a

tender  to  such  a  bid.  Because of this,  the  present

procurement process does allow for the tender  evaluation

committee not to award the tender to such a bid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, the objective of the tender

system is to get the best value for money on the basis of

quality,   reliability  and  price.   For   quality   and

reliability, we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2278</b></font><br><br>



have to base on the track record.  We have to base on the

past.   But price is what is on the table.  If the  price

is  not realistic then, obviously, that tender should not

be  awarded.  And the record shows that there  have  been

several  cases  where the lowest tenders  have  not  been

awarded.  In the case of Government agencies, as much  as

25% of tenders are not given to the lowest tenderer.   In

the  case of HDB, about 10% of contracts are not  awarded

to the lowest tenderer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would

like  to  ask  a  question regarding the case  of  Marine

Terrace  MUP  Batch 14, because I think that the  lessons

that  we have learnt from this particular experience  are

relevant  to  the matters under discussion.   Firstly,  I

would  like to ask the Minister whether the Ministry  and

HDB  have  identified the reasons why the main contractor

for  Marine  Terrace MUP Batch 14 suddenly abandoned  the

project.   I believe this contractor took over  from  the

previous  contractor.   In fact,  there  were  two  other

contractors  earlier on, who bid for  this  project  well

below the HDB's estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, why was the HDB project management unable

to  anticipate the problems which the project faced?  And

what measure will the HDB take to ensure that the project

will resume quickly without undue delay, and also help to

minimise  inconvenience to residents?  Will the  Minister

give  an  assurance  that the project will  be  completed

without any more delays?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the question of payments to sub-contractors. Many sub-contractors have complained that

they have not been paid by the main contractors, although

they   have   completed   the   projects.    Could   some

arrangements be made by HDB, or the Government  for  that

matter,  for  payments to be made directly  to  the  sub-contractors  when  the projects are  done  and  completed

satisfactorily?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Othman asked

about  the  Marine Terrace upgrading project.   First  of

all, the tender was awarded in 2001 to a company known

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2279</b></font><br><br>



as  Seatown  Construction.   The  performance  record  of

Seatown Construction was good and acceptable.  It  was  a

G8 contractor, meaning that it was a contractor which was

in  the  highest  category of  the  BCA's  CRS.   So,  no

question about its financial strength or its track record

at  that  time.   It was not debarred and there  were  no

adverse  reports  on  the contractor.   However,  Seatown

Construction  went  into financial difficulties  and  the

project  was  novated  to Hong Lai Huat  Construction  in

August 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hong Lai Huat Construction was an A1 contractor.

The  CRS  had been changed, and A1 is equivalent  to  G8.

Again, it was the top of the range.  Again, it had a good

performance record.  It was not debarred.  There were  no

adverse  reports.  So, by all accounts,  it  was  a  good

contractor.  Hong Lai Huat went into difficulties and the

project  was  novated to Sum Keong Construction  on  18th

March 2003.  Sum Keong Construction is an A2 contractor - not  the  top but the next level down.  A2 means that  it

can  tender for jobs between $30 million and $65 million.

So  it  was more than qualified to do the Marine  Terrace

project - good track record, no debarment status, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up till the 2nd June, the progress of works of Sum

Keong  was  ahead  of  schedule.   It  was  not  just  on

schedule, but it was ahead of schedule.  I think  it  was

doing  something like 55% of the project, which was  more

than  what was on the time-line.  On 2nd June, HDB's site

management  team found that the contractor  had  suddenly

stopped all works inside the flats.  And on 3rd June, the

contractor  had stopped all works outside the flats  very

suddenly.  There was no indication by the contractor that

such a thing was going to happen.  I spoke to some of the

grassroots  leaders who indicated the same  thing  to  me

because they obviously were on the ground and they  could

sense when work was being slowed down or delayed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all accounts, this was a very sudden stoppage.

Why?   I  can  only  go by what the contractor  told  the

newspapers.  Apparently, the contractor said that he  had

run into major financial difficulties and he

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2280</b></font><br><br>



had  no choice but to stop work.  So, the contractor  had

to  face  the  consequences of the  stop-work.   And  the

residents on the ground had to face more disruptions  and

inconveniences.  HDB on the same day, 3rd June, took  the

necessary  measures to try to minimise these disruptions.

A circular was sent to the residents on the same day, 3rd

June,  to  inform them that there had been a stoppage  of

work  by  the contractor, and also to inform  them  about

what  other  measures would be taken by HDB  to  recover,

including,  for  example, the appointment of  contingency

contractor to quickly take over the emergency  works  and

to  complete them.  It also appointed the same contractor

to  make sure that housekeeping and the conservancy works

in the area were properly carried out - mosquito control,

rodent  control, security in the area, and so  on.   This

was  done virtually straightaway.  The very next day when

works were stopped, all these were put into place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could it have been anticipated? As I said, the

procurement process tries to conduct due diligence on all

the successful tenderers.  In this particular case, there

was  no  indication that the contractor  would  not  have

completed  the  job.  But, for various reasons,  it  went

into financial difficulties.  And, unfortunately, in  the

case  of Sum Keong, it went into difficulties so suddenly

that  HDB  could  not  warn the residents  earlier.   But

having  had  its  attention brought  to  the  problem,  I

believe it acted swiftly, promptly and efficiently to try

and  recover and to make sure that the disruption to  the

residents was minimised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to inform the Member that to-date, the

outstanding internal works that were the most  disruptive

to  the  residents in 15 of the flats - these were  works

pertaining to the works in the bathrooms and the  toilets

-  had  been  completed  in that  week.   Similarly,  the

internal works for the remaining units in the blocks have

also  been completed and external works are going  to  be

started  by the contractor in July, and they expect  that

they  will  finish it by the end of August.  As  for  the

remaining balance of the works, HDB will be calling a re-tender.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2281</b></font><br><br>



This re-tender will be expedited and works will resume on

site by the new contractor by August 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked whether we can guarantee that there

will  be no further delays.  I wish I could.  But, to  be

realistic,  while we will do whatever is  necessary  this

time in selecting a tenderer, I cannot promise that there

will  be  no  further breakdowns or delays.   But  I  can

promise  the  Member  that such  a  possibility  will  be

minimised.  I can also promise that, if there is  such  a

thing happening again, the recovery will be as swift  and

efficient as it was in the first episode.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked about sub-contractors. The

problem  with  sub-contractors is that the contract  that

they  have is between them and the main contractors.   It

has  nothing to do with HDB.  But having said that, I  do

sympathise with the sub-contractors because they are,  as

it  were, at the lowest end of the food chain.  When  HDB

pays the main contractor, the main contractor is supposed

to pay the sub-contractors.  But when the main contractor

gets  into  difficulty or trouble,  invariably  the  sub-contractors  suffer.  So we will have to  look  into  the

possibility of how this problem can be solved, because it

is  a  problem.  If sub-contractors, which are  part  and

parcel  of the whole construction industry, are not  paid

or treated properly, then I think the industry as a whole

must suffer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked BCA and other Government agencies to

look  into  the  system and to see in  what  way  we  can

minimise this problem of sub-contractors not being  paid,

including  the  possibility perhaps of  legislating  such

payment.  But such changes, if any, must be practical and

doable  and it is something that the industry as a  whole

must accept.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, what is

the  Ministry's  response to the call by the  contractors

for the security bond to be reduced to 10% of the initial

amount  upon obtaining TOP for contractors, the  accounts

to be finalised

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2282</b></font><br><br>



after  six  months, after the TOP has been obtained,  and

also  the 5% retention sum to be waived?  As regards  the

suicide tender bids, will the contractors be penalised if

they withdraw the suicide tender bids, if it is really  a

genuine mistake being made?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I think nobody goes into business

to  commit  suicide.  They all go in  with  the  hope  of

winning  the tender.  So, if a tender bid is  low,  as  a

result of a mistake, then we would definitely look at the

waiver of the penalty sympathetically.  We are not  going

to  penalise somebody who has, say, added an extra "0" or

has  subtracted an extra "0" from one of the line  items.

So,  if  it  is  a  genuine mistake, we  will  waive  the

penalty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the other issues are concerned, eg, the

performance  bond, the accounts being finalised  quickly,

the  retention sum, etc, basically the common denominator

in all these is that there must be a certain guarantee in

the form of a performance bond or an insurance bond or  a

banker's   guarantee,  to  ensure  that  the   contractor

completes  the job within the time that is specified  and

to  the specifications that he has promised.  If he  does

not   meet   this  promise  and  does  not  fulfill   his

obligation, then the performance bond will be  forfeited.

So,  it  is  a matter of how much performance bond  is  a

reasonable  amount.   In the case of  HDB  or  Government

agencies,  it  ranges from 5-10%.  In  the  case  of  the

private  sector, I believe the norm is  10%.   These  are

issues which, again, the industry would have to sort out.

And  I  have  asked BCA to also look at these  issues  of

performance bond, retention sum, etc.  But bear  in  mind

that all this, while it incurs a cost, is part and parcel

of the contractual obligation between buyer and seller of

that service.  Without the performance bond, without  any

retention sum, the balance must be tilted on the side  of

the  contractor.   For  example, what  is  to  prevent  a

contractor from not fulfilling his obligations, if  there

is   no  performance  guarantee?   What  is  to  stop   a

contractor  from  not finishing his job to  the  complete

satisfaction of the owner, if there is no retention  sum?

The contractor just walks away.  You call him

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2283</b></font><br><br>



back  to  rectify certain works, even within the one-year

defect  liability period, he does not show up.   What  do

you do?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think there has got to be a balance between the

interest  of  the  buyer and the seller of  the  service.

But,  of course, that balance has to be struck in such  a

way  that everybody in the industry understands, and this

is  one of the issues which the industry is now trying to

grapple  with.  And I hope that there will be a consensus

reached on a new equilibrium.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, with regard to the

registration  of  contractors by BCA, will  the  Ministry

consider  further tightening the measures, together  with

inputs  from  the  industry, as regards,  say,  financial

standing and solvency of the firm where specific projects

are  analysed,  like  profitability ratios  or  breakeven

analyses?   Because  if the contractors  appear  to  have

suicidal  tendencies, as every project is  a  loss,  then

some alarm bells must ring with regard to their financial

standing.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I am not sure where the Member

gets  this  idea that people go into business  to  commit

suicide.   I  do  not believe so.  The so-called  suicide

bids, I think, are the result of several factors, but let

us leave that aside for the time being.  Specifically, to

answer  the Member's question on whether we will consider

tightening  the Contractors Registration System,  let  us

bear  in mind that the more you tighten the less will  be

the  number of contractors who will be on that list.  You

will find that the contractors will not be too happy with

this.   Of course, that does not mean that we do  not  do

it.   But  I  am just pointing out that we will  have  to

again make sure that the criteria are sufficient to  pre-qualify the good, suitable contractors and not to  be  so

tight as to preclude many contractors who would otherwise

have been able to do the job.  So the CRS has undergone a

lot  of  reviews and examinations.  I am sure that  there

will  be another round of review some time.  But we  have

just  done  the last review last year.  I would  like  to

seek  the  Member's  cooperation for us  to  examine  the

results of that past year.  If she has any inputs for  us

to improve the system any

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2284</b></font><br><br>



further, we will be happy to hear from her, including how

much to tighten.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, I have

two supplementary questions for the Minister.  First, may

I ask the Minister, over the last two years, how many HDB

contracts  were not completed according to the stipulated

completion  time  and  how much liquidated  damages  were

imposed  on those contractors who failed to complete  the

project  on  time?  Secondly, will the Ministry  consider

reviewing  the  public sector standard contract  form  so

that  the  interests  of  the third  parties,  especially

consumers,  sub-contractors  and  suppliers,  are  better

protected?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I can give the Member an indication

about how many contracts were not completed over the last

year.  I believe it is something in the region of 4%.  4%

of  the total number of contracts awarded by HDB were not

completed  on time for some reason or other.  As  to  how

much liquidated damages were forfeited, I do not have the

figure offhand.  But I will be happy to provide it to him

at an appropriate forum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the review of the public sector tender

form is concerned, yes, this is one of the issues that is

being  discussed by BCA and the industry.  The  objective

is  to  make  sure  that the terms in the  public  sector

procurement system and the form are transparent and  fair

to  all the parties involved and I include, in this case,

the   sub-contractors,  in  response  to  Encik  Othman's

question just now, and the consumers as well.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister about the problem concerning the main contractor

and  sub-contractor.  When the main contractor  gets  the

contract,  usually  he  will  sub-contract  to  the  sub-contractors  who sometimes sub-contract to so  many  sub-contractors.  Has the Ministry any form of control on the

main contractor, ie, after getting the contract, how many

percent  of  it  should  be  carried  out  by  the   main

contractor  and  how many percent by the  sub-contractor?

The Minister mentioned that the contract

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2285</b></font><br><br>



was  not  awarded  to  the  lowest  tenderer.   Could  he

enlighten  the  House, for the last two years,  how  many

contracts  under  MUP and IUP were  not  awarded  to  the

lowest tenderer?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> The issue of main contractor

awarding jobs to sub-contractors is a peculiarity of  the

construction industry in Singapore.  I am not saying that

it does not happen in other countries.  The prevalence of

such  a  practice in our industry is quite unique to  us.

As  the  Member suggested, it is not just one  level  but

maybe several levels down where the main contractors will

appoint  sub-contractors,  sub-contractors  will  appoint

their  own sub-contractors, and so on.  Why is  this  so?

There are several reasons.  One perhaps is the fact  that

the  barrier to entry of contractors in Singapore is very

low  and  we  do not require too much qualifications  nor

other prerequisites.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is, by and large, I would say, an efficient

system.   It is efficient in the sense that after getting

the  job  the main contractors find, on their own accord,

the  best people to help them to do the job.  They either

appoint  sub-contractors, or they hire people to  do  the

job.   Some  contractors prefer to hire their own  staff.

They  train  the  staff and keep them for the  long-term.

Others prefer to virtually hire all sub-contractors.  But

should  the Government get involved in deciding how  much

sub-contracting  they should do, how much  of  their  own

direct workers they should employ?  I do not think so.  I

think  the main contractor is the one who knows best  how

to  get  the  job done at the price that he has  tendered

for.   For  us  to specify these things is  virtually  to

manage the project for him.  How can the Government be in

a   better  position  than  the  contractor  to  actually

complete  the  job?   And if we  were  to  do  that,  the

contractor would have every reason to come back to us  if

the  job  is not done properly and say, "You are the  one

who told me to do all these things.  Now it is not done."

It is a system that has generally worked well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain problems in the system, one of

which is this issue of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2286</b></font><br><br>



non-payment.  But this is a problem that has surfaced now

when  the  construction industry or the construction  pie

has shrunk rapidly.  This was not such a problem when the

construction  industry was booming.  The  sub-contractors

were  paid,  suppliers were paid, and nobody faulted  the

system.  So we have to be careful that we do not try  and

come out with the wrong solutions to the problems that we

are  facing.  I have indicated earlier that the issue  of

payments  between the main contractor and sub-contractors

is something that needs to be looked at.  The industry is

now  looking at it together with the Government  agencies

and  I  hope that there will be some practical  solutions

arising out of this discussion.  But I would not advocate

the   Government   getting  involved   in   running   the

construction companies or running the contracts  for  the

main contractors.  I would leave it to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second question was on the number of contracts

under  MUP  and  IUP which have not been awarded  to  the

lowest  tenderer.   I  am  afraid  I  do  not  have   the

information  offhand.  But if the  Member  would  file  a

Question, I will be happy to answer.

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Does HDB set a

timeframe  for halted projects to resume  work?   In  the

case  of  Punggol 21, some projects were  stopped  for  a

considerable  period of time before work resumed.   In  a

particular  case  where  the blocks  of  flats  were  all

completed  and in fact inhabitants had already moved  in,

some sub-contractors took away some installations at  the

void  deck,  leaving exposed steel wires and all  because

the main contractor could not pay them.  That is a safety

hazard.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> As far as resumption of work is

concerned, HDB will endeavour to make sure that the  work

resumes  as quickly as possible.  As quickly as  possible

can  range from one or two months to probably four, five,

or  six months.  The difficulty is mainly when there  are

legal  difficulties involved in the  winding  up  of  the

current  contractor.  This, of course, is no  comfort  to

the residents.  So I would like to assure the Member that

HDB, even

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2287</b></font><br><br>



within this constraint, will endeavour to engage the  new

contractor  as quickly as possible, but it would  not  be

sooner  than, say, a couple of months.  In  the  case  of

Punggol Field, the example that was mentioned, the  delay

will  ultimately  be in the range of  anything  from  two

months  to  as  long  as  10  months  from  the  original

estimated completion date.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Wang, last question.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Thank you, Mr

Speaker, Sir.  Would the Minister consider that,  despite

his  assertion that nobody goes into business  to  commit

suicide,  for  a company which is already  in  "terminal"

difficulty,  it  is possible that such a contractor  will

tender  with  a suicide bid and, not only that,  he  will

tender  as many bids as possible so that it will go  down

with  a  big bang rather than with a whimper?  And having

looked  at  this  evidence,  would  he  take  this   into

consideration  as  a lesson learnt when  he  reviews  the

tendering system?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> The Member said that the contractor

is already "terminal".  I do not know whether ---

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> I mean "terminal" internally, but

not known outside.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> My statement was apropos a company

that starts off in business.  Nobody, when you start  off

in  business,  goes into a tender and puts in  a  suicide

bid.   But, yes, a company which is in great difficulties

probably would.  The safeguard of course for us  is  that

we do not have to automatically accept such bids.  The IM

does   not   require  HDB  to  accept  the   lowest   bid

irregardless, our own internal systems do not require  us

to  do  so, and common sense tells us that if the bid  is

really  too  low, if we accept that bid, it  is  not  the

contractor alone which is committing suicide, we are also

committing suicide because the amount of work involved in

trying to recover is not insignificant.  So it is not  in

anybody's interest to accept such so-called suicide bids.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I have two

supplementary questions.  One

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2288</b></font><br><br>



is in regard to Marine Terrace and the other is in regard

to  Punggol  Field.  In regard to Marine Terrace,  can  I

have some clarifications?  Is this an MUP?  And if it is,

how  much has each resident there co-paid for the  works?

There are three contractors involved in Marine Terrace  - Seatown,  Hong  Lai Huat and Sum Keong  -  and  even  the

Minister  says that he is not sure whether Sum Keong  can

finish the job.  I am just wondering whether HDB has been

soft  on  all these contractors and has not been rigorous

in enforcing the contract.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other supplementary question is in regard to

Punggol  Field.   It is quite obvious that,  for  Punggol

Field,  the contractors had breached the contract.   They

were  unable  to  complete  the  job  on  time  and  even

abandoned  the  project.  I heard one  complaint  from  a

purchaser  that, in fact, she had already sold  her  flat

and  could not get the replacement flat at Punggol  Field

in  time.  She had to go and find accommodation somewhere

else.   Such  a  case is clear cut that she has  suffered

damages.   I  am  a bit surprised when the Minister  says

that  HDB has not paid any compensation at all.  In fact,

I  would also imagine that the HDB has the right to claim

damages  from  the  contractors.  So, out  of  these  560

purchasers, how many have been compensated in  regard  to

their claims, if any?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Yes, Marine Terrace is an MUP

project.   And  like all MUP projects, the residents  pay

only  a  fraction of the total cost.  It depends  on  the

particular  project itself.  It depends also on  what  is

involved  in  that particular MUP.  It could be  $10,000.

It  could  be  less,  or it could be more,  depending  on

whether  there is an SAI.  But it is heavily  subsidised.

In fact, in all MUP projects, the Government foots 70% or

75%  and  for the smaller flats, as much as  90%  of  the

total  cost.   I  am not sure what is the  point  of  the

question.  That is a fact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the HDB has been soft on these contractors,

as  I  explained  earlier, the works of  both  the  first

contractor  and  the second contractor were  satisfactory

until  the  point of time when they felt that they  could

not carry on.  HDB has a system in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2289</b></font><br><br>



place to monitor the works, ie, regular monitoring of the

progress  of  works to make sure that disruption  to  the

residents is kept to a minimum and there are regular site

meetings.  I have seen records of these site meetings.  I

am satisfied that HDB has carried out its work diligently

and properly.  Notwithstanding all these, the contractors

did  get  into  difficulties,  and  once  they  got  into

difficulties and they could not carry on, HDB had to take

the necessary steps to recover.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Marine Terrace, the first disruption

was  when  the first contractor could not finish  and  it

went  to  the  second contractor.  There was a  novation.

The  second contractor could not complete, and it novated

to  the  third.  In Sum Keong's case, it was not able  to

carry  on.   So,  instead  of  novating  to  yet  another

contractor, HDB has decided to terminate the contract and

to call for a new tender.  In calling for the new tender,

the  chances of the work being completed in time will  be

that  much  better.   Of course, in  calling  for  a  new

tender, the cost involved would be much higher.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Would damages be paid?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Why should damages be paid? In the

case  of  Marine  Terrace,  the  work  is  going  on   as

scheduled.   It  will be completed, but  with  a  minimal

delay  of  about two or three months, as I have explained

to Mr Othman Haron Eusofe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Punggol Field, again the issue of

compensation does not arise because, first  of  all,  the

contractual obligation of HDB is very clear - that in the

lease agreement that is signed between the buyer and  the

seller,  this flat would be delivered by a certain  date,

in  what  is  known  as the development completion  date.

That  obligation will be fulfilled.  In so far as  delays

are concerned and residents getting alternatives, anybody

who  is in urgent need of a flat as a result of the  flat

not  being completed as originally estimated can approach

HDB  for  assistance, and such assistance will be  given.

So,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2290</b></font><br><br>



again,  I do not see any reason why there should  be  any

question  of  a compensation.  Many of the  residents  in

Punggol  Field  have  asked  for  and  have  been   given

assistance in the form of an alternative flat if they are

really  in  need, and in the form of transitional  rental

housing if they do not want an alternative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in that respect, HDB has taken great pains to

ensure that the effects of this delay, even though it  is

not its fault, are minimised.

<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, can I seek a

clarification   on   the   Minister's   reply   to    the

supplementary question by Mr Chiam?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, the Minister said that

the  cost of the project will increase.  But can  I  have

the Minister's assurance that residents will not pay more

than  what was indicated to them when they voted for  the

project?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> This sounds more like a question than a

clarification, Mr Othman.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Yes, I am happy to give him that

"clarification", that this additional cost would  not  be

passed on to the residents.

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Miss Penny Low</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

benefits   of  the  US-Singapore  Free  Trade   Agreement

(USSFTA) that were reported in the Straits Times of  19th

June 2003, (a) will his Ministry explain the finding that

(i)  71%  of those polled indicated no benefits and  (ii)

while  his  Ministry  has hailed the Integrated  Sourcing

Initiative (ISI) to be of significant impact, 92% of  the

respondents stated that ISI will not affect them; and (b)

whether his Ministry

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2291</b></font><br><br>



(i)  has  embarked  on  its FTA "outreach"  programme  to

inform and educate the business community on the benefits

of  FTA and (ii)  will intensify these efforts in view of

the SCI findings.

<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Sir, since the beginning of this year, the

Ministry  of  Trade and Industry (MTI) has  conducted  17

briefings  involving over 1,500 participants,  explaining

to  them  in detail how the various free trade agreements

we  have negotiated could be of advantage to them.  These

include  separate briefings to members of  the  Singapore

Business  Federation  (SBF) on our FTAs  with  Australia,

Japan and the United States.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our programme for raising awareness ranges from open

seminars    and   business   briefings   to    one-to-one

consultations  with  individual  companies,  which   have

approached  MTI  officials to conduct tailored  briefings

for  them  after  attending our general briefings.   Some

companies  have also sent in  enquiries through  the  MTI

website.   To  cast  as wide a net as possible,  we  work

closely  with  organisations, such as  the  SBF  and  the

individual chambers of commerce.  For instance, we staged

a major event on the US-Singapore FTA in partnership with

SBF  in  May 2003, which attracted over 600 participants.

Our events are not solely conducted in English.  In June,

MTI  organised a seminar in conjunction with SBF to reach

out  to businessmen more familiar with Mandarin.  Another

is  planned  for  late  July with the  Singapore  Chinese

Chamber  of  Commerce  and Industry.   We  will  also  be

conducting a briefing for the Singapore Malay Chamber  of

Commerce and Industry on 8th July 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our activities are targeted at all businesses, both

large  corporations  and  SMEs.   We  have  paid  special

attention  to  SMEs. My Ministry has worked closely  with

industry-specific associations as well as through SPRING,

IE Singapore and, in the future, ASME, to ensure that the

SMEs are not left out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall response to our outreach activities has

been positive, with many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2292</b></font><br><br>



follow-up  enquiries  being received  after  the  events.

Many  participants have indicated that the briefings have

helped  them to understand the FTAs much better, and  are

keen to explore the possible opportunities presented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our pre-negotiation consultations for FTAs, like the

India-Singapore CECA and the ASEAN-China FTA,  have  also

attracted  more  interest since  our  outreach  programme

started.   To  date, we have conducted seven sessions  of

pre-negotiation  consultations,  involving   nearly   100

participants   from   the  processed   food,   chemicals,

construction    and    logistics    industry    clusters.

Participants   at  such  consultations   are   now   more

forthcoming with their inputs and are more aware  of  how

they can use FTAs to help them in these markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the results of the survey by the

Singapore  Confederation of Industries  (SCI).   I  would

like  to  first  commend the SCI for  its  initiative  in

conducting the survey.  The results are extremely helpful

to  both SCI and MTI in identifying the information  gaps

that  exist  in  the minds of our business community.  As

part  of MTI's outreach activities, MTI had, even  before

the survey, worked with SCI to organise a seminar on 30th

July 2003 for its members.  We hope that, like Miss Penny

Low, SCI members will be intrigued by the results of  the

survey, and attend the seminar so as to find out how they

can  benefit from the US-Singapore FTA.  The money is  in

the  details,  and  I  believe  that  once  our  business

community studies the parts of the agreement that  affect

their industry, they will find numerous benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the US-Singapore FTA, tariffs on all products

have been eliminated, including electronics and precision

instruments.   Firms with a high volume of exports  where

there are substantial tariff elimination will get to gain

most.   Textiles companies, should they meet the rules of

origin,  will  face  lower  tariffs  and  gain  a   price

advantage after the textile quota system lapses in 2005.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These benefits will be immediately reaped by

companies that already export

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2293</b></font><br><br>



to the US.  I note from SCI's survey that although 71% of

respondents  perceive no benefits from  the  US,  50%  of

respondents also acknowledged that they do not  currently

export to the US.  I would urge these companies to review

their  business  plans in the light of  the  US-Singapore

FTA.  The US is a large market and will be a big boost to

their business if they successfully enter it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Integrated Sourcing Initiative (ISI), it

is  confined  to  266  IT products  and  certain  medical

devices.    Manufacturers  producing  these   goods   and

exporting  them  through Singapore will benefit  directly

from the provision. Although these products already enjoy

zero  tariffs  going into the US, the ISI  confers  three

additional benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, such goods will enjoy a waiver of the 0.21%

merchandise processing fee imposed by the US Customs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the ISI reduces the paperwork relating to

documentation  procedures, thus saving on  time-to-market

costs for these manufacturers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, these manufacturers will enjoy faster customs

clearance  as Singapore-origin products.  Not  all  firms

will see direct benefits from the ISI.  But the exporters

of the 266 ISI products should see higher sales which, in

turn,   generate  a  greater  volume  of  business   with

Singapore  companies that supply them with components  or

support  their  activities here.  Hence,  our  industries

will benefit indirectly from the ISI.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should emphasise that the benefits of the FTA

extend beyond tariff savings.  Enhanced investment and IP

protection, liberalisation of trade in services and other

important provisions of the agreement help us to draw  in

more     investments,     while     facilitating      the

internationalisation of Singapore-based enterprises.  All

these  will  have  important secondary spin-offs  to  the

economy.  We must therefore view the FTA in totality.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2294</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For firms, I would urge them to study the details of

those  portions that affect them directly,  and  see  how

their  operations can be re-configured  to  benefit  from

these.    MTI  will work with SBF and other  chambers  to

help businesses in the coming months in this area.

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, I am heartened to hear that

there are one-to-one consultation sessions for interested

parties.   Are  these  limited to  only  companies  of  a

certain  size or are they available to all entrepreneurs,

including start-ups?  Is there also some form of one-stop

enquiry  centre for FTAs, whether it is the  US-Singapore

FTA or the other FTAs?

<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> Size is not a criterion

for the one-to-one consultation.  It is open to all.  For

the  US-Singapore FTA, we are working on a handbook,  for

instance, so that they can get all the information  in  a

particular  handbook, and there will be a website,  going

ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the other FTAs which are under negotiation or

which  have  been concluded, MTI is working very  closely

with  SBF.  So, SBF will be a key point of interface with

businesses.

<div align="center"><b>TV AND RADIO</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Use of dialects)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b> asked the Minister for

Information,   Communications  and  the  Arts   (a)   how

effective has been the use of dialects on TV and radio in

communication  with the public during the SARS  epidemic;

and  (b) what is the policy on the use of dialects on  TV

and  radio  in future emergencies where the  audience  is

more conversant in dialects.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the

SARS  outbreak,  dialects were used on TV  and  radio  to

reach  out  to those older Chinese Singaporeans  who  are

more  conversant  in dialects than Mandarin.   It  was  a

practical approach as, like many of us, the elderly  also

need to be equipped with the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2295</b></font><br><br>



knowledge  on precautionary measures in order to  protect

themselves  from  SARS.   I  am  glad  that  the  dialect

broadcast  had achieved its purpose.  Feedback  from  the

public  had been generally positive, and a vast  majority

of  the  dialect-speaking Chinese who were surveyed  said

that they had listened to the SARS messages in dialect on

TV and radio.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we recognise that there are pockets of older

Singaporeans  who  remain conversant  only  in  dialects.

When   the   need  arises  in  future  emergencies,   the

Government  will use dialects to communicate  with  them.

However,  our stand is that we will continue to  actively

promote  the use of Mandarin, and to use dialect only  as

an exception.

<div align="center"><b>TOWN COUNCILS AND HOSPITALS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Reduction of water consumption charges)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for the

Environment  whether he will reduce the water consumption

charges  by  30% to 50% for town councils  and  hospitals

where  extra  washings of their premises are still  being

required  as  a  prevention against  the  recurrence  and

spread of SARS.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the SARS outbreak has reminded us of the

need  to  keep  improving on the  standards  of  personal

hygiene,  environmental cleanliness  and  public  health.

This  is  why we are seeing more cleaning and washing  at

public  places.   However,  I  want  to  emphasise   that

achieving a higher standard of cleanliness and hygiene is

not just a short-term concern because of SARS, but also a

long-term  challenge because we need to  remain  vigilant

against all other viruses and infectious diseases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to lower water charges by 30-50%, as

suggested  by  Mr Chiam, we could end up not  only  doing

more  washing and cleaning, but also making less  careful

use of water at the same time.  This combination of using

more water and wasting more water at the same time

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2296</b></font><br><br>



is clearly not the best way forward in our battle against

viruses and infectious diseases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, instead of calling for water to be subsidised, I

suggest  that we focus on how to make more efficient  and

smarter use of water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, if all of us can practise good personal

habits and keep public places clean and hygienic, we will

be able to keep the frequency of cleaning to the minimum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, if we can all use every drop of water more

wisely  and  waste less water, then these  savings  could

help  to  offset  any increase in water  consumption  for

cleaning.  In this way, our estates and public places can

be  cleaner,  greener and more hygienic,  and  hopefully,

without  a  corresponding increase in water  and  utility

consumption.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I must remind the Minister

that town councils are non-profit bodies ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> You have only half a minute left to

remind the Minister, Mr Chiam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes. We have not increased our

SC&C charges for the last six years.  We have no increase

in revenue, but we play our part and we spend more, by 30-50%, on water usage to clean up the place to prevent  the

recurrence of SARS.  Does the Minister not think that the

Government should play its part also to help out the town

councils, otherwise we will be lowering our standards  of

cleanliness generally, with less income?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> You have 10 seconds, Mr Lim.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will be brief.

Just to mention two points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I think it is incorrect for Mr Chiam to say

that  the  consumption of water in his town  council  has

gone up by 30-50%.  I have made a check.  In fact, across

all  town  councils, water consumption in the last  three

months, from March to May, has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2297</b></font><br><br>



come  down  by about 11-12% compared to a year  ago,  and

about 4-5% compared to the previous three months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Potong Pasir, in fact, the water

consumption there has come down by 10% compared to a year

ago, and has gone up by 1.5% compared to December 2002 to

February  this  year.  So, if we compare this  year  with

last year ---

<div align="center"><b>STREET WORKS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan (Minister of State for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Transport (Dr Balaji Sadasivan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Street Works Act (SWA) was first passed and

came into effect in 1995.  This Bill contains a range  of

amendments.   Its  primary objective  is  to  update  the

legislation to support new developments and to facilitate

LTA's operations.  In this regard, Sir, the Bill:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) empowers LTA to carry out enforcement actions

against obstructions, so as to keep passageways clear for

pedestrians;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) empowers LTA to require plans to be submitted

before engineering works are carried out within the  road

structure  safety zone.  This is to ensure  integrity  of

the road structures;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) empowers LTA to enter into non-State lands to

carry  out  road  works and install traffic  control  and

monitoring equipment;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) facilitates the introduction of a lodgement

scheme to allow for self regulation; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) winds up the Municipal Provident Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now elaborate on these and highlight the

key provisions in the Bill for the proposed amendments.

<br><br><i>Enforcement actions against obstructions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a need to ensure that the public is

not   inconvenienced   by   obstructions   placed   along

passageways.   These passageways include  public  streets

and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2299</b></font><br><br>



backlanes vested in Government, five-footways and certain

private   footways  that  serve  as  key   linkages   for

pedestrians.  Currently, LTA only has the powers to seize

and  remove  obstructions on public streets  but  has  no

powers  to  dispose  of the articles should  they  remain

unclaimed.  If the goods remain unclaimed, LTA  needs  to

seek  further  directions from  the  court  via  a  court

application.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, LTA needs to be empowered to seize and

dispose    of    obstructions   found   on   passageways,

particularly  those that are heavily used by pedestrians.

Clauses  17  and 18 create new sections  in  the  SWA  to

empower  LTA  to clear obstructions on these passageways.

The amendment will also allow LTA to enact regulations to

dispose  of  all seized articles if their owners  do  not

claim them within a specified time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like the House to note that enforcement

action   will   only  be  carried  out  against   movable

obstructions.   Where  immovable  obstructions,  such  as

illegal  structures  and walls are found  on  passageways

that  are  located  on State lands,  the  Government  has

sufficient powers under the State Lands Encroachments Act

and the Building Control Act to deal with these.



<br><br><i>Powers to ensure integrity of road structures</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 4 introduces a new section to empower

LTA  to regulate engineering works carried out within the

road structure safety zone, which is defined as 20 metres

from  the  outermost edge of any part of a road structure

such  as bridges and flyovers.  Prior to the commencement

of  such  works,  engineering plans  and  other  relevant

information  will  have  to  be  submitted  by  qualified

persons to LTA for approval.   Any failure to do so  will

be considered an offence.



<br><br><i>Powers to enter into non-State lands</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we also propose to amend the SWA to empower LTA

to enter private lands to:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) construct earth retaining walls and ancillary

buildings;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2300</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) install traffic control and monitoring

equipment;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) operate and maintain earth retaining walls,

ancillary  buildings and traffic control  and  monitoring

equipment; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) improve walkways.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, LTA has powers to enter private lands to

construct  road  structures such as bridges,  underpasses

and  tunnels.   However,  for the construction  of  earth

retaining  walls  and  ancillary buildings,  LTA  has  to

acquire  the  lands.  In some cases, only the underground

portions  of these structures extend into private  lands.

As  LTA  does  not require the land above the underground

portion, acquisition is not a good option as it will lead

to unnecessary sterilisation of this land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid this, clause 3(d) amends the definition of

"road  structure"  to include earth retaining  walls  and

ancillary  buildings.  With the amendment,  LTA  can  now

enter  private land to construct the underground  portion

of these structures without the need to acquire the land.

Notwithstanding this, Members can be assured that as  far

as  possible,  LTA will locate road structures  on  State

land so as not to inconvenience private owners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, LTA currently also has powers to enter

private land to construct road-related facilities such as

traffic  signs, street name signs and directional  signs.

However,  for  the  installation of traffic  control  and

monitoring equipment, the current practice is for LTA  to

negotiate  with  private landowners on commercial  terms.

This process of negotiation may take months, resulting in

inefficiency  and delays in implementing traffic  control

systems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To expedite the process, clause 3(d) expands the

definition   of   "road-related  facility"   to   include

electronic   and  computerised  traffic  monitoring   and

display  equipment.  Examples of such  equipment  include

EMAS  cameras, Junction Eyes, dynamic traffic information

display  signboards  and  electronic  signs.   With  this

amendment, LTA can now enter private

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2301</b></font><br><br>



land   to  install,  operate  and  maintain  road-related

facilities   such  as  traffic  control  and   monitoring

equipment, without engaging in lengthy negotiations  with

the  private owners.  Owners who wish to make a claim for

compensation  as  a result of this entry  can  do  so  in

accordance with the Land Transport Authority of Singapore

Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the above, there are occasions when LTA

will  need  to tap electricity from private  premises  to

operate  and  maintain road-related facilities,  such  as

traffic surveillance equipment erected on non-State land,

or to light up signages at bus and taxi stands located on

adjoining State land.  Clause 7 will empower LTA  to  tap

electricity from the private premises.  LTA will pay  the

electricity  supplier  directly  based  on   the   amount

indicated  on the electrical meters.  In cases  where  no

electrical meters are installed, the electricity supplier

will be paid in accordance with the formula specified  in

section 10A.  In no circumstance will the owners  of  the

private  premises  from which the  electricity  is  being

tapped  be billed for the electricity that is tapped  for

this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the SWA will also be amended to empower LTA

to enter any land to improve walkways.  LTA currently has

powers to enter any land to construct walkways for use by

the  public, but no powers to enter the land  to  improve

it.   Clause 15 amends the SWA to enable LTA to do  this.

LTA will only exercise this power as a last resort in the

interest of public safety.



<br><br><i>Self-regulation for submission of plans</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in line with Government's policy to streamline

the  approval process, clause 10 amends the SWA to enable

LTA to set up its own lodgement scheme for the submission

of plans for the construction of new streets.  Instead of

requiring LTA's approval for each plan, the plans will be

deemed  as approved upon lodgement by a qualified  person

with  LTA.   The  new  scheme  will  be  based  on  self-regulation.  In other words, the onus will be on the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2302</b></font><br><br>



qualified persons to ensure that the street plans are  in

compliance  with  the requirements of  the  SWA  and  its

regulations.  LTA will carry out random checks to  ensure

that  the  submitted plans comply with  the  requirements

stated in the SWA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA intends to start the scheme with landed housing

developments that are not affected by road widening.   It

will be extended to other developments if it proves to be

effective in ensuring that qualified persons check  their

plans  for  compliance  with  LTA's  requirements  before

making  their submissions. It will be an offence  if  the

qualified   person   makes  a  false   declaration   when

submitting plans under the new scheme.



<br><br><i>Winding up of Municipal Provident Fund</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we also propose to take the opportunity of

amending  the  Street Works Act to wind up the  Municipal

Provident  Fund.   The  Municipal  Provident   Fund   was

established  in the 1920s by the then City Council  under

the provisions of the Municipal Ordinance.  Currently, it

is  provided for under the Second Schedule of the  Street

Works Act after the Local Government Integration Act  was

repealed in 1995.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fund was set up to receive contributions from

its  members  and  to make payments  to  them  on  death,

resignation   or   retirement.   Its  members   comprised

employees  in the Housing and Development Board  and  the

Public  Utilities  Board as well as those  in  Government

ministries  who had prior service with the City  Council.

The last eligible member was paid in September 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fund also has an unclaimed balance of $6,645 due

to  some ex-members.  Many of these payments had remained

unclaimed  since 1979, with some unclaimed  since  1960s.

The  Accountant-General's Department (AGD) has made  many

attempts  to  contact these ex-members.   However,  these

attempts  have not been successful.  As the AGD does  not

envisage any further transaction, it intends to  wind  up

the Fund.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2303</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 seeks to dissolve the Fund. The balance

in  the Fund will be transferred to the Consolidated Fund

upon  the  Fund's dissolution.  Any person who wishes  to

make  a  claim  to the unclaimed moneys in the  Fund  may

still  do so at any time in the manner set out in  clause

24.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining amendments proposed in the Bill

concern   the  refinement  of  existing  procedures   and

consequential  amendments to the SWA  and  other  written

laws arising from the amendments I have spelt out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise in support of  the  Street  Works

(Amendment)  Bill  moved by the  Minister  of  State  for

Transport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have two concerns with respect to this

Bill which I would like the Minister to clarify further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first concerns clause 5 which amends section

9(1)  to enable entry by LTA into non-State land and take

possession  of  any land with the intent of  constructing

and   improving  streets  or  install  or   remove   road

structures and road-related facilities thereon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my hope, Sir, that such works, as far as

possible,  are  performed on State lands and  that  entry

into  private  properties is considered only  as  a  last

resort with the interest of the general public in mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9 of the Street Works Act 1995, subject to

the  provision of a two-month notice period, empowers the

Authority  to  enter  private land  for  the  purpose  of

constructing   road-related  facilities   or   structures

without  providing any compensatory claims to the  person

entitled  beforehand. The person entitled is required  to

file his claim for losses if he desires so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as our nation inches towards developed nation

status, it is imperative that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2304</b></font><br><br>



we pay particular attention to legislation that leaves  a

segment  of our population without proper legal recourse.

I  see the provision of the Act to acquire land which the

Authority feels necessary in the public interest  without

determining   compensation  for  the  land   before   the

acquisition  takes place, such as being provided  for  in

the  Land Acquisition Act, as denying property owners  of

their  basic rights.  It appears not to be in  congruence

with   our  objective  of  building  a  nation   with   a

competitive mindset.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our Government enterprises and Government-linked

companies  sell land and charge rents based on prevailing

market conditions, we need to bear in mind that acquiring

land  under  such  forced  situations  and  uncompetitive

conditions  is unfair and not in the direct  interest  of

our  citizens.   This amendment to the Street  Works  Act

should therefore take this issue into account by removing

the   injustice  of  disregarding  due  process  for  our

citizens  who own land.  The amendment should  take  into

consideration  Singapore's maturing  status  and  address

this  issue so that land may be acquired under firm means

but  paid for at a reasonable and, preferably, prevailing

market  price.  Consideration should also  be  given  for

inconveniences that private property owners  have  to  be

subjected to when such works are carried out within their

premises.  It is important that the message comes through

to  those  outside of our Parliament's walls  that  their

Government  is  firm  but  also  fair.   Clarifying  this

section  will  reinforce public sentiment that  a  fairer

playing  field is now on stage.  Private owners  of  land

need  not  worry about losing their properties  but  will

find   due   recourse  through  fair  consideration   and

compensation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second concern is the amendment to section 27 as

provided  for  in clause 15 of the amendment  Bill.   The

same concerns I have expressed earlier also apply to  the

newly substituted subsections (1) and (2) of this clause.

In addition, as Singaporeans are encouraged to use public

transport  and simpler modes of transportation,  we  will

require better walkways and footpaths to traverse on.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2305</b></font><br><br>



While subsection (2) of section 27 of the 1995 Act states

in  minimal  wordage that "footways should  be  up  to  a

maximum  of  3.6 metres wide", the clause  is  silent  in

specifying a minimum width for footpath.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we progress as a nation, I think it is important

for  the  Government to place on equal parity the  safety

and  well-being  of the population that uses  its  public

walkways   for  its  everyday  needs  to  that   of   the

Government's  when  it  comes to managing  efficient  and

smooth-flowing roads.  This will help, albeit in a  small

way,  to  encourage more to use public transport than  to

depend  on  private  methods  of  transportation.   Every

little  bit  counts  in our drive  to  conserve  land  by

discouraging  the use of private vehicles.   This  is  an

opportune  time for us to realise our vision as  part  of

this legislation.  What the public would like to see  and

what  the  Street Works (Amendment) Bill should  consider

providing at the minimum is legislation that ensures  (a)

convenience; (b) safe; and (c) accessible walkways for  a

large segment of the population.  I feel that our present

Bill needs a clearer mandate to help encourage people  to

make  use  of  our walkways in a manner that  provides  a

seamless connector to their destinations or their  travel

origins.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose a broader and better defined

set of characteristics that will help our population make

use  of  our walkways to get to our bus stops, MRT  train

stations,  public  buildings  or  simply  move  from  one

neighbourhood  to another.  These include (a)  setting  a

minimum  width  for a footpath where two  adults  walking

abreast can have enough room to traverse comfortably; and

(b)  having a set of guidelines that would provide for  a

comfortable gradient when a footpath comes to an end, eg,

at road crossings or at level shifts between buildings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, it would also benefit our

pedestrians  to have these walkways offset some  distance

from the road tarmac, wherever possible.  This would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2306</b></font><br><br>



make  them  safer  in the minds of our  pedestrians  and,

possibly,     discourage    jaywalking    if    immediate

accessibility  to  the  road tarmac  is  removed.   These

proposals  will go a long way in encouraging  our  senior

citizens,  families with children, those  with  strollers

and  especially  the handicapped gain  greater  mobility,

independence and ease to get from one point  to  another.

It  is  a  concern that as we progressively develop  more

sophisticated  modes  of public transportation  that  the

last  mile to and from our stations is left only for  the

brave and adventurous.  We must, as a progressive nation,

look  ahead  to  building a footpath  network  that  will

complement   our   otherwise  world-class  transportation

infrastructure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, once again, I support the

amendment Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Thank you, Sir, for allowing me

to speak on this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot support this Bill. Some of its

provisions are too unfair.  For example, clause  5  which

amends  section 9 of the principal Act is  one  of  them.

This  clause  gives the Authority more power  to  acquire

land  compulsorily  to  build roads  without  paying  any

compensation at all to the landowner whose land has  been

taken  by  the  Authority.  I do not see why compensation

should  not  be  paid  to  the landowner.   The  land  is

acquired  to make it into a public road.  True, a  public

road  does provide a public good.  But the Government  is

not  providing  the  public good  for  nothing.   On  the

contrary,  in  these  days  of  COE  and  high   motorcar

registration and licence fees, the Government is  reaping

millions of dollars each year from motorists for road use

and  the privilege of owning a car.  In view of the  fact

that  the Government is making huge profits for road  use

by  motorists, I think it is fair that clause  5  of  the

Bill  should  be amended to include a provision  for  the

payment of compensation to landowners whose land has been

compulsorily acquired for building a public road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, in the past, the Government did pay

compensation to landowners

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2307</b></font><br><br>



whose land was compulsorily acquired for construction  of

public  roads.   The amount paid was  normally  $1.   The

reason  for  that  token payment is that  the  Government

wants to protect itself  in law.  The Government does not

want  to  end  up  in  a situation  later  on  where  the

landowner  turns around and claims the land back  on  the

ground  that his land was acquired without payment  of  a

valuable  consideration.  As all lawyers know, a contract

without  a  valuable consideration later may be  declared

null  and void.  So, the Government pays the landowner  a

compensation  of $1 which is a valuable consideration  in

the eyes of the law.  But with this amendment in clause 5

of  this  Bill,  the  Authority is armed  with  statutory

powers  to compulsorily acquire land for construction  of

public roads without payment of any compensation at  all.

So,  the past practice of paying $1 to provide a valuable

consideration for the compulsory acquisition of  land  is

now redundant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a former client, when I was still in legal

practice, whose land was compulsorily acquired  for  road

building.  He was paid $1 compensation by cheque.  He did

not  bother  to  bank  in the $1  cheque  into  his  bank

account.  He had the $1 cheque framed up and hung on  his

office wall.  I am just wondering whether that $1 cheque,

which  was in payment of compensation for land taken  for

road  building by the Government, is still on his  office

wall.   If it is, then it is a valuable collector's item.

Because  with this amendment today, the Government  shall

not be making payment of $1 cheques anymore to compensate

for  the  compulsory  acquisition  of  private  land   to

construct public roads.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other provision in the Bill which I am

dissatisfied  with  is new section  10A(6).   Under  this

clause, the Authority is allowed to tap electricity  from

adjoining  land  when  the  Authority  is  carrying   out

construction  or improvement works on a  piece  of  land.

Later,  should  there be a dispute  in  the  quantity  of

electricity  used by the Authority, the landowner's  only

recourse is to make an appeal to the Minister.   We  must

remember that it is the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2308</b></font><br><br>



Minister's  department which is a party  to  the  dispute

with the appellant over the amount of electricity used.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this point, I must make it clear that I am

not  saying or insinuating that the Minister is an unfair

person,  and  is  sure to side the officers  of  his  own

department.  But in the eyes of the law, justice must not

only  be done but must be seen to be done.  In this case,

the  Minister  cannot be made the arbiter  when  his  own

department's officers are involved in the case.  To me, I

think  it  would be fairer if this new section 10A(6)  be

amended  to  allow the appeal to be made to a  manifestly

neutral  person, say, either a judge in chambers  of  the

High Court or the subordinate court.  This clause, as  it

stands,  makes  the  appeal to  the  Minister  where  his

decision is final very unfair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendment which I do not agree is new

section 32A(3)(c).  New section 32A(1) states:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No person shall -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) deposit or cause or allow any article or thing to be

deposited  on any public street, five-footway or  private

footway; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) cause or allow any article or thing to remain on any

public street, five footway or private footway,



so  as to create any obstruction or inconvenience to  the

passage of the public on such public street, five-footway

or private footway."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who contravenes the abovementioned clauses

shall  be  guilty of an offence.  If such an  offence  is

committed, the Authority can go after (a) "the  owner  of

the  article  or  thing;" (b) the person who  caused  the

article or thing to be illegally deposited; and (c)  "the

owner  or  occupier  of  any land or  building  fronting,

adjoining  or abutting on the public street, five-footway

or private footway."  I cannot agree with sub-clause (c).

How  can  the  owner  of any land  or  building  that  is

fronting  or adjoining on the public street, five-footway

or private footway be held liable when things or articles

are  illegally dumped in his vicinity?  To me, he  is  an

innocent  party.   He  cannot be made  to  look  out  for

illegal  dumping  in the adjoining public  street,  five-footway or private footway all the time.  I agree that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2309</b></font><br><br>



the  owner or the person who throws unwanted bulky  items

on  the public street, five-footway or private footway be

made responsible, but not one who lives next  to a public

street or private footway.  This is the first time I have

come across a provision where a person is made liable for

a  crime  by virtue of the fact that he is close  to  the

crime where the crime took place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Potong Pasir, there are high-rise blocks of flats

which  are situated close or next to the central  rubbish

centres.   Sometimes,  there are outsiders  who,  in  the

stealth  of the early hours of the morning, make  illegal

dumping  of  bulky  items in these  centres.   When  that

happens,  my  Town Council has to spend quite  a  lot  of

money  to  clear  all the illegal bulky  items  that  are

dumped at our rubbish centres.  Can I, as the Chairman of

the  Potong  Pasir Town Council, make the  residents  who

live  adjacent to the central rubbish centre pay for  the

removal  of those illegal items?  I certainly think  not.

Up  to  now,  the  Potong  Pasir Town  Council  has  been

responsible  for  preventing  illegal  dumping  and  also

apprehending  those culprits that we find,  and  we  take

responsibility to remove the dumped items.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I do not think that those owners or

occupiers  of  land adjoining the public  streets,  five-footways  and private footways should be made responsible

for  any  illegal  dumping on them.   I  would  urge  the

Minister to delete new section 32A(3)(c), under clause 18

of  this  Bill, and let the Authority take on itself  the

responsibility  of preventing illegal dumping  on  public

streets and apprehending and punishing the wrongdoers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise  in support of the Street Works (Amendment)

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a time when I see street works in progress, I

wonder  how  much more public streets and  their  related

road structures and facilities can Singapore conti-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2310</b></font><br><br>



nue  to  bear  without encroaching onto private  land  or

State  land  that  has already been  built  upon.   As  a

country   progresses   and  aspiration   increases,   new

buildings  for offices and homes will continue to  sprout

up.   Street works then become more complicated as demand

for  common  space in a limited land area  increases.   A

sensible  and fair handling of plan for the construction,

improvement,   repair,  maintenance  and  management   of

streets  and back-lanes and the prevention of obstruction

of footways are necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 introduces new definitions to section 2 of

the  Street Works Act (Chapter 320A).  Public streets are

now  clearly defined to mean only streets that are vested

in  the  Government.  This is important as otherwise  any

street  which is privately owned but through the goodwill

of  the  owner  allows public to use  may  over  time  be

wrongly    classified   as   "public   streets".     Such

clarification will also help in the valuation of  private

properties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The addition of a new section 32A (under clause 18)

is certainly a necessary power for the LTA to ensure that

Singapore's  public  streets, five-footways  and  private

footways are clear and clean.  However, I would like  the

Minister  to clarify what does "obstruction"  mean.   The

new section 32A, subsection (1), states that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No person shall -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) deposit or cause or allow any article or thing to be

deposited  on any public street, five-footway or  private

footway; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) cause or allow any article or thing to remain on any

public street, five-footway or private footway,



so  as to create any obstruction or inconvenience to  the

passage of the public on such public street, five-footway

or private footway."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does "obstruction" here extend to young saplings

which  over  time will grow to become huge  public  trees

blocking the path of a public footway?  Let me explain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along East Coast Road, in front of the Katong

Shopping Centre at Mountbatten, is an overhead pedestrian

bridge which

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2311</b></font><br><br>



has been in existence for many years.  About a metre away

at  the foot of the steps leading down from the bridge to

the  footpath, which leads to the bus stop, stands a huge

Angsana tree obstructing pedestrians from having a  clear

passageway.   One has to be nimble in his  footwork  when

stepping  down from the steps onto the footpath to  avoid

the  roots  of  the  tree that have  protruded  from  the

ground.  In fact, one could literally hug the tree  after

stepping down from the steps of the bridge.  Furthermore,

while  making a swing round the tree, one has to, at  the

same  time, make sure that he does not step onto the busy

street before walking towards the bus stop.  I am not too

sure  whether it was the tree that was planted after  the

overhead  pedestrian bridge was built or  the  other  way

round.  But, clearly, an obstruction is in the way  of  a

busy passageway.  Will this proposed amendment then allow

the  LTA  to  cut  down the tree which, I believe,  comes

under  the National Parks Board's care?  Or does it  mean

that LTA will have to move the pedestrian overhead bridge

away  from  the obstruction?  I hope it does not  require

another  amendment  to  the  legislation  to  provide   a

commonsense solution to such a problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example, which is the opposite extreme, also

arises from matured trees.  But, this time, the trees are

not  obstructing the public streets.  It was to my horror

that  I  discovered on Friday last week, 27th June  2003,

that  the Land Transport Authority, in the name of street

works,  cut  down 10 healthy Casuarina pine  trees  along

Dunman  Road,  in front of the Guillemard military  camp,

after  the proposed Tanjong Katong MRT station that  will

form  part of the new MRT Circle Line.  Those trees  have

been  there for about 35 years.  They provided good shade

and beauty, and are not obstructing any public street  or

footpath, nor are they in the way of the construction  of

the underground MRT station.  I understand that more will

be chopped off as I speak now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These examples show the exercise of powers without

due consideration to other factors that do contribute  to

a neighbourhood rich in history.  The serenity and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2312</b></font><br><br>



beauty  that  took  so  long to  achieve  have  now  been

destroyed.   Again,  a  commonsense approach  could  have

saved  those  trees  rather  than  treating  them  as  an

obstruction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 introduces a new section 29A that clearly

states that, "The Authority shall be responsible for  the

management,  maintenance and repair of back-lanes  vested

in  the  Government."  This is a welcome move as it  will

ensure  that  the  back-lanes are well looked  after  and

provided   for  because  additional  common   space   for

residents living along the lanes will benefit from  them,

rather than letting these lanes become homes for unwanted

animals and undesirable characters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 seeks to amend section 9(1) to provide more

powers  to  the Land Transport Authority of Singapore  to

enter  upon  and take possession of any land,  not  being

State  land, and construct or improve street, or  install

or  improve  road  structure and  road  related  facility

thereon.   While it is a good intention of the  Authority

not  to do anything that shall alter the ownership of the

land  that  is affected, the owner may still  face  great

inconvenience  and a loss of income in some  cases  as  a

result of the road works.  This is especially so when the

Authority has the right to give them the minimum of  only

two  months' notice, under section 9(2), of its intention

to  enter  private land to construct new  streets.   Most

land  owners would take a while to overcome the shock  of

knowing  that their land would be encroached  upon;  thus

leaving  a few short weeks after the news to prepare  for

the  time  when  the bulldozers start  going  into  their

property.   Knowing  that this is  the  feeling  of  land

owners, I trust the Authority will exercise fairness  and

compassion in the enforcement of its powers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the amendment to section 20 (under clause

11)  which  seeks to regularise the practice of accepting

security bonds from banks and insurance companies in lieu

of cash is timely, especially when businesses are seeking

ways of making their cash balances work harder for them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2313</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendments to the Street Works

Act.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> I thank

the Minister of State for explaining the rationale to the

amendments  in  this  Bill, which I agree  will  help  to

improve  the  conditions for commuters  and  pedestrians.

However, I have two concerns that I hope the Minister  of

State will kindly clarify.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, like my other colleagues before me, I would

like  to  refer to clause 5 which amends section 9(1)  to

authorise the Land Transport Authority to take possession

of  any  land  to  construct or improve  any  street,  or

install  or  remove any road structure and  road  related

facility.   Could  the Ministry please clarify  and  give

details  on  how the owners of land will be  notified  or

compensated under this Bill?  Currently, there  are  such

provisions under the Land Acquisition Act for the LTA  to

negotiate with land owners for land that is needed  on  a

non-urgent  basis.  Does the property purchasing  section

of  the  LTA  function in the same way under  the  Street

Works  Act when land is being acquired for better  roads?

Could  the Ministry please clarify should some amendments

be included in the Schedule to this Bill?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second concern is in reference to clause 15

(section  27).  Land can be acquired to improve  existing

walkways  or  to construct new ones.  In the  process  of

designing or redesigning walkways, may I please ask  that

provision  be  made  for wider footpaths  to  accommodate

especially the width of wheelchairs.  In some cases, some

footpaths are really narrow.  And I think with  an  aging

population and more people wanting to be mobile  as  they

use  their  wheelchairs, it becomes  important  that  our

footpaths  are wide enough.  Some of our elderly  do  use

walking  sticks; some mums and dads do push their  babies

out  in  strollers; and where the walkways are  concerned

here, sometimes the quality is not there and they are not

well   maintained.   As  such,  under  the  Street  Works

(Amendment)  Bill, is it possible then to  add  a  clause

where

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2314</b></font><br><br>



safety  issues  are considered such that  maintenance  of

walkways  will  always be there, so that people  can  use

them  knowing  that they will not be  injured?   Like  my

colleague  Mr  Andy Gan said earlier, we have  seen  tree

roots  in  the walkway itself.  We have seen  lamp  posts

intruding  into  the footpath that has  been  beautifully

constructed.   We have also seen those huge grey  utility

boxes  taking  up  almost  a third  of  the  width  of  a

footpath.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One special section of a footpath that I would

perhaps  like to draw attention to would be  Bedok  South

Avenue  1  along Upper East Coast Road.   It  is  a  very

narrow footpath that I think anyone who is not able  will

not  be  able to use.  While we spend much money on  such

construction, it will be good to have a safety clause  so

that  that becomes a maintenance issue that we  can  take

into consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before one can support this Bill, I would like some

assurance, please.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the

Members  for  their speeches on this  Bill  and  I  shall

clarify  some  of the questions that have been  asked  by

Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad asked if we were depriving property

owners  of their basic rights with the amendment made  by

clause  5.   Mr  Chiam See Tong was also concerned  about

this  and  so too were the other two Members.   Mr  Ahmad

Magad  has  also mentioned that we should consider  using

the powers to enter into non-State land as a last resort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure the House that these are indeed our

intentions,  ie, to try and protect the basic  rights  of

owners  and to try and enter into their land  as  a  last

resort.   As  I  mentioned earlier, this  amendment  will

allow   LTA   to  construct  earth-retaining  walls   and

ancillary  buildings without the need  to  sterilise  the

land  above  the underground portions of the  structures.

This will therefore reduce the need for land acquisition.

Furthermore, LTA will try as far as possible to carry out

all  such  works  on State lands and entry  into  private

properties will only be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2315</b></font><br><br>



carried  out as a last resort.  In cases where LTA  needs

to  enter  private  land, LTA will  also  compensate  the

owners for the displacement loss, ie, the loss of use for

the  period  of time when LTA is carrying out the  works.

The  owners are required to submit the claims because the

details  may  vary  from  case  to  case.   Without  this

amendment,  LTA would be forced to acquire  the  land  in

order to do this work.  But with this amendment, LTA  can

avoid  acquiring the land.  So the aim of this  amendment

is  actually to allow property owners to keep their land.

However,  in cases where the owners would prefer  LTA  to

acquire  the land, the Bill also provides for flexibility

for LTA to consider this option.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad has also suggested minimum width and

guidelines for gradient to be set for walkways to  ensure

that they are convenient, safe and accessible.  Ms Braema

Mathia  is also concerned about the width of the walkways

so  that  the  disabled on wheelchairs can use  them.   I

would  like  to assure the House that the LTA  does  have

standards for the construction of footways.  This  varies

from  between  2.4 metres and 4 metres and its  width  is

more than comfortable for more than two people to walk or

a wheelchair to be used.  However, the preferred approach

is  to  use  these  standards as guidelines  rather  than

mandatory   minimum  requirements,  as   there   may   be

situations  that call for flexibility in the exercise  of

such standards.  For example, a footpath may need to be a

couple  of  inches short of the minimum width requirement

at  a  specific  point,  for example,  when  there  is  a

heritage tree.  In such an instance, we would not want to

chop  down the tree so that we can meet the minimum width

requirement,  nor  would we want to  avoid  building  the

footpath because of the tree.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Andy Gan has asked what is considered an

obstruction.    He  also  asked  whether   the   proposed

amendment  will allow us to remove trees.   Allow  me  to

clarify  that obstructions in the context of  the  Street

Works (Amendment) Bill refer to articles or things that a

person deposits or allows to remain on any public street,

five-footways or private footways.  Trees

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2316</b></font><br><br>



will  not fall within this definition.  If any particular

tree  is  causing an obstruction or danger to the public,

the  Government has powers under the Parks and Trees  Act

to deal with it and NParks enforces this Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam was concerned about LTA tapping electricity

from  private  premises.   The  purpose  of  having  this

amendment  is  so  that  in the  construction  of  roads,

special  cables  need  not  be laid  just  for  obtaining

electricity for the purpose of the construction.  As this

electricity  tap from private premises will have  meters,

it  is  quite easy to determine how much electricity  has

been  used  by LTA and to pay directly to the Electricity

Board the amounts due.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was also concerned about the liability of owners

of  private property to obstruction in public land in the

vicinity of the private property.  The amendment  in  new

section  32A  will only affect the owner of  the  private

walkway when he has a legal duty to maintain that walkway

in a manner without obstruction.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, may I get some

clarifications  from the Minister  of  State.   I  cannot

understand  when  he  says  that,  under  clause  5,  the

authority can take possession of any land without  owning

it.   Am  I  correct?   So you are only  taking  physical

possession but not legal possession.  When the  authority

uses this land for road use, is there a transfer of legal

title   to  the  authority?   I  would  want  this  point

clarified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have got two more points. As regards the point on

tapping  of  electricity, I was  more  concerned  of  the

manner in which the appeal is made. The appeal is made to

the  Minister and the Minister is, at least, outwardly  a

biased  person because it is his own department  that  is

appealing to him.  So in law, not only justice has to  be

done,  but it has to be seen to be done.  In other words,

when  people say that the appeal is to the Minister, they

would straightaway say it is not fair.  But if you appeal

to  a  neutral person, they will be quiet.  So we  should

have the appeal to a neutral person.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2317</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards new section 32A, I do not think there is

anything in the section which says that the owner of  the

land,  or the occupier of the land adjacent to the public

street,  has the duty to take charge of the  street.   It

does not say that.  As long as you are living adjacent or

abutting  the public street and if somebody  throws  some

rubbish  there, you are liable if a notice is  served  on

you  for  21  days and you do not do anything  about  it.

That is how I read it.  Is that correct?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, without going

into  detailed legal arguments with Mr Chiam, as he is  a

lawyer  and I am not, I would like to clarify  the  three

points  that he raised.  With regard to the first  point,

yes,  LTA  will  possess  the  land  in  order  to  build

ancillary  structures, but it will not acquire the  land,

and  it will pay compensation for the use or displacement

during that period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second point, I do not see a

major problem in determining how much of electricity that

is being taken from the private premises as there will be

a  meter which will record how much electricity is  being

used.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with regard to his third legal point, the

principle is, if the owner has the legal duty to maintain

that  space  and  he  does not keep that  space  free  of

obstruction,  such  that  pedestrians  cannot   use   the

walkway, then the LTA will act.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I am sorry I have to take

up this point again. Whatever the Minister of State says,

it  is  not  reflected in the amendment.   He  says  that

compensation  shall be paid to the land  owner  when  his

land  is taken by LTA.  Where does it say that in  clause

5?   Can he point out to me?  Under clause 5, there is no

legal  duty for the authority to pay any compensation  to

the  land  owner  for  the land in  which  it  has  taken

possession of.  It does not say that at all.  And it does

not  say that the provisions of the Land Acquisition  Act

shall also have effect.  It does not say that.  So  I  do

not know where he gets the legal standpoint from.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2318</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards new section 32A, it does not say that the

owner  or  occupier  of  any land or  building  fronting,

adjoining  or abutting a public street, five-footways  or

private footways has got any legal duty to take charge of

this  public street.  It does not say that.  As  long  as

you  are living or occupying next to a public street  and

somebody  throws something and you have a  21-day  notice

served on you, you have to clear the rubbish.  It  is  as

simple as that.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, again, I

would  like  to explain to Mr Chiam that the  reason  why

there  is no compensation for acquisition is that,  under

this  amendment,  we  are not acquiring  the  land.   The

compensation   that  is  being  paid  is  therefore   not

compensation   for  acquisition,  but  compensation   for

displacement or loss, that is, the loss of  use  for  the

period  of  time when LTA is carrying out the  work.   We

have  checked with the AG's Chambers on the  language  of

the  Bill  and it feels that it is sufficiently clear  in

explaining  these  and the other points  that  have  been

raised by Mr Chiam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I want to clarify one

point.  If the authority occupies or takes possession  of

the  land, my question to the Minister of State  is:  who

has got legal title of the land?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> The legal owner has title of

the land.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Sir, I am a little bit

more confused now.  How temporary is temporary because if

we  are  widening  the walkways under the  other  clause,

surely  we  are not going to give back the land  at  some

point?   In other words, it is not a displacement  issue,

is it?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> You have got the clauses

confused.   Clause 5 is entry into State  land  to  build

ancillary  structures.  Most of the ancillary  structures

we  are  talking  about here are underground  structures.

You  are  talking about the clause that covers  walkways.

The  amendment in the clause that covers walkways  is  to

repair  walkways.  Currently, we have the power to  build

walkways on private land but we do not have the power  to

improve

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2319</b></font><br><br>



or maintain them, and the amendment allows us to do that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I just want a

clarification.  In the new section 32A, it specifies that

LTA can dispose of whatever that is taken or removed from

obstruction.  It says that it would dispose of  within  a

specified  time.  Can the Minister of State clarify  what

is  a specified time in new section 32A?  And if he tells

me  it  is  within  a reasonable time,  then  what  is  a

reasonable time?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Currently, when objects are

found  to obstruct the private walkway, they are  removed

and  a  court  order is required for the  objects  to  be

disposed of.  Under this amendment, my Ministry will have

the  power  to  draw up regulations and to stipulate  how

much  time is given to people to claim the objects before

LTA  can  dispose it.  And I would like to assure Members

that  we will give a reasonable amount of time.   I  will

inform the Ministry officials to study the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2320</b></font><br><br>



problem.   I  presume  it will be several  weeks  to  two

months.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I would like to put on

record  that  I am dissatisfied with the answers  of  the

Minister of State as they do not reflect what appears  in

the provisions of this amendment Bill.

<div align="center"><b>EXPENDITURE ON SARS EPIDEMIC</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Health

how  much  has been spent and disbursed by the Government

since March this year on expenditures in connection  with

the SARS epidemic.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore was declared SARS free by WHO on 31st May

2003.   This was achieved by Singaporeans coming together

to  deal  decisively  with the disease.   Our  healthcare

workers in particular rose to the challenge.  The  battle

against  SARS,  however, has been costly.   To  date,  32

people, including five healthcare workers, have died as a

result of SARS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SARS has also imposed a high financial cost on

Singapore. As of 31st May 2003, the Government has  spent

$192  million  on direct SARS operating expenditure.  The

Government  has  also introduced a $230 million  economic

relief package to assist businesses adversely affected by

the SARS outbreak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest share of direct operating expenditure as

a  result of SARS has been incurred by my Ministry.   MOH

and  its two healthcare clusters have up to 31st May 2003

spent about $117 million on items such as:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) the purchase of medical supplies and protective

gear  for  healthcare workers and patients  (eg,  gloves,

gowns, masks);

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) provision of free medical screening for SARS at

Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH);

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) provision of free ambulance service for persons

requiring SARS screening;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) setting up of fever clinics at polyclinics;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) the administration and enforcement of home

quarantine orders; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f) setting up of contact tracing centre and SARS-hotline centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOH has also committed to fund the healthcare

clusters'  essential SARS-related development expenditure

for  the  setting  up  of  isolation  facilities  in  the

hospitals  and  retrofitting existing medical  facilities

for   provision  of  SARS  treatment.   The  SARS-related

development cost is estimated at $105 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These estimates exclude the indirect costs

associated with SARS, such as the designation of TTSH  as

a SARS hospital which resulted in the closure of hospital

wards,  cancellation of elective surgeries and outpatient

appointments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial impact of SARS will not be one-off.

The  changes that we are instituting in our hospitals are

here  to  stay,  to ensure that we have in  place  proper

infection  control processes and procedures to deal  with

future  outbreaks, be it SARS, or any other disease.   My

Ministry,  with inputs from the two healthcare  clusters,

is  in the process of working out the financial impact of

SARS  on  a  steady state basis.  The baseline  operating

costs of hospitals will need to be adjusted to take  into

consideration  the changes in requirements  for  personal

protective  equipment  and patient  management  and  work

processes that are necessary to prevent another spread of

SARS  or other infectious diseases in Singapore.  We will

lose  some  efficiency  but  we  will  gain  in  stronger

infection  control  measures.  We are  conscious  of  the

potential impact of these changes on patients'  fees  and

will  try  to  moderate the impact, especially  on  lower

income patients.

<div align="center"><b>EDUCATION ON SARS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Minister for

Education in view of the emphasis placed on personal  and

collective  responsibility and  on  personal  and  social

hygiene  in  the  attempt to combat SARS,  (a)  will  his

Ministry reinstate "Hygiene" as a subject or, at least as

a  component  of  an  existing  subject,  in  the  school

curriculum; and (b) how will his Ministry inculcate self-discipline  on  students and their parents  so  that  the

students  will put on face masks in the event  that  they

contract ordinary colds and influenza.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Topics relating to personal hygiene and social

responsibility  in hygiene matters are currently  covered

in  the  Health Education syllabus at the primary  level.

Pupils  are  taught  how  to take  care  of  their  body,

maintain  a  healthy lifestyle, and keep the  environment

around  them clean and safe. They also learn about  germs

and how diseases can be prevented.  Since the outbreak of

SARS,  personal  hygiene has been further  emphasised  at

school assemblies and in classrooms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All parents have been reminded, through an advisory,

not  to send their children to school if they are unwell.

They   should  take  their  children  to  see  a   doctor

immediately and return to school only when they are well.

There  is therefore no need for students to put on  masks

to  attend  school.  If they have a common cold  or  flu,

they should not come to school.  Instead, they should see

a  doctor.  And, they should put on a surgical mask  when

they proceed from home to see the doctor.  This education

message is being propagated at the national level by  the

Ministry  of  Health.   The Ministry  of  Education  will

reinforce this message through the schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that a student is discovered to have a

cold  or  flu  in  school, and there is a  need  for  the

student  to  put  on  a surgical mask,  the  school  will

provide the mask and ask the student to put it on  whilst

waiting  for  his/her parents to fetch  him  to  see  the

doctor.

<div align="center"><b>PRIMARY ONE EDUCATION</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam</b> asked the Minister for

Education  under the Compulsory Education  Act,  (a)  how

many  children amongst those due for Primary 1 this  year

(2003) were given deferments on non-medical grounds;  (b)

what  are the other approved reasons for exemptions;  and

(c)  what is the process for getting these children  into

school.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) This year, 55 children were granted deferment to

enrol   in  Primary  1  on  non-medical  grounds.   These

children  started  their  kindergarten  education   late.

Their  parents  applied for deferment to enable  them  to

complete  their  kindergarten education  before  entering

Primary 1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) The following categories of children can be

granted exemption from compulsory education (CE):

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Children given approval to attend designated

schools.  Up to 400 children given approval to attend the

six madrasahs offering full-time religious education, and

up  to  10  children  given approval  to  attend  San  Yu

Adventist School will be granted exemption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Children undergoing home-schooling.

Approval will only be granted if the parents are able  to

satisfy  MOE  that  the children will  receive  a  strong

foundation  for  further  education  and  training,   and

develop a sense of national identity.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2325</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Children with special needs who are not

able  to  follow the national curriculum in our  schools.

These  children should be enrolled in a special education

school where their needs can be met.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) The Ministry will remind parents of all the

children  who are given deferment to enrol their children

in  Primary  1  in  2004.  A registration  pamphlet  with

information  on  P1 Registration will  be  sent  to  them

before registration for Primary 1 commences in July 2003.

<div align="center"><b>COMPULSORY COUNSELLING FOR PRIMARY 6 STUDENTS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mdm Cynthia Phua</b> asked the Minister for

Education  if  he  will  consider compulsory  counselling

sessions for Primary 6 students who have to cope with the

stress of the Primary School Leaving Examination.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE adopts a comprehensive and systemic approach in

ensuring the psychological well-being of pupils.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though there is no compulsory programme for Primary

6  pupils, schools do pay particular attention to  pupils

at  important stages in their school lives, such as  when

they   first  join  a  school,  or  during  examinations.

Schools do have various programmes for all students  such

as  orientation and dealing with examinations.  These are

in  effect mass counselling sessions though they  do  not

have  a  compulsory  or  standardised  format  among  the

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In parallel with these counselling and psychological

support  programmes that cater to all pupils in a school,

schools  do  provide  more  focused  counselling  support

according  to the needs of the pupils.  Such  counselling

support is available in school for pupils from Primary  1

through  to  JC2/PU3.   Every school  has  a  counselling

referral   system  in  place  to  facilitate  the   early

identification  and  extension of  help  to  pupils  with

problems.  All  teachers are first-line  care-givers  and

given  training in Basic Counselling Skills so that  they

may  provide  immediate basic counselling  to  pupils  in

need.   Pupils with more difficult problems are  referred

to  Teacher  Counsellors of which there are two  in  each

school.   The  Teacher Counsellors are  trained  in  more

advanced  counselling  skills  and  crisis  intervention.

Pupils with serious problems are referred to MOE Guidance

Specialists,    school    counsellors     or     external

professionals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children and teenagers go through significant

developmental changes and may face different difficulties

at  different  stages  in their  development.    Teachers

would have knowledge of their pupils and would be able to

help identify pupils who need counselling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also not forget that it is not just the

school, but also the home environment that contributes to

the  overall psychological well-being of our children  as

they grow up.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE POLICE FORCE</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  in  view of manpower demands in  areas  such  as

terrorism  prevention, whether (i) the  Singapore  Police

Force  has  sufficient resources to respond  to  ordinary

crime  concerns,  and  (ii) there is  a  need  to  commit

additional resources to the Police.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reassure Members that the Police has not

lowered  its readiness to deal with the crime  situation.

The  need to combat both crime and security threats after

9-11  has certainly stretched Police resources.  However,

the Singapore Police Force has reorganised itself and has

drawn  on  additional resources to deal with  these  twin

challenges.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2327</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following September 11, both anti-crime and security

patrols   were  increased  significantly.   For  example,

Police crime patrols increased by 49% as compared to  the

period  before 9-11.  Police was able to achieve this  by

leveraging  on  every  available staff  including  Police

NSmen.   Immediately after 9-11, Police froze all  leave.

For  2002,  Police  restricted  leave  to  urgent  cases.

Police  also scaled down non-essential services, such  as

the  handling of lost and found reports and  rescuing  of

trapped  animals,  in  order to  free  up  resources.  In

addition, the re-organisation of the Neighbourhood Police

Post  (NPP)  system  to the Neighbourhood  Police  Centre

(NPC)  system  in 1996 has enabled the Police  to  deploy

more   officers   on  patrols,  thus  increasing   police

visibility in the neighbourhood and to respond quickly to

crime cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, Police has been able to handle the

twin   challenges  of  combating  crime  and   preventing

terrorism  because it taps the resources  of  other  Home

Team  departments,  as well as the  community  at  large.

Many  Singaporeans are involved in the  Community  Safety

and  Security  Programme  and  Neighbourhood  Watch  Zone

activities   such   as   Citizens-on-Patrol   and   crime

prevention   discussions  for  the  elderly.    Terrorism

prevention,  in particular, involves the  Home  Team  and

does  not  fall  solely on the shoulders of  the  Police.

Hence,   the  Singapore  Civil  Defence  Force  and   the

Immigration and Checkpoint Authority also play key roles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Singapore remains one of the safest cities

in  the world to live in. The Home Team will continue  to

ensure this to be so.

Kyi and members of her political party in Myanmar.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b>

for Myanmar but for ASEAN as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conveyed our concerns to the Myanmar government

shortly after Aung San Suu Kyi was taken into "protective

custody".   On that occasion, we also urged  the  Myanmar

government to cooperate with the Special Envoy of the  UN

Secretary General and, in particular, to grant him access

to Aung San Suu Kyi.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, when the ASEAN Foreign Ministers met

at  the recent Retreat in Phnom Penh, we joined the other

ASEAN Foreign Ministers in expressing concerns about  the

safety  of Aung San Suu Kyi and in calling for the  early

lifting  of restrictions on her movement.  We also  urged

the   Myanmars  to  stay  on  the  course   on   national

reconciliation   and  dialogue  with  all   the   parties

involved, including Aung San Suu Kyi and her party.

<div align="center"><b>FIVE-DAY WORK WEEK</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for

Trade  and  Industry  whether he  will  clarify  (i)  his

rejection  in the media of having a 5-day work  week  for

civil  servants;  and  (ii)  how  will  individual  civil

servants  scheduled to work any five days a  week  affect

the functioning of the civil service on weekends.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will study the recommendations of the

Remaking Singapore Committee, including the proposal  for

a  5-day  week, before deciding which recommendations  to

accept.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2329</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from the Public Service Division's perspective,

Government  ministries  are  given  some  flexibility  in

deciding on their working hours, so long as the work week

remains  at 42 hours, and ministries continue to be  open

for business at least five and a half days a week. Within

this framework, most Government agencies are able to  set

up  alternate  Saturday-off arrangements, while  offering

longer operation hours to service the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adopting a 5-day work week for the civil service now

will send the wrong signal. Private sector companies  are

facing immediate difficulties, arising from SARS and  the

economic downturn.  They need to tide over this difficult

period, and also implement urgent wage reforms.  Going on

5-day  week should not be a top priority for them or  the

civil service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, many MNCs, and their production

lines,  are  working  24-7.   It is  important  that  our

working  hours  be in tune with the needs of  the  global

economy,  and  not  be bound by rigid  rules  on  working

hours.

<div align="center"><b>SUBTITLING ON TV</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Minister for

Information,  Communications  and  the  Arts  since   the

question on signing and captioning of key programmes  for

the  hearing  impaired was posed last year and  the  then

Acting  Minister had replied that Singapore  Broadcasting

Authority would explore with broadcasters the possibility

of  providing  the  hearing impaired with  subtitling  of

major Government speeches, how many programmes have  been

so subtitled and if more will be done.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Media Development Authority or MDA has explored

with broadcasters, the possibility of providing subtitles

for  major  Government speeches for the  benefit  of  the

hearing-impaired.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MDA has informed that to provide accurate subtitling

of  all  important  speeches by Government  leaders,  the

broadcaster  would need advance copies  of  the  prepared

text.   However,  prepared texts of important  Government

speeches that are aired 'live', such as the National  Day

Rally  speech, are normally not ready until hours  before

actual delivery.  In some cases the prepared text may not

be  available to broadcasters before the delivery of  the

speeches.   Also,  for  `live'  broadcasts  such  as  the

National  Day Rally speech, it is difficult for  accurate

subtitling  as  actual delivery may include  off-the-cuff

remarks  which  differ somewhat from  the  prepared  text

itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MDA has also assessed that while it is not

practicable  for broadcasters to subtitle  all  important

speeches,  they  should  be  able  to  provide  selective

subtitling. For a start, MediaCorp has agreed to  provide

subtitling  for  the  English  version  of  this   year's

National Day Message to cater to the needs of the hearing

impaired.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out that there are other

practical  means for the hearing-impaired  population  to

get  news  information.  Channel NewsAsia (CNA)  provides

captions  during  its  news  bulletins,  summarising  key

points from the news story that is being featured at that

point  in  time.  Summaries of the latest news  are  also

available  on  CNA  in  the form  of  crawlers  that  run

throughout the day.  The information on these crawlers is

updated  regularly and includes breaking news.   For  the

"live"  coverage  of the National Day  Rally  and  Budget

speeches, CNA also summarises the speeches through  short

captions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the CNA website provides up to date

information   on  newsworthy  items.   Hearing   impaired

viewers  can  also  refer  to  short  news  write-ups  on

<div align="center"><b>SUICIDES AMONG INDIAN WOMEN</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. <b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam</b> asked the Minister for

Community  Development and Sports  (a)  how  many  Indian

women have committed suicide each year from 2000 to 2002;

(b)    whether   the   figure   is   a   disproportionate

representation; and (c) what are some of the measures his

ministry is exploring to help the community.

<br><br><!-- Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of Indian women who committed suicide was

eight  in  2000, 11 in 2001 and 16 in 2002.  In the  last

three  years,  out  of  the total  number  of  women  who

committed suicide in Singapore, the average proportion of

Indian women who committed suicide was about 8.4%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for suicide are multi-faceted and often

inter-related.  The most common reasons are poor  health,

depression, relationship problems, financial problems and

mental  illness.  Whatever the reasons, we  must  do  our

best  to  prevent suicides and see to it that  there  are

enough channels for women to turn to if they need to talk

to someone about their problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, counselling services are readily

available  at  the  Family  Services  Centres  which  are

located  in the heartlands.  The Samaritans of  Singapore

has  a 24-hour crisis hotline for those who need help  or

just a listening ear.  Treatment programmes are available

at  the  Institute of Mental Health (IMH) to  help  those

with psychiatric disorders or depression.  Social service

agencies, Polyclinics and General Practitioners can  make

referrals to the IMH as and when necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) organises suicide

prevention  programmes  annually.   This  September,  the

Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA) will  be

jointly  organising with SOS, a talk in Tamil on  suicide

prevention.  SINDA also plans to disseminate  information

on   how  to  get  help  for  someone  who  has  suicidal

tendencies  through  the media such as  the  Tamil  radio

station.   My ministry applauds such pro-active  measures

to reach out to the community on sensitive issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, friends and relatives who notice

that  their  loved ones could be at risk  of  suicide  or

manifesting  suicidal  tendencies  should  seek  help  to

prevent  such  mishaps from happening.   The  public  may

contact  these agencies for help if they know anyone  who

may be at risk for committing suicide:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samaritans of Singapore: 1800-2214444 (24-hour

crisis hotline)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family Services Centre: 1800-8380100

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Association for Mental Health: 1800-2837019

<div align="center"><b>LIGHT-RAIL TRAIN TO SENTOSA</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for

Trade  and  Industry (a) if building a  light-rail  train

from  HarbourFront  MRT to Sentosa  is  the  solution  to

making  Sentosa  exciting; (b) if  he  expects  the  $140

million  invested in the monorail to be recoverable,  and

within  what  timeframe; and (c) will this project  be  a

waste of public money.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2333</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sentosa Express is a light rail line linking

HarbourFront MRT Station to Sentosa. Sentosa  Development

Corporation (SDC) is embarking on this project as part of

its  Masterplan to remake Sentosa as a world-class resort

destination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make Sentosa a more attractive resort destination

for  both  Singaporeans  and  foreign  tourists,  SDC  is

bringing  in  major  new leisure  offerings.   Under  the

Master  Plan, visitorship to Sentosa is expected to  grow

from  4.1  million in 2002 to six million  in  2006,  and

eight  million in 2012.  The Sentosa Express will connect

seamlessly  with  the  MRT network, and  facilitate  this

larger  movement  of  visitors  to  and  around  Sentosa.

Visitors  will  be able to enjoy greater convenience  and

much  shorter  waiting times.  The  current  bus  service

plying between the mainland and Sentosa will not be  able

to  cater  to  the  growth  in visitors  without  causing

congestion  at  the  causeway and the surrounding  roads.

Similarly,  the  existing  monorail  system  on   Sentosa

island,  which is 20 years old, has limited capacity  and

has become increasingly difficult to maintain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sentosa Express project costs $140 million, and

is  expected  to fully recover the capital and  operating

costs  in  the  eighth year of operation.  Besides  being

economically  viable in its own right, it  will  generate

spin-offs for Sentosa by allowing more visitors to access

the   island's   attractions,  and  by  encouraging   new

investments.    It   is   also  part   of   the   broader

infrastructure  that  will  support  a  larger  flow   of

tourists to Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister  and Minister for Finance what is the amount  of

were to be extended to single men and women.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Finance is unable to estimate this

figure  as it would require substantial effort to  verify

the  marital status of every employer of a foreign  maid,

and  estimate  the personal tax savings to each  employer

who  is  single.  The objective of the Foreign Maid  Levy

relief  is  to encourage women to rejoin or to remain  in

the  workforce after marriage.  Since this  objective  is

not  relevant  to singles, data on single men  and  women

have never been needed or compiled.

<div align="center"><b>MILITARY AIRCRAFT OVER JURONG WEST</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister and Minister for Defence (a) if he is aware that

military  aircraft  have  been  flying  overhead  in  the

vicinity   of  Jurong  West  at  three  to  five   minute

intervals,  causing  great  noise  nuisance  to  the  HDB

residents and resulting in the difficulty in selling  the

HDB  flats; and (b) whether he can do something to  abate

the  noise  nuisance  due  to  military  aircraft  flying

overhead.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF is aware of the noise issue and understands

the  concerns about the noise level generated by aircraft

flying  activities.  The Republic of Singapore Air  Force

(RSAF) has been minimising its aircraft from flying  over

densely populated residential areas.  However, due to our

country's  limited  airspace, it is inevitable  that  our

aircraft  will  overfly some residential estates  in  the

vicinity of airbases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RSAF needs to conduct day and night flying to

maintain  operational readiness for the  defence  of  our

country.   We  are already conducting a lot  of  aircraft

training  overseas, but in-country flying still needs  to

be  done as our pilots need to be familiar with our local

airspace environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RSAF first instituted noise abatement measures in

the  late seventies.  Over the years, other measures have

been   implemented  incrementally.   These  include   the

following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Raising the minimum transit altitudes of RSAF

aircraft overhead Singapore;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Revising departure and arrival routings to

minimise over-flights of residential areas;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Having our aircraft take the quickest route to

the training areas;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Ceasing night-flying by 11.00 pm (unless

absolutely necessary for operational reasons); and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) Scaling down the flying activities during the

year-end examination period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to assure residents that MINDEF/RSAF

will  continue  to find ways to further  reduce  aircraft

noise, while maintaining the operational readiness of the

RSAF.

<div align="center"><b>NORTH-EAST LINE</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for

Transport what is the consideration determining that  the

North-East  line  be built underground  and  that  it  be

driverless.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The North-East Line (NEL) has to be built

underground  because it passes through many  areas  which

are   already   densely   developed.   By   building   it

underground, we also achieve several benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it gives us maximum flexibility to site

stations  at  more accessible locations for  the  greater

convenience of commuters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it minimises the environmental impact by

reducing   visual  intrusion  and  noise  pollution   for

residents living along the corridor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, it allows us to optimise land-use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fully automated system was chosen for the NEL

because of the significant benefits it would bring.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is safer. Experience around the world

shows  that  most  rail accidents  are  caused  by  train

drivers.   A  fully  automated system eliminates  such  a

risk.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it provides greater operating flexibility as

the  deployment of trains is no longer dependent  on  the

availability of train drivers.  This allows the  operator

to   schedule  train  services  better  and   to   deploy

additional  trains  to cope with any sudden  increase  in

passenger  volume.  This means shorter waiting  time  for

commuters on such occasions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, it makes better use of manpower. Instead of

putting  an officer in the driver cabin on each train  to

perform routine and repetitive functions, the officer can

now,  if  necessary, provide direct customer services  to

commuters on the train while continuing to attend to  the

other train operations.

<div align="center"><b>BUILDING COST OF NORTH-EAST LINE</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for

Transport if he will give (i) the total cost of  building

the North-East Line and (ii) the breakdown of the cost.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The North-East Line cost a total of $4.6 billion to

build.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This comprised (a) $2.7 billion for civil and

architectural works, (b) $1.4 billion for mechanical  and

electrical works and systems (including the trains),  and

(c) $0.5 billion for land costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire cost was funded by the Government.

<div align="center"><b>HDB TENDER SELECTION</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development,  in  this  bad  economic  climate,

whether  HDB is willing to review its selection criteria,

in  particular,  to deviate from its normal  practice  of

awarding a tender to the contractor with the lowest bid.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2339</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for

National Development whether he will review all contracts

which  HDB  has accepted on the lowest tender  prices  to

enable  these contractors to complete the jobs for  which

they have tendered.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB's tender system is guided by the Government's

policy  to  award a tender to the company that gives  the

best  value  for  money, and not necessarily  the  lowest

bidder.   First, contractors are pre-qualified  based  on

their  financial  resources, professional  and  technical

qualifications and track record, using the  Building  and

Construction Authority (BCA)'s Contractors Registry as  a

guide.  Second, HDB will verify that the tender proposals

fully  comply with the tender requirements.   The  tender

proposals  are  then  evaluated  based  on  their   price

competitiveness,    conformance    to    the     required

specifications, the tenderer's ability to  undertake  the

project,  his  financial solvency and his performance  in

other public sector projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, HDB conducts due diligence on the tenderers

and  their  tender prices.  If HDB finds that the  lowest

tender price is significantly below the other tender bids

and its own estimates, it will interview the tenderer and

ask  him to re-examine his bid.  He can withdraw his  bid

if he so chooses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, HDB's tender system is sound and

working  well.   Since 2000, the number of HDB  contracts

that had to be terminated was only 4% of the total number

of  contracts  awarded.  However, even  with  a  rigorous

selection  process, there is no guarantee  that  selected

firms  will  not meet business difficulties and  flounder

later, especially during this economic downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under HDB's tender system, the company that offers

the  best  combination of price, quality and  reliability

will  be  awarded the contract.  All things being  equal,

HDB  will award to the lowest bidder who can do the  job.

It  is  objective and fair, and ensures transparency  and

accountability in the use of public funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, in view of recent feedback, MND and BCA

are  presently reviewing the current tender  system,  and

seeking  views  from  industry  representatives  and  key

Government  agencies.   For ongoing  projects,  contracts

have  already  been  entered into  between  HDB  and  its

contractors  and  these are legally  binding.   HDB  will

continue to monitor its contractors' performance closely.

If  any  contractor runs into difficulty, HDB  will  take

immediate  action to rectify the situation  and  minimise

the impact on the public.

<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC INQUIRY ON UPGRADING OF HDB FLATS AT MARINE TERRACE</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development  whether  he  will  hold  a  public

inquiry to enquire why the upgrading of the HDB flats  at

Marine Terrace could not be completed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upgrading works at Marine Terrace stopped on 3rd

June  2003  due  to  the  latest  contractor's  financial

difficulties  and cash flow problems.  HDB had  exercised

due diligence before engaging the original and subsequent

two  novated contractors for the project.  Unfortunately,

they all ran into financial problems.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2341</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has employed a contingency contractor to

minimise  inconvenience to residents, complete  the  more

urgent  works  first and provide essential services  like

conservancy  work,  housekeeping and  site  security.   A

limited tender has been called to select a new contractor

to finish the work.  The new contractor should be on site

by  August  2003.  Completion may be slightly delayed  by

one to two months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since HDB is not the cause of the delay and measures

have  been  taken  to  complete the works  expeditiously,

there is no need for a public inquiry.
