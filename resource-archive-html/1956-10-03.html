<div align="center"><b>(Appointment of Chairman)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Hon. Members will have received

information   that,   under  the   provisions   of

paragraphs  (2)  and (6)  respectively  of  Standing

Order  No.  61,  I have appointed  Mr  G.  A.  P.

Sutherland  to be Chairman of the Public  Accounts

the Estimates Committee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>HOSPITAL CHARGES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Increases)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for Health

whether he will make a statement

explaining  the reasons for the increases  in  the

Hospital Charges in respect of the 1st and

2nd Class Wards in Government Hospitals.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. J. Braga:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hospitals

Board  recommended an increase in the ward charges

in  the  General  Hospital and the Kandang  Kerbau

Hospital.   This  was  carefully   considered   by

Government,  and Government, after  going  through

the   various  aspects,  decided  to  accept   the

recommendation to raise costs as it was considered

that  the  present charges were most uneconomical.

It is also the policy of Government, in accordance

with   the  Labour  Front  programme,  to  provide

hospitalisation and specialist treatment  free  to

one and all, and the provision of special wards to

be  maintained for those who can afford it.  There

is  no  difference  whatsoever  in  treatment  of

patients, whether they are paying or non-paying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be of interest to Members to know that

the  1956  recurrent cost of running our hospitals

is estimated at more than $21 million, whereas the

total  revenue from hospital charges is  estimated

at  only  $1,500,000. The cost of  maintenance  of

beds  in  the General and Kandang Kerbau Hospitals

is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



estimated from 1955 figures to be as follows:

<pre>

 General Hospital

  Paying patients (A) cost $27.74 per bed;

  Paying patients (B) cost $26.07 per bed;

  Free patients cost $24.33 per bed.



 Kandang Kerbau Hospital

  Paying patients (A) cost $22.62 per bed;

  Paying patients (B) cost $21.76 per bed;

  Free patients cost $20.61 per bed.

</pre>

<br>It  will  therefore be seen that even  the  first-class patients have been subsidised by Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of first and second class beds in

these two hospitals are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the General Hospital, out of a total of 1,005 beds, there are only 46 first-class beds

and 121 second-class beds and 838 free beds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Kandang Kerbau Hospital, out of a total of 390 beds, there are only 29 first-class, 37 second-class and 324 free beds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only hospitals in which there is

accommodation for paying patients are the General,

the  Kandang Kerbau and the Woodbridge  Hospitals.

In  the  Tan  Tock Seng, the Middle Road  and  St.

Andrew's Orthopaedic Hospitals, all beds are free.

It  will  therefore  be seen  that,  for  a  great

majority  of  patients, no charge of any  kind  is

levied  and  Government  considered  that  it  was

justified in asking first-class patients to pay an

economic  fee and to ask the second-class patients

to  pay a slightly higher contribution towards the

cost  of  upkeep of second-class beds. It  is  not

considered  that the new charges are excessive  as

compared  with rates prevailing in other countries

with a comparable standard of living.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the

Minister tell this House why, if it is the  Labour

Front's   policy  to  provide  as   much   medical

facilities  as  possible,  there  should   be   an

increase  in  charges in respect of  second-class

wards? Is it justified?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> It might be of information to the

Member for Queenstown to know that the Director of

Medical  Services  and the Chief  Medical  Officer

have  a discretion to give a rebate on charges  in

respect  of  second-class patients  and, in  some

cases  of  proved hardship, not to charge anything

at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, can the Minister tell us

how  the question of hardship is assessed?  Is  it

just  on  the  question of  poverty  or  is  it  a

question of money?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> All circumstances are taken into

consideration - a   person's  salary,   a   person's

family,  and the number of children and  so  forth

who are dependent on him.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>PRIVATE ROADS TO SCHOOLS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Maintenance)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Lim Koon Teck</b> asked the Minister for Local

Government, Lands and Housing whether in  view  of

the  unsatisfactory  condition  of  private  roads

leading  to  some schools, such as Play-fair  Road

School  and Duchess Road School, he will make  the

necessary  arrangements with the local authorities

concerned   to  keep  these  roads  in  reasonable

repair.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, this matter concerning the

repair  and  upkeep of private  roads  leading  to

schools  has  been  under  consideration   by   my

Ministry  in  conjunction  with  the  Ministry  of

Communications   and  Works,   the   Ministry   of

Education  and  the  local  authorities  for  some

months,   and  as  a  first  step  to  this   end,

arrangements  have already been made  in  specific

cases   with   the  local  authorities   for   the

improvement  of a number of such roads,  including

the road leading to the Duchess Road School.

<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Butterfield (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr C. H. Butterfield):</b> Sir, I beg to move that this Order be discharged and the Architects (Amendment) Bill be withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move this motion because, since the Bill

was  read  the First time, several representations

have been made to the Minister regarding both  the

Bill   itself  and  certain  provisions   of   the

Architects  Ordinance which are untouched  by  the

Bill.  It has not yet been possible to give  these

representations the consideration which they merit

and,  in  the  circumstances, the most  convenient

course to take is to withdraw the Bill. Sir, I beg

to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Order for Second Reading of this Bill be

discharged and the Bill withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINOR OFFENCES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Sir, I move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a Bill, Sir, to assist the police in

dealing  with  secret  society  gangsters.  It  is

unfortunately   notorious  that   secret   society

gangsters here in Singapore depend on violence, or

the  threat  of violence, for their existence  and

for  their  power over the unfortunate people  who

get into their clutches. They get their funds by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



threats, and to be effective, threats have got  to

be  backed up by deeds. So it is that victims  who

fail   to   pay   extortion  money  are   brutally

assaulted,  stabbed  and even  murdered.  Further,

these  gangs have to fight for their own existence

in the jungle war that goes on between rival gangs

to   secure   control  of  particular  places   or

particular  rackets.  Before  the  recent   police

campaign  against  secret  societies,  these  gang

fights  and  threats  of gang fights  were  almost

daily occurrences. In the three months April,  May

and June, there were no less than 70 occasions  on

which  there was either a gang fight or the threat

of  a  gang fight, and in these fights, as I think

it is well known, all sorts of vicious weapons are

used - knives,   bottles,  knuckledusters,   bicycle

chains,  iron  bars  and other  such  things.  The

victims are very often assaulted in the dark or in

a  crowded public place where the thugs can easily

make  their  escape. But it does  very  frequently

happen that the police, getting information that a

gang  fight  is about to take place, are  able  to

arrive at the scene and prevent the fight actually

developing, even though the strong-armed thugs are

there  with their weapons ready. But if no  breach

of  the  peace has actually occurred,  it  is  not

possible to charge these thugs in court, and it is

to  remedy  that  difficulty  that  this  Bill  is

brought to the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will make it an offence to carry,

without  lawful authority or reasonable excuse,  a

knife  over 2½ inches long or any other offensive

weapon.  That means that if the police can  arrest

these thugs who have gathered for a gang fight and

find  them in possession of these vicious weapons,

they will be able to charge them in court and,  on

conviction,   have  them  sent  to  prison.   Now,

unfortunately in these affrays we do not get  much

help from the victims or even from bystanders  who

may   witness   what  is  going  on.   They   are,

unfortunately, too frightened of the brutal  power

of  the  secret  society gangs to  come  and  give

evidence in court, and in order to help successful

prosecution, this Bill therefore puts  the  burden

of  proof on an accused person to explain  why  he

was  carrying a weapon at that particular time and

place.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure, Sir, that any measure designed to

assist  the police in dealing with this menace  of

gangsterism will command the full support of  this

House  and  of  the public. But  it  may  be  that

Members feel some uneasiness that innocent persons

may   be   put  in  jeopardy  by  the  presumption

contained  in the Bill making it necessary  for  a

person, found  in  possession  of  one  of  these

weapons  in a public place, to explain his  lawful

authority  or reasonable excuse for carrying  that

weapon. I trust, Sir, that this uneasiness is  not

really justified. After all, an accused person  in

those  circumstances has only got to show that  he

has  some reasonable cause to be carrying a knife.

Few  of the weapons that we have in mind are  such

that  they  will  not themselves  raise  a  strong

presumption of malicious purpose; but in the event

of  a  law-abiding citizen being found carrying  a

knife in a public place, he has only to show  that

he  had some reasonable cause to be carrying  that

knife,  for  example, that he  needed  it  in  the

course of his business, or that he was on his  way

to  use  it for some lawful purpose, and  he  must

then  be  released.  I would hope,  Sir,  that  we

could, with confidence, rely on the police and the

courts   to  judge,  on  the  evidence   and   the

circumstances,  whether or not a  person  carrying

one  of  these weapons had discharged his duty  of

explaining  why.  I myself, Sir, will  have  every

confidence  that we can confidently  rely  on  the

courts to safeguard the liberty of the law-abiding

citizen.  It  seems  to me that provided  innocent

persons  do not go round carrying weapons of  this

sort  without good reason, then they have  nothing

to  fear  from  this Bill. Much, of  course,  will

depend   on  the  circumstances,  and  should   it

unfortunately  be the practice  for  a  number  of

persons to carry knives about with them, by day or

even  by  night, for no proper purpose, then  they

must stop doing so. I think it is right and proper

that people should not be in the habit of carrying

knives on their persons for presumably the purpose

of attacking other people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, even if there is some uneasiness and

even  if some embarrassment or indignity is caused

to the law-abiding citizen by being called upon to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



explain why he is carrying a weapon, then I  would

urge that that should be accepted in good part  as

a  small  price  to pay for helping  to  keep  our

streets  and public places free from these violent

and often deadly affrays and for, making them safe

for the law-abiding citizen to go about his lawful

occasions  without  fear for  his  person  or  his

property. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

when this Bill was received by

me  I  indeed felt very uneasy about  it.  I  have

heard  the  explanation  by  the  Hon. the  Chief

Secretary  about the type of people the Government

is  after. We do want to support the Government in

any  measures against unlawfulness,  but  we  must

bear  in  mind  that  we must always  protect  the

innocent people and, wherever possible, to exclude

them from any inconvenience. This Bill, when it is

passed, will make the police the sole authority to

determine whether a person is, in fact, guilty  or

not  guilty of the offence. New section 24 (1)   of

the Minor Offences Ordinance reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any person who without lawful authority or

reasonable excuse the proof whereof shall  lie  on

him has with him any knife or offensive weapon  in

any public road..." shall be guilty of the offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of lawful authority, it would be

difficult to imagine that any person who carries a

weapon  would want a permit from the police.  That

rules out "lawful authority". The term "reasonable

excuse" can be interpreted in many different  ways

by different people. Is it reasonable for a person

to carry a knife in an omnibus after he has bought

it?  If  a  policeman should find that  he  has  a

knife, the first thing he would do is to haul that

person  into  a police station and thereafter  the

poor chap will have a lot of explanations to make.

I am thinking particularly of those people who buy

knives for kitchen purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask Government to look at the problem

from this angle: that a person with a knife on him

does not necessarily mean that he will want to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



cause some other people voluntary hurt; but  if  a

person has a knife concealed on him, then there is

reasonable  suspicion that  that  knife  is  being

carried for unlawful purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, there are many people in Singapore who

have  to carry knives about in the course of their

work.  I cite the case of Harbour Board labourers.

In the process of loading or unloading, they might

have  to cut boards or string or ropes with  their

knives  which, I would say, are necessarily  of  a

length  of  2½ inches or a bit more. Such  knives

are  usually  carried about by the labourers  with

their bunches of keys and other working tools, and

it  would be difficult for the person concerned to

detach  his knife when he is not on duty. Probably

because  of  long habit, he might be carrying  the

knife with him and he may be arrested off duty.  I

think  this  Bill is going to put  such  types  of

people  to a great deal of inconvenience.  If  the

Bill,  however, is passed and the spirit in  which

it  is passed is not clearly stated to the police,

what  I am afraid of is that there will be a great

deal  of petty tyranny. That should be avoided  as

far  as  possible in order that the right  of  the

innocent  citizen to go about his lawful  business

is safeguarded.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

wish to elaborate a little on the

point  raised by the Member for Serangoon. I think

there are very few in this Assembly who have  much

intimate knowledge of workers as to how they work.

There are thousands of workers in Singapore who do

carry,  for the purposes of their work, a whistle,

a  knife and a long needle and these people can be

found in the Havelock, Tanjong Pagar and the  Boat

Quay, Telok Ayer, areas. If the Bill is passed  as

it  is, thousands of workers can be stopped by the

police  and  taken to police stations  and,  after

giving their explanations, they may or may not  be

released.  We do not know, but they  may  even  be

harassed.  What  is  the protection  provided  for

these thousands of honest workers in this Bill?  I

am  not against the spirit of the Bill, but I want

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



Hon. the  Chief Secretary to tell  us  how  these

workers  can  be  protected from arrest  and  from

being disturbed by the police.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

at first glance this Bill appears to

be  very onerous on the public in that the onus is

now  thrown  on the person carrying a knife  in  a

public  place  to  prove a reasonable  excuse  for

having  that knife with him. In view, however,  of

the  explanation  given  by  the  Hon. the  Chief

Secretary  that this Bill is required  because  of

the   recent  violent  outbreaks  by  the   secret

societies  in the form of extortion,  gang  fights

and  intimidation, I do not think we should oppose

the passage of the Bill, except to warn Government

that, being given such wide powers, it should  use

them wisely and carefully.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I

would  like to draw the attention of the  previous

speakers to the definition of "knife":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'knife' means any knife whether clasp knife or

otherwise, the blade of which is more than two and

a  half inches in length and which is capable,  in

the  opinion  of  the Court, of being  used  as  a

stabbing  or  cutting instrument and includes  any

sword, dagger, blade or similar instrument adapted

for use as a cutting or stabbing instrument;".



<br><br>It  does  not  mean  that if you  carry  a  pocket

penknife, you will be charged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, after having heard the Member for Serangoon

and  the Member for Telok Ayer, it seems that they

do  not  have sufficient confidence in the  police

force.  We  should have confidence in  our  police

force.  We should also assume that members of  the

police  force are intelligent enough not to arrest

persons,  ordinarily  good  citizens,  carrying  a

little knife in their pockets.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, on a point of order. That

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member please make his

point  of explanation in the proper way, that  is,

if the hon. Mr R. C. H. Lim will give way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I do not know why the

nominated Member Mr R. C. H. Lim should say  that

we have no confidence in the police. We have never

said  that. Ordinarily, a policeman is not a  well

educated     person - do    not     forget     that.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> That is so!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Hon. Members must remember

that they must address their remarks to the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just the

other  day I bought a small knife for the  purpose

of fishing and I do not visualise at any time that

a  policeman, finding me carrying a knife and  not

dressed  as  I am now but as a coolie for  fishing

purposes, would arrest me; and if I were arrested,

my  explanation, I am sure, would be accepted.  So

there is no reason why there should be any fear in

anybody's heart that the police will not act  with

intelligence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chief Secretary, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, I would, in reply, like to say

that  we  on  this side of the House do  have  the

greatest  sympathy for some of the expressions  of

uneasiness  which have been raised  by  the  other

side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon spoke of the word

"inconvenience". I think, in my speech moving this

Bill,  I did say that I hoped inconvenience  would

be  accepted.  But it is not only the  police  who

will  be  the  judges. After all, if a  person  is

arrested,  he  has  also  the  courts  which  will

consider his case. I have no doubt, as I have said

in moving my motion, that the courts will be quick

to   safeguard  the  liberties  of  the   innocent

citizen.  Most of the examples which were  quoted,

such  as labourers who need knives for their work,

and who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>



may be going to or from their work, would, I hope,

be   quite  clearly  covered  by  the  "reasonable

excuse" which is given in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may perhaps comfort Members if I inform the

House  that  we have taken the substance  of  this

provision   from  Ceylon.  The  Ceylon  Government

introduced,  quite  a  number  of  years  ago,  .a

similar   provision   in  their   Minor   Offences

Ordinance, and at that time they specified a blade

length  of  3½ inches in a knife. We  are  advised

from  Ceylon that that provision had an  extremely

good  effect  on decreasing the use of  knives  by

criminals, and their experience was such that they

have  since  amended  their law  and  reduced  the

length  of  the knife to two inches, which  is  an

even  shorter length than that we are giving here.

It  would  appear, from what we  can  gather  from

Ceylon, that the police have not abused the  power

and  that  it has achieved its effect in  stopping

the  use  of  knives and other  weapons  in  these

brawls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally we would like, if we could, to meet

some  of  the  points which have been raised.  For

example,  it  was suggested that we should  relate

the  offence only to a concealed weapon, but I  am

afraid that would raise great difficulties because

I  do  not  see  how we could define  "concealed".

Would  a weapon carried in a pocket or in a sheath

or  on  a  belt be concealed or not? I would  have

said  that it would be concealed, so that  if,  by

putting  in "concealed", you still brought  within

the  law weapons carried in pockets or sheaths  or

on belts or under jackets, you would not, in fact,

make any very tangible change in the position. But

I think all I can do, Sir, is to give an assurance

to the House that the police will be instructed to

use  every endeavour to see that this power is not

used  to  harass  innocent citizens  or  to  cause

vexation. The power is given to them to deal  with

secret   society  gangsters,  and  it  should   be

directed at them; and I have every confidence they

will  do  that.  In the event of there  being  any

abuse  of  the  power, I am sure  that  both  hon.

Members here and the courts will raise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>



complaints of which we shall take notice.  In  the

meantime, I do ask the House to give us this extra

power.

<div align="center"><b>CRIMINAL JUSTICE (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Sir, I move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Sir, is another Bill to strengthen the law

against  gangsters. As Members of  the  House  are

probably  aware,  the Criminal Justice  (Temporary

Provisions)  Ordinance was enacted last  year  for

the   special  purpose  of  dealing  with   secret

societies  and gangsters, and its main  provisions

were  that when a member of a secret society or  a

person  connected with a secret society  has  been

convicted  of  one of the offences listed  in  the

First Schedule, then the courts may sentence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>



him either to corrective training or to preventive

detention,  taking  into  account  the   age   and

possibilities of reforming the person concerned or

the  need to prevent him from continuing to  be  a

menace to his fellow citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule to the Ordinance lists the offences

for  which those sentences can be imposed  by  the

courts, but it omits from that list the offence of

criminal  intimidation under section  506  of  the

Penal  Code. This is a patent omission in  dealing

with secret societies because intimidation is  the

primary activity and, indeed, the lifeblood of the

secret societies. They depend for their existence,

for their funds, on getting money by extortion  or

by  protection  money exacted  from  taxi-drivers,

stall-holders,  hawkers and  all  sorts  of  other

people.  The members of secret societies  threaten

those  persons  with injury to  themselves  or  to

their property unless the money is paid over,  and

that,  of  course,  is precisely  the  meaning  of

"criminal   intimidation".   So   this   Bill   is

introduced,  Sir, to include criminal intimidation

in the Schedule to the Criminal Justice (Temporary

Provisions) Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken to make a

small  correction in the Bill to bring  it  up  to

date.  Paragraph (g)  of the First Schedule  refers

to  two Emergency regulations which were in  force

when   the   Bill   was  enacted.  The   Emergency

Regulations have now lapsed and this amending Bill

substitutes  a  reference  to  section  7  of  the

Criminal   Law  (Temporary  Provisions)  Ordinance

which  has  replaced Emergency Regulation  4,  and

thereby  brings the Ordinance up to date with  the

law as it now is. Sir, I beg to move.

<div align="center"><b>(SINGAPORE) (AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL</b></div>

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, Sir, is a simple one. The Silver

Jubilee Fund was raised in 1935, partly by  public

subscription  and partly by a grant  made  by  the

Government and the Municipal Commissioners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1936 an Ordinance to establish the Fund was

passed. Section 3 of that Ordinance provides  that

the  Trustees  of the Fund shall be a  corporation

consisting  of  the  persons for  the  time  being

discharging the duties of the Chief Secretary, the

Financial  Secretary, the President  of  the  City

Council, and two persons not in the service of the

Government  from  time to time  appointed  by  the

Governor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is considered undesirable that Ministers

should  serve on statutory bodies which are  under

the   aegis   of  another  Minister.  This   Bill,

therefore, provides that the two Ministers serving

as  Trustees, namely, the Chief Secretary and  the

Financial  Secretary, should be  replaced  by  two

permanent officials. As the Trustees are concerned

with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>

control  of  funds,  it is considered  appropriate

that  these  two officials should  be  the  Deputy

Financial  Secretary  and the  Accountant-General.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think that everyone in this House will

remember  that,  just  before  his  departure  for

India, the Rt. Hon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



Malcolm  MacDonald,  with a generous  donation  of

$5,000, opened a fund for a very practical and yet

imaginative  purpose. That purpose,  Sir,  was  to

establish  a  Singapore Youth Sports Centre  where

young  people of every race and creed  could  meet

together  for sport and friendship. In  suggesting

the   establishment  of  the  Sports  Centre,  Mr

MacDonald  pointed out that Malayans were  already

distinguishing themselves in many fields of  sport

and  athletics and that some of their  names  were

known throughout the world. Mr MacDonald went  on

to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If our school children can have expert training

in   many  such  activities,  their  standards  of

attainment  will  be high. I think  of  the  youth

centre  as  a  place where capable instructors  in

various  branches of sport would  train  boys  and

girls to be healthy in body and therefore also  in

mind."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days after Mr MacDonald had made his

donation, an Appeal Committee was set up to manage

the  fund and the public were invited to subscribe

to   it.   The  Singapore  public  has   responded

magnificently  to  the appeal for  funds  and  the

total   collected  now  amounts  to  approximately

$300,000.  The  City  Council  has  undertaken  to

donate 50 cents for every dollar subscribed by the

public   up   to   a  maximum  of  $150,000.   The

Government,  Sir, for its part,  has  donated  the

Kallang  Terminal Building together with 13  acres

of  land  to  the centre. The total value  of  the

building and land is estimated to be $2,500,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after consultation with the Appeal

Committee, it was decided that the setting-up of a

statutory  board would be the most  efficient  and

suitable  way of managing the fund and  organising

the  centre. The Bill before this House  today  is

designed to effect this. It provides the machinery

for  the establishment, construction, conduct  and

maintenance of the Singapore Youth Sports Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not propose to describe

the Bill clause by clause as this has already been

done  very fully in the Explanatory Note  attached

to  the Bill. But before I conclude, Sir, I should

like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



to pay tribute to the hard work done by the Appeal

Committee.  It is their enthusiasm and zeal  which

have   done   so   much  to  make   possible   the

establishment of the centre. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the objects

of  this  Bill  are commendable.  It  is  one  way

whereby  the  youth of Singapore  may  be  brought

together on the same sports field so that they can

mix  with  one  another  freely  and  be  able  to

understand   one  another  more  thoroughly;   but

looking  through this Bill, I find there are  many

defects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of the youth leaders in Singapore, the

first  time that I knew of the existence  of  this

Bill was when it was brought up for First Reading.

The  second  time that I knew about the  Bill  was

when  it  was sent to me by the Assembly. I  bring

this  point  to  the notice of the Assembly,  Sir,

because,  since  this Bill is  to  be  called  the

Singapore Youth Sports Centre Incorporation  Bill,

the accent on it should be youth; and if the youth

organisations   of   Singapore   are   not   fully

consulted,  then I say that those who have  framed

this   Bill  have  overlooked  the  necessity   of

bringing   all  youth  organisations  into   their

confidence and getting the best ideas from them so

that  there might be better cooperation later  on.

You   might  have  a  good  centre  providing  all

facilities for the youth of Singapore, but  unless

there  is going to be cooperation from all  sides,

it might turn out to be a white elephant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of money that is going to be expended

on  this  Youth Sports Centre is in the region  of

half a million dollars up to date, and it will  be

a  pity  if this centre is going to cater for  the

needs of only those who live around it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look at clause 3 (4) of the Bill and I find

that the Board of Management shall consist of  two

members nominated by the City Council; two by  the

Minister  for  Education; two by the Minister  for

Labour  and Welfare; one member nominated  by  the

Financial  Secretary; one member by the  Singapore

Chamber of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>

Commerce, one  member by the Chinese  Chamber  of

Commerce;  one  member by the  Indian  Chamber  of

Commerce;  and one member by the Malay Chamber  of

Commerce. Only under paragraph (e)  can I find  two

members  nominated by the Singapore Youth Council.

If  this  is  going to be an institution  for  the

benefit  of  youth, then we must have  people  who

understand  youth. We must have  people  who  have

worked for youth and know the needs of youth;  but

instead of that, I find that we have on the  Board

more people who are interested either in their own

business or just interested in making more  money.

That  is  going to be a very serious setback.  The

youth  leaders of today are not young people under

the  age  of 16 or 21. In fact, most of  them  are

well over their 30's.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Like the World Assembly of Youth?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes, and they are people who

are  capable of managing their own affairs. If  it

is   to  be  an  institution  for  the  youth   of

Singapore, then youth leaders must be brought into

this  Board to manage their own affairs, to  voice

their  opinions, and to plan programmes that  will

be acceptable to the young people of Singapore. If

clause  3 (4)  is allowed to stand, we will have  a

large  number of old people trying to  manage  the

affairs of the young. Old people sometimes may  be

good   in  the  sense  that  they  may  have  some

influence and they can rake in the money  that  is

required  for setting up this sports  centre:  but

apart  from  that, I do not think they  understand

the needs of the young people thoroughly. Probably

nomination  on  to  this Board  will  just  add  a

feather  to their cap, but apart from that,  their

contributions   towards  the  promotion   of   the

activities  of this youth centre will  not  be  as

they should be, nor will the progress made be  so.

I  suggest there must be amendments to this clause

to  allow  for greater participation by recognised

youth leaders of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point about training and ordinary

activities, I think if the Youth Sports Centre  is

going  to  cater for ordinary sports, it will  not

achieve  that object. In fact, there are  so  many

people  living so far away from the sports  centre

that it may not be possible or convenient for them

to  come  down to the centre to take part  in  its

activities. If that is one of the objects  of  the

youth  centre,  then  I  consider  that  it   will

probably  degenerate into one of  the  many  other

youth  organisations, instead of one that is above

all this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the fear of many youth

organisations  that, with the facilities  afforded

by  this  Youth  Sports Centre, it  will  be  very

damaging  to them because they may not  have  that

much of facilities to offer to their members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of training, we cannot train all

people  in  Singapore. There  is  only  a  limited

number of coaches and if promising young men queue

up  for training, in all probability they will  be

served on two or three occasions in a year's time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that if this Bill is going to be for

the  good of the young people of Singapore,  youth

movements must be consulted, and I would recommend

that  the  Bill be committed to a Select Committee

so  that  more views may be collected from  people

interested  in  youth work and not  interested  in

just making money. Further, if those youth leaders

who  have  shown themselves to be responsible  and

capable  are given this work, I believe they  will

do  the  job much better than a few of the  people

who  have been nominated to the Board. I hope that

the   Government  will  give  this  Bill   serious

consideration  and  put it into  the  hands  of  a

Select Committee of this House.

objection to is the constitution of the Board.  He

pointed  out  that  not enough representation  had

been given to youth leaders. He also said that the

youth  organisations  of Singapore  had  not  been

consulted when this Bill was drafted. it is  quite

true, Sir, that they have not been consulted,  and

in  view  of  this, the Government is prepared  to

refer this Bill to a Select Committee so that  all

views  can be represented and we can then  have  a

sports  centre  that  is going  to  work  for  the

welfare of the youth of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Sir, I move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, is entirely a formal matter. In

section  5  of the Singapore Legislative  Assembly

Elections Ordinance, it is provided that, for  the

purposes  of  preparing  an  electoral  roll,   an

identity  card  shall  be  accepted  as  evidence,

unless  the  contrary  is  shown,  of  a  person's

residence  in  Singapore, of his age  and  of  the

constituency in which he resides. Under section 10

of  that same Ordinance, the authority who reports

changes of address to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



Electoral  Registration bureau is the Commissioner

for  National Registration. Those provisions  are,

of  course,  part of the machinery which  we  have

here    of    compiling   our   electoral    rolls

automatically from identity cards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections

Ordinance  was  enacted, the  system  of  identity

cards,  of national registration, was carried  out

under the Emergency (Registration) Regulations. As

the  House  will  be aware, Sir,  those  Emergency

Regulations  have  now lapsed  and,  in  order  to

continue  the  system  of identity  cards,  a  new

Ordinance was enacted - the Registration of  Persons

Ordinance,  1955.  The purpose  of  this  Bill  is

merely to substitute in the appropriate places  in

the  Ordinance a reference to the Registration  of

Persons  Ordinance, 1955, in place of the  present

reference  to Emergency Regulations which  are  no

longer in force. Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have the Governor's consent under Standing

Order No. 33 (1)  (a)  to proceed with this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main purpose of this Bill is to repeal

and   re-enact   with  amendments  the   Municipal

Ordinance  and to provide for the local government

of  Singapore  to  be  administered  by  the  City

Council  and  by  District  Councils  which   will

replace  the Rural Board, in accordance  with  the

Government's  White Paper on  the  Report  of  the

McNeice  Committee on Local Government. Sir,  hon.

Members  will recall that the McNeice  Report  was

presented to this Assembly on 8th February,  1956,

as  Sessional  Paper Cmd. No. 10 of 1956.  I  feel

sure  that hon. Members will agree that much  work

had  been  put  into it to provide  an  exhaustive

examination of a complex problem and that  it  has

been  a  very valuable contribution to the  future

reorganisation of the local government  system  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Assembly sitting on 4th April, 1956, my

hon. Colleague the Chief Secretary stated that the

Government  accepted the basic principles  of  the

Report  and  that  a White Paper would  be  tabled

before  the  June  sitting of the  Assembly.  This

White  Paper, which is a statement of Government's

policy  with  regard  to the  McNeice  Committee's

recommendations, was presented to this Assembly on

2nd June, 1956, as Sessional Paper Cmd. No. 30  of

1956.  In  accepting the basic principles  of  the

McNeice Report, the Government is convinced that a

more  democratic framework should  be  set  up  in

which greater opportunities will be afforded to  a

larger  number of the community to  take  part  in

Local government administration, which would never

have been possible under the concept of a City and

Island   Council,  as  proposed  by   the   Rendel

Constitutional Commission, to be the only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



local government authority with jurisdiction  over

the  whole  island of Singapore. It  endorses  the

view,  Sir,  of  the McNeice Committee  "that  the

democratic opportunities offered by the  existence

of  five  elected local authorities  significantly

outweigh the advantages of centralisation." As can

be  seen  in Chapter II of the Report, the McNeice

Committee  has adduced very strong arguments why

the  basic  pattern  of  future  local  government

should  be  the  City Council  and  four  District

Councils. This basic pattern brings the public  in

different parts of the island into closer and more

intimate  touch  with  local  government   bodies,

whereas a single local authority on an all-island-wide  basis  could  become an impersonal  body  to

people living in areas on the island far away from

the  centre of activity. As the McNeice  Committee

pointed out:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are few similarities, so far as.

government is concerned, between the interests  of

the  farmer in Lim Chu Kang and the shopkeeper  in

Telok  Ayer  or  between  the  fisherman  of  Ayer

Gemuruh and the clerk in Queenstown."



<br><br>This new basic pattern also extends to the citizen

a  greater  opportunity to be of  service  to  his

fellow-men.  I  would  also  like  to  quote   the

following words of the Committee:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are, moreover, in greater doubt than the

Commission  (the  Rendel  Commission)  about   the

political advisability of constituting an  Island-wide  authority in addition to central  government

and  investing it with wide powers, and  financial

resources  which might well, at some future  time,

weigh   more  heavily  than  those  of  Government

itself."



<br><br>Sir,  Government has no doubt whatever that it  is

politically  inadvisable to have such  an  island-wide authority on this island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as stated in the White Paper, Government has

accepted  the  majority of the recommendations  of

the   McNeice   Report,   in   some   cases   with

modifications   and   reservations.   There   are,

however,  a  number of recommendations which  have

not   been  accepted,  and  in  place  of   these,

alternative proposals are made. From a perusal  of

the White



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>

Paper, hon. Members will have known which of these

recommendations have been accepted by  Government,

with or without modifications, and which have  not

been accepted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill is largely an adaptation of the

existing  Municipal Ordinance in  accordance  with

the  statement of Government policy  contained  in

the  White  Paper. The opportunity has  also  been

taken  to  make certain changes which will  remove

difficulties encountered in administering the  law

and  improve certain procedures found to have been

defective. Care has been taken to make only  those

changes of the law which are not considered likely

to prove controversial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Note attached to the Bill is

given  at some length and draws attention  to  the

more  important of the changes referred to in  the

preceding  paragraph  as  well  as  to  the  major

changes required by the White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like, however, at this stage, to draw

the  attention of hon. Members to some of the more

important features of this Bill. The provisions of

this  Bill extend only to Singapore Island and  to

the smaller islands to the north of Singapore,  as

Government  agrees with the views of  the  McNeice

Committee   that   the  responsibility   for   the

administration  of  the  Southern  Islands  should

remain   with   the   Central   Government.    The

administration  of  these  Southern  Islands  will

accordingly  be  taken over by  Government,  which

feels, however, that consideration should be given

to  any future demand arising from some or all  of

the Southern Islands to be amalgamated into one or

other of the District Council areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the provisions made in the Bill

for the constitution of the new local authorities,

I  am  confident that Members will agree that  the

new  proposals  for the City Council  are  a  far-reaching  advance on the present  constitution  of

that  body, and that the constitution as  proposed

for  the  District Councils for an initial  period

will be best in the circumstances.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to the present City Council, Sir,

which  consists  of an official as  President,  18

elected  Members and 9 nominated Councillors,  the

City   Council   will  have  a   totally   elected

membership of 32 Councillors one of whom they will

elect  annually  to the office of Mayor  with  the

right  of  re-election. The intention is that  one

Councillor will represent one constituency, making

32  constituencies in all, and not, as at present,

six electoral wards returning 18 elected Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District Council will have an official

Chairman,  12  elected  Councillors  and,  for  an

initial period of 4 years, 3 nominated Councillors

as  well.  It is considered that, as the  District

Councils  will be new bodies in the  rural  areas,

where   the   constitution  of  local   government

authority was limited in the past, and as the work

and  responsibility  of  these  councils  will  be

considerable,  it  would  be  appropriate  for   a

strictly  limited period to include  some  persons

with   experience  in  the  management  of   local

government  affairs  to the  membership  of  these

councils. The reasons, Sir, for the appointment of

an official as Chairman during this initial period

are,  to  quote  the words again  of  the  McNeice

Committee, as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have said that membership of a local

authority  is  a  job to be learned  and  this  is

doubly so in relation to the position of Chairman.

The  experience  required to conduct  meetings  of

councils and to direct the day-to-day business  of

a  local authority is not easily acquired  and  we

think it would be unfair and unwise to require  an

elected  or  nominated member of a rural  district

council to bear this responsibility in the initial

period."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members will note that, in accordance

with  the  White Paper, the present Bill has  been

drafted  to  allow  the City Council  to  continue

supplying  the public utility services  of  water,

gas  and  electricity on an island-wide basis  for

the  present. The matter of the transfer of  these

services  to  a  statutory corporation  does  not,

therefore, arise at this stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill preserves the status quo of the

local  authorities with regard to planning  powers

and  control  of  buildings. Until  the  Singapore

Improvement Trust ceases to exist and a new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



authority  set up to replace it, it will  continue

to  be  the  planning authority for the island  of

Singapore. It has not been possible to establish a

new  authority  and prepare legislation  for  this

authority  and  for  comprehensive  town  planning

legislation at the same time as the present  local

government   legislation.  In  due  course,   Sir,

legislation will be prepared to transfer  planning

powers  to  local  authorities. In  the  meantime,

building  control will continue  to  be  exercised

under building by-laws by the local authorities in

their respective areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, although in the White Paper it was

stated that the Government agreed in principle  to

the Committee's recommendation that an improvement

rate  should be levied over the whole  island  and

paid  into  a fund administered by Government,  in

the  present Bill authority is given to  the  City

Council  to continue to collect this rate  in  the

city  area  only under section 22 of the Singapore

Improvement  Ordinance, as long as  the  Singapore

Improvement  Trust  continues  to  exist  and  the

conditions  which led the Committee  to  make  its

recommendation have not yet arisen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, it was stated in the White Paper that

Government    agreed    with    the    Committee's

recommendation   that  the  City  Council   should

continue to administer the registration, licensing

and  mechanical inspections of vehicles on  behalf

of  all  local  authorities, but has  not  finally

decided   whether   the  Registrar   of   Vehicles

Department should remain a City Council department

or  be  transferred to Government. In the  present

Bill, however, these responsibilities still remain

with  the  Registrar of Vehicles as an officer  of

the City Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the payment of rates by the

Imperial Departments and by this Government, which

the   Committee  recommended  and  the  Government

agreed  to  in  principle, the  present  Bill,  as

drafted, continues to exempt them from payment  of

rates, since this question of payment of rates  by

the  Imperial Departments must first be  taken  up

and agreed with the United Kingdom Government, and

the  question of rating the Singapore Government's

property will require more time in order to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



examine  the  full implications of this  proposal.

Amending legislation, Sir, can be introduced later

when the matter has been settled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As explained in the Explanatory Note, provisions

are  made  for District Councils to be run  during

the  interim  period after their  constitution  on

lines  similar  to  those of  the  present  Board,

particularly  with  regard to  finance,  staffing,

vesting of properties, acquisition and disposal of

land  and  other immovable property. It  is  clear

that for some years to come District Councils will

not    be   self-supporting   and   will   require

substantial assistance from the Government in  the

way  of  capital  expenditure, annual  grants  and

provision  of staff. It would be best,  therefore,

to  start  each council off on Rural Board  lines,

namely,  that  the budgets will be  subject  to  a

measure of government control and incorporated  in

the Colony estimates. The staff will be Government

servants and all land vested in or acquired by the

councils  will  be vested in or  acquired  by  the

Crown  on  their behalf. When these councils  have

been set on their feet and have become financially

viable, amending legislation will be introduced to

enable  them  to function independently  like  the

City  Council.  I feel sure that this  House  will

agree with these interim provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transitional provisions have also been included

(see clause 324 of the Bill) which will allow  any

powers  of  the  existing law to  continue  to  be

exercised  despite  the repeal  of  the  Municipal

Ordinance, and for the City Council or  the  Rural

Board  to continue to function in respect  of  any

defined   area   whenever  it   is   required   by

administrative exigencies. In particular, there is

enabling provision for the Rural Board to continue

to  perform  its present functions  in  the  Rural

Board   area  in  the  event  of  delay   in   the

establishment  of  the District Councils  and,  if

required, to administer those parts of the present

city  area  which are to be merged  into  the  new

District Council areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a transitional provision for the

districts of Bukit Panjang and Jurong to be merged

into one district for a prescribed period for  the

purpose of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>



this Ordinance. This is in keeping, Sir, with  the

recommendation of the McNeice Committee that these

two  districts should, in the first  instance,  be

amalgamated  and administered by a single  council

and  that the municipal centre should be at  Bukit

Panjang.  These  two districts are  too  small  in

population to enable them to operate separately at

the  present time. Jurong especially,  because  of

its  small  population, will have a weak financial

position at the start, but there can be no  doubt,

Sir,  that the population of these districts  will

grow  rapidly in the future so that  they  can  in

time   be   administered  by   separate   District

Councils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also makes significant changes in the

qualifications and disqualifications  relating  to

candidates  for election as Councillors.  I  would

invite the attention of hon. Members to the  notes

given  at  some  length  in the  Explanatory  Note

dealing with clauses 21 and 22 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has been taken to improve the

arrangements  of  certain  parts  of  the  present

Municipal  Ordinance  and  to  omit  a  number  of

provisions  which it is considered can  be  better

dealt  with by means of by-laws. At the same time,

the  various existing provisions relating  to  the

making of by-laws have been replaced by clause 322

of  the present Bill and the Sixth Schedule  which

may  be varied by the Minister from time to  time.

Every  by-law or alteration, amendment or addition

thereto, cancellation of or substitution therefore

will have to be published in the Gazette and shall

not  have  effect  unless it is confirmed  by  the

Minister and notice of such confirmation has  been

published in the Gazette.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boundaries of the new City and District

Councils  are  described in the First  and  Second

Schedules  to  the  Bill.  It  has  been   thought

desirable to provide for this detailed description

in  view  of  the  substantial alteration  in  the

present  limits of the city that will result  from

the  reorganisation of local government  envisaged

in  the  Bill, so that both hon. Members  and  the

public  will be fully aware of the changes  to  be

made.  Sir,  hon.  Members will  recall  that  the

McNeice Committee's boundary proposals



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



were shown on the map attached to the Report.  The

Committee  recommended  that  the  city   boundary

should  be  extended to the West and withdrawn  in

the  East, it also recommended that an  Electoral

Boundaries' Delimitation Committee be appointed to

define  exact boundaries for the local  government

districts  and  electoral  divisions,   and   that

electoral boundaries for the Legislative  Assembly

should  be  adjusted  so  that  a  common  set  of

boundaries could serve all electoral purposes. The

latter  Committee was duly appointed, and  in  the

White Paper Government stated that it accepted the

recommendations which this Committee made for  the

boundaries  of the local government  areas.  These

boundaries were set out in a map attached  to  the

White Paper. The White Paper map also showed where

these  boundaries differed from those proposed  by

the  McNeice Committee. It was pointed  out,  Sir,

that  the  boundaries as proposed by  the  McNeice

Committee  did not conform to existing Legislative

Assembly  electoral  divisional  boundaries.   The

Electoral   Boundaries'  Delimitation  Committee's

boundary  proposals have kept  as  close  as  they

possibly  could to the boundary proposals  of  the

McNeice   Committee,  while  at  the   same   time

following   the   boundaries   of   the    present

Legislative   Assembly  electoral   districts   as

closely  as  possible.  Sir,  Chapter  IV  of  the

McNeice   Report  contains  the  views   of   that

Committee  with regard to its boundary  proposals.

It  will be seen that it has taken the Master Plan

proposals into consideration in its deliberations.

It  is  true  that  this plan  has  not  yet  been

approved by Government, but it can be safely  said

that  the  general principles governing the  Plan,

which  is  the  product of some  years  of  expert

study,  aided by the valuable work of a number  of

competent  study groups and working parties,  have

won general acceptance since its publication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to say that, by giving a

detailed  description of the new local  government

areas  in the First and Second Schedules  of  this

Bill,  both Members of the Assembly and the public

will be fully aware of the changes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



to  be  made. I would like to point out that until

the exact boundaries of the city and districts are

first   defined  and  approved  under  the   Local

Government Ordinance, no action can be taken under

the   Local  Government  Elections  Ordinance   to

specify  the names and boundaries of the electoral

divisions  and  to  subdivide the  divisions  into

polling   districts  for  purposes  of  elections.

Provision has been made for subsequent alterations

of  local  government boundaries to be subject  to

the  procedure  set  out in  section  362  of  the

Municipal Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I have made a somewhat lengthy speech

which was unavoidable owing to the very nature  of

the  Bill,  I  have tried, for the most  part,  to

indicate to the House the principles and merits of

the Bill. I have, at the same time, tried to avoid

referring to matters of detail as far as possible.

Matters of detail should, of course, be dealt with

in  the  ordinary way in Committee and it  is  the

Government's  intention  that  after  the   Second

Reading  of  this  Bill,  which  is  of   such   a

comprehensive nature and of such importance to the

people  of  Singapore, that it be committed  to  a

Select  Committee. I am confident, Sir,  that  the

principles of the Bill will commend themselves  to

hon. Members and that they will give this Bill its

Second Reading. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was

disappointed   when   the   Minister   for   Local

Government,  Lands  and  Housing  enumerated   the

differences  between  the Report  of  the  McNeice

Committee  which  sat on it and the  Bill  itself,

disappointed  because, in listing what  he  termed

the   "minor  differences",  he  had  skated  over

certain    important   departures    from    those

recommendations.  The most astonishing  departure,

which he has only referred to en passant by asking

us  to  refer to the Explanatory Note,  is  clause

21 - Qualifications of candidates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have nothing against the machinery which

this  Bill  will set up in so far as they  are  in

accordance  with the advice of experts to  replace

the  machinery under the Municipal Ordinance.  But

we take strong exception to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>



the     not    disinterested    "tailoring"     of

qualifications. Under clause 21 (b)   a  person  is

eligible  to  be a candidate "if  he  is  able  to

speak,  and, unless incapacitated by blindness  or

other  physical cause, to read and  write  with  a

degree of proficiency sufficient to enable him  to

take an active part in any proceedings as a member

of   the   local  authority".  Let  us   see   the

explanatory note on clause 21, which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...sets out the qualifications for councillors of

a  local  authority. The most important difference

from  the provisions of section 6 of the Municipal

Ordinance  is in paragraph (b)  of this  clause  by

which  the  present requirement  that  councillors

must  be able to speak, read and write the English

language  is omitted. Paragraph (c)  provides  that

candidates for election to the City Council  shall

be  resident  in the City and that candidates  for

election to District Council shall reside  in  the

division in which they stand for election."



<br><br>In  effect, this means that you can speak  Hebrew,

you can speak Urdu, you can speak any language  in

the  world,  provided  it is  "with  a  degree  of

proficiency sufficient to enable you  to  take  an

active part in any proceedings as a member of  the

local authority".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When multi-lingualism was first mooted as a

departure  from  the  sole and  exclusive  use  of

English  in  the constituted organs of government,

those  who opposed the use of vernacular languages

in  Government  councils used  the  argument  that

there  would  be  utter  and  absolute  confusion.

Finally everybody agreed that only certain limited

and specific languages with the widest use in this

colony   would   be  allowed.   Those   were   the

recommendations of the McNeice Committee.  We  all

know  that  when people are confined  to  speaking

only  English,  Malay,  Mandarin,  or  Tamil,  the

chances are, as far as Mandarin is concerned,  the

younger  generation will predominate as  they  are

the   persons  educated  and  proficient  in  this

important language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does one then cover up one's intentions? How

does  one overcome what is right in principle  but

is  inexpedient because it militates against party

interests? One does not want to confine it to  the

Mandarin-speaking,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



because  one's supporters are 83-year old men  who

speak  the dialects and not Mandarin! At the  same

time,  if  one starts enumerating all the  Chinese

dialects, it might attract unnecessary attention.

Therefore,  one  blankets the whole  by  remaining

silent  on the languages or dialects that  can  be

spoken.  One puts it in this curious clause  which

is glossed over, en passant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One could perhaps try to justify clause 21 (c)

that - although  this  was not  recommended  by  the

McNeice Committee and is not the accepted practice

in  civilised countries - a candidate can only be  a

candidate  if he resides in the area. If  you  get

people  like the young intellectuals of the P.A.P.

all  grouped  together living in  suburban  areas,

then let them stand for election in those suburban

areas  where they will be defeated. Now  if  young

master  Lee  has to stand for Cairnhill  where  he

lives, that would fix him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This giving way to expediency and abandoning of

principles  is the most disheartening  development

of  the last six months. I shall have more to  say

on those matters in this session of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this Bill itself I would like to draw

attention  to certain other points. For  instance,

in   its  recommendations  the  McNeice  Committee

agreed  that for the first four years the Chairmen

of  these District Councils should be appointed by

the Governor and that subsequently they should  be

popularly elected. But there is nothing in  clause

17,  as  there  is in clause 16, to  say  that  it

should  be  only for the first term.  The  McNeice

Committee  agreed  that  there  should  be   three

nominated  members in each council for  the  first

four  years, and that limitation is  set  out  in

clause 16 (1) :



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provided that for the first four years from the

date  of  the first ordinary elections held  under

the  provisions of the Local Government  Elections

Ordinance, 1956, there shall in addition be  three

nominated councillors."



<br><br>Clear and specific - three nominated councillors for

four  years and no more. This limitation for  only

one  four-year  period for  the  Chairman  of  the

District Council has been quietly dropped and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



no  reference  was  made to it when  the  Minister

explained  where  this  Bill  departed  from   the

recommendations  of  a  Committee  on  which   the

Government had the deciding voice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, in clause 4, the mechanics of varying

boundaries:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Minister may by notification in the Gazette,

alter or vary the limits of the City."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in a later clause, clause 14:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Minister may by notification in the Gazette,

alter or vary the limits of any District."



<br><br>Sir,  if we want to avoid any gerrymandering,  any

alteration  of boundary lines to suit  whoever  is

the  Minister and his Party, then let  us  have  a

Boundaries Commission -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Is the hon. Member imputing

improper  motives  to the Government  and  to  the

Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Tanjong Pagar seems

to  be  skating very near the point. I am watching

it very closely.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the

contrary, I think I was extremely careful  not  to impute -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Does the hon. Member challenge the

ruling of the Chair by talking on the contrary?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member was

making an explanation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It is a little pathetic seeing

this attempt to harass and hamstring your opponent

rather than meet the substance of his attack -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I will meet you anywhere,

any time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, this sounds very much like

a  classroom brawl where the little students  say.

"Let us go outside and have it out!" I do not like

to  lower  the dignity of this House by  provoking

Members on the other side into revealing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



their natural instincts! But I would like to point

out   that,   although  I  am  not  imputing   any

dishonourable,  base, vile or selfish  motives  to

the  Hon. the Minister for Local Government, Lands

and  Housing, I am stating, as a proposition, that

in  any part of the world, and more especially  in

this  part  of  the world, people who  assume  the

duties  of government are somewhat tempted to  use

the  powers with which they are temporarily vested

to  weight things permanently in their favour.  If

we  want  to avoid gerrymandering, the drawing  of

boundary  lines  to include kampongs  where  one's

supporters are and to exclude kampongs where one's

opponent's  supporters are, then  let  us  have  a

proper  Boundaries' Commission. Let the  mechanics

of  it  be  by the Minister notifying  it  in  the

Gazette,  but  let  us  have proper  machinery  to

ensure   that   the   working   of   parliamentary

democracy,  this wholesale importation of  Western

ideas  of political organisation, is not perverted

by feudalistic Eastern ideas of personal survival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to say this on the question

of disqualification. Clause 22 says, amongst other

things,  that a man is disqualified if he  has  in

any  part of the British Commonwealth (it does not

matter if he commits a crime in Indonesia and gets

six  years  jail for gun smuggling  or  some  such

trivial  crime, but he must not break any rule  in

any   part  of  the  British  Commonwealth)  "been

sentenced to death or to imprisonment by  whatever

name  called, for a term exceeding six months  and

has  not suffered the punishment to which  he  was

sentenced  or such other punishment as  may  by  a

competent    authority   have   been   substituted

therefore or received a free pardon". This  clause

is  common form. But I think in this part  of  the

world  we ought to say specifically that political

offences  like sedition, particularly  these  days

with  a Government becoming very legalistic  about

offences like sedition and section 3 of the  Trade

Disputes    Ordinance,    should    not    be    a

disqualification. After all, the man to  whom  the

Chief  Minister of Singapore sent  a  telegram  of

congratulation, came out from prison to become the

Prime Minister of the Gold Coast.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my hon.

Friend  and  Colleague  the  Minister  for   Local

Government,  Lands and Housing spoke this  morning

on  the  principles and the merits that went  into

the  making of this piece of legislation. I  shall

therefore  now  content myself with going  briefly

into  the details of this Bill so that the salient

points  can  be brought forth in this  House.  The

final   details  will,  of  course,  have  to   be

considered in Select Committee later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, Sir, is divided into 13 parts and the

opportunity  has  been taken to rearrange  certain

parts  of the existing law, which is the Municipal

Ordinance (Chapter 133 of the 1936 Edition).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Note outlines the principal

changes part by part, and in the case of Part  II,

which  contains  the  major  alterations  to   the

existing  law, an explanation is given  clause  by

clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think, Sir, I need add anything to what

has been said in the Explanatory Note in regard to

Part I of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II is explained clause by clause as it deals

with the new constitution and organisation of  the

local authorities. Hon. Members will read it, I am

sure,  with  particular interest. In  addition  to

what  has been said in the Explanatory Note,  hon.

Members  will  note  that the  present  tenure  of

office of City Councillors, namely, 3 years,  with

one-third retirement annually, has been changed to

a  four-year period with half retirement every two

years. The Bill also provides that appointments to

certain  senior City Council posts shall  only  be

made with the concurrence of the Minister and that

the  holders of these posts shall not  be  removed

without  the Minister's consent. I would, however,

refer  hon.  Members to the views of  the  McNeice

Committee on this matter at page 44 of the Report.

This  Bill  now  makes provision to  preserve  the

validity  of  acts  done  in  his  capacity  as  a

councillor  by a person subsequently found  to  be

disqualified.  Provision  is  also  made  for  the

payment   to  councillors  of  such  remuneration,

allowances or expenses as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>



the   Governor  in  Council  may  direct.  Another

provision   prohibits   councillors   from   being

employed  by  the local authority  whilst  holding

office and for twelve months afterwards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure hon. Members will be pleased to see

that provision is made for the appointment by  the

City  Council of a Mayor and a Deputy  Mayor,  and

this  will  be  the first occasion, when  the  new

Council comes into being, that Singapore will have

a Mayor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Part III it will be noted that, in

accordance  with the White Paper, the  minutes  of

the proceedings of meetings of the local authority

shall  be recorded in English, although it is  not

obligatory on the part of the councillors to speak

only in English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 45 of the Bill now makes it obligatory for

a  local authority to appoint a Finance Committee,

and  clause 49 gives a local authority  powers  to

delegate the exercise of many of its functions  to

committees or to employees. At present,  Sir,  the

lack of these powers in certain cases is hampering

the  quick  carrying out of the work of  the  City

Council,  and  the present system  is  that  every

decision of the committee in the City Council  has

to  go  to  a  full board meeting and consequently

there  is  delay  in carrying out  certain  urgent

work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Part IV, as stated in the Explanatory Note,

provision  is made for any public street,  or  any

part  thereof,  to  be exempted from  the  general

vesting  in  the local authority by order  of  the

Minister.   This  is  an  enabling  provision   in

accordance  with  the  White  Paper  statement  of

policy   with   regard   to   the   division    of

responsibility, in respect of the  main  road  and

drainage  systems  in  the  island,  between   the

Central  Government and the local  authority.  The

Minister referred to here, hon. Members will note,

is the Minister for Communications and Works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no additional comments to make on Part V.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Note states quite clearly and at

some  length what the changes in Part  VI  dealing

with finance are. I may mention, however, that two

new purposes for which a local authority



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>



fund  can  be expended are: firstly, provision  of

community  centres,  children's social  centres,

creches and youth clubs, and of hostels other than

those  established by written law. I am  sure  the

Member  for Serangoon will welcome that provision.

Secondly,  payments in connection with  visits  by

members  of,  or its employees on behalf  of,  the

local  authority  including travelling  and  other

expenses in any part of the world. Clause 71  lays

down  how  the Municipal Fund accounts are  to  be

kept.  I  wish  to  stress  again  that  financial

provision regarding District Councils is only  for

an interim period and amending legislation will be

introduced to enable them to budget like the  City

Council when they become fully financially viable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to rates and taxes under Part VII, my

hon.  Friend  and Colleague the Hon. the  Minister

for   Local  Government,  Lands  and  Housing  has

already made some remarks in his speech. I  would,

however,  point  out  that  the  present  Bill

reproduces  the  existing law which  provides  for

exemption  from  rates  of  all  S.I.T. premises

except  premises  used for profit,  and  also  now

provides for exemption for all premises, vested in

a  local authority. By clause 111 referred  to  in

the  Explanatory Note, it will be possible for the

Minister to order, within a certain period,  after

due  consideration, parts of the Rural Board  area

now incorporated into the city area, for instance,

to  be  rated at less than the rate prevailing  in

the city, and for any part of the former city area

included in the District Council area to be  rated

at  more  than  the rate ceiling for the  District

Council. With regard to taxes, in accordance  with

the  White  Paper which states that all veterinary

services should be transferred to Government,  dog

licensing has been omitted from the provisions  of

this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further to what has already been said in the

Explanatory Note regarding Part VIII which relates

to  streets, sewers and buildings, I might mention

one  or  two  other  matters. In  clause  144,  in

connection with the submission of a plan for a new

street, a local authority is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>



now  empowered to give written directions  to  the

person submitting such a plan, for example, on the

materials and construction of a new street and the

provision  of  foot-paths in a  new  street.  With

regard  to  sewers, in accordance with  the  White

Paper,  provision is made for the City Council  to

remain in control of, public sewerage on an island-wide  basis, with appropriate charges being levied

on   the  other  local  authorities  for  services

provided.  There is provision for the Minister  to

direct  the  amount  of contribution  in  case  of

disagreement or dispute between the various  local

authorities  and the City Council.  In  accordance

also  with the White Paper, provision is made  for

the division of responsibility for drainage in the

island  between  the  Central Government  and  the

local  authorities. Regarding buildings,  most  of

the existing provisions are reproduced, with a few

additional  ones, as, for instance,  under  clause

171  (12)   concerning the payment  of  a  sum  not

exceeding ten times the prescribed fees in respect

of  submission  of plans in certain circumstances;

and  clause  173 (2)  with regard to action  to  be

taken  in  respect  of  unauthorised  erection  of

buildings on land vested in the local authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding Part IX I have already mentioned that

the  City  Council  is  given  power  to  continue

supplying water, gas and electricity on an island-wide basis. One important additional provision  of

note  here  is  that  under clause  203  the  City

Council can now sell and not merely let for  hire,

water,   gas   and   electrical   apparatus    and

appliances,  including  air-conditioning   plants.

Sir, concern has been expressed to me by importers

and  distributors of air-conditioning  plants  and

other  electrical appliances in respect  of  these

powers. I would suggest that the right course  for

them  to  take is to make representations  to  the

Select  Committee when the Bill goes to the Select

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of clauses under Part X, which relates

to  public health, have been altered to make  them

more effective.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>



Provision  is made for more effective  control  of

markets,  including private markets.  The  control

and  supervision of burial and  burning  grounds

throughout  the  island  are  now  made  a   local

government  responsibility, whereas previously  in

the  rural areas such control was in the hands  of

the  Central Government. Among those dangerous and

offensive   trades  which  will  be   subject   to

licensing   are   sawmills  and  those   producing

injurious or offensive dust or fumes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the White Paper, Part XI

provides  for  the  City Council  to  continue  to

operate the Fire Brigade on an island-wide  basis,

subject  to  expenditure being met proportionately

by all local authorities. Here again, the decision

of  the  Minister shall be final in the  event  of

disagreement between the local authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Part XII, which relates to vehicles, although

the Registrar of Vehicles is still responsible for

registration,   licensing   and   inspection    of

vehicles,  the  licensing  of  drivers  of  public

service vehicles will no longer be carried out  by

his  Department,  since  this  function  is  being

transferred  to  the police in  keeping  with  the

policy stated in the White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part XIII deals with the supplementary provisions

and, as stated in the Explanatory Note, is largely

a  reproduction  of  Part  XVI  of  the  Municipal

Ordinance, with slight alterations in some clauses

and  with  a few new provisions, as, for  example,

clause    319   which   provides   that    certain

inaccuracies   in   documents   shall   not   make

proceedings invalid for want of form,  and  clause

320   which  relates  to  the  proving  of   local

authority records in legal proceedings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have briefly outlined the details

contained  in the Bill, and I hope that  when  the

Bill  goes to Select Committee all those who  have

views  to  express  will come forward  before  the

Select Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I,

under  Standing Order 7 (4) , move the  suspension

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

glad   to  learn  from  the  Minister  for   Local

Government, Lands and Housing that this  important

Bill  is  to  be sent to a Select Committee.  That

there is need for it brooks no argument but as  it

is  a  Bill which affects the private citizen more

intimately  than  perhaps any other  Bill  on  the

Statute  Book,  it  is clearly important  to  have

representations  from the public given  a  careful

hearing by Members of this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose to speak this afternoon on the

whole  Bill.  It  contains  325  clauses  and   an

exhaustive  examination  of  it  would  be  almost

impossible and lengthy. But I would content myself

with  consideration of certain points to be  found

in Parts I to III comprising the first 55 clauses.

These  Parts are concerned with what I might  call

the  constitutional side of local  government  and

not  the side affecting the ratepayer directly and

yet even in these three Parts, there are points of

principle  which require very careful  examination

before we accept the Government's proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are forging a new instrument for local

government which we wish to see effective for many

years   to   come  and  while  political   Parties

doubtless will hold sway in the new councils to be

set up, the shaping of that instrument seems to me

to be a matter above Party. With these preliminary

observations,  I will proceed to consider  certain

of  the  clauses in the first three Parts  of  the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, in clause 3, Interpretation, I will

mention  in  passing that the terms "Chairman"  "

Chief Administrative



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



Officer" and "Mayor" are not included and I  think

their importance to local government is such  that

their  status and functions should be  defined  at

this stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as regards clause 5, while it is true

that  this  clause cannot become  operative  until

this  Bill  becomes law, nevertheless, I  consider

that  the attention of the public should be  drawn

to  the proposed changes in the limits of the city

boundary  by the method of advertisement  intended

by  this  clause.  There are one or  two  proposed

alterations  in the city limits which are  clearly

controversial, namely, the exclusion  of  most  of

the  suburban area of Katong and the inclusion  of

the  rural area of Ulu Panjang. It is strange,  to

say  the  least,  that only  a  few  months  after

bringing  Katong so much closer to the  centre  of

the  city by the opening of the great new  highway

and  bridge,  there  should  be  contemplated  its

exclusion  from  the city area  to  which  it  has

belonged for so long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that if the residents in the proposed

area  of the new Katong District Council have read

clause 110 (3)  of this Bill, they will perhaps not

object  to  banishment  from  the  city,  as  this

subsection puts the ceiling of 20 per cent on  the

rate  of  assessment leviable by District Councils

as  opposed  to  30 per cent in the  city.  But  I

wonder  what the ratepayers in, for example,  Haig

Road  who  will continue to pay 30  per  cent  are

going  to  say to their ex-fellow rate-payers  in,

for example, Joo Chiat Road who will in future pay

20  per  cent, bearing in mind that both  sets  of

rate-payers  enjoy the same municipal services  of

made-up    roads,   street   lighting,   sewerage,

electricity, water and gas, and bearing further in

mind that Haig Road is purely residential and  Joo

Chiat  Road  has considerable business  interests,

and  that the latter has a bus service. If I  were

living  in Haig Road, I should have some questions

to ask.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is an obvious anomaly here and in view

of   the   fact   that  clause  111   allows   for

differential rating, it seems to me that we should

give  very  careful consideration to  establishing

the  principle of fixing a ceiling for  the  rates

leviable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



in  both  the city area and the district areas  at

the  same figure, differential rates being  levied

according  to  the number of municipal  and  other

services  enjoyed. This would seem to be  more  in

keeping  with the Government's general  policy  on

taxation  and,  Sir, there seems  to  be  no  good

reason  why  the  principle of the "haves"  paying

more than the "have-nots" should not apply to  the

municipal level as well as the national  level.  I

hope that the Minister will study this matter with

the greatest care.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next important matter of principle comes in

clause  6 (2)  in which it is laid down that  there

should  be  32  Members of the City  Council,  all

elected. Now, this is purely a Government proposal

because the Committee on Local Government made  no

representations on the numbers of elected Members,

either  to  the  City Council or to  the  District

Councils.   Is  this  number  sufficient?   First,

bearing in mind that as the Mayor and Deputy Mayor

must  remain apart from contention and controversy

and  will,  I  think, have to remain out  of  most

Committees   in  view  of  their  positions,   the

effective working strength of the Council will  be

30,  or  only  3  more  than  the  present  number

excluding  the City President. It is an  undoubted

fact that the present number of 27 is insufficient

to  run the City Council really competently and an

increase in only 3 is patently not enough. Because

of the paucity of numbers, each Standing Committee

at   present   consists  of  only  five   or   six

Councillors which, to my mind, is insufficient and

there  have  been many instances of the  requisite

quorum  of  three only being obtained  with  some

difficulty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Standing Committees cover a very wide range

of responsibilities and subjects. A Councillor who

has,  as  his two Committees, for example,  health

and public utilities, has to acquaint himself with

the  problems  of health prevention, anti-malarial

and  veterinary  projects,  hawkers,  stand-pipes,

markets,   infant   welfare  as   well   as   gas,

electricity and water. Now I doubt whether any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



Councillor  however competent and conscientious

can  master all these problems during his term  of

four  years,  and  I  mean no disrespect  to  hon.

Members in this House who are City Councillors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then is the system in the United Kingdom? lt

is  simply this: of having larger Councils, larger

Standing Committees, a sub-division of work of the

Standing  Committees  through  SubCommittees   and

greater  delegated powers. The City of  Worcester,

where  my  father was a Councillor and an Alderman

for  over  twenty years and a Mayor for  three  of

them,  has  a  population of  only  60.000  and  a

Council of over fifty Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the City of Singapore were to have a Council

of   64  Members,  not  32,  what  would  be   the

advantage?  It  would  then be  possible  to  have

Standing Committees of 12 to 15 Members as they do

in  the United Kingdom to which you could delegate

far  greater powers than is desirable in the  case

of  the  present Committees of five or six.  These

Standing   Committees  could  elect  SubCommittees

large  enough  to  maintain some kind  of  balance

between the Parties and which could concentrate on

a  smaller  number  of  subjects.  In  the  United

Kingdom, a Municipal Health Committee has  a  Sub-Committee   for   infant  welfare,   another   for

veterinary  matters, another for markets,  and  so

on.   A   Councillor   therefore   becomes   fully

acquainted  with one or two aspects  of  municipal

work on which his opinion can become authoritative

instead  of  attempting to become a  Jack  of  all

trades under the present Singapore system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Public Utilities Committee of fifteen Members,

for  example, would be large enough  to  have  the

requisite  leaven of responsibility and sufficient

authoritative  knowledge  to  be  delegated   wide

powers  of  executive action without reference  to

the  full  Council. This would result  in  quicker

decisions  which after all the public is  entitled

to expect from the municipal service which affects

their  day-to-day  lives  and  that  leads  me  to

another point in favour of a larger Council. It is

the  same argument at the municipal level that has

been used in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>

respect  of  the  doubling of membership  of  this

Assembly, namely, that there is too much work  for

too few people if the country is to be efficiently

run.   Not  only  does  this  apply  to  Municipal

Councillors but it affects every one of us in this

Chamber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think that all hon. Members will agree

that a large percentage of the calls upon our time

from  our  constituents - it may be 75 per  cent  or

even  as  much  as 90 per cent - is  connected  with

local  government  problems.  Their  problems  are

those   nearest  to  their  daily  lives - in  their

buildings,   electricity  or  water   connections,

standpipes, roads, drains, assessment, and so  on.

By  and large, the public are not deeply concerned

about  legislative  matters except  at  infrequent

intervals.  Now we Members of the Legislature  are

called  upon  to  deal with these  problems  which

belong  more properly to the sphere of  the  local

government  Councillors and it seems  to  me  that

these  problems can only be fully tackled  if  the

wards  are  smaller  so that a  City  or  District

Councillor  can  really know the  people  whom  he

represents. And if this argument has force, is  it

wise   to  raise  the  effective  number  of  City

Councillors  from  27 to only 30 -  I  exclude  the

Mayor and Deputy Mayor - when you are increasing the

muncipal electorates by tens or maybe hundreds  of

thousands?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that this whole problem - and it is

a problem with obvious difficulties in having much

larger   Councils - must  be  considered  with   the

greatest  care and that is why I feel it necessary

to give it an airing today before the Bill goes to

Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I leave the question of the composition of

the  City Council, I must refer to one other point

which has not received the attention either of the

Committee  on  Local Government or the  Government

itself. I refer to the question of Aldermen.  Now,

I  am  well aware that the idea of having Aldermen

has been derided in many quarters in Singapore but

I  hope  that the House will have the patience  to

let  me put the case for them as objectively as  I

can, because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



I  think  that  the  arguments in  favour  of  the

Aldermen  system  are at least  strong  enough  to

warrant their having further consideration at this

stage.  Now, Sir, I am quite aware that the  chief

argument against having Aldermen is that it is  or

can  be  a  pernicious device by which a  majority

Party   in  the  Council  can  increase  its   own

majority. I accept that argument as an exceedingly

strong  one  and  the crux of the whole  question.

But,  in  theory at least, the system of  Aldermen

has  much to recommend it. The idea is to  have  a

group of experienced elder statesmen, if I may  so

call  them, who can provide continuity  in  policy

and  perhaps  a  special stability of  opinion  by

virtue of their being non-Party men. Because  they

are  subject to less pressures through  not  being

elected, they can use more objective judgment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, it will be agreed that there should

be  much  less government by political Parties  at

the  municipal  level than at the  national  level

because  most  municipal  matters  are  not  party

matters   at   all.   It  is  unfortunate   though

inevitable that the Party system should have crept

into  municipal affairs in the United Kingdom  and

in  Singapore but, that being the case, a group of

non-Party  Aldermen who can keep the balance  when

party  politics  get out of hand over  some  quite

trivial  matter  has considerable point.  I  think

that  the  nominated Members on the  City  Council

have   in  recent  years  shown  this  virtue   of

objective  independence on numerous occasions  and

that  elected  Councillors have been  grateful  to

them for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question however is: whether it is within the

wit  of someone in this Assembly or outside it  to

devise a means whereby City Councillors can  elect

Aldermen   to  the  Council  by  a  method   which

eliminates  party bias. That may be a  tall  order

but  I submit to this House that it is worth  more

than a passing consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point that arises for consideration

comes  in  clause 11 where we have a new proposal,

namely,   of   the   Minister   controlling    the

appointment of the City Council's senior  officer.

I hope



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



that  the  Minister in his reply will explain  the

reasons for this and not reserve it for the Select

Committee, particularly as there seems  to  be  no

similar  provision  in  respect  of  the  District

Councils. Does this mean that there are to  be  no

District  Council  employees, no District  Council

health officers, assessors, engineers, and so  on?

If not, how are the District Councils to carry out

their  work  effectively and not  degenerate  into

advisory bodies?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 16, there is laid down twelve elected

Councillors for each District Council and here  we

come  up  against the same problem  which  I  have

already posed in respect of the City Council.  The

District  Council must have for its  Committees  a

bare   minimum - finance,  public  works,   health,

assessment,  staff - and twelve  Members  are  surely

inadequate for this purpose. From clause 41 (3)  of

the Bill, it seems evident that the Government has

been  aware of this difficulty by fixing eight  as

the  quorum for Council meetings. A normal  quorum

is  about  one-third  of the total  members  on  a

Council or a Committee. The Government has had  to

fix it at about two-thirds as anything less would,

of  course, put decisions of District Councils  in

the  hands  of  too  few.  Logic  alone  therefore

suggests  that  24  would be a better  number  for

District  Council. lt is further  borne  out  by

clause 34 (4)  of the Bill where the quorum for the

City Council is fixed at 11 out of 32.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come, Sir, to clause 45 (2) which is a new

subsection  not  to  be  found  in  the  Municipal

Ordinance. In referring to this, Sir, I hope  that

it  will not be considered that I am straying into

points  of  detail for it seems that a  matter  of

principle may be involved. To make my point clear,

I  must  draw  the attention of the House  to  the

entire clause. Clause 45 (1)  reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A local authority may appoint from among their

own number such and so many committees either  of

a  general  or  special nature and consisting  of

such  number of councillors as it thinks fit  for

any  purposes which in the opinion of  the  local

authority  would be better regulated and  managed

by means of such committees."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



Subclause (2)  reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A local authority shall appoint a Finance

Committee  consisting of such  councillors  as  it

thinks  fit  for  regulating and  controlling  the

finance of the authority and shall fix the term of

office of the members of the Committee."



<br><br>It will be noticed that the unspecified committees

in subclause (1)  will regulate and manage, but the

Finance Committee will regulate and control.  This

would seem to suggest that Finance Committees  are

to  be statutory Committees not accountable to the

Councils  themselves. I cannot believe, Sir,  that

this  is  what the Government intends and I  would

ask   the  Minister  to  explain  what  this   new

subclause means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to my last point with reference to clause

50.  This  clause enables the Chief Administrative

Officer  of the City Council in times of emergency

to  use  extraordinary  executive  powers  without

reference   even   to   the   Mayor.   The   Chief

Administrative  Officer under  clause  11  (1)   is

nevertheless  appointed by  the  City  Council.  I

think therefore an important question of principle

is involved here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have raised a number of points in respect

of  the  first  55 clauses which I  consider  need

examination  in Select Committee.  There  will  be

many  others in the remaining 270 clauses. I  have

put  them  as objectively as I can because,  as  I

have  said before, I do not consider this Bill  to

be  one in which party politics should be involved

but  a problem of how to make our local government

work efficiently, smoothly and economically in the

best interests of the ratepayer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One further question needs to be answered by the

Minister and I hope he will answer it. What is the

extra  cost to the country going to be of  setting

up  District  Councils with their offices,  staffs

and  equipment  compared with the  running  of  an

island-wide   Council  which  was   the   previous

proposal?  I  think  that the  taxpayers  and  the

ratepayers ought to know that.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

welcome  the introduction of this Bill  into  this

Assembly. I feel that this Bill is in keeping with

the constitutional progress of Singapore. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>



find, Sir, that this Bill has preserved the status

of  Singapore as a City which got its Charter  six

years  ago.  I also see, Sir, that in  this  Bill,

there  is  provision for the setting up  of  rural

District  Councils which give a wider  measure  of

democratic  self-government  in  rural  districts.

Being  a  member of the Rural District in Seletar,

Sir,  I  endorse  the views of the  people  in  my

constituency  that this is indeed a  very  welcome

move and they wholeheartedly support it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few comments to make on the various

provisions of this Bill. The first one is that the

Public Services Commission is to be consulted when

appointments are made in the City Council.  For  a

long time, Sir, the staff of the City Council have

felt  that this should be done and I am sure  that

they will welcome this new move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The qualifications for City Councillors have been

dealt  with  by the Member for Tanjong Pagar  (Mr

Lee  Kuan Yew). Sir, this particular clause was  a

subject  of considerable discussion in  our  Party

and I can assure this House that, when we endorsed

it,  we had no ulterior motive behind this clause.

We  felt  that  if Members are elected  from  each

Division  and who are resident there,  the  people

will  be  able to draw representatives from  their

own    place - representatives   whom   they   like,

representatives  whom they love.  I  thought  that

probably  this would be a very good  argument  for

more representation from rural districts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The language qualification for councillors was

also dealt with by the Member for Tanjong Pagar. I

think,  Sir, that Government was very wise in  not

specifying  the language required because  I  feel

that   at  this  early  stage  of  rural  district

elections, there might be people who know  various

languages  and  who will be equally  qualified  to

become  District Councillors, and  I  think,  Sir,

this is another example whereby we could draw  out

people   who  are  able  to  tackle  the  job   of

councillors for these posts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Including Eskimos!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, the point about the number of City

Councillors,  in accordance with  this  Bill,  was

raised by the Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede). In the

city  area at present, Sir, there are one  million

residents  and  for this number, I  feel  that  32

would  be  very  adequate. If,  according  to  the

suggestion  of the hon. Member, we are  increasing

the  number, the Council will be larger  than  the

Legislative Assembly itself. If there is any  need

for further decentralisation, I do suggest that we

have  some  suburban  councils  added  on  to  our

existing  City  and  Rural  District  Councils.  I

believe  in  more  decentralisation  rather   than

centralising the whole City Council machinery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member further suggested that the

membership of committees in the City Council would

also  be  benefited by an enlarged number of  City

Councillors.   I  think,  Sir,  in   effect,   the

membership of the City Council is adequate.  I  do

believe  that a committee of 15 Members would  not

be   able  to  do  much  work.  The  smaller   the

committee, the more efficient the work  would  be.

If  there  is  any slackening in the work  of  the

councillors,  it  is  not  entirely  due  to   the

decreased  number.  I was a  Member  of  the  City

Council for three years and I know that, to  be  a

City  Councillor  and  to  do  the  work  that  is

expected, only two or three hours a day  would  be

required to go through all the work.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> I do not think for a moment that the

enlarged committees would help in any way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a shame to me, Sir.I said three hours

a  day on paper work. You may have a lot to do  in

the  way  of touring your area, getting complaints

and trying to sort them out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of Aldermen was also raised.

There  are  advantages  and disadvantages  in  the

Aldermen system and it appears to me that even  in

the  United  Kingdom,  where the  Aldermen  system

exists,   the   existing  trend  is  towards   the

abolition  of Aldermen. There, too, democracy  has

been  preached  and  the various  Parties  in  the

United Kingdom feel that the system of Aldermen in

some areas should cease.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of boundaries for the City

Council and the District Councils was also  raised

and  my personal view is that these boundaries can

be  adjusted  from time to time. It  is  no  fault

giving  the  Minister the power for the adjustment

because we feel that, when the Minister decides to

have a new boundary, he will automatically consult

the  people concerned and fix the boundary to  the

satisfaction of all concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> All the Members on his side!



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> I do believe, Sir, that this is not a

question  which  the Minister  will  tackle  on  a

political  basis  because he, in his  capacity  as

Minister,  ought to know the views of  the  people

and  anything  that he does, we can  all  imagine,

will be in the best interests of the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Hooray!



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, before I conclude, I think that it

is  very  appropriate at this juncture  to  pay  a

tribute to the Members of the City Council and the

Rural  Board for the work that they have done  for

our  people.  Before  the elections  to  the  City

Council,  there  were a number of councillors  who

sacrificed  their time, on various occasions,  for

the  benefit of the people and I think that it  is

during  this time that the Assembly, as  a  whole,

should pay a tribute to all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as this

Bill  will be referred to a Select Committee, many

of  the  points raised by Members on the  opposite

side  of  the  House will, of course, receive  due

consideration by the Select Committee but  I  feel

that there are two points raised by the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) which require  a

reply from this side of the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point I would like to speak on is what

he said in regard to the residential qualification

in  clause 21(c) . From what he said, Sir, I  think

he  would  have  us believe that  this  particular

clause is aimed at his Party. Surely it is  not  a

confession  of the P.A.P. that they  do  not  have

suitable   candidates  throughout  the  whole   of

Singapore!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, in clause 22 (c) , he touched on the

qualifications of a candidate and as  usual,  Sir,

he  distorts clause 22 (c)  by trying  to  have  us

believe that anybody who is imprisoned for  crimes

against  the  Trade  Disputes  Act  will  not   be

entitled  to become a candidate. May I,  Sir,  ask

him  to read that particular sub-clause again?  It

clearly  states  that  any  person  who  has  been

sentenced for any crime committed against society,

so  long as he has served his sentence, is free to

stand  as  a candidate irrespective of the  extent

and nature of the crime for which he has paid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to

the  point raised by the Member for Tanjong  Pagar

(Mr Lee Kuan Yew) on the question of language,  I

can  assure  this Assembly that it  is  still  the

intention of this Government to follow the  policy

which is laid down in the White Paper, that is  to

say,  in  the City Council, Malay, Tamil,  English

and  Mandarin  will be spoken and in the  District

Councils,  any Chinese dialect, Malay,  Tamil  and

English will be spoken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the subsequent alterations to

boundaries, I would like to point out that clauses 5   and   15  of  the  Bill  follow  the  existing

provisions  inviting  persons  affected  by   such

alterations  to  make  their objections  known  in

writing to the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the period for official Chairmen

of  the  District Councils, here again,  Sir,  the

Government has no intention of departing from  its

White  Paper policy statement that these  Chairmen

will be appointed during an initial period of four

years only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are one or two points raised by the Member

for  Tanglin (Mr Ede), in particular, clause  111

with regard to assessment. I can assure the Member

for Tanglin that, when this matter comes up before

the Select Committee, Go-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>



vernment  will do all it possibly can to meet  the

objections  that may be placed before  the  Select

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to clause 6, this is, I think, the

first   time  that  I,  as  Minister   for   Local

Government,  Lands  and Housing,  have  heard  the

statement that the present membership of the  City

Council is not enough for the Council to carry out

its policy or its work. I am somewhat baffled that

an  organisation like the City Council,  who  have

had its constitution for these so many years, have

not   placed   before  the  Minister   for   Local

Government, Lands and Housing the suggestion  that

the   number  of  its  membership  is  inadequate.

However,  Sir,  here again, it is  a  question  of

policy   and  I  am  sure  that  when  the  Select

Committee sits, Government will bear in  mind  the

objections that have been raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin also did ask about the

extra  cost  that may be involved in  constituting

all  these  four District Councils. I would  refer

the  Member  to  page 207 of the  Bill,  the  last

paragraph of which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The changes in constitution envisaged in the

Bill  will  not, broadly speaking, affect  overall

revenue  and  expenditure, but provision  will  be

necessary   for  certain  additional  staff,   new

buildings  for  Rural District Councils,  and  the

acquisition  of  land, which  is  estimated  at  a

probable  cost of $700,000 subject to some  margin

of error."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Butterfield (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr C. H. Butterfield):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, legislation was brought into force early in 1955 which made certain temporary amendments to

the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, the Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance,  of  course, being the Ordinance  which

regulates     the    importation,     exportation,

manufacture,  sale  and use of opium  and  certain

other  dangerous drugs. Sir, the purpose  of  that

temporary   legislation  was   to   enable   Opium

Treatment  Centres to be established and  also  to

enable  certain classes of persons to be  sent  to

those  Centres. I should remind hon. Members  that

under  that legislation, persons who are convicted

for the first time of an offence of either smoking

prepared opium or of being in possession of  pipes

or utensils used for smoking or consuming prepared

opium   must   be  remanded  by  the   Court   for

examination  and  report by  the  Opium  Treatment

Centres  Advisory Committee. That Committee,  Sir,

is  required, amongst other things, to assess  the

prospects  of the person on remand being  able  to

overcome or assisted to overcome his addiction and

the  Committee is also required to say whether  in

their  opinion a period of treatment at  an  Opium

Treatment  Centre would be likely to cure  him  of

his  habit. Now, after considering such a  report,

the  Court  is required either to send  him  to  a

Centre for a period which may be for between 3 and

12  months  or  to  send him to prison  for  three

months.  Second offenders go to prison for  twelve

months. What this Bill proposes, Sir, is to  allow

magistrates a discretion as to whether or  not  to

sentence to a term of imprisonment first



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



offenders  who  are  not considered  suitable  for

treatment   at  an  Opium  Treatment  Centre   and

accordingly, Sir, if this amendment is  made,  the

Court will be enabled in suitable cases to fine or

otherwise deal with the first offender, perhaps by

putting him on probation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, this Bill is also concerned with

another  matter.  It  proposes  another  amendment

which  relates to the use of medical  certificates

which  are issued following a Court Order  that  a

person  accused either of possession  of  prepared

opium  or  of  consuming prepared opium  shall  be

medically   examined.  At  present,   Sir,   these

certificates are admissible as evidence during the

course of a trial and what is now proposed is that

they  should not be admissible in evidence  except

on  the  application of the accused or  after  his

conviction should he be convicted. I think I might

usefully add, Sir, that these certificates can  be

of  considerable assistance to an accused  who  is

charged  with  a possession offence  because  that

offence carries a sentence of up to five years and

also  the  liability to a fine of up  to  $10,000.

They  might be of great assistance because if  the

Court   is  satisfied  that  the  opium   in   the

possession  of the convicted man was for  his  own

immediate personal consumption, the Court may deal

with  him as if he had been convicted of a smoking

offence which carries a lesser penalty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the two amendments with which Bill is

concerned  are  amendments which are  put  forward

following  the  experience of the working  of  the

temporary legislation relating to dangerous  drugs

and  Opium Treatment Centres and I hope that  they

will commend themselves to the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Butterfield (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr C. H. Butterfield):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill comes before the Assembly as a

separate  measure because the amendments  proposed

are   not   directly  related  to  the   temporary

provisions of the law relating to Opium  Treatment

Centres  with which the last Bill, which has  just

been before the Assembly, dealt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think hon. Members will have seen from the

Explanatory  Note which is attached to  this  Bill

that the main purpose of the amendment proposed by

it is to empower police officers who are not below

the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police  as

well  as,  as at present, magistrates and Justices

of  the Peace, to authorise the search of premises

in which there is reasonable cause to believe that

there  is  concealed any dangerous  drugs  or  any

articles relating to the commission of an  offence

under the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment will do away with the

procedure involving a very considerable  waste  of

time which has to be followed when the Officer  in

charge of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



the  Narcotics  Branch of  the  C.I.D. is  not  a

Justice of the Peace. Sir, briefly, this procedure

involves  the  transportation from the  old  Kreta

Ayer  Police Station to the Central Police Station

of  the  Duty Officer and of each detective  whose

information forms the basis of an application  for

a  search warrant. This normally involves a  large

proportion of the detective staff attached to  the

Narcotics Branch every day and sometimes,  indeed,

it involves the transportation of the whole of the

detective staff to the Central Police Station.  It

is clear therefore, Sir, that if this amendment is

made,  the  Narcotics Branch will  be  enabled  to

devote   all   its  time  and  energies   to   the

suppression  of  the traffic in  opium  and  other

dangerous drugs instead of, as at present, using a

considerable  amount  of  time  in  obtaining  the

warrants  which  are  necessary  before  they  can

undertake their work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view, Sir, of the importance of the work of

the  Narcotics  Branch, I hope that this  Assembly

will support this motion. I would, before formally

moving   the  Second  Reading,  Sir,   take   this

opportunity of indicating to Members that  in  the

event  of the Bill being given its Second Reading,

I  propose  to move in Committee the  deletion  of

paragraph  (d)  in clause 2 which is considered  to

be unnecessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

to clause 2. Would you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>



like  me,  Sir,  to  give it  to  you  now  before

indicating  its  nature or shall I first  indicate it?

<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> What I wish to move in respect of clause 2, Sir, is the deletion of paragraph (d).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of that amendment will be to allow a

search  warrant  issued under the Dangerous  Drugs

Ordinance to be executed by any police officer  no

matter  what  his  rank.  A further  consideration

suggests,   Sir,  that  the  existing  law   which

provides that such warrants may not be executed by

a  police  officer  below the  rank  of  Sergeant,

should be retained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have accordingly, Sir, to move the deletion of

paragraph   (d)   and  a  number  of  consequential

amendments. May I now hand in, Sir, the  amendment

which I propose to move?

<div align="center"><b>LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the Governor's consent Sir, to proceed

with   this   Bill.  Sir,  the  Local   Government

Elections Bill is of its very nature complementary

to  the  Local Government Bill in that  while  the

latter  Bill makes provision for the establishment

of  the  City  Council and District Councils,  the

purpose  of  this  Bill  is  to  provide  for  the

elections of Councillors to those Councils and, in

particular, to enable the registration of electors

for  the  purposes of elections  to  the  proposed

Councils  to  take place. That is  why  these  two

Bills   are   introduced   concurrently   in   the

Legislative Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the drafts of the relevant legislation stand

at  present, while the Local Government Bill  sets

out   the   qualifications  and  disqualifications

relating   to   candidates   for   elections    as

Councillors,  the Local Government Elections  Bill

sets  out the qualifications and disqualifications

of  electors. Again, while the boundaries  of  the

new  local government areas are defined under  the

provisions of the Local Government Bill, the names



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>

and boundaries of electoral divisions within these

local  government  areas and the  sub-division  of

these  electoral divisions into polling  districts

are  made  under  the  Local Government  Elections

Bill. Until the boundaries of the local government

areas   have   been   defined  and   approved,   a

Proclamation  specifying the names and  boundaries

of   the   electoral  divisions  and   a   Gazette

Notification  specifying  the  polling   districts

cannot be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the White Paper, Sir, it was pointed out that

the  McNeice  Committee  did  not  deal  with  the

question  of  the  franchise for local  government

electors  as it was not included in its  terms  of

reference, but Government has, however,  given  it

considerable thought and proposes that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(a) the basis of the franchise for the proposed

new   City  Council  and  District  Councils

should be

universal  adult suffrage qualified by a  period

of   at  least  five  years'  residence   in Singapore, the

elector  being  required to be resident  in  the

division in which he wishes to vote;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) registration of electors should be effected

by a system of automatic registration based on

identity cards."



<br><br>This  Bill  accordingly makes provision for  these

two proposals. These are the two major changes  in

the  Bill which, in the main, follows closely  the

provision  of  the Municipal Elections  Ordinance,

1948,  to  be  repealed on the  enactment  of  the

present Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in the Explanatory Note to the Bill,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clause 5 provides that any person who was not

less than twenty-one years of age on, and has been

ordinarily resident in the Colony for a period  of

not less than five years immediately prior to, 1st

April  in  any year shall be entitled to have  his

name  entered in the register of electors  in  the

division in which he is resident that year."



<br><br>It  will  thus  be seen that the new franchise  is

different from the qualifications of City  Council

electors  described under the Municipal  Elections

Ordinance, 1948. This means that the right to vote

will  be extended to a far greater number  of  the

adult    population   resident    in    Singapore.

Citizenship    will   not   be   a   pre-requisite

qualification.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present Bill, the system of automatic

registration  of  electors,  now  in   force   for

Legislative Assembly elections, is to replace  the

former system of voluntary registration under  the

Municipal Elections Ordinance, 1948. The  register

will be prepared automatically from identity cards

and  provision  is accordingly made for  presuming

that  persons  to  whom identity cards  have  been

issued  before 1st April in any year are  on  that

date  ordinarily resident in the Colony. Provision

is also made for particulars in the identity cards

regarding age and addresses to be presumed  to  be

accurate  for purposes of preparation and revision

of registers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the White Paper, it was proposed that plural

voting should be permitted so as to allow a person

living in one local government area to have a vote

in  another local government area in which he owns

property  if he registers himself voluntarily  for

the  purpose.  Therefore, a person living  in  one

area and owning properties in all other four areas

could  exercise  five votes in all,  one  in  each

local  government area. This proposal has  however

been reconsidered and it was felt that the present

Bill  should  not include any provision  for  such

plural voting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These then, Mr Speaker, are the general features

of   the  Bill.  It  is  the  intention  of   this

Government  to commit this Bill immediately  after

the Second Reading to a Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have one plea to

make  with  regard to this Bill  and  that  is  in

clause 28 regarding deposits by candidates.  I  am

making  this  plea  on behalf of  the  prospective

District  Councillors and City Council candidates.

1 see that they are required to pay $250 deposit.

I  would suggest, Sir, that either the deposit  in

the  case  of these councillors be waived  or,  if

there is any particular objection to that, to have

about  $50 or $100 instead of $250 deposit.  I  am

aware,  Sir, that deposits are usually  waived  in

the case



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>



of  some county and borough councils in the United

Kingdom. It may be a new practice in Singapore but

I  would like the Government to give consideration

to   this  suggestion  when  it  goes  to   Select

Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is only

one  point I wish to bring to the attention of the

House  on this Bill, namely, that it has  made  no

provision   whatsoever  for  the   limitation   of

transport  of  candidates. Any man who  has  taken

part  in  elections in Singapore  knows  that  the

availability of friends with free motor  cars  and

free  petrol is a very useful advantage in getting

people to the polls to vote for a candidate. It is

a   principle   in  countries  which   profess   a

democratic system that factors such as the  wealth

of  a  candidate or the wealth of his friends  are

not allowed in any way to affect the result of  an

election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we have in this Bill a provision carried

over  from  the old Municipal Elections  Ordinance

which  says  that no money shall  be  expended  on

transport. But the dodge is to get friends to  provide  not only free cars but also free petrol  and

free syces. I suggest that when this Bill goes  to

Select  Committee, the Government should seriously

consider  putting  in  provisions  to  stop   this

reprehensible practice and to limit each candidate

to  a specified number of cars depending upon  two

things: the size of a constituency and the  number

of  voters on the electoral register. In that way,

the Government can ensure - and I am sure all honest

democratic  governments want to ensure - that  there

should  be  a  free competition  of  opinions  and

candidates popularly and democratically elected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Bedok (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin

Haji  Jumat) in the days before he became a Member

for   Ulu Bedok  must  have  experienced   great

difficulty getting transport to get the voters  of

Ulu  Bedok  to  the polls, particularly  competing

with other candidates who happened to be wealthier

than  he was. I am sure that in the next election,

he  would not like to undergo all the stresses and

strains of worrying about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



the wealth of his opponents and their friends.  We

can  do  that  by putting a proviso ensuring  that

every candidate is limited to the same number  of

cars.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

suggestion  by  the Member for  Tanjong  Pagar  to

limit the candidates to a fixed number of cars  is

a  very good one provided it could be carried  out

by our candidates in the right spirit in which,  I

hope, it is meant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice, Sir, that there is another

clause  in this Bill which says that electors  are

free   to   provide  their  own  transport   which

presumably  means that four or five  electors  can

join  together, hire a taxi and go to the  polling

stations. Therefore, if we provide a limit on  the

number of cars a candidate can use, obviously  the

way  out  is for the candidate's friends  to  band

together and provide another hundred cars and  say

that it does not concern the candidate; that these

cars  are  used  by the electorate  on  their  own

volition and that the candidate has no say in  it.

Therefore, they can easily defeat the -

<div align="center"><b>CLERKS EMPLOYMENT BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have His Excellency the Governor's consent

to proceed with the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- Deliberately left comment -->Hon. Members will remember that during the last

Session,  the Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim  Choon Mong) introduced

a Shop and Office Employees Bill.

At  the  Second Reading of this Bill, the previous

Government introduced Sessional Paper No. Cmd.  11

which  laid down the labour policy of the previous

Government and included as an annexure a  Bill  to

regulate  the conditions of employment  of  clerks

and shop assistants. In committing the Bill of the

Member  for  Serangoon to Select  Committee,  this

Assembly ordered that it be an instruction to that

Select Committee that regard be had to the terms



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



of  the draft Bill annexed to the Government White

Paper.  The  Select Committee, Sir, did  not  have

time to conclude its investigations before the end

of the last Session and the Bill therefore lapsed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A considerable amount of further study has been

done  on  the  Bill  attached as  an  annexure  to

Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 11. Due regard  has  been

given  to  the  representations  made  before  the

Select Committee by employers and trade unions  in

addition  to  the  advice of the  Labour  Advisory

Board to which the Bill was referred for comment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest change that has been made, Sir, is

the  splitting of the Bill into two: one  relating

to  clerks  and  the  other  to  shop  assistants.

Despite  the fact that both Bills are  similar  in

the protection and benefits they give to these two

types of employees, it is considered that separate

Bills  are  desirable. Clerks and shop  assistants

are  after all two distinct types of employees and

it  may  well  be  that the experience  gained  in

administering  this Bill over a  number  of  years

will  show that the type of amendment and addition

which  is necessary to one Bill is unnecessary  to

the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the drafting of two separate

Bills, the main difference from the provisions  of

the previous Government's Bill is the inclusion of

a  new  designation of "industrial clerks" in  the

Bill  which is the subject of my motion. This  has

been done to meet objections that many clerks, for

example,  tally clerks, storekeepers,  etc.,  must

have  the conditions of employment with regard  to

hours  of  work and holidays as the  workmen  with

whom they work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the matter of legislation for clerks has

already been debated at considerable length during

the  previous Session of this Assembly, Sir, I  do

not  propose to cover the ground again.  The  need

for  legislation to protect clerks is too  obvious

to require a lengthy oration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I intend therefore, Sir, merely to summarise the

main features of the Bill, a Bill which I am quite

sure will go a long way to give fair conditions of

employment to a hitherto neglected section of  the

community



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, Sir, this Bill regulates contracts of

service,  lays down conditions for the payment  of

salaries  and limits the type of deductions  which

may be made from salaries. It provides for, in the

case  of clerks, 16 days paid public holidays,  14

days  paid annual leave. It limits their hours  of

work  to  39  a week and provides for overtime  at

time and a half for hours worked in excess of this

limit.  In  the  case of industrial  clerks  whose

conditions of service must be similar to those  of

workmen  for the reasons I have already given,  it

provides for 11 days paid public holidays, 7  days

paid annual leave. It limits the hours of work  to

44 per week and also provides for overtime at time

and  a  half. Paid sick leave up to a limit of  28

days  is  provided for both clerks and  industrial

clerks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important feature of the Bill, Sir, is

that it permits clerks to lay their complaints  in

the  Labour  Court thus saving them the  formality

and  expense of proceedings in the Civil  District

Court.   It   provides  for  adequate  powers   of

inspection and suitable penalties for infringement

of   its   provisions  to  ensure   that   it   is

successfully enforced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is Government's intention to refer this

Bill  to a Select Committee which will, no  doubt,

take  into  consideration  any  views  which  hon.

Members may express on the Second Reading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a Member of

the  Select  Committee which sat last  Session  to

consider two Clerks and Shop Assistants Bills, one

drafted  by  the Liberal-Socialist Party  and  the

other  by  the Government, I think it  had  become

clear  that we had been setting ourselves problems

of  legislation which it would not be at all  easy

to   surmount.  I  am  glad  therefore  that   the

Government  has taken the course of  drafting  two

Bills  to  meet  two  rather  different  sets   of

problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Clerks Employment Bill before us, the

further  conundrum  with  which  the  old   Select

Committee was faced has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



been  met  by defining two categories  of  clerks:

industrial and otherwise. Whether this is going to

be  a  satisfactory solution or whether  it  would

result   in  invidious  distinctions  and  further

complications is a matter on which I have an  open

mind,  but  to  which a Select Committee  of  this

House should call for evidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested, Sir, that a 39-hour week

will  be  extremely  hard on  the  numerous  small

businesses  in Singapore. If this is  so,  I  hope

that the Government will call for evidence and, at

the  same  time,  make  their own  investigations,

because  a  Bill  of this kind while  giving  much

needed  protection to the clerks should not impose

undue  hardship on the small employer on  whom  so

much of the ordinary trade of the country depends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, it has been stated that a 39-hour week

is  not at present being worked in Government  and

City Council offices. This rather surprises me and

I  should  like to know from the Minister  whether

this  is a fact and, if so, what will be the extra

bill  which  the  ratepayer  will  have  to  meet,

bearing  in  mind that the Government's  and  City

Council's, wage bills already swallow up too  high

a proportion of the country's revenues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other specific point to which I wish

to refer, namely, in clauses 44 to 46. It seems to

me  that  they give inspecting officers very  wide

powers  indeed.  An Inspector may  enter  premises

under  clause  44 without previous notice  at  any

hour  of the day or night and under clause 46 (a) ,

he  may put questions concerning the employees  to

their  employer or to the employees themselves  or

to any other person whom he may consider desirable

to  question. There seems no obvious justification

for  these  wide powers. Surely, it is  sufficient

that an Inspector makes his enquiries during hours

when  the  premises are opened for  business,  and

that  there also should be the proviso to be found

in  section  9 (2)  of the present Weekly  Holidays

Ordinance now to be repealed, namely:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...no person shall be compellable to answer any

question  if  the  answer  may  tend  directly  or

indirectly to incriminate himself."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may add, Sir, that similar clauses which seem

to  me  objectionable are to be found in the  Shop

Assistants  Employment Bill,  clauses  48  to  50.

Unless, Sir, there are good and convincing reasons

for  their  retention, I think that  the  Minister

should consider modifying them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

definition of "clerk" in this Bill is contained in

clause 2 which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'clerk' means any person employed in or about

the  business of an office whose salary is  not

more than five hundred dollars per mensem or such other

sum as may from time to time be fixed by the

Minister  by  notification  in  the  Gazette  and,

subject  to  such  salary  limits,  includes  such

classes of person employed  by  the Government or by  Her  Britannic

Majesty's   Government  in  the   United   Kingdom

functioning in  the  Colony as the Governor may from  time  to

time declare to be clerks for the purposes of this Ordinance...".



<br><br>Now,  it  is  true that we must have an  arbitrary

figure but I would like to know why the figure 500

was chosen. With the tendency of wages to get more

and  more inflated because the money becomes  less

and  less  valuable, it seems quite  obvious  that

there  will  be  many clerks who will  not  be  in

supervisory  or  special categories  drawing  more

than  $500  a  month.  It  is  not  an  altogether

satisfactory method of dealing with the definition

of  "clerk"  to  allow the Minister  to  vary  the

definition by gazetting the salary limit by  which

a  person is deemed to be a clerk or not a  clerk.

However,  that  is a matter which  could  be  more

usefully dealt with in Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede) has stated

that he has an open mind on the subject, I see  no

merit  in  dividing  clerks into  two  categories:

Industrial clerks and ordinary clerks.  One  would

have  thought that a Socialist Government's policy

would,  as  a  matter  of  principle,  have   been

directed  towards  some  more  or  less  classless

society.  This  process of not only creating  more

classes but sub-divisions of classes is one  which

must  be  a  Socialist heresy. A tally clerk  will

have to work 44 hours a week instead of 39 hours a

week. He will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>



entitled to 11 public holidays instead of  13.  He

will be entitled to 7 days annual leave instead of

14,  and so on. I think this question of principle

should  be resolved at once. The Government  would

be   well  advised  to  define  its  attitude   to

legislation of this nature: whether its  intention

is  to  stratify  classes  into  sub-divisions  of

classes or whether its intention is to bring about

a more egalitarian and less stratified society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> In reply, Sir. As I said

earlier,  this Bill will be committed to a  Select

Committee and the various points raised by the two

speakers, the Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede) and the

Member  for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)  will

receive due consideration in Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin has criticised that the

number of hours of work per week of 39 is, in  his

view,   not  satisfactory  in  so  far  as   small

employers are concerned. I said, Sir, earlier that

this  Bill  was considered by the Labour  Advisory

Board on which employers and employees are equally

represented. He asked for information  as  to  the

working  hours of Government clerks.  I  am  sure

that  he must be aware that the working hours  are

from  9  a.m. to 4.30 p.m. with an hour break  for

lunch  on  Monday to Friday and from 9 a.m. to  1

p.m. on Saturday. This works out to less than  39

hours a week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar has said that in the

definition  of "clerk" the figure of  $500  is  an

arbitrary  figure. I agree that it is an arbitrary

figure but the hon. Member will also remember that

in  the  previous Bill, the figure was put  in  at

$400  and  there  was  no protest  whatsoever  and

because I have felt that it should be increased by

another $100 in order to cover more clerks who  by

the  very  nature  of their employment  should  be

protected by legislative measure, he has now  seen

fit to say that $500 is not enough whereas $400 at

that time was quite adequate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar too, Sir, if I

remember  rightly,  was a  Member  of  the  Select

Committee during the last Session.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No, I was not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am sorry about that. I

thought  he was. During the deliberations of  that

Select  Committee, Sir, employers did  explain  to

the  Select  Committee the difficulties  of  their

having  industrial clerks working for  less  hours

than  their  ordinary workmen - labourers - especially

as  these  workmen have to work together with  the

clerical supervisors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, all the points that have been raised

will  be  given  due consideration by  the  Select

Committee and I therefore need hardly say anything

more at this juncture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.
