<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1676</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I am

raising this concern based on a fundamental core value which the

Government  has repeatedly articulated: the desire to  become  a

gracious society.  I think BG Yeo's vision of Singapore becoming

the  watering  hole  for  Silicon  Valley  experts  to  come  to

Singapore to hone our expertise for the IT commerce sector is  a

very stimulating and intellectually an uplifting one.  I applaud

that  vision.   But if we could also visualise  Singapore  as  a

nation   where   people  on  wheelchairs  who   are   physically

handicapped but mentally brilliant, like Dr William Tan, or  not

too  bright but still able, can mix freely and openly over a jug

of  beer  with  other Singaporeans without social stigma,  in  a

barrier-free physical environment, then I say we are a  city  of

graciousness.   Because it is a city with intellect,  enterprise

and humanity prevailing side by side.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this vision of a city as a driving value for my cut

today,  I  would  like  to  raise the following  issues  to  the

Minister:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, what progress has been made on the 1993 Advisory

Council's   recommendations,  and  the  number   of   facilities

identified for the needs of the disabled?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, do we have a central registry of disabled children

to  enable us to reach out to kids hidden away by parents?  What

further  resources and support can be committed by the  Ministry

to help disabled children integrate in the mainstream education?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, could the Minister also reinforce our plea to MOE to

persuade  neighbourhood  school principals  to  accept  disabled

children  and  to  create  a  barrier-free  school  environment,

focusing on physical accessibility to laboratories, canteens and

libraries?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, another concern is the physical and sexual abuse of

disabled  children,  especially the  girls.   Can  the  Minister

inform  us  of  past  records of such  abuses  and  whether  the

amendment  to the Women's Charter is an enabling legislation  to

protect them and prevent such abuses?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1677</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, PWD, some years ago, assured MCD that it would

create  a  disabled-friendly  environment  through  its  walkway

upgrading  projects, to increase physical accessibility  of  the

disabled.   Can  the Minister confirm that this  is  now  a  HDB

policy  for all constituencies?  At this point, I would like  to

make  a  plea  to  all  MPs in this House to  take  this  matter

seriously.   The  disabled  wish  for  a  barrier-free  physical

environment, so that they can manoeuvre their way  around  in  a

wheelchair   without  assistance.   Gradient  of   kerbs,   road

crossings,  ramps  are a few suggestions  which  can  be  easily

designed.   These  user-friendly features  are  helpful  to  all

Singaporeans,  especially young mothers with infant  push-carts.

They do not cost a lot.  I was heartened to hear from Mr Charles

Chong, MP for Pasir Ris, and I applaud his initiative, that  his

Town Council built a ramp for a handicapped girl to help her get

to  the  car park to go to school every day.  These are  simple,

concrete  but  significant measures which MPs can do  for  their

constituents to spread the spirit of care and share.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, could the Minister reinforce our plea to HDB to

establish a policy whereby ground floor units of flats  or  lift

decks  can  be  allocated to families with disabled  persons  to

facilitate their access and mobility?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MCD, NCSS and about 56 voluntary welfare organisations

have  done  a  lot  in  the caring of the disabled  by  offering

funding  for basic facilities, training and service development.

I  see  the  need  now  to lift our eyes to  the  community  for

assistance.  I see two areas of focus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first focus is to enhance employment opportunities for

disabled  persons.   We have talked about this  during  the  MOM

debate.  I am pleased to know that NCSS will be carrying  out  a

survey  on employment problems of the disabled, to identify  the

factors  securing and retaining employment for the disabled  and

the  views of employers regarding their employment.  This survey

will  help  us  develop  a strategic plan to improve  employment

opportunities but, meanwhile, I hope the CDC could channel



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1678</b></font><br><br>



queries  and  job  recommendations through  its  Helpline.   The

public  sector  could take the lead by employing  more  disabled

persons, so as to encourage more employers in the private sector

to  do  the same.  But as Minister Dr Lee Boon Yang said  a  few

days  ago,  the  challenge is in changing  the  mindset  of  the

employers.   It  looks  like we will need a  national  awareness

campaign.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second focus is to encourage VWOs to develop informal

networks, eg, a disabled children's circle, youth circle  or  an

elderly  circle within neighbourhoods to enhance mutual  support

as well as strengthen inter-agency help networks through sharing

of services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make a call again to all Members of

Parliament to support the programmes of MCD, CDC, NCSS and  VWOs

at each of their constituencies.  MCD, given its limited budget,

has accomplished many targets in the areas of service provision.

We  now have to generate community-based initiatives by focusing

on  enablement  and participation approaches to help  vulnerable

groups reach an optimal level of independent functioning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister Abdullah Tarmugi has broad shoulders to take on

this  huge task of community development, but the responsibility

of community building requires the collaboration of everyone.  I

urge the hon. Members of Parliament in this House to support his

mission,  participate and help to generate an enduring reservoir

of  resources  and  helping networks for community  bonding.   I

propose  that  they visit VWOs, find out the problems  faced  by

their  constituents,  and  serve as a  bridge  to  convey  their

problems  to  the respective Government bodies.  The  experience

will only enhance MP-constituent relationship.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, in 1995, during

the  Committee of Supply debate, I proposed a national volunteer

services scheme for women.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to resurface that proposal today. I believe,

that as Singapore matures, we need to pay more attention to  the

issue of social cohesion.  If we are not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1679</b></font><br><br>



careful,  stratification  of  our society  along  socio-economic

lines could occur.  Over time, the poor will become better  off,

while the rich  could become even richer so that the gap between

the  haves  and  the  have-nots could widen, particularly  where

property  and other assets are concerned.   In other  words,  we

need to make an effort to develop social bonding at the national

level, particularly across socio-economic lines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the greatest institutions of social bonding that we

have  in Singapore today is national service.  During their  two

and  a  half years, men of diverse social backgrounds,  eg,  the

Hokkien   speaking,  or  shall I say  Hokkien  swearing  primary

educated  man, together with the Cambridge-trained  son  of  the

rich tycoon are thrown together.  They train together.  They eat

together.   They  suffer together.  They  relax  together.   And

because  of  these  ties, bonds of friendship are  forged  which

transcend  socio-economic status.  As a result, an understanding

and   tolerance   of  others  from  entirely  different   social

backgrounds  is developed, which will stand them in  good  stead

throughout their lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this form of social cohesion is absent for women.

Schools  offer  some  opportunity but this  is  limited.   As  a

result, a Chinese girl may grow up never having been to the home

of  a  Malay friend and vice versa.  A girl living in a district

11  bungalow  may never understand the concerns and  mindset  of

someone  who  grew  up in a rented 3-room HDB  flat.   There  is

simply no opportunity to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore urge the Government to seriously consider

a national cohesion scheme for women.  The objectives are clear.

First,  it  is  to develop social  bonding among  women  at  the

national  level and, second, in developing that social  bonding,

it  will  also foster a greater sense of community, of  national

identity, of what it means to be Singaporean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best time for such a scheme to occur is after `A'

levels  where there is a window of about six months  before  the

university  term begins.  The scheme could involve  a  range  of

duties, including social work, health care and administrative



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1680</b></font><br><br>



support   services.   It  should  include  a  physical  training

programme  to  develop physical fitness, much like  the  Outward

Bound School.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I believe that social cohesion and social

bonding  should not just be for men alone, simply  because  they

have  national service and women are excluded.  A scheme  should

be  started for women.  The beneficial effects of such a  scheme

are  of strategic importance for Singapore.  I also believe that

in  this  day  and  age, this is the time to  implement  such  a

scheme.  It is a scheme for which the time has come.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, my topic is on quality of

life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to go through the corporate brochures or annual

reports of various Ministries and statutory boards, we will find

that  most  of them have impressive mission statements,  visions

and  goals  for  their respective organisations, many  of  which

strive to develop Singapore into a world-class city, a city that

offers  diversity  and choice, a city with  a  rich  variety  of

environment, a city of character and grace, and a  city  with  a

rich quality of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although all these mission statements reflect what the

respective Ministries or statutory boards would like to  achieve

in  the  next  century, many fail to reflect  what  Singaporeans

really  want  in life.  While it is easy to define a world-class

city,  it is difficult to define quality of life.  Thus, I would

like  to urge the Ministry to develop a set of social indicators

to measure our quality of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent Straits Times report on 2nd June 1997 highlighted

that, "Life has become better for Singaporeans in the five years

between   1990  and  1995.   Singaporeans  are  richer,  better-educated, live in bigger homes and hold better jobs."



<br>12.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another survey which was conducted by Asiaweek in October

1996,  ranked Singapore's standard of living second, as compared

to  40  other  cities  in Asia.  But, are these  measures  truly

reflective of the quality of life of Singaporeans?  I do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1681</b></font><br><br>



think so.  If you were to conduct house visits to a block of  3- or  4-room HDB flats, you will receive this common feedback from

the  residents, "Living in Singapore is very good, but  life  is

very tough."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some developed countries, the standard of living is

improving, but the quality of life does not necessarily  improve

at  the  same  time.  Are people happier, more  fulfilled,  more

creative,  more  able  to develop their  potential?   Are  their

relationships at work and leisure as satisfying?  Do  they  find

their neighbourhood and environment as pleasant to live in?   Is

there  a supportive network of families, friends, and neighbours

to help them in their old age or childcare?  All these questions

must  be  properly addressed before we embark on  our  ambitious

plans to develop Singapore into a world-class city.  I hope  the

Ministry  could  update  the House on the  quality  of  life  of

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to urge the Ministry to consider

developing  a Quality of Life index for Singaporeans.   Economic

indicators are used to track the performance of the economy.  We

also  need  Quality of Life indicators to monitor the fulfilment

of Singaporeans' needs and aspirations in life.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, it is commonly

acknowledged that there is too much stress in Singapore and,  as

Dr  Teo has eloquently put it, the quality of life is not as  it

should  be.   We are too strung-up.  We are too serious  minded.

As  the Minister for Information and the Arts said in the debate

in  this House a few days ago, quoting Mr Sim Wong Hoo, our best

and most famous entrepreneur, there is not much of a fun element

in  Singapore.   Even a pressure cooker needs safety  valves  or

else  the pot will explode and then whatever you are cooking  is

useless and wasted.  I do believe, Sir, that the pressure cooker

that  we  are  in  in Singapore needs safety valves.   There  is

anecdotal evidence that more and more children, for example, are

going for counselling and the mental health of our nation is  at

stake.  The talents that we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1682</b></font><br><br>



nurturing could one day explode and then be wasted.   I  do  not

know if there are figures, but if there are, I hope the Minister

would reveal them to the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my purpose today is not just a call to the Minister to

do something about this, but also a call to all Singaporeans, my

fellow  Singaporeans, to remember to work hard  and  play  hard.

This  is a call to all Singaporeans to keep a healthy mind in  a

healthy body.  Being competitive is fine because we are a  small

nation that survives on our wits, but being a small nation  that

is  competitive does not mean that we have to spend every single

moment making money and forget about our health and forget about

our  families  and  having  fun with them.   Being  competitive,

without being healthy, is thus foolish.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My call is also to the Singapore Government to promote

sports (not only for the masses, we have been doing that a  lot)

and I think it is time we move on to a higher level, and that is

we  should also be promoting sports for professional talents  to

grow, not just in soccer but in everything else.  This may  seem

like  benefiting only a small group of people but as we can  see

from  other  nations, every time somebody wins a  medal  in  the

Olympics, the whole nation wins and cheers.  Every time there is

a  medal  won in the World Cup, not only in soccer, but  in  all

sorts  of things, everyone stands up and cheers.  So I think  it

is important now for us to start looking for programmes to groom

professional   talents  and  be  serious  about   this   because

professional  talents and champions also serve this  purpose  of

bonding  the  nation and the community together, and  giving  us

all,   you  might  say,  a  vicarious  national  pride  in  this

achievement.     We   need   bigger   grants   for    grassroots

organisations,  for example, to organise family oriented  sports

and  games and recreational activities and be more proactive  in

starting some of these programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My call is also to the Government to promote mental health

by building facilities that would give fun, inexpensive fun, for

Singaporeans.   It is nice to build big resorts or  big  tourist

spots that can also be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1683</b></font><br><br>



used  by  locals, but these are expensive and generally  if  you

look  at the entrance fees of $15-$16, nobody goes.  If you look

at  the  Lianhe Zaobao celebrations, they opened up Tang Dynasty

City  for a dollar and crowds came.  Perhaps we do not  have  to

charge  a dollar, maybe $3 or $5, and I think much more response

will be there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to create facilities for Singaporeans to play,

recreational facilities that do not cost the earth, perhaps such

as adventure campsites.  I think we have got adventure campsites

that were planned but are now suffering from the regional crisis

because these things have to be put on the shelf as they are not

deemed  to  be necessities.  Sir, I think that is short-sighted.

These  are  necessities  - fishing sites,  perhaps  even  kelong

sites.    I   think  PPD  and  some  other  agencies  discourage

Singaporeans  from  going up to kelongs to just  spend  a  night

there, or fish and do things like that.  I think we should allow

them  to  do so.  We should allow for more outdoor accommodation

for  fun  activities, more parks like Sungei Buloh and  Labrador

and  we  should leave Pulau Ubin alone so that it is  unburdened

with all our improvements.  There is value in being able to just

run  around  in  the wild, so to speak.  Sir,  if  we  leave  it

untouched, it also helps our Singaporeans to be reminded of  the

times  that  we  have gone through, that once  upon  a  time  in

Singapore it was like that.  It would give them some lessons  in

how  far we have come and how much we should appreciate the work

that we have put in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps this can be modified a little. We might be

able to preserve one or two villages in there as pristine as  we

can.   Leave it there, the Malay village or the Chinese village,

so that the people would remember how we lived once upon a time.

Perhaps for this model village we can put people there.  Like in

other  countries, for example, Plymouth, in Massachusetts,  they

have  got a village there as if it is still living in the 1600s.

They  have got people moving around, sowing, planting,  milling,

and  so  on.  Maybe we can do a model village like that just  to

remind Singaporeans of where we were and how far we have come.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1684</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this call is also to the Government - and the Minister

for  Finance is happily here - for the Minister for  Finance  to

allocate   some  more  funds  to  the  Minister  for   Community

Development  so that we can have funds to educate and  publicise

these things that Singaporeans can do to help them to learn  and

this is a learned thing  to learn the art of relaxation and  the

proper use of leisure time.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, the Government

adopts  a many helping hands approach in the provision of social

service.   This approach harnesses the collaborative efforts  of

Government  agencies  and non-government  organisations  in  the

provision  of social welfare and community support services  and

programmes for the less fortunate in our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although a wide range of services has been put in

place  by  various  organisations, the general  public  or  even

social service agencies may not be aware of the availability  of

the full range of services.  MCD could perhaps identify specific

target  groups  which would be most likely to need  such  social

service.   I believe the group that needs this service most  are

usually  low  income families staying in the  1-room  or  2-room

rental  units.  I understand there are about 100,000  households

in  this  category.   MCD, together with CDC  volunteers,  could

target  this  group  for an extensive outreach  programme.   CDC

volunteers could first be trained to understand the entire scope

of   social  services  available.   The  volunteers   in   their

encounters  with these families would then be able  to  explain,

and  also assist those who need such service, to apply for  them

or help to refer them to the relevant authorities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask what measures will be taken to provide

greater  publicity  on  the different types  of  social  service

available so as to reach a wider audience?

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I feel we should ask

ourselves one basic question.  Are we giving enough help to  the

voluntary  sector?  I am sure Members would be  able  to  assess

this.  They have been involved in the various voluntary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1685</b></font><br><br>



sectors   and  encouraged  people  to  participate  in   various

voluntary activities.  Sir, my own assessment is that,  yes,  we

have  given  some help to a certain extent.  Moral  support  and

encouragement, plenty.  You and I can give all this to the  many

organisations.  But this is insufficient.  Just  appeal  to  the

hearts and cajole people is a good thing, but it is insufficient

because  a lot of efforts go into the raising of funds,  to  run

projects  and  to  translate  ideas, interests,  concerns,  into

concrete programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you assess the financial grants given to voluntary

organisations,  I  would  say that some  are  given,  perhaps  a

little.  Let me tell you what has been provided to the voluntary

sector.   First,  you  have  the  matching  grants  for  various

programmes.   It  is  up  to 50% for selected  programmes.   The

voluntary  organisation has to raise the rest.   It  is  a  good

thing, but how much can you raise because a lot of organisations

are  competing out there for funds, including the CDCs today who

are  also  in  the scene competing to raise funds  from  various

people.   And you and I are being cajoled all the time.   It  is

good  if  we  can help.  But I think at some point, many  of  us

could  suffer  from compassion fatigue.  But,  nevertheless,  we

should do something for the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For capital grant, I think there is good mileage because

organisations get up to 95%, but these are for a few  buildings,

and   new  facilities  and  other  developments.   This  is   an

interesting  development and I must say that  the  Ministry  has

given  support  in  this  aspect.  For  many  of  the  voluntary

organisations, their facilities need to be upgraded  and  I  see

that  some  of the facilities are really down to the  pits.   So

what  we  have  to  do is to see what can be done  in  terms  of

providing grants for them to upgrade their facilities.  I assert

that more could be done in this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that moral support alone is insufficient. I

can   understand  the  Minister's  predicament.   He  has   been

persuading the Ministry of Finance, year in and year out, to get

more  funds  and  since the Minister for Finance  is  here  this

afternoon, I am glad he is here, I see that it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1686</b></font><br><br>



is  important that he be persuaded to support community building

cause and to note that the funds that he will be releasing is in

terms  of investment for the social infrastructure.  It  is  the

people  that  we  are  looking at, ie,  community  building  and

community  cohesion.  We want to prevent social  divide  in  the

community.   If the community is divided, how could  we  harness

them  to be productive people?  Sir, almost every sector of  the

community  is  important to us.  Whether they are  the  able  or

disabled, I feel it is important for us to find ways to  support

them.   And I hope that next year the Minister for Finance would

be  better  persuaded  to release more  funds.   I  am  sure  my

colleagues would agree with these suggestions and persuasion.



<br>1.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that the Minister would consider this matter

seriously.   And  I  hope  he is not suffering  from  compassion

fatigue  but  able to see what he can do to boost the  voluntary

sector as well as the Ministry of Community Development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, increasingly voluntary organisations are also

encouraged  to provide more and more services.  We ask  them  to

develop  programmes.  We persuade them with all good  intentions

and  purposes.  Many of them want to do good.  But  how  can  we

help them to have a better mileage, in terms of contributing  to

the  community?  What more than by providing them adequate funds

to  enable  them  to achieve the missions and objectives  to  do

public good.  This is an area where we should examine seriously,

in terms of what support we can give them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of these organisations are affected by spending a

lot  of time in raising funds.  I suppose more than 70% of their

time  is  spent  in  raising funds and 20% in terms  of  service

delivery, thinking about what and how they can plan ahead.  So I

hope we can relieve them of this fund-raising burden.  It is not

easy  to raise funds today, because many of us are all the  time

approached  by many organisations, persuading us to do  what  is

possible,  and many of them are very supportive.   I  hope  that

people will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1687</b></font><br><br>



continue to do so, but there is a threshold to how much  we  can

do.   And the heart of the matter is that volunteers and  others

can  do  things up to a point.  But Government must  demonstrate

its  capacity to do more and should be encouraged to do a little

more so that it could inspire more volunteers and people in  the

community  to  contribute to this common good.   To  reduce  the

problem  and  burden of fund-raising, it is  necessary  for  the

Ministry to persuade the Ministry of Finance to increase  grants

for the voluntary sector.  I would like to persuade the Minister

for  Finance to see whether the CDC funding formula of $3 to  $1

could  be  applied  to the voluntary sector, ie,  for  every  $1

raised,  the Government will give $3.  If it is matched by  that

formula, then I think the voluntary sector would be able  to  do

more  and  the community would be able to benefit in the  longer

term.   We  will  be  able to reduce the social  divide  in  the

community   and  people  will  participate  fully  in  community

building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the funding formula and support for the

voluntary sector could be reviewed and the Minister for  Finance

would  be  able  to  think of ways in  which  he  can  urge  and

encourage people to do more.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, I would like to know from

the  Minister  what  measures have been  taken  to  improve  the

professionalism of the social worker sector.  Based on a  number

of  conversations I had with various people following my  maiden

speech  in  November last year, I have observed  some  uncertain

sentiments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fear that by recognising the professionals

through accreditation measures, we may risk losing thousands  of

needed  good-hearted volunteers who may now "disqualify".   That

is  not  so.   In fact, the feedback is we are losing volunteers

because  of  unclear  role  expectations,  low  professionalism,

absence  of  training  and self-growth  opportunities  and  weak

volunteer  development  programmes.   Moreover,  volunteers  can

still  be  accredited by experience and performance accordingly.

They can also take up course modules in their work



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1688</b></font><br><br>



experience  and  become  progressively professionalised,  so  to

speak.  So they will not be excluded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side of the professionals, for the sake of

protecting  public  interest, they feel  strongly  the  need  to

differentiate the volunteers and professionals by skills so that

the  qualified  and  certified social  work  professionals  will

handle  therapy related work and the social work  volunteers  or

non-accredited   staff   can   be   trained   to   offer   other

administrative,   management  and  non-clinical   client-related

services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The confusion of the word "social worker" which has been

used  very loosely in the community and by the media because  it

is  referred interchangeably to everybody - professionals,  non-accredited staff and volunteers in the field.  They assume  that

social workers are primarily volunteers.  Sometimes legitimately

so  because  a  social work professional can be a volunteer.   A

volunteer in the social work sector, on the other hand, may  not

have  professional qualifications.  And a staff not  trained  at

all  in  the social work discipline, who is managing a  VWO,  is

also  seen  as  a  social  worker.   Everyone,  irrespective  of

qualifications  and  skills, as long as she contributes  in  the

social service sector becomes commonly known as a social worker.

That is the root of the confusion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight to Members of the House that they

are different in their areas of focus, the kind of training they

bring to the field and the sort of professional outcome and work

performance we expect from their participation.  We must develop

a  system  of job functions and skills levels.  Once clear  work

roles  are established and their contributions are organised  in

complementary  terms,  the closer we are towards  developing  an

action  model of cooperation for enhancing performance standards

in that sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will continue his effort in pursuing

the need to professionalise the social service sector and accord

due  recognition  by  accreditation, rank  and  remuneration  of

social workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1689</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another matter, Sir, there were special requests from

numerous  VWOs  whether we could give direct service  volunteers

some  incentives  to influence a minimum standard  of  services.

Sixty-one agencies, about 82% in a survey of 75 VWOs last  year,

conducted  by  NCSS,  expressed  problems  in  sustainment   and

deployment  of volunteers.  Organisations which focus  on  their

service  delivery  standards through  training  are  finding  it

difficult  to  retain their volunteers.   I  was  told  that  an

occasional praise, a door gift, lucky draw prizes, a certificate

or  inspirational  talks and stories are no longer  adequate  to

motivate these thousands of people to give up their leisure  and

take  up  the  burden of fulfilling someone  else's  need  on  a

regular basis.  On top of this, like Dr Vasoo says, these people

are asked to look for funds to perpetuate their own sacrifice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about 12,500 lonely elderly poor in Singapore;

the  number is going to grow to 17,500 by the year 2030.  Unless

such  people  are befriended for psycho-emotional support,  kept

clean  and  fed  by  volunteers or full-time staff,  they  would

become  early  candidates for nursing homes.  It was  calculated

for  me that it costs the community less than $50 per month  for

each  of  these  elderly to be supported by  volunteers.   In  a

nursing home it would cost $1,000 per month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need an average of 2,000 volunteers to assist direct

service  VWOs  to care for the chronic sick, the  disabled,  the

young  and the abandoned individuals.  The social burden on  the

state  will  increase.   We  need to look  deep  into  community

resources   by   mobilising  and  deploying  the  thousands   of

homemakers  and  retirees  for action.   By  giving  them  basic

training  in care programmes, they form a significant  community

of  reservist  volunteers whom we should bestow some  degree  of

prestige and privilege.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two views about the use of material

incentives.   One which urges us to accept the  reality  of  the

voluntary movement and offer material incentives to attract  and

retain volunteers.  The second



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1690</b></font><br><br>



view  sees  the use of material incentives as a wrong spirit  to

promote  in  voluntarism.  Moreover, by  having  the  Government

stepping  in  to  do  this, a whole lot of requests  from  other

quarters  will  follow.   What  limits  and  on  whom  does  the

Government  impose?   And  how much is  enough  as  benefits  to

volunteers, anyway?  So although I support Dr Vasoo's  call  for

more support for the volunteers, I think this is a complex issue

that we need to handle cautiously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A middle view sees the voluntary movement being organised

and  incentivised at the NGO level, but there is then an overall

need  to  critically  examine if the  resources  and  management

capabilities  of  NGOs  can effect such  an  outcome.   We  need

advocates and leaders in the social service sector who  are  not

care-givers,  therapists or social work professionals,  but  are

good  managers  with a helicopter view for developing  community

initiated programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some strategic planning and visioning is urgently

needed  to  promote voluntarism as a philosophy and a  movement.

NCSS is working hard at this, but the Government must step in to

support with resources and public education programmes.  If not,

the  State  will only be saddled with increasing  social  burden

costs  and  a desperate lot of Singaporeans with no  one  taking

care of them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We seek the Minister's direction and leadership on this

matter.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, today in Singapore, the

planning and delivery of community and social services occurs at

three levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is at the national level where the Ministry of

Community  Development studies overall trends, ascertains  needs

and plans and implements programmes nationwide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is at the district level. With the advent of

Community  Development  Councils last  year,  we  now  have  the

equivalent  of  local  governments to  cater  to  the  needs  of

residents at the CDC district level.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1691</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we have the community groups and volunteer welfare

organisations.   These organisations target specific  groups  or

neighbourhoods in order to serve the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clearly, there is a need for coordination and

cooperation across these three tiers.  And it already occurs  to

some extent.  MCD has enlisted the support of many helping hands

by  working  closely with the VWOs.  CDCs are  doing  the  same,

particularly  with volunteer organisations in  their  respective

districts.   However,  it is the third axis,  that  between  the

Ministry and the newly established CDCs that is perhaps  not  as

strong as it ought to be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case in point is the provision of Before-and-After-School

Care services.  MCD has a plan to roll out BASCs islandwide.  It

then  invites  VWOs to indicate their interest in running  these

centres.  Most, if not all, the CDCs have similar plans to offer

BASC  services.   They too are approaching VWOs to  collaborate.

It  seems  to  me  that much duplication can be avoided  if  the

Ministry  shares its long term master plan for  BASCs  with  the

CDCs.  The implementation can then be a joint effort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the Ministry should not just share but also jointly

develop these master plans with the CDCs and possibly the  VWOs.

MCD  would  have the macro perspective of overall trends.   CDCs

would   bring   the  micro  perspective  of  local   needs   and

constraints.  Together, MCD and CDC can identify VWOs  with  the

expertise  and interest for specific projects and  support  them

with  resources.  In this way, each party is able to  add  value

according to their strengths.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach applies not just to BASCs but also to other

services  aimed  at  the  aged,  the  disabled  and  the  young.

Ultimately,  the many helping hands must work in concert  if  we

are  to  reap the greatest benefit for our community.  I  would,

therefore, like to ask the Minister what plans there are to step

up  cooperation  and  coordination with CDCs  and  VWOs  in  the

planning and implementation of the community service programmes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1692</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Community Development (Mr Abdullah

Tarmugi):   Sir, I thought I should stop the debate here  for  a

while  to  reply to some of the questions.  I am  not  too  sure

whether  I  can  finish  answering  everyone  by  the  time  the

"guillotine" for my Ministry comes into effect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday we were concentrating on the aged, but today

apparently  we have shifted to the other side of  the  fence  by

going   to   the  children.   We  have  questions  on   juvenile

delinquency, child abuse, and child care centres.  I would  like

to  start  with  Dr  Vasoo's  questions  yesterday  on  juvenile

delinquency and also Mr Shriniwas Rai's and Dr Yaacob Ibrahim's.

These three gentlemen raised some questions and concerns on  the

issue of juvenile delinquency.



<br>1.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of juvenile delinquency is a very complex

one.   There  is till now no single, quick fix solution  to  the

problem  of juvenile delinquency in any community.  And  in  any

community,  no matter at which stage of development  it  is  in,

there is the problem of juvenile delinquency.  The best approach

is a multi-disciplinary and multi-pronged one which involves the

community,  the Government, the VWOs and, most importantly,  the

parents.   So  we involve the schools, social service  agencies,

the  Police,  the community, teachers, preachers,  friends  and,

most  importantly, as I said, the parents.  At the local  level,

we  already have a network involving the different agencies.  At

the  national level, I am not too sure whether Members are aware

that   there   is  an  Inter-Ministry  Committee   on   Juvenile

Delinquency  chaired by the Minister of State for Home  Affairs.

This  Committee looks into all problems of juvenile  delinquency

which  are  brought up by the various Ministries and coordinates

the efforts of the various Ministries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two approaches which the Government takes on

juvenile  delinquency.  One, is the preventive  and  development

programmes   approach,   and,   two,   the   reinforcement   and

rehabilitative  programmes approach.   In  terms  of  preventive

programmes, we have an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1693</b></font><br><br>



intensive public education programme to make people aware of the

dangers of juvenile delinquency and also how to prevent juvenile

delinquency from happening.  We have linking of schools with MCD

and social service agencies.  We have in schools a checklist for

teachers  and also for VWOs where they can identify children  or

students who are at risk and would need help so that schools can

refer  them  to  FSCs  or  professional  social  workers  to  be

counselled.   They can be helped.  Then of course there  is  the

Before-and-After-School programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of enforcement and rehabilitation programmes, we

have  the  Guidance  Programme for  Police  Caution  Cases,  the

National  Youth  Council's Streetwise programme  and  networking

between  MCD and social service agencies to provide counselling,

support and supervision for juvenile delinquents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Yaacob asked how do we keep our children and teenagers

occupied   so   as  to  prevent  them  from  becoming   juvenile

delinquents.   As you know, there are many programmes  organised

by  the People's Association Youth Movement, the National  Youth

Council,  and  the social service agencies to keep the  children

occupied.  Even the BASCs will keep them occupied to ensure that

they  keep themselves away from bad peer influence.  And we will

be  looking  into  more  ways  to  see  how  children  could  be

distracted  from  bad peer influence into activities  which  are

wholesome and useful for them when they grow up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one interesting point which Dr Vasoo and Mr Rai

brought  up,  and that is, empowering schools to  send  children

beyond  parental  control  (BPC)  cases  to  the  Homes.   I  am

reluctant to support this and I would not want to advocate  this

proposal.   Let me explain.  If we do this, we will  run  across

problems  with differing standards of assessment by teachers  or

principals.   Some  principals may be more than  happy  to  send

their  students direct to the Homes.  But some other  principals

or  teachers may have more stringent standards; in other  words,

they will not want to send them to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1694</b></font><br><br>



the Homes.  We may have very differing standards and we may also

encourage  schools to be less stringent in trying to help  their

students  because it is an easy avenue for them to  get  rid  of

problem students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that it is not fair for us to

place this very heavy responsibility on the schools.  Whether we

like it or not, they may suffer the stigma of being sent to  the

Homes.   The thing to do is to empower the parents instead,  not

the  schools.  We must put the whole responsibility  of  looking

after  the  children  on  the parents.  Therefore,  we  need  to

reinforce  parental  responsibility.  We  have  to  ensure  that

parents get the help and the knowledge  parenting knowledge   to

look  after  their  children  and to  bring  up  their  children

properly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are avenues, Sir, in the community which parents can

turn  to.   They can go to the Family Service Centres for  help.

They  can  come to my Ministry for help, advice or  counselling.

And  if a child is really recalcitrant, the parents can lodge  a

complaint.   The parents must lodge a complaint to the  Juvenile

Court and the child may be placed under statutory supervision or

admitted  to an approved Home.  It is a serious matter before  a

child  can  be  sent to a Home.  So I do not think  we  want  to

empower  the  schools to send children direct to the  Homes.   I

think  it  is unfair to them.  Sending of children to the  Homes

should  be  a last resort, something which we would not  do  and

something which we only do after trying other ways to solve  the

child's problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai and Dr Yaacob also asked about the Boys'

Home  and measures to improve the Boys' Home.  Members must have

heard  about  the recent riot which happened in the Boys'  Home.

It  is  something  which  we did not  want  to  happen,  but  it

happened.   The  Singapore Boys' Home,  as  has  been  mentioned

yesterday, is over 100 years.  We face problems of staff.  There

is overcrowding.  But, more importantly, the profile of the boys

that  are  admitted into the Homes has changed over  the  years.

Previously,  the  number  of boys with history  of  violence  or

involvement in

violent  crimes was about 20% but now it is about half, or  50%.

In  other  words, the kinds of children and teenagers  that  are

being sent to the Homes are different.  About 90% of these  boys

have previous secret society or gang connections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the attempted break-out, MCD had further upgraded the

security of the Home because security was the immediate concern.

We  had  brought in the Prisons Department.  We had  sought  the

advice  of  the  Police on how to increase the security  of  the

Home.   We  even had to employ CISCO officers as guards because,

previously, we had only commercial guards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had some of our internal procedures reviewed and

tightened  our management and control of the boys in  the  Home.

There will be a new Home for the boys to replace the Boys' Home.

It  will be ready by the end of the year.  And in the new  Home,

we  hope  that things will be better.  The environment  will  be

better,  there will be more facilities, more space, and security

will be better.  We would also improve the staff/resident ratio.

So be assured that we have looked at the problem very carefully.

We will continue to monitor the boys there and we will see to it

that  the conditions in the new Home will be so much better than

the old one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments to the Children and Young Persons (CYP) Act are

being thought of by my Ministry.  We will be amending the Act to

include  provisions  for enhancement in the treatment  of  young

offenders and those who are beyond parental control.  There will

be  new  sentencing  options which will be  available  and  will

provide  the  courts  with  a  wider  choice  in  selecting   an

appropriate  treatment for the kinds of cases that  come  up  to

them.   In  the amendment too, we will see to it that  not  only

parents  but  also  family  members are  more  involved  in  the

rehabilitation of children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Mr Rai - I am afraid he is not here - who has offered to help review the CYP. The CYP has in fact

gone  through a lot of discussions between my Ministry  and  the

courts, the Police, the AG's Chambers and even the GPC for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1696</b></font><br><br>



Community Development.  I intend to table the amendments in this

House  later this year.  However, I would be pleased to  receive

views and suggestions from the NMP in the meantime.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai also suggested that instead of sending children to

court,  he would rather that a tribunal, similar to the Tribunal

for  the Maintenance of Parents, be set up to deal with juvenile

delinquency.  This is to divert the juveniles from the  juvenile

delinquency  system and also not to criminalise  the  boys.   We

support  the use of diversionary measures wherever possible  and

we too believe that the juvenile court should be the last resort

where  boys  should be sent to for treatment and rehabilitation.

But  we  do  not  think that a tribunal is necessary  because  a

tribunal,  as proposed, will also include a judge  and  a  judge

will  preside and thereby it would be similar to a court  or  at

least a quasi-court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NMP also suggested that there should be social workers

to  sit  with  the  judges  in  dealing  with  cases.   This  is

happening,  Sir.  In the juvenile court setup, we have  a  court

system but we also have a magistrate who sits with at least  two

members  of the panel of advisors who are laymen (not  lawyers),

who  may  be teachers and social workers to advise or  hear  the

case  together  with  the  judge.   They  serve  to  advise  the

magistrate on the possible treatment of cases and to discuss the

case with the magistrate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low also asked about the Boys' Home. I think I have

answered  some of his concerns.  He suggested that there  should

be  better programmes in the Home.  I am glad to say that in the

new  premises, there will be a classification centre  where  all

new  committals will begin their rehabilitation programme.  Each

boy  will  be  assessed by a team of officers and an  individual

treatment  plan will be designed for each inmate and a  contract

worked  out.   In  other words, there will be a  more  sensitive

classification system, so that each inmate or each committal boy

will be better looked after in that sense.



<br>1.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards staff/resident ratio, I agree with Members that

the  ratio of 1:40 for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1697</b></font><br><br>



existing  homes is simply unacceptable.  We will look into  this

and we will improve the staff/resident ratio in the new complex.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On child care centres, Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay asked

whether  there ought to be stricter control over  the  usage  of

child care centre premises.  He mentioned that some of the child

care  centres,  instead  of  administering  the  programmes   as

determined  by  my Ministry, come out with a lot  of  enrichment

programmes.  They even refuse to take in extra students  because

they  feel  that the students will not be "enriched"  enough  if

they  take in more students.  I would like to inform the  Member

that there are child care regulations which stipulate that child

care  premises  cannot be used for any purpose, other  than  the

ordinary  conduct  and  business of a child  care  centre.   Our

officers  visit these centres frequently and, in fact, there  is

an  annual report.  In other words, we have an annual assessment

of  each  centre and we use a list of criteria to  evaluate  the

centres.   The Ministry, however, does allow child care  centres

to conduct one approved enrichment programme, in addition to the

normal programme for children enrolled in the centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assoc. Prof. Low also mentioned the shortage of child care

places.   This problem apparently arises every year, that  there

are not enough places and there are long waiting lists.  But the

truth  of  the matter, as I have answered at a previous sitting,

is  that there are enough places and, indeed, some centres  have

vacancies.   The  problem is that parents want  to  choose  more

popular  centres,  and  they want to choose  preferably  centres

below their blocks.  Therefore, there are some centres which are

over  subscribed and there are other centres which are empty  or

which  have  vacancies, simply because parents  tend  to  choose

centres  which are more convenient to them or which they prefer.

So  if  we look at the child care centre situation at the  macro

level,  there are enough places.  The supply is enough  for  the

demand.  But if we look



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1698</b></font><br><br>



at  each  child  care centre, there seems to  be  some  mismatch

between what the parents want and what the centres can provide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, there are 464 child care centres providing

places  for 38,000 children.  Another 40 new child care  centres

for an additional 3,000 children will be provided this year.  We

will  continue  to provide sites.  We will continue  to  monitor

demand  and  supply and, if need be, we will continue  to  build

more child care centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin Tet Yung feels that MCD should take a more

positive  role  in  planning and coordinating the  provision  of

facilities  in  child  care centres.  Mr Zulkifli  calls  for  a

national  child  care  centre system where  Government  will  be

involved  in  the setting up and running of child care  centres.

As  of  now, actually Government is very deeply involved,  as  I

mentioned earlier, in the development of child care centres.  It

has  regulations for these centres.  It sends officers to  check

and monitor the progress of these centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD actually adopts a three-pronged approach in developing

child  care centres. First, to ensure that there is availability

and  accessibility of child care centres; second, to ensure that

child care centres are affordable; and, third, we want to ensure

the quality of the child care centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We project the demand of child care centres, review such

projections  annually,  and  we take  into  consideration  HDB's

housing  development plans in new estates.  So there is  already

close  coordination between my Ministry, HDB, URA and  the  Land

Office   in  terms  of  location  of  child  care  centres   and

availability  of  sites for child care centres in  the  estates.

HDB  will  indeed be incorporating child care centres and  other

social facilities in its building plans for new estates, and, as

far  as  possible, to have such facilities built in tandem  with

the  development of the estates in the future.  Therefore,  once

we  have  the  estates, we will have the child care centres  and

other social facilities built up at the same time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1699</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of quality, MCD ensures that there are enough

training   programmes  for  child  care  centre   teachers   and

supervisors, training programmes by accredited agencies.  We set

the  curriculum for the training to ensure standards.  MCD  also

gives training awards to those who are interested in pursuing  a

full-time  career in child care centres.  The award comprises  a

grant  for fees and allowance during the duration of the course.

And  on  completion of the course, the candidate is  allowed  to

work  in  any  child care centre.  In other words, there  is  no

bond.   The  person is not bound to work in any centre.   He  is

free  to  work in any non-profit organisation's centre or  in  a

private child care centre if he or she wants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked for tax rebate for child care courses. I

am  afraid  there  are  no such rebates, but  SDF,  I  am  told,

provides  80%  funding  for course fees,  whether  it  is  basic

course,  intermediate course or advanced course.   In  addition,

SDF  also  funds 50% of the course fees for first aid and  other

enrichment  courses.  I think there is really no  need  for  tax

rebates for people to go to child care courses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the supply of child care centres in Woodlands,

Prof. Chin commented that MCD was slow or rather sluggish in the

development  of  child  care centres in his  constituency.   The

Member  must  be aware that there are currently  12  child  care

centres providing 920 child care places in the Woodlands estate.

The  total enrolment in these 12 centres is about 90% right now,

and there are, in fact, still 50-odd vacancies in these centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the long waiting list, I have given the reasons

just  now.  They are mainly for the more popular centres in  the

ward.   Assoc. Prof. Chin may not be aware that for some  years,

Woodlands had only two centres and the utilisation of these  two

centres was actually poor.  Consequently, private and non-profit

organisations  were  actually reluctant to  set  up  child  care

centres  in the estate for some time.  Despite this, my Ministry

pushed for the development of more centres in the estate and  as

the  estate  expanded.  And within two years, between  1996  and

1997, 10 new centres became operational, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1700</b></font><br><br>



10  more  with a total of 780 places are being planned  for  the

estate.   Out  of  this number, I am told that six  are  already

under  construction  and  will be  ready  by  the  end  of  this

financial year.  If demand still exceeds supply despite all this

building,  my  Ministry will consider building more  child  care

centres in Woodlands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh See Kiat asked for more child care centres in the

workplace.   I cannot agree with him more on this.  It  is  very

important and I think it is very convenient for parents to  have

child  care  places in their workplace.  Indeed,  we  have  been

working toward this.   We have been trying to do this for  quite

sometime  now.   The  benefits of  child  care  centres  in  the

workplace  are immense.  I think nobody can argue   against  it.

It  is  mutually beneficial for the employer as well as for  the

employees.   And  it  is also good for the bottom  line  of  the

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been setting an example in this. It has

taken  the  lead in providing child care centres in  workplaces.

There  are  about  30  workplace centres in  various  Government

departments.   Actually,  there are  a  lot  of  incentives  for

companies  to  set  up  child care centres  at  their  premises.

There are financial subsidies, for example, which we give to non-profit  organisations, and which we also extend  to  firms.   In

addition,  the firms are allowed to claim expenses  incurred  in

capital  expenditure and subsidies given to employees for  child

care   as  tax  deductive  expenditure.   They  may  also  claim

industrial  building  allowance on capital expenditure  for  the

renovation and conversion of their premises.  In fact, there are

already enough incentives for firms to set up child care centres

in  their  buildings,  and  we will  continue  to  find  and  to

encourage  more  companies  to  build  such  centres  in   their

workplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Claire Chiang spoke very extensively on the disabled,

and  she made a rallying call.  I am thankful for that.  I think

MPs  at the local level can help as advisers to their grassroots

organisations.   They  can network with other  VWOs.   They  can

network with CDCs to ensure that there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1701</b></font><br><br>



are  enough help or social agencies or institutions to help  the

disabled in their constituencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has always been my Ministry's philosophy that the

disabled can live meaningful lives and can be integrated in  the

community.  In fact, they ought to be.  It is better for them to

be integrated into the community, rather than being put aside in

institutions or being hidden at home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She mentioned three areas of focus - training, employment

and  informal  support  networks.   In  terms  of  training,  we

actually have many agencies serving disabled people, which  also

run  training  programmes,  eg, Rainbow  Centre,  Down  Syndrome

Association, Singapore Association for the Visually Handicapped,

Canossian  School for the Hearing Impaired.  They have  training

programmes for disabled people.



<br>1.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the NMP that employment plays a very important

role  in  the integration of disabled people into the community.

My  Ministry, in fact, together with NCSS set up Bizlink  Centre

in 1988.  So the Centre is 10 years old now.  It is now known as

Bizlink  Centre  Singapore Limited.  It is  a  central  body  to

coordinate   employment  assistance  for  disabled  persons   in

Singapore.  It works together with the Ministry of Education and

also  the  Ministry of Labour and provides vocational assessment

and assistance and also job placements for the disabled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed the Centre's data bank has about 2,000 potential

employers  which  we can draw on to provide  employment  to  the

disabled.   We  feel  that there is scope for  Bizlink  to  work

together  with  CDCs  to  reach out to  the  community  for  job

placement/assessment of the disabled.  We  will  see  that  this

happens  and we will encourage such coordination between Bizlink

and the CDCs and the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government also funds vocational training programmes

leading  to  Certificates  of  Vocational  Training  for   Basic

Computer Applications, Office Practice



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1702</b></font><br><br>



and  Service Skills for the handicapped to ensure that they have

the skills for employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage employment of disabled persons, the Government

also  provides  financial  incentives  to  employers,  like  tax

rebates  for  modifications which they make in the workplace  to

enable the disabled to work, and for reimbursements of the first

1 1/2  months  of  the  disabled employee's salaries,  as  well  as

transport  and  food allowance, for the disabled  worker,  where

needed.   In other words, there are incentives for employers  to

employ  the disabled and we would certainly encourage  employers

to look into the disabled as a source of manpower.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector actually is the largest single employer

of  the disabled people.  As at end of last year, we have  about

224  disabled persons employed in the public sector and we  will

increase that number when we find suitable disabled to  work  in

the  civil  service.  But the greatest obstacle to the disabled,

as  I  mentioned  this afternoon, is the prejudice  against  the

disabled in the community, that existed in the community  itself

and  this is something I think we have to tackle through  public

education,  through  the  public knowing  more  about  what  the

disabled can and cannot do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also asked about the recommendations of the Advisory

Council  for  the Disabled.  It is quite a long  list,  Sir.   I

could  provide  the NMP with the list if she needs  it.   It  is

quite a long one and most of them have been implemented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to schools, where possible, disabled children

are  integrated  in  normal schools.   There  are  no  barriers,

physically,   to   the  handicapped  and   schools   have   been

cooperative.   Where there are handicapped in  the  school  they

make sure that mobility and access for the disabled are made  as

easy  as possible, where necessary and appropriate.  But we feel

that it is not always advantageous for the disabled children  to

be  sent  to  normal  school because some of them  are  mentally

disabled.  Therefore it may be better for them to attend special

schools



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1703</b></font><br><br>



instead  of  going to normal schools, where they can  be  better

looked  after,  where their needs and learning can  be  tailored

more to their level of understanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On barrier-free environment, she did mention that the BCD

has  got a Code on Barrier-free Accessibility in Buildings.   It

was I think revised in 1995.  The code requires new buildings to

have  barrier-free features such as toilets for the handicapped,

ramps with gentle slopes and kerb ramps which slope upwards from

the  road  to the building.  In other words, there is  a  gentle

slope  from the road to the building walkways instead of a sharp

angle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New buildings have to conform to the requirements of this

code  and old buildings would have to comply with these  revised

requirements  when they undergo major renovations.   HDB,  I  am

told,  has also incorporated accessibility features in  the  new

HDB  buildings  as well as existing buildings  which  are  being

upgraded in the Main Upgrading Programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the provision of ground floor units for families of the

disabled,  HDB does allocate ground floor flats where  they  are

available  and  possible for families of the disabled.   In  the

rental  flats, they are also given ground floor flats  and  also

flats  at lift landings and when they transfer their flats  they

are also given priority for ground floor units.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to sexual abuse of disabled individuals, this

is  something which we all abhor.  It is right that we feel very

strongly  against this, and I agree.  I share the NMP's  concern

about   physical  and  sexual  abuse  of  disabled  individuals,

particularly the young ones and the girls.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions in both the Children and Young Persons Act,

as  well as the Women's Charter, protect all victims from abuse,

including the disabled.  In fact, the amendments to the  Women's

Charter  provide  an  added avenue through  which  help  can  be

obtained, for example, the Charter now allows persons  to  apply

for  a protection order on behalf of an abused victim.  In other

words, for the disabled



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1704</b></font><br><br>



person who could not make any report, a protection order can  be

applied for on behalf of that person by other persons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the NMP also asked about the central registry for

disabled.   She  may want to know that there was a  Registry  of

Disabled  People  or  CRDP  which was established  by  the  then

Ministry  of  Social  Affairs in  1969.   But  there  were  some

inherent  difficulties in maintaining the  Registry  because  of

people being reluctant to report, infrequent reporting and  very

unreliable reporting.  Therefore, in 1988, the Advisory  Council

on  the  Disabled  recommended for the CRDP to be  discontinued.

But currently, I am told that welfare organisations working with

the  disabled  themselves maintain their  own  registry  of  the

disabled  who  are  under their charge  and  they  update  these

registries regularly.  So if the Member is interested in knowing

who  are  the  disabled and where they are,  perhaps  she  could

approach these organisations directly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Tsao Yuan talks about a national cohesion scheme for

women.   This is quite a different subject from what  the  other

speakers  have  been  talking  about.   But  I  agree  with  the

sentiments  about the need for cohesion.  There are avenues  for

males  but  apparently  there is none  for  females.   There  is

something about being in the trenches together, eating together,

wallowing in the mud together for National Servicemen.  They  do

set up this bond between the rich and poor, between the Hokkien,

the Cantonese and the Malay and the Indian or whatever race.  So

I  agree with the sentiments.  The question is whether NS should

be  extended to women.  This question is one which Government is

still  looking into.  It has not dismissed the idea.  But  there

are  several  issues which we need to look into very  carefully.

For  example, the reasons for having NS for women in  the  first

place.   Well,  she has given one reason, to encourage  cohesion

and  bonding  among women.  Other issues are whether  we  should

enlist  all women or some of the women, and at what level.   Who

should  be enlisted?  Which Ministry should be in charge?   What

would the enlistees do?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1705</b></font><br><br>



These are issues which have to be carefully looked into and,  as

the  Member  mentioned, the scheme ought to  be  very  carefully

formulated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to say that we shall look into her suggestions,

to  see  whether  a  modified form of National  Service  can  be

implemented  for  some women in Singapore.  But  notwithstanding

that,  NS is not the only way to bring about social bonding  and

social  cohesion  among  women.  They  could  engage  in  social

service,  they could go down to the constituencies and join  the

CDCs; they can join as Civil Defence volunteers.  They can  help

in  the  self-help groups.  Indeed there are many  opportunities

for  women to get together and help out others.  I think through

such  involvement in the community, our girls would be  able  to

interact  with Singaporeans from all walks of life and from  all

income  groups.   Besides deriving personal  satisfaction,  they

somehow  very  quickly  learn  to  understand  the  plight   and

circumstances  of the families and individuals  whom  they  work

with  and whom they help.  They are able to empathise with those

who  come  from completely different socio-economic backgrounds,

but  they  share,  nevertheless,  a  common  identity  of  being

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin talked about quality of life. The definition

of  quality of life can be very nebulous.  Different people have

different definitions of what a good quality of life is.  I grew

up  in  an urban slum, and I used to have a neighbour who was  a

hawker, who had eight children.  To all intents and purposes, he

considered his life as of good quality.  He said, "I have got no

problems.  I don't owe any mortgages.  I don't have money in the

bank  but  I  have enough to eat."  To him, quality of  life  is

good.  And yet I know of someone who earns $25,000 a month,  who

keeps  on complaining he has not got enough and that his quality

of life is somehow very rotten.  So the definition of quality of

life  indeed  can vary between one individual and another.   But

even then I agree that we should not neglect the development of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1706</b></font><br><br>



social  and  community infrastructure and  we  should  not  just

measure quality of life by material standards alone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the PM presented his ideas on Singapore 21 last year,

he  said that Singapore needs to go beyond economic and material

needs  and  reorient  society  to  meet  the  intellectual   and

emotional,  spiritual, cultural and social needs of our  people.

In  this  regard, my Ministry will continue to develop policies,

programmes  and infrastructure for individuals to  lead  a  more

meaningful and balanced life through promoting community bonding

and  social  cohesion and inculcating family  values,  promoting

voluntarism and caring for the young, the aged and the needy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of quality of life indicators, again this is

something  which  we have to think about.  We have  to  work  at

definitions.   We  have  to  work at  measurements  and  at  the

indices.  We have now on-going a survey on the state of families

in  Singapore.  It is being carried out by my Ministry.  We hope

it  will produce some important social indicators for Singapore.

If  Members have any proposals on what kind of indicators  ought

to be included in this index, my Ministry would be most happy to

receive it.



<br>2.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working hard, playing hard - that is the motto of Dr Toh

See Kiat.  In MCD, we believe in playing hard but, alas, we work

harder.  We agree that Singaporeans work hard but we also  agree

that  they  must learn to make meaningful use of their  leisure.

They  must  have  some balance in life.  In  this  respect,  the

Singapore Sports Council, which is under the Ministry, has  done

quite a lot, in terms of promoting sports at the community level

Sports for Life  and also the SPEX 2000 programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Sports for Life programme, since its

launch  in September 1996 from Sports for All programme, we  had

made a survey last year on sport participation.  It was revealed

that the percentage of regular sport participation had increased

from  24%  in 1992 to 34% in 1997, within five years, so  a  10%

increase within five years.  But what is significant is that 72%

of the participants spend more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1707</b></font><br><br>



than  45  minutes  in  each session.  This is  very  significant

because  it  shows  not only the regularity of participation  in

sports  but  also the length of each session.  And  for  72%  to

spend more than 45 minutes is indeed significant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Sports Council has launched a public

education  programme to promote the message that sports  is  not

only  fun  but  it is also beneficial to one's  fitness  and  to

oneself.   The  SSC has now embarked on a second phase  of  this

national  public  education  campaign.   The  mass  media   will

organise road shows, exhibitions, to bring home the message that

sports  is  fun, it is easy to take up and it is  healthy.   The

campaign will impress on Singaporeans that we do not have to  be

fit to take up sports but rather sports will develop fitness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to what the SSC does, PA also has many leisure

activities in the CCs.  Quite apart from sports, it  has  got  a

sea  sports  centre, karaoke, outings, dancing, barbecues,  etc.

So indeed there are many opportunities for Singaporeans to play.

Just  like  the proverbial horse which we want to  drag  to  the

waters  to  drink,  unless the horse wants to drink  nobody  can

force  it  to  drink.   Therefore, we have  enough  outlets  for

Singaporeans to play; it is up to the Singaporeans themselves to

take up these opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also wants to know statistics on children

attending counselling or children with problems.  I am afraid we

do not have the details but what we have are statistics from the

Institute of Mental Health.  According to them, there are 16,253

attendees  seeking child and adolescence psychiatric  outpatient

services  at  the child  guidance clinics.  We do not  know  the

details.  If the Member is interested, perhaps he could approach

the Ministry of Health to pursue the matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho Tat Kin proposed that we consider reaching out to the

poor  to  make  them  aware of the kinds of  services  that  are

available.  I agree with the Member of the need for us to  reach

out  to the poor.  In fact, it has been our experience, not only

in  MCD but also in self-help groups and among the VWOs that the

group  which  you  try to help is the very group  which  is  the

hardest to reach, for example, the low



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1708</b></font><br><br>



income  group.   I  am glad to say that last  year  my  Ministry

embarked on a joint project with the Marine Parade CDC  and  the

Tanjong  Pagar  CDC  to launch a public education  programme  on

social  services to reach out to households living in 1- and  2-room  HDB  flats.  In this programme, volunteers from the  CDCs,

RCs  and VWOs were enlisted to go door to door, we go and  knock

on  each  door,  literally reaching out  to  the  community,  to

explain  to  the  1- and 2-room flat residents  of  the  various

programmes  and  services that are available for  them  to  take

advantage of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry also has established a booklet entitled "We're

Just  A  Call  Away"  which  contains information  on  available

services  and  schemes which families can avail  themselves  of.

The  booklet  can  be  used by volunteers to  brief  and  advise

families.   There  are  also  two  other  publications:  one  is

"Helping  Low-income Families  The Singapore Way" and the  other

is  "Reaching  Out  - Directory of Services to  Help  Low-income

Families".   These two publications can also be used  by  social

service  providers, schools, grassroots organisations for  their

own  reference  and also for them to pass on the information  to

their residents and students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDC has also launched a National Helpline in January

this year.  This is where people can contact the CDC directly, a

one-stop information provider, as it were, for them to  ask  the

kinds  of  help available to them.  This has made things  easier

for  people.   Instead  of going to several organisations,  they

just call on this Helpline and they get all the information they

need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Dr Vasoo for lending his moral

support, again, for MCD to get more funds and also for VWOs.  He

also mentioned "compassion fatigue".  I sincerely hope that this

would  not happen because once we have compassion fatigue,  then

there go our plans for having more volunteers and more people to

care  for  others.  I do hope that compassion fatigue  will  not

occur and will not happen in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various Ministries dealing with VWOs (MCD, MOE and MOH)

are working very closely with NCSS to monitor the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1709</b></font><br><br>



impact  of the current economic downturn on social services  and

the  ability  of  the VWOs to raise funds and to anticipate  the

sort  of  support  that VWOs may need.  But VWOs  themselves,  I

think, can help themselves.  We really feel that they are  still

able  to raise funds, provided they have good programmes,  their

aims are clear and the programmes are perceived by the community

as  worthy of support.  For example, the recent President's Star

Charity  collected more than $2 million whereas last  year  they

collected only about $1 million.  So it is more than double what

they  collected.  Indeed people are still able and  they  donate

even in bad economic times like this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can also look into how they can streamline their

services  further,  review  or  re-prioritise  their  needs  and

expenditures like what the Government and the private sector are

doing.  And they may also want to consider more creative ways of

raising  funds.  Indeed, this is the time for them  to  be  more

creative,  to examine themselves and to face the whole situation

as  a  challenge for them, which can be very exciting.  And they

can look into other avenues, and more innovative ways of raising

funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to assure Members of this House that Government has

not  cut back on its budget for approved programmes run  by  the

VWOs which receive Government funding.  And Government will also

not  be cutting back on its development programme for community-based  social  services such as FSCs, child  care  centres,  and

BASCs.   In fact, there will be a 14% increase over FY97 in  the

provision  for  the development and operating  expenses  of  the

VWOs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to CDC funding, whether we can extend the 3:1

formula  to  VWOs,  if  there is a real  need  and  Members  can

convince the Minister for Finance - he is not here now - I think

he might consider the proposal very sympathetically.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On voluntarism and professionalism in social work, Mdm

Chiang  mentioned  about the need for people to  recognise  what

social  work really is.  We need both types of workers really  - the professional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1710</b></font><br><br>



social  workers and the volunteers.  Indeed, in our many helping

hands approach, we need a variety of such workers.  There  is  a

wide  range  of  services requiring a variety  of  skills.   For

example, at one end, there is the befriender type where we  need

volunteers.  There is also the more administrative duties  where

we   can   get   via   paid  staff  in  the  voluntary   welfare

organisations.  Then at the extreme end or the high end, you may

call it, where we need real professional social workers to deal,

for  example,  cases of child abuse, domestic  abuse  or  family

casework.   These  really need professional,  knowledgeable  and

skilful workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we need volunteers and we need social workers, and we

need  those in- between too.  And there is room actually  for  a

whole continuum of services to be served by these people.   They

need  different  knowledge and skills.  She is  right  that  the

public is somehow unclear about what a social worker really  is,

and  there  is this confusion also that social worker  equals  a

volunteer  equals a counsellor, equals anybody who  works  in  a

voluntary  welfare organisation.  The public is largely  unaware

of  what  social  work  actually involves,  and  that  it  is  a

professional   service   rendered  by   trained   persons   with

specialised   knowledge  and  skills  and  these   are   to   be

differentiated  from acts of charity carried out by  volunteers.

The  professionals will have an increasingly important  role  as

our  society  develops  further and the  social  service  sector

expands.   My  Ministry will help bring about better recognition

of  social workers by way of investing in training and improving

service  conditions  and public education about  what  a  social

worker really is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of training, for example, my Ministry has been

sponsoring   specialised  training  for  social  workers   which

includes training in working with family violence victims  (this

is  training  in  specific  areas  about  family  violence)  and

training   for  new  services  such  as  counselling  first-time

offenders in Police caution cases.  We are also working with the

NUS  Department of Social Work and Psychology and  with  various

training institutions to increase the specialised and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1711</b></font><br><br>



professional upgrading opportunities.  MCD's staff  itself  will

be  attending  upgrading courses to equip them with professional

skills to perform their work properly.  At the other end of  the

scale,  the  voluntary sector will also be given more  resources

for  training of the volunteers so that agencies can upgrade the

skills of the helpers and those working in the organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD is also studying how best to achieve a good standard of

practice,  especially in the most critical area of  social  work

interventions,  like child abuse and domestic  abuse.   We  will

look  into an ethical code of practice and the need to  regulate

the  practice  in  those critical areas so as  to  ensure  that,

especially in cases where the clients are vulnerable, the social

workers  who handle the cases are properly qualified, that  they

know  what  they are doing.  These are critical areas  and  this

can, in fact, either help the victims or cause more problems for

them,  if  the social workers are not knowledgeable and  skilful

enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD will also work with the Singapore Association of Social

Workers and NCSS to look into the development of the social work

sector  as a whole, in terms of manpower planning and standards.

There   is  always  the  challenge  to  attract  volunteers   in

Singapore.   We  have  found  that  somehow  people   are   more

charitable when giving donations of money because it is  a  one-time commitment.  You want $10, I give you $10; you want $50,  I

give  you $50.  But if you ask me to commit one hour a week,  it

is  a long term commitment.  So it is much more difficult to get

people to volunteer their time and energy than getting people to

donate.  But it is a challenge which we will face.  We will need

to  calibrate  carefully  between  passion  and  compassion  and

whether  there needs to be some reward for volunteers.  We  need

to  balance the two.  I know some of us really abhor the idea of

rewarding  volunteers.  And at the other end of the scale,  some

people  feel that they may be volunteers but, at the same  time,

they are human beings too.



<br>2.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question by Mr Iswaran was whether there could be

closer coordi-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1712</b></font><br><br>



nation or cooperation between the CDCs and MCD.  I would like to

assure the Member that indeed we work closely not only with CDCs

but  also  with  the  other agencies I  mentioned  earlier.   In

particular, he mentioned about the BASC programme.  MCD has  got

a Social Service Development Master Plan for BASCs, FSCs and all

the other centres.  We have met with the officers of the Tanjong

Pagar  and Marine Parade CDCs and we shared with them our Master

Plan  for BASCs, FSCs, CDCs and the other centres.  We  will  be

holding  similar sessions.  In other words, we will  be  working

together.  It is not as if we work on certain directions and the

CDCs  work  on  another.  We have regular  dialogues.   We  have

regular consultations in the planning and implementation of  our

social service facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD is currently working with the CDCs on a number of

projects, including public education on social services.  We are

also  working  with  them on the development of  social  service

facilities,  as I mentioned earlier, such as the BASCs  and  the

provision  of  services, such as food rations to the  needy  and

meals-on-wheels project.  We welcome proposals from the CDCs and

advisors  on  the services that are of priority and  which  they

feel would be needed for the community.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I

would  like to make some comments on the subject with regard  to

the  Family  Development Department in MUIS.  I  would  like  to

declare  my  interest  as  the former President  of  the  Muslim

Religious  Council of Singapore and Chairman  of  the  Committee

that  was  appointed  by  the Minister  responsible  for  Muslim

affairs  to  study and make recommendations on the  question  of

divorce.   One  of the suggestions was that there  should  be  a

special  unit  established to handle the problem.   It  has  got

close connection with the question of family development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House may still remember that at the Budget

session  last  year,  I  had stressed the  importance  that  the

Government should increase its assistance to MUIS.  The work and

responsibility  of  MUIS  in  the  development  of  the   Muslim

community in Singapore has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1713</b></font><br><br>



become so wide that MUIS should be given more opportunities  and

resources to carry out its duties.  Therefore, I am happy to see

that  the Government has allocated an increased contribution  to

the Family Development Department.  Though the provision of $1.8

million  is quite a lot I see that it is only for the  financial

year  1997.   The  Government  should  consider  increasing  its

contribution as the responsibility of this Department  is  heavy

and  important.   If it is not done through MUIS, the Government

may   assist   through   MENDAKI,  AMP  and   other   grassroots

organisations.   If  the  Government is  to  promote  this  good

effort,   MUIS  will  have  to  rely  on  the  effort   of   the

organisation.   Strategies  will  have  to  be  made  for   this

Department to increase its responsibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Sir, the relevant unit of MUIS has to

work   closely   with  AMP,  Madrasahs  and   other   grassroots

organisations  to obtain better synergy.  It is  important  that

this department together with other Muslim organisations set  up

a  network  with  other Government agencies  and  non-Government

agencies  to  utilise  the  resources available  as  the  Muslim

community is taking part in this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to congratulate the Minister for

Muslim  Affairs, Mr Abdullah Tarmugi, for showing great interest

in   the  Family  Development  Unit.   Family  is  the  core  of

individual development.  The stronger the family is, the  better

will be the opportunity for individuals to progress forward with

the other communities in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, the idea to set up a

unit  under the Islamic Religious Council (MUIS) to help  Muslim

families  to strengthen family relationship in order  to  reduce

divorce rate among them has evolved into something bigger.  Like

Mr Zainul, I think we should applaud this.  A Family Development

Department  will  now be formed to look into not  only  ways  to

reduce the number of divorces among Muslim families but to  find

ways to strengthen family values among them.  This is a move  in

the right direction as the work of the department should include

finding ways to strengthen parenting skills



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1714</b></font><br><br>



too.   I hope the Minister can enlighten Members as to the staff

strength and responsibilities given to the Department and how it

will   work   with   existing  Malay/Muslim  voluntary   welfare

organisations  in strengthening family values among  Muslims  in

Singapore  and  reduce the number of divorces.   The  department

should be given sufficient manpower and resources to achieve its

objectives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One aspect of its work that should be given some emphasis

is in the area of improving the contents and presentation of pre-marital  courses and counselling.  I found that the few lectures

that  I  have  heard over the radio sounded more like  religious

sermons  rather  than something that could appeal  to  potential

couples,  ie,  those who are planning to get married.   In  this

regard,  I  would  like to know how MUIS or the relevant  agency

assesses the effectiveness of the pre-marital courses.  How many

couples who attended the courses have divorced within the  first

five  years  of  their  marriages?   One  other  area  that  the

department should take a closer look at is how to help unmarried

Muslims,  including, if not particularly, female graduates.   In

these  two  areas,  I hope the department will conduct  thorough

studies so that the programmes that will be carried out will not

only  be suitable to Muslims but are more effective in achieving

their objectives.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, recently, NMP Dr

Lee  Tsao  Yuan  reminded  the House how  important  it  is  for

national cohesion to exist.  Her interest and concern of society

touches  on  the  question of community and religion.   We  must

ensure  that  this element will not divide the multi-racial  and

multi-religious community in Singapore.  Islam, as we  know,  is

an   important  instinct  for  the  Malay/Muslim  community   in

Singapore.  We also know that Islam encourages harmonious living

and Islam is holistic and encourages us to live in tolerance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Minister for Education, RAdm Teo Chee Hean, raised

his  concern that a number of Muslim pupils are unable to  enter

the  national school system, it  has become a topic  of  general

concern of the Muslim community.  Is the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1715</b></font><br><br>



not  happy  with  the  Muslim  students  attending  classes   at

Madrasahs?  What is the future of these Madrasahs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident it is not the policy of the Government to

put  aside the Madrasah.  Madrasah has an important role to play

and is close to the hearts of the Muslim community in Singapore.

As  we  know,  the Muslim community of Singapore has voluntarily

given $14 million for the Madrasah Aljunied in a short time  and

in  record  time.  We know the Malay/Muslim community  has  high

hopes  for their Madrasahs.  The Muslim community wants Madrasah

graduates  to  fulfil the religious needs of the  community  and

strengthen their beliefs in the religion.  The question  is  not

that the Madrasah should be there or not, but whether the system

is suitable for the Muslim community in Singapore in the context

of this multi-religious society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that the Madrasah will have its place in the

community and that MUIS and Madrasah sponsors can work  hard  to

improve  the  Madrasah.  Probably, the Minister responsible  for

Muslim Affairs, Mr Abdullah Tarmugi, can explain the mission  of

MUIS  with  regard to the development of Madrasahs.  What  steps

have  been  taken  to  ensure that not only  the  needs  of  the

teachers  are  fulfilled but the potential of each  student  who

enters  Madrasah  education  for the  benefit  of  the  national

economy?   The Madrasah should play an important role to  fulfil

the  aspirations  of the community and the nation  in  order  to

develop fully the potential of our citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the future of Madrasah, the Minister can

consider  the  establishment of a joint  committee  between  the

sponsors of Madrasahs and MUIS and the Ministry of Education  to

settle issues connected with these Madrasahs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, the question of Madrasah

education  has  been  a topic of discussion between  the  Muslim

community and the Minister for Education touching on the subject

of  500 Malay pupils each year who will not be able to enter the

national  school system.  He expressed concern  that  they  will

miss the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1716</b></font><br><br>



opportunity to obtain quality education and skills and  as  such

will  not  be able to integrate into the economy and the  social

system of Singapore in future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that some Muslims in the community have

expressed  concern  about  the  comment  of  the  Minister   for

Education on the education and job opportunities of Malay-Muslim

children  who  are  attending  normal  school.   Also  they  are

concerned  that  the  Government may take steps  to  change  the

Madrasah  education system or close the Madrasahs.  May  I  take

the  opportunity  to  ask  the Minister responsible  for  Muslim

Affairs  whether  this assumption is correct  or  not.   If  the

Government  has  no  intention of doing so,  please  express  it

clearly  and the Malay-Muslim community should accept  it  as  a

comment  and that will be a hopeful sign within the Malay-Muslim

community  that  the madrasah education system be  improved,  so

that more benefits will be obtained by its pupils and the public

in  general.  Sir, the question that I express here is  in  that

direction.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, my question is with regard to the statement made by

the  Minister responsible for Muslim Affairs earlier this  month

that  a committee comprising members and representatives of  the

madrasahs,  the Malay/Muslim community, the Majlis  Ugama  Islam

Singapura (MUIS) and the Ministry of Education will be formed to

study the question of madrasah education.  I welcome this move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The encouragement of parents to send their children to

madrasahs  is  clear. Some of them like to  see  their  children

having  alternative education, balancing secular  and  religious

education.  This is because there are six full-session madrasahs

which  are  having subjects with regard to secular and religious

education.   Some of the parents like their children  to  become

Muslim  teachers  and  scholars, and  it  is  the  hope  of  the

Malay/Muslim  community locally that religious educated  leaders

should have the highest education possible.  However, the  point

is  that  about 10%-15% of each cohort of standard one  madrasah

are able to go for higher



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1717</b></font><br><br>



learning.  What about the fate of students who are not  able  to

continue  with   higher education?  Will  they  have  the  basic

educational  needs  to enable them to follow courses  in  skills

required  by  the economy so that they have the  opportunity  of

higher employability?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know the type of investments that will be brought into

Singapore  in  the  future  will be those  concentrated  in  the

production  of  component  parts and  high-tech  goods,  whereas

labour  intensive  industries will be leaving Singapore  one  by

one.   In  short,  how can the madrasah be able to  improve  its

service  to the Malay/Muslim children so that they are  prepared

for  the  job  market?   It is important  that  the  economy  of

Singapore is knowledge-based.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a full report on madrasah education was published in

the  Straits Times  and it reflected clearly the views that have

been raised by Malay/Muslim leaders with regard to improving the

prestasi  or  performance of madrasah education to children  and

the  public  at  large.  First, the concern of the  Malay/Muslim

community   is  that,   with  the  cooperation  of  the   Muslim

community,  the  Government  should make  the  madrasah  mission

schools use the curricula approved by the Ministry of Education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, start full-time madrasahs beginning with secondary

school level, so that all students could follow the same primary

level  basic  education before they make the choice for  further

education in madrasahs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, upgrade the quality of the week-end madrasahs so

that  more  parents  will  be able to  send  their  children  to

participate  in  religious education while such students  attend

formal school as far as they can attain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will give his views and inform the

House  concerning MUIS' efforts in helping in the management  of

upgrading  the  quality  of education  offered  to  Malay/Muslim

children and also in upgrading the work capability during  their

working life.  To what extent can the Ministry of Education help

to upgrade?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1718</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, I will be brief. I want to ask the

Minister what improvements is he making to the scheme of service

in order to attract staff to his Ministry.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, I will be equally

brief.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Sports Council has done a very good job and

it  has  been transformed.  But I understand from many  National

Sports  Associations  that they are all running  into  financial

difficulties.  They have a lot of good and great plans, but they

need  funds.   Could the Minister please go to the Minister  for

Finance  and ask for more money in order to ensure that  we  can

put  SPEX  2000,  Sports for All, Sports for  Life  and  Healthy

Lifestyle in place?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I

will  be  very brief.  I would just like to ask the Minister  on

the  Sports  Excellence  2000 scheme  of  the  Singapore  Sports

Council  which  has been implemented for the  last  five  years,

costing  about $10 million a year.  Have we attained the targets

that we have set and is there any further plan?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I must declare that I am the President of the

Singapore  Basketball  Association (SBA).    The  SBA  has  been

holding  all  its  tournaments at the  Geylang  Indoor  Stadium,

formerly known as Gay World Stadium or Happy World Stadium.   If

you  happen  to  pass by the Geylang Indoor  Stadium,  you  will

notice  that the stadium is exactly the same as it  was  in  the

50s.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is that many people are saying that basketball

is  a game played predominantly by the Chinese-educated.  So why

should  the Government look after them?  But why do people  have

this  sentiment?   I think the Sports Council should  take  some

responsibility  for this perception.  Why can  the  SSC  not  do

something to upgrade the stadium?  If the site is earmarked  for

development, then the stadium should be demolished.    If   not,

then  something should be done to spruce up this  stadium  where

all  major basketball tournaments are held, so that  it will not

give  people  the  impression that since  basketball  is  played

predominantly by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1719</b></font><br><br>



Chinese-educated, the Government will not  look  after  it.    I

think the Singapore Sports Council should do something about it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sinnakaruppan, I think you have to be

brief too.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I just want

to take a few minutes to speak up for soccer fans in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For generations now, soccer fans from all over the world

follow  the  English League with great enthusiasm and  interest.

In England, in every reasonably big town, there is a soccer club

named after the town, and the soccer club is rallying behind the

town  in  order to get the people to bond together.  The  people

follow  the fortunes of the club, and win or lose, they  support

the club and there is a bonding in the town.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have started the S-League. We now have 11

soccer  clubs in the S-League, and we have eight CDCs, following

the  idea of our Prime Minister.  The time has come that we have

to  use sports, particularly soccer, to link and bond people  in

the CDCs.  My suggestion to the Minister is to link these 11  S-League clubs to the respective eight CDCs.  In some CDCs,  there

may  be  more  than one club.  For example, in Manchester,  they

have  Manchester City and Manchester United.  In the  same  way,

for  example,  Central Singapore, we can  have  Home  United  in

Bishan and Balestier in Kreta Ayer-Tanglin.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already started linking these clubs and CDCs at our

central CDC, thanks to our Chairman.  I understand Tanjong Pagar

has done so and Marine Parade has done so.  I would like to urge

the Minister to extend it and make it a comprehensive network so

that this process of community bonding can be expedited.  And as

a  by-product, we could also change the names of  the  clubs  to

link it to the satellite towns or the name of the CDC's.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I will

try  and  make it short.  I want to talk about multi-culturalism

from the point of view of self-help groups.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1720</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to give my praise for the success of self-help groups to increase ethnic identity, consciousness and

self-esteem  of Singaporeans.  But, more important, the  success

of  these  self-help  groups  is based  on  feelings  of  ethnic

communities that are receiving the kind of services more  suited

to  the  problems  they experience.  Based on group  membership,

this can bring about other problems.  I am concerned about these

problems  and  I  think we need to have CDCs to do  more  multi-cultural  programmes.  Because the experiences in some of  these

countries  which  practise assimilation of different  races,  we

have  now seen the problems, racial tension and unease in  times

of  economic turmoil.  So we cannot assume that we will not have

that problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we need to do more to develop the growth of a

multi-cultural society, especially among our children.   Because

I  think  and  believe the normal way of thinking,  feeling  and

behaving,  when begun at an early age with children,  contribute

to  a culturally sensitive atmosphere that is needed for all age

groups  in  Singapore.  So I urge that more be done  to  promote

multi-culturalism in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I would like to take the question

of madrasahs  first, because I think it is important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, madrasahs are important and established institutions

in all Muslim communities.  They are primarily set up to provide

religious education for Muslim children and to prepare those who

wish to pursue vocations such as religious teachers, leaders and

scholars in madrasahs, mosques and Muslim organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government understands the importance of madrasahs to

the  Muslim  community, and would like to assure  the  community

that  it  is not the intention of Government to stop  them  from

continuing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the madrasah system is not without its concerns

and problems, and the community must be prepared to make changes

to  overcome these problems and concerns.  One is as pointed out

by   Mr  Hawazi  on  the  issue  of  employability  of  madrasah

graduates.  As mentioned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1721</b></font><br><br>



earlier,  madrasahs will have to produce religious teachers  and

leaders required by the Muslim community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not all madrasah graduates have the inclination or

ability to go on to become religious teachers and scholars;  nor

do  we  need  all the graduates of madrasahs to  go  into  these

vocations.   This  means that those who do  not  go  into  these

vocations  or   who  fail to complete  their madrasah  education

will have to secure other employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS will continue to revamp the madrasah curricula to

enhance  the teaching skills of teachers and also to  strengthen

the management and administration of madrasahs.   Apart from the

existing   core  curriculum  of  religious  subjects,   English,

Mathematics  and  Science  are also  taught  in  madrasahs.   IT

literacy  programme will also be introduced in  madrasahs.   The

curriculum time and subject combination will be revised to  meet

the  dual needs for a trained workforce and a qualified pool  of

religious  workers  for the community.  More  students  will  be

encouraged to sit for the `O' and `A' level examinations.    And

these   measures,   hopefully,  will  help   to   increase   the

employability of madrasah graduates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS is also looking into the streaming of students at the

primary  level,  so  that  weaker students  can  be  given  more

attention.   This, together with better trained  teachers,  will

help  to  reduce the high attrition rate in madrasahs, which  is

another concern about the system mentioned by Mr Hawazi.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul may be pleased to know that National Education

will  be incorporated in the madrasah system.  An MOE-MUIS joint

committee  on  National Education has been formed to  study  and

help  the implementation of NE in madrasahs.  MUIS has  met  the

madrasahs  and  they  have supported  the  inclusion  of  NE  in

madrasahs,   which  also  plan  to have  joint  programmes  with

mainstream  schools as a way of enhancing the common Singaporean

identity.  These and other measures mentioned earlier will  help

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1722</b></font><br><br>



bring   the   madrasahs  in  tandem  with  national  needs   and

aspirations, as proposed by the Member.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me touch briefly again on the question by Dr Vasoo

about  what are we doing about the service conditions of  social

workers.   The Ministry, as I mentioned earlier in my answer  to

Madam  Claire Chiang, is looking into how the service conditions

of  the  social workers can be improved.  Because we  know  that

they  do  onerous jobs and we know that we are really  competing

for  manpower  against  the other industries.   So  we  will  be

looking into how we can improve their service conditions and  we

will  also  be looking into their training needs, as I mentioned

earlier.



<br>2.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On sports, I wish to thank Mr Choo Wee Khiang for

complimenting us on what we did for Toa Payoh Stadium.  We  have

air-conditioned the stadium and I think the table tennis players

now  are  playing  in a much more comfortable  environment  than

previously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards to funds for the NSAs, we are always looking at

how  we  can  help  the NSAs.  But the NSAs will  also  have  to

convince  and  show  us that they are running  the  Associations

properly and they have a proper management system.  So  we  will

be  looking into these criteria and we will extend all the  help

that we can.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the problem of Gay World Stadium, the area is going to

be  redeveloped and, therefore, it is on annual TOL.  So we feel

that it is not economical for us to upgrade the stadium.  But we

have done something to the seating and whatever improvements  we

can,  but we thought it would not be economical for us to invest

too  much funds to upgrade the stadium.  I hope the Member  will

understand  what we can and cannot do to upgrade or improve  the

Gay  World  Stadium.  It is not because basketball is played  by

Chinese school students and therefore we are neglecting it.   It

is  because  of  the  circumstances which surround  the  stadium

itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On CDCs and S-League, yes, we agree with the sentiments of

Mr Sinnakaruppan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1723</b></font><br><br>



about  bonding  and  the  ability  of  football  and  sports  to

encourage bonding among citizens.  We encourage the adoption  of

S-League teams by CDCs.  Marine Parade CDC has done it.  Central

CDC  and  also  Tanjong  Pagar CDC have done  it,  and  we  will

continue  to promote the idea to all the CDCs.  But  really  the

decision  would  have to be on the CDCs themselves  and  on  the

teams.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the change of names of teams, I leave it to

the  teams themselves, whether they want to call themselves  the

"Tanjong  Pagarers"  or "Marine Paraders",  instead  of  calling

themselves the "Cobras" and the "Stallions" or whatever.  But we

are  supporting the idea itself and we will certainly  encourage

other CDCs to do the same.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> If the CDCs adopt these soccer clubs,

will  they be eligible for the $1 to $3 grant?  Next year, legal

betting will be on, and it will not be a problem, but what about

this year?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> I have just got a ready "No" from Mr

Wong  Kan Seng.  We will leave it to the CDCs because it is  not

MCD which administers the funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reply to Mr Zulkifli's question about multi-culturalism. I fully agree with the need for the self-help

groups  to  see beyond the community.  And really the  important

thing  is the leadership of these organisations.  The leadership

must  see  the importance of going beyond their own  communities

and  seeing  themselves  as part of the whole  of  the  national

population rather than as a small community which looks  inwards

into themselves.  I have encouraged joint programmes between the

self-help groups and the CDCs.  They have in fact come up with a

joint  project of setting up a family service centre  or  social

service centre which is at one of the CCCs in Toa Payoh.  So  we

will  try to encourage more of these joint programmes among  the

self-help groups.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar):</b> I thank the Minister for

his reply.  If we recognise the importance of sports, I think he

should  consider re-naming his Ministry to "MCDS",  Ministry  of

Community Development and Sports.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, as usual, Members have stretched their

have  covered  as much as possible and we look  forward  to  the

service  sector.  With that note, I would like  to  withdraw  my

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this year's budget, the Government has provided a total

sum  of  $5,700 million for expenditure on education.   This  is

made  up of $3,785 million for operating expenditure and  $1,915

million  for development expenditure.  The total expenditure  on

education  constitutes 3.6% of GDP and 20% of  total  Government

expenditure.  For every $5 that Government spends,  $1  goes  to

education.   I  wish to commend the Government  for  giving  top

priority  to  education.  The Government  has  not  allowed  the

present  regional financial crisis to affect our  focus  on  the

long term competitiveness, growth and development of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, brain power is the basis for Singapore's success today

and the spring-board of our prospects tomorrow.  If we look back

on  our  lives,  we  can remember fondly the teachers  who  have

affected  us.   We  will readily attribute our  development  and

achievements  to  those beloved teachers  who  had  excited  our

imaginations  and set us on the path which we have  subsequently

followed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1725</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is a human enterprise. It is people, teachers,

students,  administrators and parents, who make  the  difference

between  success and failure in our school system.  But teachers

are  the key.  Teachers open the door to new knowledge and moral

values.   Teachers  are  at the forefront of  implementation  of

school and educational policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the classrooms, teachers wield considerable influence on

the  students  in  the  way they teach  and  behave.   There  is

definitely  a  link  between  teacher-effectiveness  and  school

performance.   The  planned changes in  the  National  Education

programme,  information  technology,  creativity  and   thinking

skills  and curriculum review, will not be successful if  we  do

not  have  the  support  and commitment of  the  teachers.   The

teachers must be persuaded to own the new approaches in teaching

methodology, instructional materials and assessment  modes.   We

have  to  find  new  and  better ways  to  involve  teachers  in

empowering  them  to  enhance their work performance  and  bring

about  the  desired  outcomes  in  our  students.   Perhaps  the

Minister  can  give  us an update on the progress  made  in  the

implementation of the key initiatives of the Education Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education has done much in recent years to

improve  the  salaries and conditions of service  for  teachers.

The  anticipated  slower growth of the economy may  require  the

civil  service to either freeze or moderate the salary increases

of  public sector employees.  I hope the Ministry will  consider

carefully  whether  any  wage restraint exercise  in  the  civil

service should be extended to those in the Education Service.  I

believe  that  there is still some catching  up  to  do  in  the

remuneration  package of the teachers.  Now is a good  time  for

our  teachers  to  be recognised and rewarded  with  competitive

salaries, promotion and career development opportunities.   This

will enhance the status of teachers in our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the salaries and fringe benefits, there are other

aspects of the job that can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1726</b></font><br><br>



uplift  the morale of the teachers.  Teacher-principal  relation

is  important.  The transfers and postings of principals to  new

schools  should be better planned and communicated to  teachers,

students  and parents.  Teachers are affected by the  leadership

and   competencies  of  principals  in  making  firm  and   fair

decisions.   Teachers  are  also  affected  when  they  perceive

inequitable distribution of workload assigned by the  principal.

Teachers  also  lament that they have to take on  administrative

and  clerical work at the expense of their teaching  roles.   We

should  build  and develop more trusting relationship  and  team

spirit  among  principals  and  teachers  in  our  school.   The

Ministry  has already provided school administrators in  schools

and  launched  the School Clusters Scheme.  I wish  to  ask  the

Minister  on the improvements made towards achieving  excellence

in  the management of our schools.  Perhaps it is also time  for

the  Ministry  to  seriously  consider  the  setting  up  of   a

Principals  College to train and develop potential  talents  and

those already holding the principal's position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Ministry's budget, 511 temporary and relief staff

positions  have  been done away with.  Does  it  mean  that  the

positions have been regularised and made permanent?  In the  new

financial year there is the need to recruit 1,750 teachers.   We

need  highly  committed and dedicated individuals  to  join  the

teaching profession.  With the recent large intakes of  new  and

younger  teachers, I would imagine that the median age  and  the

average  length of service of teachers will be  lower.   We  may

have  better  educated and more knowledgeable  teachers,  but  I

wonder  whether they have the necessary experience and  maturity

to  handle,  for  example,  the teenage  students  in  secondary

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that we are short of English Language

teachers.  This has affected the general performance of students

in the "O" level examinations in English Language.  What are the

Ministry's  plans in attracting and retaining very good  English

Language teachers in our schools?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say (Tanjong Pagar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, there

is a Chinese saying,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1727</b></font><br><br>



"If  you  are my teacher for a day, I will respect you like   my

father  for my whole life time".  This saying reflects how  much

respect students in the old days had for their teachers.  It  is

also said that a successful teacher would have students all over

the  world.  This saying affirms the social status of  teachers.

With  the changes of time, students are difficult to teach, even

parents  are  harder to handle and the pressure on  teachers  is

increasing  day  by  day.  The question of how  to  improve  the

morale of teachers is a great challenge.  There are four reasons

for  this.  One, generally parent's educational level is  higher

and   therefore   their  expectations   on  the   teachers   are

correspondingly higher.  As a result, their respect for teachers

also  correspondingly  declines  and  some  even  criticise  the

teachers  and interfere with their methods of teaching  --   and

this is a big blow to the dignity of our teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in the past, teachers enjoyed a very high social

status.  Society generally respected the teachers and emphasised

on  morals.  Now, the number of children in the family is  small

and parents both go to work.  Accordingly, their way of bringing

up  children  is  different and this again further  weakens  the

students' respect for their teachers.  On the other hand,  there

is  this  problem  of knowledge explosion and so  the  teachers,

students and parents have to do all they can in the pursuit  and

transmission of knowledge and therefore the question  of  stress

on morale also begins to decline in the minds of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, with the advancement in science and technology, it

is  difficult  for us to catch up with the time, especially  for

the  older  teachers  who  will find it  more  difficult.   Some

teachers,  particularly  the  older  ones,   have  developed   a

technology  phobia.   In fact, technology itself  is  making  it

difficult  for  us to catch up with the times.   Especially  for

older  teachers, they will find it more difficult.  And so  some

teachers  are  beginning to take courses  to  learn  the  latest

technology available to us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the syllabi and curricula of schools have also

been  changing  all  the  time.   Now,  apart  from  the  normal

curricula and syllabi, the teachers have to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1728</b></font><br><br>



look after National Education, thinking and creativity, computer

teaching,  etc.   As a result, they are highly stressed  in  the

classroom and they really crave that they can have "three  heads

and  six  arms".  That shows how much pressure  is  put  on  the

teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the teachers have to upgrade themselves to catch

up  with the latest technology.  On the other hand, the pace  of

the schools is on the move all the time and they may well suffer

the   "fatigue  syndrome".   If  we  do  not  face  up  to  this

phenomenon, it will only worsen the morale of the teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In last year's Budget, I really appreciate the Minister's

vision.   The Minister for Education has stressed the importance

of  professional  training  and it has  also  committed  to  the

upgrading of teachers in their skills.  I hope that the Ministry

of  Education can go one step further to give the teachers  more

support.  This will not only improve their salaries and  service

conditions, but more importantly, they must go a step further to

improve  the social status of teachers, and the kind of  respect

they  used  to enjoy in the past.  We must affirm the  teachers'

position  so  that  they can develop their  professionalism  and

teach our next generation better.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, schools

in  Singapore  are  well-equipped with first class  hardware  in

terms of school buildings, classrooms,  computers, teaching aids

and  other facilities.  Our students enjoy studying in  a  high-tech  and  comfortable  environment.   However,   in  terms   of

software, we are quite inadequate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about having "thinking school" and creativity,

having  good   hardware  is  not  enough.   Creativity  is   not

something that you can learn in the classroom.   Creativity must

be inculcated through experience in the reality of life.  If you

want  to  catch the light at the end of the tunnel, you must  be

prepared  to go through the dark passage in life, work hard  and

persevere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong urged the parents and students

not to narrowly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1729</b></font><br><br>



pursue more "A" grades, and neglect the importance of moulding a

perfect character.  I fully agree with him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest mission of education is to cultivate the

students  through the five aspects of education, namely,  moral,

intellectual,  physical, community and aesthetic  education,  so

that  they can mould a perfect character on the basis  of  moral

values,   knowledge,  physical  fitness,  social  concept,   and

aesthetic appreciation.    Only in this way can  we assure  that

the future generations of Singaporeans are capable of playing  a

more  important  role when our nation faces  greater  challenges

ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of this principle, I appeal to the Ministry

of Education to include the behaviour and conduct of students as

part  of  the  criteria for admission to secondary  schools  and

institutes  of  higher  learning.   So  students  with  slightly

inferior  academic results, but have good "A" or "B"  grades  in

their  conduct  marks,  can  also have  the  opportunity  to  be

admitted  to  the better secondary schools, junior  colleges  or

universities.  This will indirectly encourage students and their

parents  to attach more importance to seek perfection  in  their

character.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also call upon all the schools to set up an

"Excellent  Conduct Award" for every standard  and  every  class

each  year.   We  should not put our emphasis only  on  academic

results.   Excellence  in  conduct  and  behaviour  is  just  as

important.   By  focusing on how many "As"  and  neglecting  the

conduct  of the students is an imbalance in the whole  education

system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a large extent, the conduct of students is influenced by

the  school environment, the words and deeds of the teachers and

the  principal.  This is what the Chinese described as  wei  ren

shi  biao (be a model of virtue for others).   Recently, I  read

in  the  newspaper a real-life story of how a group of secondary

one  students  of  the Class of 63 in Thomson  Secondary  School

inserted an advertisement in the newspaper, some 34 years later,

to look



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1730</b></font><br><br>



for  a certain teacher whom they were very fond of but had  lost

contact  with.    They  found the teacher and  had  a  memorable

reunion.   I  was very touched by this report.  I  do  not  know

whether the Minister has read this report in the newspaper.   If

he has not, I can supply him with the relevant cuttings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that to mould the perfect character of the students,

the  responsibility must lie squarely with the principal and the

teachers.   Credit must also be given when it is  due.  I  would

therefore  suggest  that the Ministry of  Education  set  up  an

"Engineer  of  the  Soul  Award" to show appreciation  to  those

principals  and teachers who have worked their hearts  out  with

perseverance and dedication to education throughout their  whole

life-time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I try to remember the good teachers I had the good

fortune  of  coming under during my 10-odd years in  school,   I

cannot hardly count  beyond my five fingers.  So if we do not do

something to encourage these good teachers, how are we going  to

build  the good character of our students?  I think it would  be

very  difficult.   So  I  hope the Ministry  of  Education  will

consider my two suggestions above.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, we enjoy an excellent

education system that we can be proud of.  For a small nation,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1731</b></font><br><br>



our students have done well, often times performing better in

international examinations and surveys than their counterparts

from larger and more developed countries.  Credit must go to our

teachers and students.  However, in a very rapidly changing

world, our education system must continue to change to keep

abreast of the fast changing time, better still we should strive

to move ahead of new requirements.  But this is no easy task.

For what we are seeking to do to our education system is not to

repair a defective one but to make a good system better and more

suitable for a demanding and uncertain future.  This is a

difficult task which carries heavy responsibilities and requires

much care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education has done very well in bringing

change to the education system.  One area that deserves mention

is for the efforts to improve the management of our schools.

Several innovative management initiatives like school cluster

and the appointment of administrative assistants and operation

managers have been introduced.  I was proud to read that the UK

introduced the cluster school management concept at the end of

1997, long after we had implemented it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our teachers are a critical educational resource. Good

management of our schools is crucial to draw out the potential

in our teachers.  Good managers motivate their staff and bring

out the best in them.  I would recommend that principals adopt a

more business management approach towards running their schools.

Principals should therefore be introduced to modern management

knowledge and techniques used in business, especially in the

area of human resource management.  I believe the business

schools in our universities can help in this task.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent salary adjustments, promotion exercise and

greater flexibility and opportunities to upgrade themselves have

been great morale boosters to the teachers.  They are better

motivated when the Ministry is responsive to their needs.  They

feel that the Ministry cares about them and has their interest

in mind.  The public will also view the teaching profession with

greater and higher regard. With all these changes, I look forward

to greater motivation and a higher morale



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1732</b></font><br><br>



among our teachers, students and parents and

better performance and discipline from our students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now touch on the courses that the Ministry has

introduced to upgrade our teachers.  The Ministry has introduced

many innovations like IT and new teaching and assessment methods

into our schools.  It is vital that our teachers are properly

trained and equipped to handle these innovations.  The Ministry

has introduced many training courses, including IT courses, to

impart these new skills and knowledge to our teachers.  The

efficacy of these courses depends on the implementation of the

training programme.  I hope that the Ministry will look into

ways to make the implementation process more effective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some feedback which may be of help. Teachers have

expressed three areas of concern, namely, the course schedule,

the course content and the use of the newly acquired knowledge

and skills.  Teachers, generally, have difficulties juggling

their training schedule with a full load of teaching duties.

Some principals have helped by rescheduling activities and

others have given their teachers time off to attend training.

The support of the principal is crucial.  Teachers want their

principals to understand their difficulties and to show support

for training, both in words and deeds.  Secondly, teachers

quickly lose their newly acquired knowledge and skills if these

are not put to use.  Teachers have to use the new knowledge and

skills in order to deepen their understanding of it and to

internalise it.  They must be encouraged and given opportunities

to do so.  If this is not done, they will quickly forget what

they learn.  It will be a case of training for training's sake.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the course content. Some teachers found

the courses too theoretical.  They prefer to start with

practical courses which they can use immediately.  They can move

on to intermediate and advanced level courses after they have

gained some experience and confidence with the new technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now move on to the needs to reduce the course

content to make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1733</b></font><br><br>



learning  easier  and  more efficient  for  our  students.   Our

children work very hard in schools.  The result of their  effort

is good grades and success.  In the future where information and

knowledge decide the outcomes of competition, our students  must

also  acquire the ability to think more and to be more  creative

and  innovative.  Our students must therefore continue to  score

in   their   examinations  while  becoming  more  creative   and

innovative  in  their thinking process.  At the same  time,  one

should not be achieved at the expense of the other.  This is  no

easy  task.  If we do not do it right, our students will  become

more  stressed  out.  One way is to help our students  to  study

more  efficiently.  With interconnected computers, there is less

need  to memorise volumes of information which has grown rapidly

over  the years, partly also a consequence of IT.  But no matter

how  easily accessible facts and information become, each  child

must still acquire a core set of facts, knowledge and skills  in

order  to  make  use of the volume of information  that  can  be

accessed on the network.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning can be made easier if we pare down the volume of

information to this core of facts and knowledge that we need to

teach our students.  This will free time in the curriculum for

other activities which can be organised to help develop their

thinking, creative and innovative skills.  I have been told that

the Ministry is already doing this and in some subjects, they

have been able to scale down the content by as much as 30%.  I

would like the Ministry to make more urgent efforts in this

area.  We should make more use of the Internet as a teaching

tool and its vast store of information as educational resources.

We should thus give our students better and easier access to the

Internet.  Our students therefore need to be proficient in the

use of information technology.  In the new millennium, every

student who misses the opportunity to be computer literate will

be handicapped.  We must not delay the IT programme to equip our

schools with computers for our students to work on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1734</b></font><br><br>



and to imbue our teachers with the resources and skills to teach

with the computer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to add that preparing teaching materials

and resources is a time consuming and tedious process.  For

teachers new to the technology, it is in fact also a daunting

and intimidating task.  I would like the Ministry to consider a

centralised effort to produce such teaching materials and

resources to assist the teachers.  Such a centralised body would

allow teachers to seek help, especially when they start to use

IT in their work.  The use of common syllabi in our schools

makes a centralised effort practical and feasible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, let me touch on the topic of technical

education and the Institute of Technical Education (ITE).  Four

of every 10 of our young will not go to the polytechnic or

universities.  They will go to work or proceed to the Institute

of Technical Education where they will acquire practical skills

needed by our companies.  The first batch of the Normal

(Technical) stream students has completed their secondary

education.  Some of these students have come to seek my help to

get them into ITE courses.  I hope that this is an indication

that our students have accepted ITE as an educational path.

However, the shortage of places suggests that IT has some work

on its hand to either re-allocate its teaching resources to the

more popular courses or to sell the less popular but  important

courses to the students.  As the first batch of Normal

(Technical) students has passed through the portals of our

schools and ITE, I would like the Ministry to update and apprise

the House of the progress made by students in the Normal

(Technical) stream and ITE in providing technical education to

our young.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, I would like to make two

suggestions to the Minister.  One, is to introduce education

programmes, especially for parents, to make them better and more

effective tutors at home and, two, to provide a more flexible

and accessible training programmes for teachers in recognition

of the great demand placed on our teachers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1735</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent study conducted by the AMP involving some 2,004

Malay/Muslim workers, it was found that Malay/Muslim parents now

have much higher aspirations for their children in education.

61% of them want their children to obtain at least a polytechnic

diploma.  That is the good news.  In fact, more parents want

their children to obtain higher degrees like Masters and PhDs.

The result of this survey was in fact recently published in the

Berita Harian.  But the not-so-good news is that, of this 61%,

more than half of the parents are uncertain of ways to help

their children to succeed academically.  I am sure a lot more

are incapable of teaching, guiding or tutoring their children at

home.  While I do not have any empirical evidence of the

situation in other communities, I believe there is some

relevance here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was extremely disturbed by these statistics. It has

taken this country and community so much and for so long to give

parents the hope, promise and optimism and the feeling that in

Singapore, despite differences in race, language, religion and

income group, their children have equal opportunities to

progress and achieve the desired academic success.  But there is

a danger that parents may become frustrated and disappointed if

they continue to feel helpless to assist and guide their

children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have discussed this matter with a number of parents and

found that even those with tertiary education have some problems

understanding, let alone tutoring their primary school children

in Mathematics.  Some, for example, especially among the more

affluent, have found it necessary to attend special classes

organised to guide and help parents on ways and methods of

tutoring their children.  Many of these parents have discovered

that the methods and concepts taught in school today are alien

to many of them.  Quite naturally, some of these parents see

tuition as the only solution to these problems.  In fact, some

of them feel inadequate if their children are not getting enough

tuition compared to their peers.  This brings about a host of

other problems, namely, stress, excessive workload, complaints

of high tuition fees.  I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1736</b></font><br><br>



think we should not allow parents to feel that the academic

achievement is dependent upon the amount of tuition that

students get.  Parental guidance and help are more significant

factors.  I am therefore suggesting to the Minister to structure

a programme to prepare and equip parents so that they can play

an effective role as teachers and tutors at home.  Self-help

groups can also have such programmes by making parents the

facilitators in their children's education.  We must demonstrate

and emphasise that the teaching and education of our children is

as much the responsibility of parents as it is for teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on another point that was raised by

some other Members earlier and that is with regard to teacher

training.  I would like to ask the Minister on the type and

scope of training that teachers receive in order to keep pace

with increasing demands placed on them.  I sympathise with the

teachers who are under tremendous pressure from parents and

society to produce and nurture creative, disciplined, well-rounded, eloquent, IT literate students with the right moral and

national values.  It is a very difficult task indeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But teachers do need training in all these matters,

including IT skills, problem solving and many others.  It  would

indeed  be  very  difficult for the Ministry to provide  such  a

diverse  range  of  training for teachers through  its  in-house

training  programme.   I  personally  would  like  to  see  more

teachers  attending privately run seminars and  conferences  and

hope   that   teachers  are  given  greater  accessibility   and

flexibility  to  attend  such courses.   Perhaps,  through  such

interaction,  we can enhance the profile and image  of  teachers

and instill greater understanding amongst parents and society at

large  of  the  huge responsibilities and pressure our  teachers

shoulder.



<br>3.45 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, it is easy to think of ways to spend

money  to  build  good  schools and  provide  the  hardware  for

schools,  like  computers and the sort of  equipment  that  they

need.  These can all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1737</b></font><br><br>



be  listed  out.   I  think it is important to  talk  about  the

software  that goes into the schools, the children and  what  we

put into their minds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, creative people are divergent thinkers. They tend to

come  to different conclusions from the majority of us.  I  have

read somewhere that Thomas Edison, for example, was deaf in  one

ear, because he had been boxed as a child for misbehaviour.   We

have  got  a  society that tends to, they say, build  conformist

patterns  in  children, and this is a clear  way  of  destroying

creativity  of people who are divergent thinkers.  Children  who

act differently, think differently or give different answers are

looked  upon  as  being too smart, too big for  the  shoes  and,

therefore, punished and suppressed in normal schools.   I  think

we need to think of ways of changing that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools are also burdened with all sorts of programmes.

Many  of  these programmes are, of course, introduced with  good

intentions,   with  well-meaning  purposes.   But   when   these

programmes are implemented in schools, they are done  in  rather

unthinking  ways.  There are all sorts of enrichment programmes,

programmes  that  teach  children  IT,  programmes  that   teach

children  who  are bad in their mother tongue to pick  up  their

skills, remedial classes, even community service hours for  them

to  learn how to serve others.  Our children are very, very busy

people.   They have so many things to do.  Sir, I wonder whether

the  schools  actually do think carefully of  how  to  implement

this, whether the schools give the rationale to the children, so

that  the  children grow up learning why they  are  doing  these

things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thinking schools, we need to reduce the academic load

somehow,  because there is this irresistible desire for  schools

(and  parents,  I  suppose, pressuring  the  schools)  to  teach

primary  6 work, for example, in primary 4.  And drill  for  GEP

aptitude test.  I think this is ridiculous.  Creating needs time

to  think.  Play aids creativity.  I think we need to give  back

to our children time to play, time to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1738</b></font><br><br>



children,   time  to  do  things  that  fill   up   their   time

meaningfully.  And not just to see that if there  is  some  time

left, they must not be given time to be idle, let's fill it  up.

So  we  have  teachers and parents who have this temptation  and

they say, "Well, you have got a long weekend ahead.  Chinese New

Year  is coming, many days of holidays, I think you need  to  do

some  homework."  And then piles of homework are given to  them.

How  do  they enjoy their long weekends and holidays then?   And

how do we give them time to play and learn to be creative?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think creativity perhaps needs to be nurtured, but I

wonder  whether  creativity can be taught.  How  would  creative

teachers  be identified?  Because if creativity can  be  taught,

surely they must be taught by creative teachers.  Otherwise, how

do uncreative teachers teach creativity?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is a pertinent question to think about, and we

certainly do know that we have got a lot of good teachers.   But

I think it is not every teacher that knows how to be creative or

knows how to teach creativity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are sending a lot of teachers, in a way, back to school,

to  seminars and workshops to learn things that they perhaps did

not  learn when they were in the teachers' training school.   We

are  sending  them  to do all these things because  we  want  to

upgrade their skills and improve their professionalism.  But  we

also  need to be careful that we do not fill our teachers'  time

so  much  that they too have no time to think.  And if  teachers

have  no time to think, how can they teach students to think  in

the thinking schools?   Tired teachers have no time to think and

plan.  Tired teachers have no ability to rest, read, refresh and

keep  up to date.  If this happens, we are not going to get  our

thinking and creative schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to mention that we need to be careful

when we plan all these programmes with purpose and good meaning,

but  they  may be implemented in a way that is not expected.   I

know, for example, that the Ministry of Education sets some very

reasonable standards.  But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1739</b></font><br><br>



the  policy makers must remember that at the ground, things  are

looked  at  differently.   And if they  do  not  understand  the

rationale of some of the programmes that are being introduced at

the  Ministry level, they are going to do it their own way,  and

they are just going to look at it as yet another thing to do  to

improve the ranking.

<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, we live in a society that venerates the

role  of  the  teacher.   Over the past  year  or  so,  we  have

witnessed  many  Government initiatives on the education  front.

National  Education, information technology and creativity  have

been  at  the  core.  I would like to look at these  initiatives

from the perspective of the teacher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new initiatives have brought about considerable

change in the school environment.  Teachers have had to adapt to

new  technologies.  They are asked to incorporate new  pedagogic

methods in their classroom.  At the same time, they have to deal

with   extra-curricular  activities  and  other   administrative

duties.   It  would  not  be an exaggeration  to  say  that  our

teachers  have found life becoming a little bit more  hectic,  a

little bit more stressful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in part, to address these concerns, I would like to

ask  the  Minister  for some information on initiatives  of  the

Ministry in a few areas.  The first area pertains to curriculum.

In  the  Addendum  to  the President's Address  last  year,  the

Minister  announced  that efforts would be made  to  reduce  the

curriculum.   This is an initiative much awaited,  not  just  by

students and teachers, but also the parents.  In particular,  it

would   give  teachers  the  capacity  to  undertake   the   new

initiatives the Ministry has introduced with greater vigour.  So

I would appreciate it if the Minister could give us an update on

this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in a somewhat mundane but I think very important

administrative arena, can more be done to help and  support  our

teachers  in  schools?  Some of our staff rooms look  like  they

have  remained unchanged since the 60s and 70s, and yet we  live

in  an  era where systems furniture and open office systems  are

the  norm.   Similarly, it is not unusual to find a computer  on

every desk or every other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1740</b></font><br><br>



desk  in  the commercial world.  This is certainly not  yet  the

case  in  our  staff  rooms.  I know the  Minister  has  already

undertaken  initiatives to address this.  I would appreciate  it

if we could understand the progress and the targets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, according recognition to our teachers is extremely

important.  In  part,  this  is  done  through  the  competitive

remuneration.    And  I  know  the  Ministry  has  conducted   a

comprehensive  review last year and recently, and will  continue

to  monitor  this  situation.  It is the non-monetary  arena  in

which I am concerned.  I think more can be done.  We have annual

events  like  Teachers' Day to acknowledge their  contributions.

But I think it is more than just one localised annual event, and

it is certainly not the responsibility of just the Ministry, the

students  or  the  teachers.   I  think  our  society  and   our

institutions,  as  a  whole, should cultivate  this  culture  of

constantly  recognising our teachers' contributions.   Recently,

the  Lianhe  Zaobao  introduced an award for excellence  in  the

teaching of Mandarin.  I wonder if this could be emulated by the

other vernacular media.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, in every day's Straits Times, we have at least 4-6

pages  of business news and 15 minutes on TCS talking about  the

achievements  of corporations and their leaders.   We  have  400

over  schools.  We have about 300-350 listed companies.   Surely

we  can do something similar, if not on a weekly or daily basis,

then  perhaps on a fortnightly basis to highlight some of  their

accomplishments.  After all, our future wealth creators  are  in

these schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in keeping with the spirit of thinking schools and

learning  nation,  I  believe it is very  important  for  us  to

constantly   think   of  our  teachers  and   learn   of   their

accomplishments.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, the Education Ministry has

succeeded in attracting many candidates as teachers.  Its bumper

harvest  can help overcome the shortage of teachers  and  enable

new programmes to be implemented in schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we cannot rest on one's laurels, because it

appears that we need



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1741</b></font><br><br>



many teachers not only to take the place of those who retire  or

resign,  but also to reduce the burden experienced by  teachers.

If  we  look around, we can see that many schools are forced  to

depend  on  temporary teachers, because teachers who  retire  or

resign or fall ill are not immediately replaced by permanent  or

full-time  teachers.   This results  in  many  of  the  students

affected  not getting the full guidance in the subjects  taught.

Is the Education Ministry looking into this problem and how does

it intend to overcome it?  If we actually need more teachers, is

the  Ministry reviewing its policies on recruitment of  teachers

with overseas degrees?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I acknowledge that the teaching profession needs teachers

who are dedicated, of good morals and are people who can educate

their  students,  not only teach particular subjects.   However,

would it not be better if the Ministry reassesses its policy  on

recruitment  of  graduate teachers from foreign universities  if

these people can contribute to the education of our children?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are some candidates with overseas degrees, who are

currently employed as part-time teachers with graduate salaries,

not   offered  salaries  which  are  commensurate   with   their

qualifications?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, talking about teachers, I would also like to point out

the  need   for  the   Ministry to send teachers  who  are  more

capable as educators, guides and, what is no less important,  as

disciplinarians,  to  schools which are likely  to  accept  more

students  with limited academic abilities.  This is so that  the

teachers concerned can increase the motivation of the students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter that I would like to touch on is how our

schools  fund  their  various activities while  their  operating

budgets  are becoming more restricted.  How can schools  provide

programmes  to  increase creativity, for example,  with  limited

funds?  Does this mean that we have to compromise the quality of

our education?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry of Education could clarify.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1742</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, I would like to talk on higher

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our universities have budgetted an increase in student

intake  in  the new financial year.  The question in the  public

mind   is  how  many  of  the  places  will  actually   be   for

Singaporeans, as the universities have announced plans  to  take

in  more  foreign  undergraduate students.   With  the  regional

financial  crisis,  the  depreciation of  the  Singapore  dollar

against  the US dollar and the British sterling pound,  and  the

anticipated slower economic growth, there would be students  who

had  originally intended to study overseas, but  have  to  shelf

their   plans  and  remain  in  Singapore  for  their   tertiary

education.  What then would be the impact of this on the student

enrolment and the ability of the universities to accommodate all

the   students  who  meet  the  entry  requirements?   Will  the

universities be able to expand its facilities quickly to take in

larger  intakes  of students if there is demand,  especially  in

some popular courses?



<br>4.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the regional financial crisis persists for a prolonged

period, the Ministry would have to accelerate the opening of the

third  university to take in the large number of  undergraduates

wishing  to  remain in Singapore for their university education.

Can  the  Minister  give his assessment on  the  impact  of  the

present  regional financial crisis on the demand for  places  in

our  universities in Singapore and how will the universities  be

coping with the situation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universities have recently announced that the future

admission  criteria for university would not be based solely  on

academic  results.   There is already  the  test  and  interview

selection process conducted for students applying for courses in

law  and  medicine at NUS.  How different is the  new  basis  of

selection  for  university admission?  Can the Minister  explain

the  merits  of  this new entry system?  How do we  satisfy  the

students,  and  their  parents, that they would  not  be  unduly

penalised under the new system of admission?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1743</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many have viewed this system to be subjective and are

concerned that the wrong selection could lead to unintended  and

undesirable outcomes.  How do we assure the students  that  they

will  not  be denied the opportunity of studying the courses  of

their choice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presumably under the new entry system more weightage would

be  given  to extra-curricular activities.  Would it  then  mean

that  those  youths  who  had represented  Singapore  either  in

sports,  arts, music and culture, in international  competitions

and  have  won medals, would be given automatic admissions  into

our universities, if they meet the minimum entry requirements?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education has recently informed prospective

applicants  of Business Administration and Business  courses  at

NUS  and  NTU,  that NTU would cease to offer  business  courses

after  year 2000.  Singapore Management University is a  private

university.  What would be the difference for students  choosing

to  study either at the NUS or SMU?  What would be the focus and

orientation  of  NTU  when it no longer runs  business  courses?

What  would  the vacated facilities at NTU be used  for  in  the

future?   Would there be any difference in the fees payable  and

the  entry requirements between the two universities of NUS  and

SMU?   Will  there  be an overall increase or  decrease  in  the

number  of places for students pursuing business courses in  NUS

and  SMU?   Would SMU be strictly a university for business  and

finance  related  courses?  What would  be  the  future  of  the

programmes  currently  run  under  the  Singapore  Institute  of

Management?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the Open University what would be its

status  with  the establishment of SMU as a private  university?

How  successful has the Open University been?  How many students

have signed up and graduated from the Open University?  Can  the

Open  University  be more flexible in its entry requirements  to

cater  to  working adults who have made good progress  in  their

careers?   We should be open-minded and make it easy for  mature

students  to  qualify  for admission into  the  Open  University

courses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1744</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it really necessary for applicants to have relevant "A"

level  subjects  to  apply for courses in  the  Open  University

Degree  Programme?  We are already facing a shortage of  English

Language and Literature teachers.  If non-graduate teachers  who

have "A" levels in other arts subjects and have the interest  to

do  a degree in English Language and Literature, we should allow

them  to  do  so, provided they pass the entrance  examinations.

After all, they need to work hard to earn their degrees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also ask the Minister whether there are plans to

expand  the range of courses in the Open University to encourage

more working adults to take up continuing education programmes?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been concerns expressed that the private

educational  institutions  conducting twinning  programmes  with

overseas  universities  may fall short  in  the  high  standards

expected of a university.  In such an important area of  quality

control, I do not think we should completely allow the market to

decide.  The Government can make the Open University a model for

standards  of  distant  learning courses  and  a  benchmark  for

comparison against private educational institutions.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I would like

to  state  that I am currently an academic staff member  of  the

National University of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a total of $1 billion is provided to our 2

universities  for the financial year 1998.  The  average  annual

subsidy  per  student  is  stated to be,  at  NUS,  $18,300  per

student,  and  at NTU, $15,200.  These are major investments  on

our  universities  and their students.  The aim  is  to  provide

Singapore  with  graduates having the  requisite  knowledge  and

skills  for  employment and to promote research and  innovation.

The  broader vision sketched out by DPM, Dr Tony Tan, last  year

in  the  debate on the President's Address, is to make  the  two

universities  world-class and its graduates more  responsive  to

life-long  learning  and  changing circumstances.   One  of  the

proposals  was to broaden the curricula of the universities,  to

have courses such as history, regional cultures or language  and

expository writing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1745</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, university or tertiary education is regarded as the

pinnacle  of  one's educational career.  Graduates usually  join

the  workforce after university.  At the university, the student

takes  a  degree course that may determine his career.  Economic

competitiveness  plays a large part in the student's  perception

of what he or she should be reading at university.  Excelling in

the  subjects  that  are seen to be most relevant  to  employers

appears  to  be  uppermost in the minds of most  students.   The

proposal to broaden the curricula of the university is  seen  to

promote  other objectives, besides job competence  and  economic

competitiveness.   It  is  to arm the  graduate  with  life-long

learning  skills and a better appreciation of the  world  around

them.   Additionally, these subjects serve the more  traditional

functions  of  university  education,  namely  to  build   civic

responsibilities and cultivate tolerance, in short, to produce a

well-rounded  educated person.  There are several  points,  Sir,

that  should be made concerning these broader aims of university

education.  I hope the Ministry will see fit to comment on them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, and most important of all, unless the consumers buy

the  product, that is to say, unless they believe in  the  aims,

all  will come to nought.  Subjects are learned, examined on and

discarded  by semester.  At the end of the day, only  the  grade

counts.   To  avoid  this,  our  university  students  have   to

internalize  a  different set of values,  a  sense  of  pursuing

knowledge  for  its own sake, a sense of civility,  a  sense  of

culture, a sense of community.  Without a new perception on  the

part of our students, there will only be the appearance that  we

are doing the right thing.  This should be avoided at all costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the employers must believe in the broader

curricula.   Many enlightened employers do look at the  totality

of  the  graduate's time at the university,  not  only  in  what

grades  he has obtained, but how broad the sweep of subjects  he

has  taken and the intellectual maturity that he displays.   But

there are also many who take a blinkered view and who would hire

only graduates who had done the subjects



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1746</b></font><br><br>



most  relevant  to the jobs.  This has to change.   Professional

bodies  must take a more enlightened view about what is required

for professional competence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the home universities must provide the wherewithal

in  terms  of  facilities and teaching to  foster  the  academic

tradition.   There  must be intellectual autonomy,  intellectual

curiosity  and intellectual rigour to inspire and  motivate  the

students.   The  worst  thing  that  could  happen  is  a  broad

curriculum, badly taught and half-heartedly learned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there must be recognition of the quality of the

home universities - that its faculties are comparable to some of

the  world's  best.  That recognition must be shown through  the

award  of  prestigious scholarships and to the top  students  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Ministry of Education would do its best to

persuade   the  top  students,  the  scholars,  that  the   home

universities  are  equal  to the task  of  providing  for  their

tertiary  education.   Sir, the Government has  been  farsighted

enough   to   continue  to  invest  heavily  in   the   tertiary

institutions.   We  are  still  on  course  in  respect  of  the

objective.  For our home universities to be world-class, let  us

also ensure that our graduates are world-class.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, I rise to applaud

the   move  by  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  our  tertiary

institutions to fine-tune the admission criteria for  our  local

universities.   The  encouragement of the  development  of  all-rounded  students, taking into account each student's  ECAs  and

achievements,  personality and communication  skills,  deductive

capacity  and  general  knowledge,  is  a  step  in  the   right

direction,  as these attributes are necessary for graduates  and

Singapore to succeed in the 21st century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, the objective of the new admission criteria is

to  nurture all-rounded talents so that our graduates  will  not

only  be  equipped with specialised skills, but also be able  to

conduct  themselves  gracefully when they  enter  working  life.

Sir, I understand the Ministry will appoint a panel or committee

to review



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1747</b></font><br><br>



the  admission criteria and work out implementation details  for

the  scheme  to be effected in the year 2001.  I wish  to  raise

some concerns and suggestions to the Ministry as regards the new

admission criteria.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, Sir, whilst I agree that greater emphasis should

be placed on ECA as a criterion for admission to the university,

we   should  not  over-emphasise  this.   Students  could  over-compensate, and parents could put undue stress on them to  spend

an   exorbitant   amount  of  time  on   ECA.    The   resulting

participation for the sake of participation might  detract  from

any  benefits that these changes are designed to create and also

compromise  academic excellence, which has been the hallmark  of

our  education  system all these years.  There  is  therefore  a

need,  Sir,  to  properly establish an optimum  balance  between

academic excellence and ECA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, I believe there must be social consensus all

round,  among parents, teachers and employers, that  indeed  the

new  admission criterion is in the interest of all, particularly

in  producing  graduates who should be more forward-looking  and

who  have  to  compete with talents all over the world  as  they

venture out to the region to seek opportunities in line with our

move  towards  regionalisation and globalisation.   To  do  this

successfully, and to gain acceptance, we must also  educate  and

prepare  our  parents, our teachers and our employers,  on  this

move.  And I believe that we should start now and not wait  till

the  year  2001.   The  Government therefore  should  look  into

implementing  changes  to our education  system  and  employment

scene  to  facilitate  this  process of  acceptance  and  social

consensus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, in establishing new criteria for admission

into  our  universities, inevitably we have to  learn  from  the

experience of more well-known and established universities world-wide.   By all means, learn from the others, but I would caution

against the wholesale adoption of a particular model, whether it

is  based  on the US, UK, Australian or Japanese model.   May  I

therefore suggest that the Ministry look into the various models

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1748</b></font><br><br>



adopt whatever is relevant to our needs.  At the end of the day,

Sir,  we  must  develop our own admission  criteria,  given  the

unique  nature  of Singapore, with its constraints  and  limited

manpower.   Sir, I urge the Ministry to consider these  concerns

and  suggestions  in  drawing up the  new  university  admission

criteria.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, unlike one

or two of my colleagues, I am cheered by the recent changes that

have  been  announced for university admission by  Deputy  Prime

Minister, Dr Tony Tan.  In fact, many of my friends who  I  have

spoken to, welcomed this announcement.  But, however, there  are

some  who do have concerns and are anxious as to how it will  be

implemented, as the GPC Chairman, Mr Loh, has pointed out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our education system, the top 20% in each school

cohort enter the university.  It is from this elite that leaders

of  industry,  business and politics in Singapore  will  largely

surface  from.   Whether one becomes a leader  in  industry,  in

business  or  commerce or in politics, the  fundamental  factors

that  will make him or her a successful leader is his intellect,

his  character, that is, integrity, honesty and confidence;  his

effective  communications  skills, that  is,  written  and  oral

skills;  and  inter-personal skills, and  other  qualities  like

charisma,  perseverance,  tolerance and  compassion  for  fellow

human  beings.   Sir, this list is by no means  exhaustive,  but

these are some of the key qualities of leaders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are in politics, certain of these factors will be

emphasised  -  charisma,  ability  to  convince  the   mass   of

Singaporeans on the policies that have been implemented  and  to

follow through, to understand ground feelings and so on.  If you

are  in  business,  operational  skills  become  essential.   So

broadly,  these  skills are required in whatever  you  do  as  a

leader.



<br>4.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have often heard that a good degree is but only a

passport to a good job.  But whether one develops a good  career

and succeeds in his life depends on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1749</b></font><br><br>



many of the above qualities that I have mentioned.  Sir, when  I

was  a  student  leader in my undergraduate  days  at  NTI,  the

predecessor  to  NTU,  a  very  senior  administrator   of   the

University used to meet student leaders for lunch from  time  to

time.  At one lunch meeting, he said that he was very happy that

we  were involved in student leadership because he felt that the

experience that we could gain would indeed give us an  all-round

or  universal  university education.  He said that he  reflected

back to his own group of friends during his Raffles College days

and  came  to  the conclusion that those friends who  were  very

active in student activities and, of course, did reasonably well

in studies, had as a rule done much better in their careers than

those  who  had excellent results but did not have an  all-round

education.   By  the  way, the university  undergraduate  hostel

lingo,  we  called this type of people, the latter, "square"  or

"Martians", people from Mars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, after graduating 13 years ago, I find that what

this administrator has told me is very true indeed.  Personally,

I  have  been  very  active in ECA in primary school,  secondary

school, pre-U and in the university due to the kind guidance  of

my  parents,  my teachers, relatives and friends.  I  feel  very

strongly  that  ECA  has  helped me  very  significantly  in  my

personal  development and career.  And therefore,  I  feel  very

passionately in supporting this policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universities in Singapore have moved in recent years to

the  modular academic system.  Although it is a good policy, one

of  the  side  effects of this, sadly, is  that  the  time  that

undergraduates  have  for  ECA  is somewhat  lessened,  somewhat

squeezed.    Therefore,  broadening  the  university   admission

criteria  would encourage an earlier development  of  this  all-round  university  education at junior  colleges,  at  secondary

schools and even primary schools.  But the main fear really that

I  have is that some principals, some teachers and perhaps  some

parents may go overboard and unduly emphasise ECA in lieu of the

academic curriculum.  The Education Minister should be aware of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1750</b></font><br><br>



this  and  ensure that the academic curriculum and ECA find  the

right  balance  in our schools so that a balanced foundation  is

laid  before  some  of  the  brighter  children  who  enter  the

universities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to urge the Minister to release more

details on the implementation of these policies as soon  as  the

appointed  panel  completes its work.  I would  urge  that  this

panel  complete  its  work  as soon as  possible  so  that  this

apprehension that people have on a balanced weightage of ECA vis-a-vis  academic results can be resolved.  And I would also  like

to urge the Minister not to wait till the year 2001 to implement

it;  try and implement it as soon as possible, if not, the  next

academic year.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, I reiterate my interest

as  an  academic  staff  member of the  National  University  of

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the perennial problems that has always plagued every

university staff member when he sees a new batch of students for

the  first  time is: Have we admitted the right people?   Or  an

even  more  difficult question: Did we leave out some  deserving

ones?  These are questions that are hard to answer.  Recently, a

suggestion was made that admissions should not be based  on  "A"

level  results alone and that other activities of  the  students

should  be  taken  into account.  The so-called extra-curricular

record  should be examined with points to be awarded to  various

types of deserving activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is, of course, well and good. But it must be

noted  that the "A" result is really the culmination of at least

two  years'  hard work.  Examination smartness  should  not,  of

course,  be dismissed lightly.  If the extra-curricular  records

were  taken into account, my first concern is that it would take

the spontaneity and fun out of participating in such activities.

Students, together with parents, in Singapore are very  good  at

applying what is specified, what earns most points.  We may,  in

fact,  encourage  an unhealthy attitude, for example,  of  doing

community



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1751</b></font><br><br>



service  without  the heart in it.  Extra-curricular  activities

will  be pursued very much like grades in "A" levels themselves.

It would detract from, rather than reinforce, the aims of extra-curricular  activities, that of pursuing certain activities  for

their  own sake, whether it be community work, sports or  drama.

We,  therefore,  need  to exercise great care  in  this  matter.

Extra-curricular activities should be encouraged but not  forced

directly or indirectly on students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that consistent with the approach of

the universities in broadening the curricula, the specialisation

that  has taken root for a long time in the "A" levels,  namely,

separating  the students into Science, Arts or Commerce  stream,

should  be  re-examined.  Both numeracy and literacy  should  be

necessary  conditions  for  the admission  of  students  to  the

university.   This  would be in keeping  with  the  proposal  to

broaden  the  university's curricula. A  JC  student  should  be

allowed  to  take  a  preponderance of subjects  in  his  chosen

specialisation  but  he should take at least  one  from  another

stream.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that care has to be taken in instituting

other forms of admission procedures, like interviews.  There  is

always   the  danger  of  subjectivity  in  personal  forms   of

assessment.  For this reason, it would be wrong to put too  much

credence on it.  An interview probably operates best as a  means

to  sift  out those who cannot make it rather than as a positive

factor  for taking in students.  Drawing from my own experience,

for  example, it is very difficult to tell what the student  has

prepared  for and what he actually genuinely believes  in.   For

example,  one candidate, having declared his great  interest  in

reading  law,  he  was asked: "As you have a great  interest  in

reading  law,  what  can  you  tell  us  about  the  courts   in

Singapore?"  And the response was: "Colombo Court".  It is quite

inappropriate in the circumstances.  Other answers to  the  same

question,  taken  by  my  colleagues: "Badminton  court,  tennis

court."  This clearly indicates that the students with some idea

about  having  an  interest practising law but have  not  really

taken the trouble to look at the matter seriously.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1752</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I believe that the signals should be sent strongly

and  clearly  to parents and teachers that they must  give  some

leeway to their children to pursue their own interest.  A  child

or  young  person  is  much more likely to excel  in  an  extra-curricular activity if he did it out of interest and commitment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that these views will be taken into account by the

Ministry  when working out the new guidelines for the admissions

to universities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the Open University

Programme  should  have  a more flexible  entry  requirement  to

provide a second chance to those who did not see the need for  a

higher education when they were younger.  Back in the 60s,  many

people aspired to complete just the Cambridge examinations.   It

would  have  been sufficient for them to secure a good  job  and

earn  a  living.  As Singapore advances, it became necessary  to

gain   good  `0'  level  results.   Subsequently,  the  standard

increased  and  one needed "A" level passes.   Today,  one  will

pursue  for  a  diploma, degree or a professional qualification.

Some people will go on to earn a Masters degree.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Open University concept in the United Kingdom caters

for  anyone who wishes to upgrade himself or herself by studying

for  a  degree.  Anyone without the requisite "0" and "A" levels

can enrol for a foundation course where the necessary skills for

the pursuit of a degree are taught and examined.  On passing the

examinations or the foundation course, one becomes  eligible  to

continue  with the degree course.  This way, all adults  have  a

chance  of  studying for a degree, irrespective  of  their  past

study  track  record.   Their  working  experience  would   have

equipped them to embark on this journey.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, those who have targeted entry into one of our

main universities stand a better chance to qualify for admission

to the Open University Degree Programme.  Sir, there is a danger

that it would become the University with easier options for  the

students of today.  The Open University Programme must  set  for

itself higher ideals than just being equal to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1753</b></font><br><br>



our  two  major universities.  It can be recognised as an  equal

while catering for different segments of our society.  Room must

be  made  for the mature students, the experienced workers  with

few  or no GCE passes at "0" or "A" levels.  Only then is it  an

Open University.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, I think we all know that we

have  a  very  high literary rate in Singapore.  I do  not  know

whether  there is a measurement for motivation.   But I am  sure

if  there  is one in Singapore, Singaporeans would measure  very

well on that score.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at this booklet on "Desired Outcomes of

Education",  Sir, you will find that the Ministry  has  outlined

various  attributes which they would want to see as outcomes  of

education.   If  you look at just secondary and junior  college,

you  will  find that they want the products of education  to  be

enterprising and innovative, possessing a broad-based foundation

for  further education, believe in their own ability, understand

what   it  takes  to  inspire  and  motivate  others,  have   an

entrepreneurial   and  creative  spirit,  be   able   to   think

independently and creatively, and strive for excellence and have

a  zest for life.  I think all these will contribute to more and

more  Singaporeans wanting to improve their level  of  education

and,  thus,  I  am  glad to see that we are  pursuing  the  Open

University actively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I would like to ask is: what level of

coordination is there among the institutions of higher  learning

in  Singapore with the Open University?  And what more could  be

done   to   make  the  Open  University  more  open  with   more

opportunities  for  those who are not able to  pursue  full-time

tertiary education?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also would like to suggest, Sir, that there is room for

selective  twinning  with  foreign  universities  on   an   open

university  concept  and level.  For I am sure  all  these  will

contribute  towards making our Singapore achieve the  target  of

excellence and a thinking society.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, it has been announced that the

Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1754</b></font><br><br>



Management  University  will be run  privately  along  lines  of

American universities, and I think this is a good move.  It  has

also  been  announced that entry standards at this SMU  will  be

high  but not necessarily based on academic results.  That is  a

good assurance because we do not want the SMU to be a third rate

university.   It has been announced too that amongst  the  other

things that would be referred to when choosing students for  the

SMU  would be their record of extra-curricular activities  (ECA)

and  aptitude tests and perhaps essays and interviews.  I  think

that this is also a move that is to be highly commended.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outcome of education really must be to produce a

rounded student that is not just word perfect, and not certainly

not  word  perfect "bookworms".  We need flexible  thinkers,  we

need  people who care for society to be compassionate.   And  Mr

Zainul  has referred to the booklet called the "Desired Outcomes

of  Education".   Several of the outcomes for potential  leaders

are  also  listed in this book on page 4:  First,  committed  to

improving  society;  compassionate  towards  others;   able   to

inspire, motivate and draw out the best from others and has  the

tenacity to fight against the odds, not quitting.

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I doubt that any of these things can be learned in the

books  and  from professors, no matter how intelligent  and  how

brilliant they are.  These are things that you have to learn, as

Mr Sinnakaruppan has mentioned, from living in the hostels, from

acting in the plays produced by the student societies and  being

student leaders, like Mr Sinnakaruppan was.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not easy for a student these days, especially in

university.  Not only do they have very little time for ECA, but

they  are  sometimes actually discouraged because they  will  be

faced with comments like, "You stupid fool!  Go and study!   Why

do you care so much for other things?"  These are things that we

have to nip in the bud.  If ECA is to be one of the criteria for

admission  into SMU, I think we ought to look at  the  character

development aspect



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1755</b></font><br><br>



of  ECA  rather  than to worry that it is going  to  be  another

pressure  point, another thing for which the parents would  say,

"Son,  you'd  better  go  and get a gold  medal  for  100  metre

sprint."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one other thing that I would want to raise is to urge

those  who  are planning for SMU and those who will be  choosing

students  for admission that they mind what Prof. Chin has  said

about  not leaving out those who are deserving.  There are  many

ways  that  students can be deserving to enter into SMU  without

having  got  sterling  academic results.  American  universities

choose  students sometimes based on their potential.   In  other

words,  a  child's  personal  interests  and  potential  are  as

important in deciding whether he should go for a course or  not.

If  he  is a violin prodigy, as has been reported in the Straits

Times  recently, he may be a teenager, his age is too far  below

what  his cohort would be but he, nonetheless, is a genius,  and

he should be admitted.  We do not want to have a situation where

Albert  Einstein  is  refused entry  into  SMU  or  any  of  our

universities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other requirement that perhaps SMU could look

into,  when  looking into admission criteria, is to consider  if

this high emphasis we put, as a society, on the mother tongue is

important.   I know I am going to be accused of heresy  at  this

point  with  some members of the establishment.  But  I  am  not

saying we should drop or stop teaching mother tongue.  What I am

saying  is that the stress of our current educational system  is

sometimes  due  to parents putting on more pressure  though  the

Ministry  of  Education requires them to  have  some  reasonable

standards in achieving mother tongue proficiency.  Actually  all

that  the Ministry of Education requires is just a pass  in  the

language.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, parents adopt this attitude that to reach the

tree  tops you have to aim for the moon.  And so they force  the

students  to  go for all kinds of remedial lessons  and  tuition

when  actually the standard is already proficient.  And so  they

add  the  stress because they fear that if they do not do  this,

the  student may not even pass the mother tongue and  so  cannot

get into university.  Sometimes,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1756</b></font><br><br>



they  know  that their own children can pass mother  tongue  but

they are afraid that in a contest between two equal persons, the

one  with  the lower mother tongue grade would drop  out.   Then

they  may  say,  "Son/daughter, I  cannot  afford  to  send  you

overseas."  Here, we have an opportunity for SMU to be a kind of

overseas university based locally and this is where we can  say,

"Well,  if you pass mother tongue or even if you don't pass,  we

can  consider and see if you are really one of those who deserve

to  enter  otherwise."  Then we would not have people who,  when

asked  about  the  courts, say "Colombo Court"  or  maybe  "food

court".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is also important that if we do have

standards  that  are flexible like this, in terms  of  admission

criteria, then we can also afford to be lenient in deciding what

courses the students can do in this university.  I hope that  if

these  cases arise, our SMU will be more flexible than  the  two

established universities that we have currently.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Zainul Abidin is not here. Mr Hawazi.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, I was encouraged to note that 91% of

6,740  students from the Normal (Technical) course have  applied

to  get  into  ITE.   I  would say that  91%  is  quite  a  high

proportion.  Without the finest training implemented  some  four

years  ago,  many  of  these students, who  are  generally  weak

academically, would probably have joined the labour market  with

very  little  knowledge and skills.  However, what  happened  to

about  600  students or so who did not apply to enter  the  ITE?

They  could  be unemployed now or have joined the labour  market

with  no  technical skills.  The number may be relatively  small

but,  taken  cumulatively over the years, we will have  a  large

number  of  Singaporean workers who have low or no  skills,  the

problems  among older workers, which the National  Trades  Union

Congress and the Government are now working hard to address.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that education and skills training are not

compulsory here, I would urge both the MOE and ITE to do more to

encourage all Normal (Technical) students



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1757</b></font><br><br>



to take up courses at ITE and help ensure that these students do

not drop out halfway.  In the same vein, Sir, what would MOE and

ITE   be   doing  to  encourage  more  students   to   take   up

apprenticeship programmes, a problem which the Minister of State

for Education said existed now?

<br>4.35 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, my topic is on private educational

institutions.   Over  the  years,  the  Government's  effort  to

encourage  Singaporeans to upgrade themselves  has  resulted  in

many  Singaporeans taking up many courses in private educational

institutions.  These include tertiary courses such  as  diploma,

degree and postgraduate programmes.  As such, there has been  an

influx   of   private  educational  institutions  and   overseas

universities  offering  a  wide range  of  tertiary  courses  in

Singapore.   Although  it is assumed that Singaporeans  who  are

attending  tertiary  courses should  be  able  to  evaluate  the

quality  and  recognition of these programmes, in practice  this

may not be so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am the President of a professional body. Very

often,   I   receive  queries  from  students  or  practitioners

concerning  the recognition of various professional degrees,  or

diploma   courses  conducted  by  private  institutions.    Many

Singaporeans  have spent large sums of their  savings  on  these

courses.   Sometimes, they do not obtain value  for  money.   In

some  cases,  they were disappointed when they  found  that  the

diplomas  or degrees which they have obtained are not recognised

by  our  Government, statutory boards or companies.   The  above

situation  could  happen because we do  not  have  a  system  of

accrediting  tertiary courses conducted by  private  educational

institutions in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to protect the interest of Singaporeans who are keen

to  upgrade  themselves,  I would like  to  urge  the  Education

Ministry to accredit all tertiary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1758</b></font><br><br>



courses  conducted  by private institutions in  Singapore.   The

Ministry can license these private educational institutions, and

conduct quality audit to assess the standard and quality of  all

approved  tertiary courses. This could be achieved by appointing

quality   auditors  from  the  Ministry,  our  universities   or

practitioners in the industry.  The accredited courses may  then

be included in the list of approved courses in the CPF Education

Scheme.   In this way, more Singaporeans would be encouraged  to

upgrade themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I hope the Education Ministry can take steps to

control  the  quality  of tertiary courses  that  are  currently

conducted by private educational institutions.  We should set up

a  national accreditation body similar to that of the UK or USA.

Accreditation will assist Singaporeans to make a better-informed

decision to upgrade themselves.  To have a quality workforce, we

need to control the quality of education of both the public  and

private educational institutions in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, I will not talk on pre-primary education. I will go straight to special education.

But  first,  I  want to give special thanks to the Minister  for

increasing this year's budget on special education to 39.9%,  an

increase of $11 million, from $26.7 million to $37.5 million.  I

also  note  that an average cost per pupil in special  education

programmes of $5,229 is almost equal to that of secondary school

education.  I would like to suggest to the Minister to  consider

partial  or  full  integration of special  schools  into  normal

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the emphasis on special education reflects our social

responsibility and value that we attach to train as best  as  we

can children with special disabilities so that they can maximise

and  realise their full potential.  This is a worthwhile,  noble

and  difficult cause involving the Government, the community and

a  dedicated pool of volunteers.  In schools, these children are

given   specialist   attention  to  cope  with   their   varying

disabilities from hearing impaired to slowness and those with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1759</b></font><br><br>



speech  problems.  But they and their parents  have  one  common

desire and aspiration, that is, to be accepted and integrated as

part  of society to make their lives as normal as possible.   We

owe  it to them to give our special attention.  I would urge the

Minister   to  set  aside  classrooms  in  normal   schools   to

accommodate  children  who are now attending  special  education

programmes.   This  would  allow for maximum  opportunities  for

integration  and speed up adaptation process.  They should  have

common  programmes and curriculum, where appropriate,  but  have

their own specialised care and training, when necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand the complex administrative difficulties

and  inconveniences it can pose.  But I think this  is  a  small

price  that we should be willing to pay.  Our children can  also

benefit  enormously  by learning, playing and  growing  up  with

children  of special disabilities.  If they are not prepared  to

put up with the minor inconveniences and sacrifice, how are they

going to grow up into adulthood to appreciate that it is part of

nature  to  have  amongst us those who  are  born  with  special

disabilities?  How are they going to appreciate that it is their

responsibility  as part of society to take care  of  people  and

ensure  their  quick recovery, adjustment and  integration  into

society?   It  is  indeed  expensive to  provide  the  necessary

specialised  facilities in such schools.  But I  hope  that  the

tremendous  improvements being made to schools can also  benefit

students of special education programmes if they are allowed  to

be integrated into part of our normal education process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen recently more structured community

participation and involvement in some schools.  Perhaps, we  can

experiment  more integration at these schools to  emphasise  and

demonstrate our joint responsibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these children may have special disabilities but they

need not be specially segregated.  Their only wish is to be part

and  parcel  of a normal mainstream education.  I think  we  can

grant them this wish.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1760</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, I just want to ask the Minister for

Education  what  more  can  or will be  done  for  a  small  but

important  group of students with disabilities.  As Mr  Zulkifli

has said, they too have aspirations, they too have potential  to

be  realised.  Equipping them with skills for life and  even  in

employment goes to the heart of human dignity.



<br>4.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, there are two approaches through which we can

educationally assist students with disabilities.  The  first  is

by  integrating  them,  where possible, in  mainstream  schools.

This approach offers important benefits for the intellectual and

social  development  of high-functioning disabled  children  who

have  the capacity to do so.  I understand from the experts that

this is, in fact, part of the world trend.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister what is being done to

enhance the capacity of our schools to better cater to the needs

of  high-functioning disabled students.  Can  more  training  be

given  to our teachers to help them be better prepared to  teach

disabled  students  in  the  mainstream?   Or  could  additional

resources be given for them to enhance this capacity?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second approach is through special schools which have

devised customised programmes catering to these students' unique

requirements.  Last year, the Ministry announced an increase  in

the  financial  resource allocation for such schools.   I  would

like  to  raise  a  specific question  regarding  these  special

education  schools.  There is a need to professionalise  special

education.   In the UK, for example, special education  teachers

are  properly  trained, often with post-graduate qualifications.

In  Singapore, their qualifications are far more modest and many

do  not  even  have  a  degree.  In general,  special  education

teachers  appear  to  be  placed at the level  of  an  assistant

teacher.   The work is physically and emotionally demanding  and

the  terms  of  employment compare less  favourably  with  other

options in the market.  Morale is low and turnover is high.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1761</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Ministry able or considering any possibility of

offering  a  professional  course for the  training  of  special

education  teachers,  possibly  by  augmenting  the  basic   NIE

programme?   Also, I would like to ask whether the  Ministry  is

undertaking  any measures to help special education  schools  to

retain  their teachers, perhaps by offering terms comparable  to

their counterparts in the mainstream schools.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, recently, I encountered a case of a

person  who was posted overseas.  He, in his youth, was  one  of

the  star  performers  in his particular  department.   Perhaps,

because  of  that,  he was sent overseas and he  stayed  several

years,  working for his employer.  When he came back, of course,

he  felt that he was by-passed for promotion because his  cohort

had moved ahead. But, Sir, I want to talk about what happened to

his children.  When he brought his children overseas, of course,

he  wanted  to be with his family.  But when he came  back,  his

teenage  children could not fit in our school system and  became

drop-outs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Government has been encouraging Singaporeans to

build  a  second  wing for the economy and for companies  to  go

regional.   I  think it is important for us to think  of  things

that  we can do to encourage people who have been loyal to their

companies  and  who  have  been  posted  overseas.   Can  we  do

something to help them adjust when they come back?  Perhaps even

before  they  leave,  we  can  have  programmes  to  help   them

understand the problems that they will face when they come back.

And  we  could emphasise that in cases like this, they would  be

given exemptions if they need to apply for it.   Because in some

of  these countries they are posted to, their children  are  not

able  to  study  the mother tongue and their  standards  of  the

language   would   therefore   deteriorate.    We   could   have

orientation.  Besides orientation, we can think of scholarships,

loans or grants for education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like this parent that I met, his children cannot enter our

local university.  But he is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1762</b></font><br><br>



not rich enough to send them for an overseas education.  And  so

he  feels  that  for  his loyalty to his company,  he  has  been

deprived of something that others take for granted.  Perhaps  in

this  situation,  we can think of grants or loans  or  something

which we can give to help them send their children to university

or  for further studies.  And if this is needed, perhaps we  can

even look at relaxing our rules on the use of CPF savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing that we can also do to help these students

fit back into Singapore society, and besides looking at relaxing

the  standards  for the mother tongue grades, perhaps  we  could

also  look  at  accepting  the grades that  they  have  obtained

overseas in their overseas educational systems.  I think we  are

rather  rigid in this and perhaps our universities, for example,

could look into accepting the equivalent of `A' levels, so  that

these children will not be penalised.   Otherwise, if we do  not

do  these things, who would want to go overseas?  Who would want

to be penalised for being good?

<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, parenting is an under-rated skill that is

taken  for  granted.   The practitioners are generally  left  to

their   own   devices.   There  are  no  courses,   manuals   or

evaluations, except perhaps by their children.  Parents  usually

rely  on  experiences within their family and circle of  friends

for  references.   Yet, as we have heard time and  again  today,

parents play an important complementary role to our teachers  in

our schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the members of the resource panel for the GPC for

Education  have  highlighted the dissonance that exists  between

parents'  perceptions  of school life today,  and  the  reality.

Please allow me to illustrate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For most parents, their understanding and idea of life in

school dates back to more than two decades ago.  Back then,  the

advent  of  the hand-held calculator was momentous.  Today,  PCs

are the norm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents are still grappling with the intricacies of our

education  system.   In a sense, they themselves  are  streamed.

Those in the fast track understand our system well.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1763</b></font><br><br>



Others,  whom  I  believe  constitute  the  bulk,  have  a  more

approximate understanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents are also unaware of some of the norms in our

schools  today.  For example, what is the going rate for  pocket

money?   In  the business world, HR managers can consult  salary

reviews by consultants, like Hays, to get some reference points.

Whom or what can parents turn to other than their intuition  and

perhaps casual discussions with their friends?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the perennial question of what they call BGR

-  boy-girl relationships.  What are the OB markers?   What  are

the  acceptable  limits?  Parents have to walk a  tightrope  for

fear of being labelled as rude or a prude.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These questions highlight the gaps, I think, in the

awareness  of today's parents.  I believe that the  Ministry  of

Education, perhaps in conjunction with MCD, could undertake some

steps  to  better educate our parents as well.   In  particular,

Sir,  I  urge  the Ministry to consider the use of  the  Parent-Teacher  Associations (PTAs), strengthening them and using  them

for  this  purpose.   PTAs could facilitate regular  discussions

between  the  schools, the teachers, on the one  hand,  and  the

parents  to  help  them to better understand  and  navigate  our

education system.  At the same time, PTAs could facilitate group

discussions  amongst  parents  so  that  they  may  share  their

experiences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know whether the Ministry has any plans to

further  strengthen  our PTA system and, in particular,  in  the

area of parent education.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I doubt many will

fault our education system in terms of first-rate facilities, in

terms  of fantastic academic results, and even in terms of  free

and fair opportunities for all our children.  The Government and

educators  spare no effort in trying to let our young  have  the

best.   We  should all be glad.  But "no", we moan  and  we  are

disgruntled.  We are not quite satisfied, and we tell the  world

and  allow  the world to tell us how stressed we  are  from  the

education of our children.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1764</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I contend that the problem has to do with our mindset

on  "success" and "competition for success".  We are a  success-orientated  nation.   It is only natural  for  parents  to  want

success  and the best for their children.  Compete  for  it,  if

need  be.  It is not enough to assume that this is only part  of

kiasuism, and it is harmless.  Having competition for betterment

is  not  a bad thing at all.  But when such competition  becomes

excessive  and begins to look like a survival pre-requisite,  we

must take note.  We need to change our mindset towards this type

of  "success"  and  this  type  of  "competition  for  success".

Although  this may take  years to achieve, we do have  to  start

somewhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing in mind that the Government will help the children

realise their maximal educational potential, let us see if  life

can  be  better  when  this is achieved, but  with  a  different

mindset.   Consider emphasising a new ideology and  interpreting

an  old policy somewhat differently from the way we do now.  Let

me use the following aspects of our present system to illustrate

what I mean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The introduction of a range of textbooks may be good

for  a  whole lot of people, but it may not be so for  the  very

people  that matter, namely, the students.  The idea  of  giving

people  a  choice  is right, but this offer,  with  the  present

mindset, opens the door to the problem of "too many books".   It

is  not  easy to have a "perfect" book, so parents will probably

buy a couple more to be taught by tuition teachers.  This cannot

be  good  for  the  children.  It is my opinion  that,  for  the

present,  we  should still have a standard textbook.   From  the

books  by  various  authors, the work that best  represents  the

topic  in the syllabus is extracted from such a textbook  to  be

compiled.    Some sort of a standard is thus made  available  to

guide  the  students, teachers as well as parents.    Sir,  this

way,  the students will have less books to carry and the parents

will  have  less  books to buy.  Indeed, the  opposite  will  be

awesome as there can be an endless amount of materials available

out there in due course.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1765</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) It has been said that our students are doing too many

subjects  for  the `O' levels.  They say that "only  6  subjects

count, but you can do as many subjects as you wish" and you have

students  doing  10 or more.  This is just too  much  work,  let

alone  too  much  stress.  Let us try to reduce  the  number  of

subjects.   What happens when the rule is "6 subjects count  and

you  will  be  examined on only 7"?  It is likely that  students

will  not  want  to study more than 7 subjects  for  examination

purposes.   The Singaporean is pragmatic.  Mind you, Sir,  I  am

sure  many students will still want to study more subjects,  but

they  now  can enjoy these other subjects for personal  interest

rather   than  for  examinations.   To  deal  with   this   more

effectively,  the authorities would need to modify and  simplify

the subject-combination choices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Adding value to extra-curricular activities (ECAs) is

a  step in the right direction to encourage students to be  all-rounders.  However, the mindset is that there is a "new subject"

to  score  from.  All at once, ECAs will be in addition  to  the

academic  workload.  If the rule for admission to  course  X  is

"get  3As+1B  and  your  ECAs can give you  further  advantage",

stress  is increased, because the requirement for course  X  now

becomes 3As+1B+ECAs and the "new subject" must be pursued.   Let

us please emphasise that to do course X, just get 3As+1B, and if

you  should  get only 2As+2Bs, your ECAs can help  make  up  the

deficit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Standards and requirements should not fluctuate too

much year to year.  If a student with 3As+1B in subjects PQRS is

eligible for course X in one year, then another student with the

same  results  in  another year should also qualify.   In  other

words,  an  inclusive, rather than exclusive, policy  should  be

adopted.  You want course X?   Just get 3As+1B, and that is all.

You have what you want.  Let the standards be more finite.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fear that our education system may become too

exclusive  if we do not simplify more and quantify  less.   This

mindset  of  our people should be borne in mind when  we  change

policy or introduce new ideas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1766</b></font><br><br>



<br>5.00 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, our young are unflatteringly

described  as smart, but self-centred, selfish, and  lacking  in

humility,  moral values and community spirit.  Let me illustrate

this with two frequent complaints.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students litter and vandalise common facilities without

thought.   They do not care about the community who lives  there

and  uses  the facilities.  Employers have complained  of  being

interviewed by young graduates instead of the other  way  round.

The  graduates  were  more concerned with  their  own  interests

rather  than the needs of the company and the job.   It  is  the

extremity  of  the position that the graduates take  that  is  a

worrying sign.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our young are our future. Today we are still able to

influence  the  course of the nation, but tomorrow  we  have  to

depend on them to do it.  The attitude and mindset of our  young

to  duties  to the nation, society and community,  is  of  great

concern.   Without  a strong sense of community responsibilities

and  duties among our young, the future of the nation stands  on

flimsy  ground.  This is a pressing and serious  issue.   Deputy

Prime  Minister, BG Lee Hsien Loong, has spoken  eloquently  and

persuasively  on this issue in his recent ministerial  statement

on bond breaking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lest I am accused of being unfair to our youths, let

me  hasten  to  add that the sense of community responsibilities

and duties of our youth is high.  But we are noticing a downward

trend.  We cannot shrug off this concern by reassuring ourselves

that  somehow  things will turn out right as in the  past.   The

whole society, including the school, community and parents,  has

duties  and  responsibilities for the moral development  of  our

young  and  I  would urge each to make conscious efforts  to  do

more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our children do spend a substantial amount of their waking

hours  in  the  schools, in the company of  their  teachers  and

school  friends.   I  am  happy to note that  the  Ministry  has

recognised  the  importance  of  the  role  of  the  school  and

developed several programmes to foster



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1767</b></font><br><br>



community spirit and to widen the outlook of our students beyond

mere  school books and examinations.  National education is  one

example.  The requirement that each of our secondary school  and

junior college students performs 6 hours of community service is

another.   The  recent Learning Journey programme  adds  to  the

opportunities  available to our students  to  learn  more  about

country and community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud our companies who have opened their doors to our

students.  Participation will cost them time, money and manpower

resources.  Hence it is a noble act on their part to  serve  the

wider  interest of the community.  I hope more organisations  in

both  the  public and private sectors will take part.   However,

the  key  must  be the principals and teachers.   They  must  be

convinced  that these are desirable programmes and will  support

them fully.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The community, too, has its role in the moral development

of  our  young.  The young learned from what they see  going  on

around them.  If adults behave responsibly and show care for the

community,   such  as  protecting  and  properly  using   common

properties,  in  showing care and respect for one  another,  our

young  will  emulate these behaviours.  In the  debate  on  last

year's  Budget, I called upon grassroots organisations  to  work

with  the  schools  to give our students the opportunity  to  do

community  work.   The recently announced Community  Involvement

Scheme for our secondary school and junior college students will

make  this task easier.  Grassroots organisations like the CCCs,

CCMCs,  RCs, Town Councils and CDCs should seize the opportunity

to  work  with  the  schools to provide more  opportunities  for

students  to  serve  the community.  Besides  making  our  young

better  and  caring people, some of them may  well  stay  on  to

become  the  next generation of grassroots leaders.  The  lament

that not enough residents are coming forward to serve may, in  a

few short years' time, be a thing of the past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ultimate responsibility for the moral development

of  a  child  rests with the parents.  Parents must accept  this

responsibility.  Some have tended to put



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1768</b></font><br><br>



the  blame  on society and the schools for their children  going

wayward.   Parents must find time to spend with their  children,

and  during these times to discuss and impart family and  social

values.  They must realise that the children grow up to be  like

them  as  the children emulate not just what they advocate,  but

more,   what   they  do.   Parenting  is  a   heavy   task   and

responsibility.   Unfortunately, society  does  not  impose  any

qualifications to become a parent.  We learn from experience and

our  mistakes, but by which time our children would  have  grown

up.   I  believe  that courses in parenting  are  necessary  and

important and will help many to be better parents.  I would like

grassroots  organisations to take up the  challenge  to  conduct

parenting  seminars  and  courses  for  young  parents  in   the

community.   Some community organisations like AMP, Mendaki  and

Family  Service Centres are already doing this.   These  efforts

will help our schools and teachers in doing their work.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> First of

all,  I would like to thank Members, especially Mr Loh Meng  See

and   his   GPC  members,  for  their  feedback,  comments   and

suggestions  so  far.  I am grateful that so many  Members  have

taken  such  an  active  interest in education.   It  is  always

refreshing  to  have  ideas coming from different  perspectives,

challenging our assumptions and triggering off even  more  ideas

on how we can do better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a good education system which has been developed

over  the  years through strong leadership, clear foresight  and

determination,  and  through the commitment  and  hard  work  of

teachers,  students and parents.  We have achieved good  results

by  international standards.  Nevertheless, we are often our own

harshest  critics; and that should be the way.  We should  never

be  satisfied with what we have.  We need to continue  improving

our education system, building upon the solid foundation that we

have.   We  must maintain the rigour and high standards  of  our

system  as we make adjustments and improvements.  This principle

undergirds all our efforts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1769</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing a good education is our investment in Singapore's

future.   The currency crisis and its ripple effects  underscore

the importance of sound fundamentals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound fundamentals extend beyond prudent economic and

financial management to include preparing the next generation to

face any combination of possible future scenarios.  In times  of

prosperity,  it  is the people of Singapore who must  seize  the

opportunities and even create new opportunities.   In  times  of

adversity, it is the people of Singapore who must turn adversity

into opportunity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our schools, our young must learn not just the knowledge

and  skills  for the economy of the future, but also values  and

instincts  so  that  when they come of age, they,  collectively,

will   be   able   to  face  the  future  with  confidence   and

steadfastness,  identify  the  real  problems,  find  the   best

solutions and chart Singapore's destiny.  The better we  develop

their talents and abilities, the better will be the home that we

build together for the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young people are the future of Singapore. And the

Government  has  shown its commitment to invest  in  our  future

through  good times and through not so good times.   This  year,

although  the Minister for Finance has allocated a significantly

larger  budget for education, we should not imagine  that  funds

are  unlimited.  The Minister for Finance still  keeps  a  tight

rein  on things.  Nor should we go away with the idea that  more

spending is the solution for all our problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending more money does not ensure that we will have a

better  system.   I agree with those Members who have  expressed

the  view  that it is the "software" in our system that  counts.

What  we spend on, and how we spend, is more important.  In June

last  year, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong unveiled the vision  of

Thinking Schools, Learning Nation to prepare our young  for  the

future.   Allow me to provide an update on what the Ministry  of

Education has done to move towards this vision.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1770</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step is to define our goals. In any long

journey, we need to set out with a purpose in mind.  We need  to

ask  ourselves  what  is  it that we want  formal  education  to

achieve.   Given  our  transition to a knowledge-based  economy,

given  the demands of life in the 21st century, given  a  likely

picture of the social environment in the future, what attributes

do  we  want Singaporeans to have?  What characteristics  should

our  community,  business,  professional  and  national  leaders

possess?   What intermediate outcomes should primary,  secondary

and junior college education achieve?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January this year, the Ministry of Education published a

document called "The Desired Outcomes of Education" and  Members

have  a copy of it before them.  I need not read it out to  you.

Some  Members have already done this favour on my behalf.   This

document  defines the aims of a holistic education by  giving  a

comprehensive yet succinct list of values, skills and  attitudes

our young at different stages of their education should possess.

The  press  has dubbed this the "88888" list, which I  think  is

quite appropriate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Desired Outcomes of Education" is a reaffirmation of

what  educationists,  parents, teachers and  students  have  all

along wanted a good education to provide.  The list was drawn up

after extensive consultation with our principals and teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice that explicit academic achievement targets

are  conspicuously  absent  from  the  list.   This  is  not  an

oversight.    Cognitive  development  is  one  of  the   desired

outcomes.   And academic performance is one of the ways,  and  a

well-accepted,  objective and rigorous  one,  by  which  we  can

measure cognitive development.  It is a good indicator,  but  by

no  means a comprehensive one nor the only one.  But we can  all

agree  that  we  are looking for more than that from  education.

Our  intention  is to deliver holistic education in  partnership

with parents and the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some wonder if the pursuit of holistic education will mean

a drop in academic standards.  I do not think so.  I cannot see



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1771</b></font><br><br>



why  a more morally upright, socially responsible student should

perform  less  well  academically.  I  cannot  see  how  a  more

independent,  creative  thinker can do worse  than  someone  who

relies  on reproducing facts and content.  This is not a  matter

of  sacrificing academic standards to nurture students with high

moral  standards and community spirit.  This is not an  "either-or"  situation.   Holistic education is entirely  possible  with

high  academic achievement.  Getting good grades in examinations

should  be a product of holistic education, but I agree with  Mr

Peh  Chin Hua that it should not be an all-consuming passion  in

itself, pursued to the exclusion of everything else.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An organisation sets itself performance targets for two

purposes:  to  focus  the efforts of the  organisation,  and  to

measure  the  progress they are making towards  achieving  their

targets.   Focusing  efforts is important  to  the  Ministry  of

Education because in the provision of education, as we can  hear

today, there are many `good' things we can do.  We want to  make

sure  we direct our efforts at those activities that go furthest

in   achieving  our  aims.   But  the  issue  of  measuring  our

achievements does pose some problems.  How will the Ministry  of

Education know if we have achieved these desired outcomes?  What

are our yardsticks?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measure of success will not be easily quantifiable.

How, for example, do we quantify compassion for others?  How can

we  objectively measure a student's love for his country or  his

commitment  to the nation?  Perhaps we will know,  not  when  we

have succeeded, but when we have failed.  However, the fact that

we have no reliable measure does not mean that we should give up

delivering  holistic education.  Ten or twenty  years  down  the

road,  if  we succeed, our economy will be more prosperous,  our

nation  will  be  more united, our society  more  gracious,  our

people  more  creative,  our  community  more  cohesive.   These

outcomes  may not be easily quantifiable nor tangible, but  they

are no less real, and are absolutely critical for our future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now update the House on the progress of various

specific initiatives my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1772</b></font><br><br>



Ministry has undertaken in the past year to achieve the goal  of

Thinking  Schools, Learning Nation, and The Desired Outcomes  of

Education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, National Education. Members will remember that the

objective  of  National  Education  is  to  foster  a  Singapore

identity,  and  to help our young understand the challenges  and

constraints  confronting  Singapore.   Efforts  are  ongoing  to

infuse  National  Education into different  subject  syllabuses.

You will have learnt through the media about the imaginative and

engaging  ways  our schools are bringing the National  Education

messages across, even in extra-curricular activities.



<br>5.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October last year, we also launched the Community

Involvement Programme.  Through this Programme, we hope that our

young  will  learn  to be active participants in  community  and

national life when they grow up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our schools have also started to commemorate key historical

events  in  Singapore's history.  Besides National Day,  schools

now  commemorate  three other events.  These are  Total  Defence

Day, Racial Harmony Day and International Friendship Day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of last month, `Learning Journeys' were

launched.   Pupils  from  Primary Four to  JC2  will  visit  key

national  institutions at least once a year.  We hope  that  our

students   can   understand   the  country's   constraints   and

vulnerabilities,  develop a sense of pride in Singapore,  and  a

confidence  that with ingenuity, determination  and  hard  work,

Singapore  will remain an exceptional island-nation for  a  long

time to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Masterplan for Information Technology in

Education.   Phase 1 of the IT Masterplan has been  successfully

implemented in 22 demonstration schools, comprising  10  primary

schools,  10  secondary schools and 2 junior colleges.   On  4th

April, these schools will be holding an open house, and I invite

Members  to  drop by and have a look.  We are now  embarking  on

Phase 2 involving 100 schools.  In 1999, we will move on to  the

remaining 240 schools.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1773</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, buying and installing hardware is relatively

simple  compared to the training of our teachers  and  providing

our  teachers with the necessary guidance and support.  This  is

most  critical to the success of the Masterplan.  And it is here

that the Ministry of Education has focused its main effort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All trainee teachers in NIE now undergo a course in IT.

Basic  IT  literacy training for all serving teachers  has  also

been  completed.  As their schools come on stream under  the  IT

Masterplan,  teachers  will  receive  further  preparation   and

training which will include the design of lesson plans  and  the

use  of  different kinds of software.  IT instructors  from  the

Ministry  of  Education  go  to the schools  to  work  with  the

teachers  and sometimes even co-teach in classrooms so that  our

teachers are able to learn by observation and practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also set up a Media Services Section which reviews

and   recommends  software  titles  and  websites.   These   are

classified by subjects and by levels.  Teachers have  access  to

this  via  the  Ministry  of  Education  Intranet.   There   are

currently about 350 software titles posted on this site.  I hope

this goes some way to address the concerns raised by Dr Tan Boon

Wan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of new technology at such a pace into the

schools is a little daunting.  But this is the pace at which the

IT  industry  is  moving.  Our schools, which must  prepare  our

students  for  the world of tomorrow, cannot be behind  what  is

already  commonplace in the workplace.  We need to put computers

into  the  hands of our teachers.  After an initial one  or  two

years  of  learning,  experimentation  and  experience,   I   am

confident that our teachers will be able to use computers  as  a

powerful tool to enhance the learning and teaching that goes  on

in our schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also pressed on with initiatives in school

administration.  The School Cluster scheme was piloted last year

to  devolve  greater  autonomy to schools in  order  to  enhance

school management.  In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1774</b></font><br><br>



November  1997,  the Ministry introduced five more  clusters:  2

primary  and  2  secondary  clusters, with  one  mixed  primary-secondary  cluster.  A junior college was also added to  one  of

the  original  clusters formed in early 1997.   The  reason  for

mixing  different schools in the same cluster is to add  variety

and richness of experience to the cluster.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final and fourth initiative, perhaps the most important

one  announced  last  year, is fostering creative  thinking  and

reviewing the curriculum.  The curriculum is important, as it is

the  medium  through  which  most initiatives  in  teaching  and

learning take place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no shortage of ideas as to what we should add to

the  curriculum - everyone has his or her pet topics to put  in:

modern  art, Singapore literature, astronomy, even swimming  and

life-saving skills.  There are comments that our students  today

are   not  as  knowledgeable  or  as  well  prepared  as   their

predecessors,  ergo,  they should be better  prepared.   Several

have  commented that our curriculum is too narrow and should  be

broadened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, many have also expressed the view that our

national  curriculum is too content-heavy,  and  does  not  lend

itself  to  the development of creativity and critical  thinking

skills.  But we must not forget that each topic already there in

the  curriculum was put there for a good reason - to  achieve  a

specific  learning outcome.  The problem then is not a  shortage

of  good ideas as to what to put into the curriculum.  The  real

question  is the opposite one: among all these wonderful  ideas,

what  should  we leave out?  That is the real challenge.   After

all, there is only so much time in a day and so much that we can

ask our children to cope with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the various curricula in different

education systems, and I visited a number of countries this past

year, it does not mean that one with more subjects, more topics,

more  content  is  better.  For example, if  someone  tells  me,

"Look,  the curriculum of this school system covers all that  is

taught in our school system in Singapore and much



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1775</b></font><br><br>



more.  It must be better, let's follow it."  I would say, "Stop,

think a while, think very carefully.".  Most parents would agree

that  what  their  children are now doing in school  is  already

quite  a  heavy load, and we should beware the "more is  better"

syndrome.   In  our case, teaching less may allow  us  to  teach

better.   If  anyone  has found a magic  formula  to  teach  our

national  curriculum and more without over-stressing  our  kids,

please let me know.  I would like to find out how it is done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British have decided that they are trying to do too

much  in  their  primary  schools and  are  failing  to  provide

sufficient  focus  on  the basics.  In January  this  year,  the

British  Education  and Employment Secretary Mr  David  Blunkett

announced  that  from  this year, British primary  schools  will

focus  on  just four things: English, Mathematics,  Science  and

Information Technology.  Minimum teaching hours are mandated for

these four subjects.  The prescribed programme for the six other

subjects  in  the  curriculum have been suspended,  and  primary

schools are no longer required to follow them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the solution obviously is not simply to slash our

syllabuses.  We have to balance breadth and depth.  We  want  to

maintain the rigour in our curriculum and the high standards  in

our  schools.   We need to develop and to deliver  an  essential

core  of  knowledge  in each subject, and to overlay  this  with

higher  order  thinking skills.  Creative and critical  thinking

cannot occur in a vacuum, they can only be learnt and applied in

the context of some content knowledge.  We also want to design a

curriculum that adequately stretches our most able students.  At

the same time, we must be mindful of our less able students.  We

must  not leave them way behind, unable to catch up, discouraged

and disillusioned with school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 1996, the Ministry of Education invited a senior

academic, Prof. Hang Chang Chieh, Deputy Vice-Chancellor of  the

National University of Singapore, to lead an external review  of

our curriculum and assessment system.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1776</b></font><br><br>



The  objective was to provide a fresh perspective; a perspective

of   recipients  of  the  products  of  our  school   system   - universities, polytechnics, and future employers of our students

- as to what they would like to see being taught in our schools.

The  committee submitted its report to the Ministry of Education

in August 1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report has been studied by the Ministry of Education.

One  of the main themes in the report is that the syllabuses are

generally  too heavy and should be cut back to allow  more  time

for  creative  thinking  and application  of  knowledge  through

activities such as project work in the schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has decided to implement the recommendations

which the committee has made on the curriculum in a major review

which we are now undertaking.  But this review will take several

years as it is a major review that will involve not only what we

teach,  but  how  we teach it and how it is assessed.   In  this

review,  we  want  to make sure that not only  do  our  students

acquire  content and factual knowledge, but also process skills.

These  are  significant changes, and we will need some  time  to

study   them  carefully,  consult  experts  and  users,   orient

teachers,  make course materials and design assessment  systems.

We can only introduce the bulk of these changes into the schools

from the year 2001 onwards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, we have decided to take some interim

measures  to  reduce the curriculum load on our students.   With

very  few exceptions, most syllabuses will be reduced by 10%  to

30%,  most  of them in the range of 10% to 20%.  However,  there

will be no change to the structure of the syllabuses, nor to the

examinations nor the type of questions that will be set.   These

interim  curriculum reductions can therefore be introduced  into

the  schools  from  next year.  Some schools  may  already  have

selectively  omitted teaching certain topics;  these  curricular

cuts make it official.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Content which has been reduced or cut include those which

focus mainly on recall, or technical details not critical to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1777</b></font><br><br>



students' understanding of the topic.  Content inconsistent with

real  world practice, too difficult or too broad has  also  been

cut.   Content which is repeated either at other levels or in  a

different subject may be retained in one subject at a particular

level, and removed from the others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will lighten the load so that teachers and students

can  have  more  time  to  implement  the  initiatives  that  we

introduced  in the last year.  This will free up time  for  more

collaborative   learning,  more  self-directed  research,   more

independent investigations, to develop process skills,  thinking

skills, and communication skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These reduced syllabuses will take effect next year, and

students  will be examined on these reduced syllabuses from  the

year  2000  onwards.  This is the first step we are  taking,  so

that  there  can  be an immediate reduction in curriculum  load.

Teachers and students should have no difficulty adapting to this

reduction, as it only involves removing some topics,  while  the

remaining topics and the examination system remain the same.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This immediate reduction will allow a lightening of the

load  from next year, while we do a more thorough review of  the

curriculum  and our assessment system to see how we  can  better

bring out the creative spirit and thinking ability of our young.

Changes  to  the curriculum, if not accompanied by corresponding

changes  to  assessment modes, teaching methodologies,  learning

resources  and learner attitudes, are likely to be futile.   The

Ministry  of  Education will continue to  work  on  these  other

areas.   As  I  said earlier, we will not be able  to  introduce

these major changes earlier than 2001 into the schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the progress described above would not have been

possible, or will come to naught, without the teacher.  Teachers

are key to everything that we do in the education system.  As  I

said  last  year,  teachers are the heart and the  soul  of  our

system.   They are out there in the classrooms, in  the  science

laboratories, in the school field, delivering total education.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1778</b></font><br><br>



The best physical facilities and most innovative curriculum will

not come to life without dedicated and competent teachers.



<br>5.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully endorse the support that Mr Loh Meng See, Mr Peh

Chin Hua, Mr Lim Swee Say and others have given to our teachers.

We  will  take  their comments and suggestions  on  how  we  can

improve the teaching service into account.  The teacher plays  a

crucial role in nation-building.  The teacher's role goes beyond

ensuring  the employability of the next generation.   It  covers

the  development  of his charges in all areas described  in  the

Desired Outcomes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers shape the values of their students, and instil in

them  a  strong sense of social conscience.  Teachers  are  role

models of lifelong learning to their students.  Teaching is  not

an easy job, but it is highly rewarding.  It requires people who

are  caring and nurturing, those who have a sense of mission and

calling.   There  is an immense satisfaction in  moulding  young

minds, shaping lives, helping and encouraging people who will go

on  to  help and encourage others.  It almost certainly involves

tears  and heartaches, but ask any teacher, and he or  she  will

tell you that it is a job that it is totally rewarding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the many demands placed on them, the vast majority

of teachers like what they are doing.  The Ministry of Education

recently conducted a Teachers' Survey and I would like to  share

some  of  the  preliminary  findings  with  this  House.   As  I

expected,  the  vast majority, 83%, of teachers  indicated  that

they  like  the  type  of  work  that  they  do.   Teaching   is

intrisincally  satisfying.   This  is  befitting  of  a  people-centred,  people-development  profession.   83%  indicated  that

their  job makes good use of their abilities, and 88% feel  that

they  can  count on support and assistance from their colleagues

when faced with a difficulty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As some Members in the House, Dr Tan Boon Wan, Dr Toh See

Kiat,  Mr  Iswaran, Mr Lim Swee Say and others have  said,  they

have heard of teachers feeling



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1779</b></font><br><br>



stressed by the rapid pace of change and the amount of  work  in

the  schools.  In this past year, I visited many schools  and  I

have talked to many teachers.  Yes, there is stress and there is

worry.   Our  teachers  work very hard.   Our  teachers  have  a

tremendous sense of responsibility towards the young under their

charge and want to do the best for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am encouraged by the response of our teachers. They are

convinced  that the changes that we are making to the  education

system  are  important and necessary.  But change is unsettling.

Even  as  our  teachers  do their best to deliver  high  quality

education today, they worry about how they will continue  to  do

their best with infusing National Education, or learning to  use

IT, or dealing with more demanding parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps because we have consciously announced initiatives

to all teachers way before implementing them in schools, some of

our  teachers suffer from the stress of anticipating stress!   I

would  like  to assure the House that it is not the Ministry  of

Education's  intention to simply think up these initiatives  and

load  them  on  to the schools.  We will guide our  schools  and

teachers  each  step  of  the way.   As  I  said  earlier,  when

introducing  IT  in the demonstration schools, we  sent  experts

from  the Ministry to work together with and guide our teachers.

And  as  more  schools and teachers get into the IT  habit,  the

scope  for shared learning and faster learning will be enlarged.

In  National  Education, we also have guided our principals  and

National   Education  coordinators  through   various   teething

problems of implementation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The early and timely announcement of our various

initiatives  gives  principals and teachers time  to  adapt  and

adjust.   For example, the IT Masterplan will reach the majority

of  our  schools (two-thirds of them, or 240 of our 360 schools)

only  next  year, two years after we launched the IT Masterplan.

These   principals  and  teachers  have  two  years  to  prepare

themselves  for  this change.  Those schools and principals  and

teachers who felt more ready have been those who have come in in

Phase I and Phase II.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1780</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education is committed to providing

teachers   with  the  support  for  personal  and   professional

development so that they can in turn do their jobs well.  It  is

useful for me to highlight some of the key improvements we  have

made to help teachers to do their jobs better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, the Ministry of Education has implemented

a  series  of  measures to alleviate teachers' workload.   These

include  the  posting  of school administrators  and  operations

managers   to   perform  certain  administrative   and   support

functions,  the streamlining of work procedures (mundane  things

like  payment  of  school fees is now done  by  GIRO,  centrally

issuing  student travel passes so that teachers do not  have  to

keep  on  sticking  these things on), and leveraging  on  IT  to

improve work efficiency (like pre-printed class registers).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of this year, the Ministry of Education

reviewed  the  staffing  needs  of  schools  and  allocated   an

additional 1,000 posts.  This works out to an average  of  three

posts per school.  Larger schools with more urgent needs got  up

to   seven  extra  posts;  others  got  fewer;  some  got  none.

Principals  are  free  to decide how best to  use  these  posts,

whether  to have additional teachers or other support  staff  to

help with the administrative and other duties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But getting additional posts is only the first step. We

need  to  reward our people well, and recruit and retain  enough

people to help us do the important work that we have before us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995, Members will recall that the Ministry of Education

did  a  major  restructuring of the teaching service,  improving

salaries  and  advancement prospects.  I like to  give  a  brief

update  on  what  has happened since then.  Since  then,  15,285

teachers  have  been  promoted to GEO1A/2A  grades,  1,766  into

Senior  Education Officer grades, 454 were promoted  within  the

Senior  Education  Officer grade and  95  into  and  within  the

Superscale  grades.   Approximately,  1,300  officers  will   be

promoted this year.  Altogether, over 80% of teachers would have

been promoted in these three years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1781</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last two years, we managed to recruit an average of

1,900  teachers per year.  This compares with the 1,000 teachers

per year we were recruiting prior to that, which was just enough

to  replace those who had retired or resigned.  After accounting

for  retirements and resignations, the net increase  in  teacher

strength  over  the last two years was 1,366 in total.   We  are

making  progress.  In this current recruitment cycle  ending  in

June, we can expect a good intake as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recruitment and retention of teachers is crucial. If we

can  get a net gain of 500 teachers a year (we have 360 schools)

we  can  add one or two more teachers to every school per  year.

This  does  not  sound like a lot.  But if we can  sustain  this

after five years, every school can have 10% more teachers - 6 or

7 teachers per school.  This will make a big difference and help

to ease the load of our teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only has the better recruitment allowed us to post more

teachers to schools, it has also enabled us to let many more  go

on study leave to improve themselves.  Mr Hawazi and Mr Lim Swee

Say  have  asked about this.  We are seizing the opportunity  of

better  recruitment  to  make an investment  in  the  future  by

allowing  more  teachers to study and improve themselves.   This

year,    386   teachers   have   been   granted   (in-principle)

undergraduate  study leave, as compared to just 80  in  previous

years.  They will be emplaced appropriately when they return.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more teachers in each school, better upgrading

prospects and greater support given to schools and teachers,  we

should  be  more  able to improve retention rates.   This  is  a

healthy  upward  trend  for the Education  Service.   We  cannot

change  things overnight, but over several years,  we  can  post

more  teachers  to  the  schools, and  that  will  make  a  real

difference  to  the workload of teachers and to the  quality  of

education that schools can deliver to our children.  Parents and

the  public  can  help  in this matter by  giving  teachers  the

support, respect and regard due to the profession.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1782</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My call to fresh school leavers and graduates and working

people  who  have  the  passion to teach is  to  come  join  the

teaching  service.  There is no cap on how many people  we  will

take in each year as long as you demonstrate the qualities which

we  look for in a good teacher.  The Ministry of Education  will

provide  the necessary training, both foundation and  in-service

training, to help you to become a superior teacher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what can be made of any student in our education

system  depends  primarily on the interplay  of  three  factors:

character   development,  motivation  and  ability.    Character

development  is most important because the student  must  decide

how  he wants to use his knowledge and abilities - to serve only

himself  or to serve others, to do right under all circumstances

or  only  if  he  stands  a high chance of  being  caught.   But

character  formation takes place almost from the time of  birth,

so  that  children  in  Primary 1 comes to school  already  with

values ingrained in them in their homes, by their parents.   Our

schools  conduct moral education and civics, but  these  lessons

cannot  exist  in a vacuum.  They will either be  reinforced  or

thwarted by messages from home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motivation is important because it determines how the

student decides to use his time, talents and his abilities.  The

school  encourages children to learn, mostly by coaching, reward

and  building  self-esteem,  but  sometimes  by  punishment  and

discipline.   At  times,  our principals  and  teachers  may  be

pushing  too  hard.   They  want to  do  their  best  for  their

students.  And parents expect them to.  You will all have  heard

of  parents  who complain that the teacher has not given  enough

homework, whether it is on a normal school day or over a  school

holiday.   May I add that the Ministry of Education has designed

the  workbooks such that doing every single page in the workbook

is  not necessary for all pupils.  Yet some parents would not be

satisfied unless the teacher has assigned the child to do  every

page, and the teacher marks every page.  This is unnecessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo, Dr Tan Boon Wan, Mr Iswaran, Mr Zulkifli and

others have talked



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1783</b></font><br><br>



about  mindset and parents' education.  I do not want to broaden

the  scope  of  the  Ministry of Education to  include  teaching

parents  as  well.   I  agree that self-help  groups  and  other

community  groups  could  introduce  parent  education  to  help

orientate  parents on how they can best help their  children  in

school.



<br>5.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motivation is strongly influenced by what happens at home.

Which  parent  does not believe that his child  can  do  better?

Which  parent  does  not  believe that  if  they  just  urge  or

encourage  his child to work just a little harder, do  one  more

exercise,  one  more worksheet, spend one more  hour,  that  the

child will get one or two more marks in his examination?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young must reach out to be the best they can be, and

they  must be encouraged and urged to do so.  But they must  not

be  pushed beyond the brink by unrealistic parental expectations

and  demands.   A child who fails to achieve that which  is  not

possible  for  him  to  achieve in  the  first  place,  will  be

demoralised and will have his self-esteem dampened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ability is what schools try to bring out in the student.

We  start with the premise that every student has some talent or

ability.   Teachers, together with parents,  do  their  best  to

identify these talents and help the child develop them.    Every

child  is different, and we should do the best for each,  rather

than expect to make them all the same.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ability without motivation achieves nothing. Motivation

without  character  development is at best misguided,  at  worst

downright dangerous.  Of these three, character development  and

motivation are the most crucial, and these are the two qualities

that  can be most highly influenced by what happens at home  and

by parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wholeheartedly support Members' call for a more holistic,

a  more  wholesome education for our children.  Education  is  a

partnership  between schools and homes.  Our  teachers  will  do

their  best in our schools with what parents put in their hands.

Let  us  each  play  our  part for the  sake  of  our  children.

[Applause.]



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1784</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have spoken at length about our school system today.

There  are other points, especially on higher education which  I

will  deal with at a later time before the end of this  cut.   I

will  ask  Dr  Wong and Mr Chen to deal with some of  the  other

issues that Members have raised today.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Dr Aline K.</b>

<b>Wong):</b> Sir, Mr Zulkifli and Mr Iswaran talked about special

education,  especially from the perspective  of  integration  of

children  with  special education needs  in  the  mainstream  or

normal  schools.   Generally  speaking,  it  is  desirable  that

children   with   special  educational  needs  are   given   the

opportunity  to  receive an education which is  most  suited  to

their  disabilities.  I would like to point  out  that  disabled

students who are able to benefit from mainstream education, such

as  the  hearing  impaired,  the visually  handicapped  and  the

physically  handicapped, do and are already attending mainstream

schools.  Those who are likely to benefit from attending special

education  schools  (SPED) with specially customised  programmes

are encouraged to enrol in SPED schools.  These schools not only

give  them customised educational programmes, they also  provide

para-medical professionals who can help in the rehabilitation of

the  children.   These include speech therapists, psychologists,

physiotherapists, social workers and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the SPED students, although not many, are able to

join   the   mainstream  schools  after  they  make  significant

progress.   Although  it  is  more expensive  to  cater  to  the

disabled in SPED schools, we will continue to encourage  parents

of  disabled students to enrol their children in SPED schools so

that  they  can  benefit from the special  education  that  they

offer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that in some countries in the West, children with

special education needs are said to be fully integrated  in  the

mainstream schools.  But the fact is that many of them  have  to

be  taught  separately from the rest of the class, some  of  the

time  or  for a certain portion of the time-table, because  they

require special assistance.  And not all the schools are able to

give these students the required



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1785</b></font><br><br>



resources  or attention.  I read recently that some  parents  in

the United Kingdom are demanding that their disabled children be

taken  out  of  the  mainstream schools in order   for  them  to

receive specially tailored education.   This is in the UK, after

many  years  of  integrating disabled  children  in  the  normal

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli suggested that perhaps we can set aside some

classrooms in the mainstream schools for SPED children.  We  can

look  into his suggestion on a pilot basis.  We will see whether

this  is  feasible and what kind of resources we  need  to  give

them.   But  I would like to point out from the start  that  the

voluntary    welfare   organisations   are   facing   tremendous

constraints,  because  of the shortage of trained  teachers  and

para-medical  professionals.  It would be easier, in  fact,  for

them  to run the SPED schools whereby they can concentrate their

resources in these places.  And they are also building  purpose-built  schools  to  suit the needs of the  different  disability

groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose if disabled children are integrated in mainstream

schools,  it  will enable students to learn to  live  with  each

other and help each other.  However, it is a matter of balancing

the educational benefits and the social benefits to the disabled

students.   There are already many opportunities for students to

interact and help the disabled.  I think some schools send their

students,  mainly from the secondary levels, to visit  the  SPED

schools  regularly,  some of them even on  a  weekly  basis,  to

attend  and  to help the special children in music  lessons,  in

swimming, in sports, in arts and crafts.  And students from  the

SPED  schools  are  also  regularly invited  to  the  mainstream

schools to attend National Day functions, Children's Day and  so

on.   So  there are plenty of opportunities for them to interact

with each other and learn to care for each other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran wanted to know what more have we done for the

special students in the mainstream schools.  As I said, many  of

the  visually impaired and hearing impaired students are already

attending



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1786</b></font><br><br>



mainstream  schools.  Last year, in FY97, we  have  given  these

students  additional resources.  Now we are giving  the  hearing

impaired students 2.6 times and the visually handicapped 3 times

the  per capita recurrent cost of secondary education.  We  have

added resource teachers for them.  For the visually handicapped,

for  example, they are given assistance with braille, assistance

with the lessons, test, examinations and so on.  For the hearing

impaired, they are taught in sign language, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest MOE initiative for children with special

educational  needs in mainstream schools is with regard  to  the

dyslexic and the autistic pupils.  Since the beginning of  1996,

we  have been working with the Dyslexic Association of Singapore

(DAS)  to set up its learning centre at Ping Yi Primary  School,

and  provide financial and physical resources to the Association

to  expand  its  learning centres in other parts  of  Singapore.

And  since  the middle of last year, we have also been  offering

assistance  to  a  new  voluntary  parent  group,  the  Autistic

Association  of  Singapore (AAS), which has  set  up  a  project

called  the Reach-Me-Project for autistic children who study  in

our  mainstream  schools.  We are prepared to render  even  more

assistance to these two groups of high-functioning children with

special  educational needs who are studying  in  our  mainstream

schools.   Beginning  in  FY98,  we will  help  the  AAS  secure

classrooms in a functioning school and co-fund up to 90% of  the

one-time  renovation cost, subject to a cap of $90,000  for  the

DAS  Clementi  and north zone learning centres as  well  as  the

Reach-Me-Project  of  the  AAS.  So we  will  help  them  secure

classrooms and renovate them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we will fund their recurrent cost on a one-to-one

matching  basis,  subject to a cap of  50%  of  the  per  capita

recurrent  cost of primary education.  This means MOE will  fund

dyslexic  and autistic pupils in mainstream schools  up  to  1.5

times the cost of primary education.  In addition, we will  help

them   identify  suitable  teachers  for  secondment  to   these

associations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1787</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-time renovation grants will cost the Government

$300,000,  while the total recurrent cost to the Government  for

helping  dyslexic and autistic pupils in mainstream  schools  is

estimated to be at $1.3 million per year at the steady state.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran also talked about the need for qualified people

and  the  need  for  professional training of teachers  at  SPED

schools.    There  are, right now, almost 400  teachers  and  60

teacher  aides  in  the 16 SPED schools.  Of the  400  teachers,

about  300  have  received  special  education  training,  while

another   60 are currently undergoing training at the NIE.   The

NIE  has  recently  upgraded its training course  to  a  diploma

course,  and  it has shortened the amount of time  required  for

this  course,  so  that the throughput of trained  teachers  can

increase at a faster pace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, there is a shortage of teachers in SPED schools.

Mr Iswaran is right in pointing out that one major reason is the

disparity  in the salaries as compared to teachers in mainstream

schools.   But I would like to point out that the salary  scales

of  teachers  and promotion guidelines are set by  the  National

Council  of  Social  Service itself.   MOE   has  seconded  some

teachers  - 18 of them - to the SPED schools upon their request.

Their  salaries  are  paid for by the SPED  schools,  but  their

salaries  follow  the salary structure and promotion  guidelines

for  MOE  teachers.  Four of the principals of SPED schools  are

MOE-seconded  teachers and they have been promoted  to  the  SEO

grade for principals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the teachers, as I said, the SPED schools need para-medical professionals. But there is a shortage of

physiotherapists,  speech  therapists,  music   therapists   and

occupational therapists in Singapore in general.  So it is  very

difficult   for  the  SPED  schools  to  secure  such   teaching

resources.   Hence I would not downplay the role of the  teacher

aides.    They  play  a  very important  role  in  the  schools.

Special  education  for  children with disabilities,  especially

those  with  multiple disabilities, is a very  labour  intensive

process.   Sometimes it calls for a one-to-one  kind of teaching

requirement.   So, in face of the shortage of trained  teachers,

teaching



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1788</b></font><br><br>



aides  play  a  very  important role in  providing  the  special

education required by these children.



<br>6.00 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Peter Chen):</b>

Sir, first I would like to touch on an important point mentioned

by  Mr  Zainul Abidin who reminded us of the growing expectation

for  higher education.  Indeed by the year 2000, we expect  that

25%  of  each cohort would enter university, 40% will enter  the

polytechnics and 25% the Institute of Technical Education (ITE).

So,  therefore,  65%  of  each  cohort  will  enter  either  the

polytechnics  or  ITE,  this bulging  middle  segment,  and  the

Government is providing amply for all those who so aspire.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growing opportunity for a polytechnic or ITE education

is  reflected  firstly in the increased intakes into  these  two

institutions  in  the last two years.  Between  1996  and  1998,

intake  into  the  four polytechnics increased by  nearly  1,000

students, from 15,780 to 16,800 this year.  Over the same period

of  two  years, the increase in student intake into the  ITE  is

even  more dramatic.  Student intake nearly doubled, from  5,988

in 1996 to 11,800 expected this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, 65% of each cohort will therefore enter

either the polytechnics or ITE.  Including the 25% going to  the

university,  we  will be providing post-secondary  and  tertiary

education  opportunities to 90% of our young people.   I  should

point  out here one important fact.  Each year, there are  1,200

ITE  graduates who move on to obtain a polytechnic diploma  and,

similarly, about 1,000 polytechnic graduates go on to  obtain  a

degree  at  our  universities.  There are no  cul-de-sacs.   Our

education  system is full of bridges and ladders for  all  those

who seek them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growing expectation for a polytechnic or ITE education

is   not  just  by  more  students  wanting  a  place  in  these

institutions.   As  our  economy  restructures  and   businesses

restructure,  there is an inevitable demand for new  skills  and

new knowledge.  Quite apart from this pull



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1789</b></font><br><br>



factor, many working adults themselves would wish to continue to

learn  and  to  upgrade themselves in order to  keep  themselves

relevant  in  a  changing economy.  To help raise the  education

levels   and   professional  skills  of  working   adults,   the

polytechnics  and ITE offer part-time continuing  education  and

training courses specifically for them.  Currently, there are  a

total  of  41 advanced diploma courses and 7 specialist  diploma

part-time  courses  offered by the polytechnics.   In  the  ITE,

there  are  also a wide-range of courses covering  the  academic

areas like BEST (Basic Education Skills Training) and WISE (Work

Improvement  through  Secondary Education) and  technical  areas

like  ACTS (Adult Cooperative Training Scheme) and MOST (Modular

Skills Training).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enrolments of continuing education courses in the

polytechnics and ITE in 1997 are 7,965 and 75,747, respectively.

You  have  heard  Mr Lim Swee Say talk about the  importance  of

Skills  Redevelopment Programme (SRP).  I will add  that  nearly

90%   of  the  training  places  under  SRP  will  lead  to  ITE

certification and are conducted at ITE training institutes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can perhaps next address the issues raised by Mr Hawazi,

together  with  the questions that Dr Tan Boon Wan  has  raised,

concerning  the  Normal (Technical) students  and  their  recent

enrolment into ITE.  Members will recall last July the fate  and

welfare of the first batch of Normal (Technical) students was  a

subject  of much discussion here.  As this was the first  batch,

we  actually  did  not know what to expect  and  like  expectant

fathers, a number of MPs spoke with some anxiety on the subject.

All  expressed care and concern and encouraged them to join  ITE

on  completion of their Normal (Technical) course.  I would like

to thank all those who have spoken on the subject.  I would also

like  to thank the media for their full support in the publicity

given   to  ITE  and  the  encouragement  given  to  the  Normal

(Technical)  students and their parents urging them to  continue

their education in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1790</b></font><br><br>



ITE.   I  am happy to report that we have been extremely pleased

with the results of the enrolment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first batch of the Normal (Technical) students who

completed  their secondary education in December 1997 was  about

20%  more than the projected annual output of Normal (Technical)

school leavers under a steady state.  This is because the  first

batch included students from the old primary school system.  Out

of  a  total  of  6,740 students in the first  batch  of  Normal

(Technical)  stream, 5,593 or 83% of them  applied  to  ITE  for

technical  training.   In addition, another  2,900  applications

were received from the Normal (Academic) stream.  In response to

the overwhelming number of applications, ITE had to take special

measures  to  expand the training capacity.  A  total  of  8,846

training  places,  comprising 6,431 full-time places  and  2,415

positions  under apprenticeship programmes, were made  available

to accommodate all the students.  This amounts to a 30% increase

compared with the previous year in ITE's training capacity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of Normal (Technical) school leavers who

eventually took to ITE training in January 1998 was 4,918.  This

represents  an intake rate of 73% of the GEC Normal  (Technical)

pool available and it exceeds the target intake of 70%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address Mr Hawazi's question on these 600 Normal

(Technical) students who applied but did not join ITE.  Some  of

them  changed their mind and went on to do something else or  to

work.  Some decided not to join because they could not get  into

the  course  that  they want.  In fairness,  this  is  actually,

proportion-wise, not a frightfully big number.   It  is  10%  of

those  who applied and I do not think that it is something which

we are terribly alarmed with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must accept that the interests of school leavers vary

widely  and  some courses, which are important  to  support  the

growth  of  our  industry, may not be appealing  to  the  school

leavers.   In  terms  of the number of first  choice  applicants

vying  for  places in specific courses, some courses were  over-subscribed.  It is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1791</b></font><br><br>



always  possible to accommodate every first choice applicant  as

the  number  of  places in each course is planned  to  meet  the

technical  manpower  needs  of  Singapore's  economy.    It   is

unavoidable that some applicants will have to be offered  places

in courses not of their first choice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi also referred to the apprenticeship places not

being  fully taken up.  I am told that the requirement of  a  2-year  bond  is a factor for this.  I think we have heard  enough

about bonds over the last week in this House and I shall say  no

more  on  the subject this time.  But I agree that  there  is  a

selling  job,  as  Dr Tan Boon Wan has mentioned.   There  is  a

selling job for courses that are less popular but, nevertheless,

important.   ITE  had  in fact put in place  career  counselling

facilities  for  students to make informed choices  even  before

they  enrol.  This is to provide advice to parents and  students

in choosing courses based on the student's aptitude, inclination

and  interest, instead of just the popularity or glamour of  the

course, or a job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparations made to receive the first batch of Normal

(Technical)  students into ITE this January started  almost  the

day  the students entered Secondary One, Normal (Technical) four

years  ago.   Over  the  last few years, ITE  has  painstakingly

carried  out a comprehensive programme of promotional activities

to  share  with the students and the parents the full  range  of

training  offered  by  ITE  and  the  career  opportunities   in

industry.  They have brought both students and parents into  the

various  institutes  of  ITE  to get  a  good  feel  of  an  ITE

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, their efforts have been well rewarded. The

first  batch  of Normal (Technical) students started  their  ITE

training in January and in the last two months, the feedback  on

their  performance has been positive.  We have the  report  that

the students are motivated and keen to learn, they are quick  in

practical  hands-on training and they are adept in  the  use  of

computers and are able to learn better through the computer mode

of  instruction.   We  will continue to monitor  their  progress

closely and provide



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1792</b></font><br><br>



maximum   assistance  to  help  them  complete   their   courses

successfully.   Measures taken so far to assist  these  students

include counselling and guidance to sustain the interest of  the

students, use of computer-based teaching and learning materials,

simplifying  the  language used in lesson notes and  integrating

more  theories into practical lessons.  We will spare no  effort

to bring the best out of our Normal (Technical) students because

we  believe that the ITE graduates that they will become are  an

essential constituent of Singapore's human resource capital.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now go on to address Dr Toh See Kiat's question

on  education of returning children and what help  is  given  to

them  to settle back into our system.  In any area we can  think

of,  there is no shortage of anecdotes.  But there is  no  doubt

that  the first concern of Singaporean expatriate parents is  to

find  a  school back home for their children.  It  could  be  to

rejoin  a  former school, to join at Primary One or to  join  at

other  levels.   The  Education Information  and  Guidance  Unit

(EIGU)  was created by the Ministry in 1991.  The Unit  provides

an  advisory  service  to the Singapore expatriates  on  matters

concerning the children's education in Singapore and assist them

in  the  placement of their children in Singapore  schools  upon

their  return.   The Unit of course can advise  parents  before,

during  or after their assignments.  There is no time  limit  on

that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key question raised by Dr Toh See Kiat is what help can

be  given to the child to settle back into the Singapore  school

system,  especially with the demands for the mother tongue.   He

asked  if exemptions can be given.  It is known policy that  all

Singaporean  pupils  are required to study  an  official  mother

tongue  language, Chinese, Malay or Tamil, or a non-Tamil Indian

language, in our primary schools.  However, pupils who have been

overseas  for  a  number of years may apply for  exemption  from

offering a mother tongue language at national examinations  when

they  return  to  join  Singapore  schools.   The  Ministry   is

sympathetic  to  parent's  concerns and  has  been  flexible  in

considering applications for exemption on a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1793</b></font><br><br>



case-by-case   basis.   Decisions  are  based  on   professional

judgment on what can be reasonably achieved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, pupils rejoining mid-stream at the primary or

secondary  level and who have not had the opportunity  to  study

the  mother  tongue overseas will be considered  favourably  for

this exemption from mother tongue language at the primary level,

that  is,  the PSLE, or the "O" level or "N" level, or  the  "A"

level  examination.  But the exemption is granted for  only  one

examination.  This means that the pupils who are exempted at the

PSLE are expected to offer an official mother tongue language or

a  minority Indian language or their approved foreign  language,

French,  German or Japanese, when they are promoted to Secondary

One.   The pupil will then offer this language at GCE "O"  level

and at the GCE "A" level examinations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These concessions are only to help the child's transition

back  into  the  Singapore  school  system.   They  do  not   by

themselves   bring  about  any  improvement   in   the   child's

proficiency  in the language.  The parents and the schools  must

ultimately provide the help and encouragement for the  child  to

catch up and improve.  Schools too exercise a certain degree  of

flexibility in helping the returning pupils settle in.   As  the

pupils rejoin Singapore schools at different times of the school

year, parents are understandably concerned about the performance

of  their  children in the school examinations.  Principals  are

given the discretion to decide on a case-by-case basis whether a

child could be exempted from examination and/or promoted to  the

next level.



<br>6.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What might also be helpful are our immersion programmes.

Arrangements  can  be made for children returning  during  their

vacation to attend classes in Singapore schools to ease their re-entry  into  the system at a later date.  Singapore  expatriates

who  wish  to have their children participate in these immersion

programmes can write to EIGU for assistance or apply directly to

the schools concerned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1794</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how serious really is the general problem? A study

among returned pupils from overseas and parents was conducted by

the  Ministry and it shows that generally pupils adjust well and

quickly  to  the  situation they are in.  Existing  efforts  and

induction  by  schools  are adequate.  Pupils'  personality  and

family   background  contribute  to  the  rate  of   adjustment.

Parents' main areas of concern include finding a place for their

children in a suitable school, streaming and assessments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore parents are a resourceful lot. They use a

variety  of coping strategies, including widening the circle  of

friends,  keeping  in touch with the Singapore education  system

through  friends  and  relatives and the Ministry  of  Education

website and the use of textbooks and assessment books.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, all the help that others give can only

be  to buy time to enable the child to acclimatise and catch up.

Nothing can replace the help and encouragement which the parents

and  the schools have to provide and, of course, the child's own

efforts.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, my topic is on Quality Education.

Sir, I would like to declare my interest as a staff of NUS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To develop a national attitude of "Thinking Schools and

Learning  Nation", we need to adopt a holistic quality  approach

to  education.  Although the Education Ministry has an  internal

quality system, we need to develop an internationally recognised

quality assurance system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve world-class standing and recognition, we must

adopt  the  ISO  9000 approach to our educational  institutions.

Clear  quality  policies,  objectives  and  procedures  must  be

documented to ensure that quality services are provided  in  our

Ministry and schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ISO 9000 quality assurance model provides a systematic

approach to ensure that quality services are delivered.  It  has

a   structure  whereby  regular  periodic  quality  audits   are

conducted.   We  should conduct external audit to ascertain  the

quality of students produced.  For example,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1795</b></font><br><br>



secondary  schools should audit primary schools,  pre-university

institutions  should  audit  secondary  schools,  the   tertiary

institutions   auditing  the  pre-universities,   and   finally,

employers auditing our tertiary institutions.  In this  way,  we

can  always  be assured that our students are receiving  quality

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the cost of education is rising and

the  operating budget of the Ministry is tight.  But  we  should

not  compromise on the quality of education.  Thus, I  hope  the

Minister  can update the House as to how he proposes to  achieve

low cost and high quality education in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, the Ministry

continues to build new schools in new estates and sometimes even

in the established estates.  I am certain that the schools built

by  the  Ministry are good schools.  However, there  can  be  no

denying the fact that some schools are better than others.  Even

the  Ministry  has a ranking system for the schools.   Over  the

years,  many  schools  have developed good  standards  and  have

established excellent track records.  Many of these schools  are

either  Government-aided  schools or SAP  schools.   Some,  like

Raffles  Institution,  are Government schools.   Many  of  these

schools have a long tradition and established system and  strong

alumni which contribute to the development of the school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time that the Ministry considered tapping on these

schools for their expertise when they build new schools  in  new

estates.   There  is, of course, the concern  that  if  the  SAP

schools or Government-aided schools are involved in establishing

new schools, the minority races may avoid SAP schools for either

language  or religious reasons.  And this will result in  uneven

distribution of minority races in neighbourhood schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the solution is not to prevent good schools from

establishing  their  tradition and  good  system  elsewhere  but

rather  to ensure that they open up and encourage people of  all

races to join the schools.  Many of these schools have an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1796</b></font><br><br>



established  system, a very strong school  spirit  and  a  loyal

alumni which together make a strong recipe for success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In new estates, like Sengkang and Punggol, where several

new  schools can be built or accommodated, the Ministry may want

to  consider allowing some of these well established schools who

want  to  share their success to set up new schools  and  manage

these  schools.   After  all,  you  want  to  provide  the  best

environment  for our pupils and to build not only  good  schools

but  better  schools.  If we can tap on the value  systems,  the

academic record and alumni spirit of these schools, it will help

the  Ministry  to  establish better schools and  not  just  good

schools.   The Minister has just said in his speech  earlier  on

about the importance of character, motivation and ability.   And

these  very  schools  which have these records  and  established

traditions  are  the best schools to establish  these  areas  of

character, motivation and ability in our school children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, therefore, I hope that the Ministry will consider this.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I rise to speak

in support of single session schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is commendable that $150 million or 17% of development

expenditure  on education in fiscal year 1998 will be  spent  on

converting  secondary schools into single  session  schools.   I

would  like to propose that the Ministry go one step further  to

extend single session schools to primary schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same reasons which apply to single session secondary

schools  also  apply  to primary schools.   These  reasons  are:

first,  students can spend the morning covering  the  curriculum

and  the  afternoon  in enrichment programmes,  extra-curricular

activities  or  remedial  lessons.   Not  only  does  this  give

students  a more all-rounded education, it also offers  students

from  different  classes greater opportunities for  interaction.

This  promotes  bonding  among  students  and  helps  develop  a

stronger  sense of community in the school.  Often, the learning

which occurs outside the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1797</b></font><br><br>



classroom  can  be  just as important as the  academic  learning

within the classroom.  Attributes such as the give-and-take,  of

being  a  team  player, learning to win and lose  gracefully  in

sports  and  games,  are  important in the  development  of  the

overall  person which the Ministry has announced as the  aim  of

education in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that teachers have a greater

flexibility   in   arranging  their   schedules.    They   could

concentrate  on the academic syllabus in the morning  and  spend

the  afternoon in a variety of ways, such as helping the  weaker

students or overseeing the students' enrichment programmes.  The

same would apply, of course, for afternoon school at present.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason is that this would also benefit parents.

Single  session primary schools, by keeping children  in  school

for  a longer time, will fulfill an important component of child

care.   It will take the worry off the parents' minds, regarding

what  the  children were doing after they finished  the  morning

session  or  before they started school in the afternoon.   This

would  be  particularly relevant in the case where both  parents

work  and  there  are no relatives or maids to  look  after  the

children during the day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1987, 38% of married women worked. Today, 47.5% of

married women work.  Broadly speaking, then, nearly half of  all

households in Singapore are already dual income households.   In

10 years' time, it could well be that 60% of households could be

dual income households.  In the eventuality that all schools are

converted  to single session schools, I have one more suggestion

-  start  school one hour later at 8.30 am, instead of 7.30  am.

Then,  there  will  be greater coincidence of  parents'  working

hours  with  children's  school-going time.   This  will  enable

parents  to spend a longer time with their school-going children

in  the mornings and will take care of the child care aspects as

well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I urge the Ministry to consider

extending single session schools to primary schools.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1798</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, my topic is on School Cluster. Sir, I

must  commend  the  Education Ministry for introducing  the  six

hours  per  year  per student community service requirement  for

school   children.   This  exposure  will  definitely  inculcate

community service values among our students.  In fact, a further

step  will  be to encourage more principals and teachers  to  be

involved in community work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I would like to urge the Ministry to restructure the

school cluster management committee so that both the schools and

grassroots  organisations can work together for the  benefit  of

the   community.    To  facilitate  closer  collaboration,   the

Committee  should  be headed by the advisor  of  the  grassroots

organisations  or  a person appointed by the  advisor.   Members

should  include  principals, School Advisory Committee  chairmen

and other appointed members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this structure, the advisor will be able to harness

the  resources of both the schools and grassroots organisations.

The  advisor will also be able to deploy staff and resources  to

ensure  the smooth running of the schools.  Principals, teachers

and  grassroots leaders will thus have the opportunity  to  work

together and share their experiences.  In this way, we not  only

develop the community service value system in our students,  but

also that of our teachers and principals.  At the same time,  we

can develop a community culture in our neighbourhood schools.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, my cut is on

Boarding Schools.  There are very few schools in Singapore which

have  boarding  facilities.  Unlike  in  England,  the  boarding

school system is prevalent there.  May I suggest to the Minister

to  set up boarding facilities in some of the better schools, in

particular,  to  cater  for students who  have  to  travel  long

distances to attend those schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, one of the problems in Singapore is traffic

congestion.  If large numbers of students can be housed  in  the

school compound or within walking distance of the schools, where

the boarding schools are sited, much of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1799</b></font><br><br>



traffic  congestion  can  be mitigated.   I  am  not  suggesting

setting up boarding schools to solve our traffic problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more important reasons for setting up boarding schools

are  for social and educational reasons.  When students stay  in

boarding  school,  they are living in a community.   They  learn

good  social habits.  They learn to give and take.   This  means

that  they learn not to be selfish.  They learn always  to  care

not   only  for  themselves  but  take  into  consideration  the

interests of others around them.  As Dr Lee Tsao Yuan has  said,

in  one  session schools the possibility of bonding between  the

students  is  great.  I think in boarding schools,  the  bonding

would even be greater.  They also learn to be disciplined.  They

cannot  do  things as they like.  They are to a  certain  extent

regimented  because in boarding schools, they shall  have  fixed

hours  for studying and other times for games.  I think at home,

this  kind  of discipline is less because most likely  both  the

parents  are  working.   They  also learn  to  be  self-reliant,

tolerant and independent.

<br>6.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the boarding school system in England has produced

great  leaders,  both in government and in  politics,  and  also

great  administrators.  It was said that the Battle of  Waterloo

was  won  at the playing field of Eton.  Sir, Eton is  a  famous

English  public school.  Eton is also a boarding  school.   What

the  saying  means  is  probably that in  this  type  of  school

environment,  the qualities of leadership, courage, cooperation,

discipline  and  physical  fitness are  inculcated.   All  these

qualities probably help in the winning of the Battle of Waterloo

where  many of the generals and leaders in the battle came from.

Of  course, these qualities will also assist in helping to build

men later in their work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that we should have an Eton school

duplicated   in  Singapore.   But  good  boarding  schools   can

inculcate in our students those extra values which a normal  day

school  would  not  be able to do so.  The ordinary  day  school

lacks  the  element  of  communal living.   Communal  living  is

perhaps the essence of boarding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1800</b></font><br><br>



school.   Sir,  I believe that money spent in building  boarding

schools shall benefit Singapore in the long run.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, I would like to start by commending

the  Minister  and his team for coming out with  this  excellent

document,  The  Desired  Outcomes  of  Education.   A   lot   of

insightful thinking has gone into this document and I  think  it

is  a  first-class piece of work.  There is one particular  line

that  caught my attention and I would just like to read it  loud

here:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The foundation of a person is his value system, from which

springs his outlook on life and his goals in life."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think this is a very important statement. It is

something  that is worth discussing further.  With globalisation

and  technology, the world is getting more and more complicated.

For  the  young Singaporeans to survive in the future, obviously

you  need to have more knowledge.  But with technology, you  can

actually  have  access  to knowledge in a  just-in-time  manner.

Many people say that we should not worry too much about what  we

learn  in  school  because  when  we  need  the  information  or

knowledge we can always have it, when we need it.  This  is  the

just-in-time concept.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the case of the value system, there is no such thing

as  a  just-in-time value system.  With globalisation, the young

Singaporeans  are now exposed to the world.  We are  seeing  all

kinds of influences, bad or good, that are influencing the young

Singaporeans.  My view is that for young Singaporeans  to  think

straight  in the future, it is very important that they  have  a

stronger value foundation.  In that regard, I am very happy that

value  system is being highlighted and given the right  emphasis

in this document.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having recognised the importance of value system, the next

question  is:  how can we do even more to inculcate  a  stronger

value  system in our young?  Here, I would like to present  just

one  small  suggestion.  I believe that there is a limited  time

for  us to teach our students and whatever time we can spend  to

strengthen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1801</b></font><br><br>



the teaching of a value system is something we should not forgo.

Take,  for  example,  the  learning of second  language  in  the

school.   I  noted  that  in our Chinese  textbook,  this  is  a

photocopy  taken  from  a Primary 6 textbook  [indicating],  the

article  is an excellent one.  It is a story about a father  and

son  and the kind of love and care between them.  It is  a  very

moving  story.   But  at  the  end  of  the  lesson,  what   was

highlighted  in  the  revision section is:   what  are  the  new

sentences you have learned in this lesson and what are  the  new

words you have learned in this lesson.  My humble suggestion is,

why  not add another section, and ask the students what are  the

moral  values  they  have learned from this lesson.   I  believe

that,  in so doing, by combining the learning of a language  and

the  strengthening of the value system, we can go a long way  to

further strengthen the inculcation of a stronger value system in

our young.

<br><br><!-- Mr David T.E. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David T.E. Lim (Aljunied):</b> Sir, after that very

stirring  speech by the Minister on what the Ministry has  done,

is  doing  and  will be doing for our students, I feel  somewhat

like  Oliver Twist coming back and asking for more.  But  it  is

nonetheless an important subject and if the Minister  will  bear

with me, I would like to talk about pre-school education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key issue is whether the way we teach our very young

and  what  subjects  we teach them makes any difference  to  the

development of a child both academically or socially.  There are

at  least  three reasons why I believe that a higher quality  of

early  childhood education is beneficial and why we  should  pay

attention to this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Over the last 20 years, our knowledge of how the mind works

and  how  it  develops  has increased.  We  now  know  that  the

stimulation  of  the  mind  at  a  very  early  age  facilitates

learning, especially of language.  It is also well accepted that

there  are  different forms of intelligence and  that  different

children  learn in different ways.  What this research tells  us

is  that  a child who is seen to be slow may simply be  a  child

that is forced into a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1802</b></font><br><br>



mode of learning that does not fit him or her.  Conversely, in a

right  environment, a child's development might well be enhanced

and accelerated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Over the last one or two decades, many educators have

pioneered  teaching  methods  to  take  into  account  a  better

understanding  of  how the mind works.  Admittedly,  some  early

research showed that improvements to IQ scores tested at Primary

1  washed  out after two or three years in primary school.   But

later  studies  have also shown that benefits can  be  sustained

depending  on  the  approach  used.   These  benefits  may   not

necessarily  show up just in academic scores, but  also  in  the

form  of  social  benefits  such as lower  drop-out  rates  from

schools or a lesser degree of trouble with the law.  The results

show  that  learning effectiveness at an early age is linked  to

the  way  we  teach the young child.  But whether or  not  these

results  can be sustained may depend on whether we are  able  to

provide the same supportive environment as the child grows up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Across all cultures, social norms or customs or

practices and values are inculcated from a very early  age.   It

is  true  that  formal  learning,  like  mastering  Mathematics,

Science  or  Economics, can only take place when the  brain  has

sufficiently   matured  and  is  capable  of  certain   abstract

constructions.   But we also cannot deny our instinctive  belief

that  habits and values and attitudes are formed not so much  by

formal   instruction  alone,  but  shaped  by  early   childhood

experiences.   Indeed,  two  of  the  three  pillars  which  the

Minister spoke about, character development and motivation,  are

formed by the time the child enters the formal school system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the approach which early childhood educators take

today is based on the notion that the mind is not a vessel to be

filled  up but a fire to be kindled.  By creating a safe, caring

but  challenging  environment, these educators  stimulate  young

children  to  reach out for new knowledge and not  to  wait  for

knowledge to be dished out to them.  In the process of learning,

the children also build self-confidence.  And in discovering



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1803</b></font><br><br>



knowledge, they also discover the sameness and differences  with

other  children,  learning both acceptance and leadership;  both

teamwork  and  challenge.   By  helping  children  to  build   a

foundation for learning, early childhood educators prepare  them

to  become  more  self-actuating and hence more successful  when

they enter the formal school years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons and reasons given by other Members of the

House  who have spoken on the subject, I hope that the  Ministry

of Education would take a closer look at this important matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the early ages, from two to six, child care and

child development are hard to separate.  Learning is integrative

and  whole life.  It cannot be separated into discrete  subjects

or  periods.  The Ministry can rightly argue that child care  is

not  the  State's responsibility and should rightly be  left  to

parents and market forces.  But it should play an active part in

a  young  child's education.  If we can more fully  realise  the

potential  of our young and produce youths with a greater  sense

of  social  responsibility or reduce juvenile delinquency,  then

our  efforts would have been worthwhile.  Our money  would  have

been well spent.  I realise that the education of the very young

is  still a relatively new area.  There is much we need to learn

and  understand  about which methods are effective  and  how  we

should go about providing better early childhood education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to make two proposals on how we can

make  progress in this area.  Firstly, I would like  to  propose

that  the  Ministry of Education set up a research and  teaching

centre  to  look into early childhood development and education.

The  centre  should gather from other countries those programmes

in  early  childhood learning which have worked and  also  study

those  programmes  which have failed.  It  can  promote  greater

understanding  of  how children learn at an  early  age  and  do

research  into  how effective learning can be  achieved  in  the

early years and sustain as the child grows up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the centre should set up or work with a number of

prototype schools



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1804</b></font><br><br>



to  gain first-hand experience and to see in practice what works

and what does not in our cultural context.  Some private schools

and  kindergartens who have already made a pioneering  start  in

new  learning  methods  could be brought  under  this  prototype

programme.   MOE could provide them with funding assistance  for

them  to  take  an active role in research and development  into

early  childhood  learning and also  to  reach  out  to  a  more

representative  mix of children.  The funding and  staffing  for

these  two  efforts will not be large compared  to  the  overall

school programme.  But it would be well worthwhile if this would

lead to a better educational foundation for our very young.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not every child is a genius though many mothers may

think so.  But there is a genius in every child.  By recognising

the   importance   of  early  childhood  development   and   the

effectiveness  of  early childhood learning,  we  can  set  this

genius free.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, I would like to touch on this

subject  of ranking of schools.  There is a saying that  if  you

feed  peanuts,  you  get  monkeys.  I am  not  saying  that  the

teachers  are  monkeys.  But I am saying that  if  we  rank  the

schools according to results, then we are likely to have all the

teachers concentrating their efforts on producing results.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that there is a junior college whose principal and

school  teachers actually responded to the call by the  Ministry

to promote creativity, and so on.  What they did was to try some

new   methods  of  teaching,  but  as  a  result  the   academic

performance dropped because whatever new knowledge that they had

passed  on  to  the students was not tested.  As a  result,  the

school had now decided to go back to the old way of teaching.  I

would urge the Minister to consider changing the way of ranking.

If  you are talking about producing a whole person, then I think

ranking must reflect the criteria of the whole person.
