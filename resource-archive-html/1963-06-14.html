<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, last

night I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>



read  to  the  House the legal opinion given  by  the

State  Advocate-General's Chambers on  the  point  of

holding secret ballots where there is a certified and

registered  collective  agreement.  The  Member   for

Thomson  accused  us of trying to evade  this  issue.

Here are the facts of the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.K. Tang Ltd, and the Singapore Manual and

Mercantile   Workers   Union  signed   a   collective

agreement  which  was  certified  by  the  Industrial

Arbitration Court on 15th March, 1961. The  agreement

was  for  two years, from 15th March, 1961,  to  14th

March, 1963. On 5th December, 1961, that is two years

ago,  the Singapore Business Houses Employees'  Union

claimed to represent the majority of the employees of

C. K. Tang, and this union requested the Commissioner

for  Labour  to conduct a secret ballot to  determine

union  representation. The Commissioner  for  Labour,

who then was Mr Kok Ah Loy and not Mr Pang Tee Pow,

referred  this matter to the State Advocate-General's

Chambers  for advice, and the S.A.G.'s Chambers  gave

advice  which  I  read  last night.  The  union  was,

therefore,  advised  accordingly.  The  matter   then

rested at that stage without being pursued further by

this union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was after two years, that is on 13th March, 1963,

that  the  S.B.H.E.U. again took up this matter.  The

present  Commissioner for Labour, Mr Pang  Tee  Pow,

then told the union that it could not proceed with  a

secret  ballot because of legal advice  being  given.

However,  in  the  meantime, he  again  referred  the

matter    to    the   State   Advocate-General    for

clarification. The S.A.G.'s Chambers took  some  time

and  it  was  only  on  30th April,  1963,  that  the

Commissioner  for Labour was advised  that  he  could

proceed to hold a secret ballot in cases where  there

were certified and registered collective agreements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From then onwards, any dispute on the question of

representation of unions is always resolved by way of

a  secret ballot. Therefore, a secret ballot was held

in the C. K. Tang case sometime after April.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, last night the Member for Thomson

also made an accusation that the present Commissioner

for Labour, Mr Pang Tee Pow, is biased and is acting

on  instructions.  I will reveal to  this  House  the

facts  of the other two cases so that the House  will

be  able  to arrive at a conclusion as to whether  or

not  the Commissioner for Labour, as a civil servant,

really  acted  on legal advice and according  to  the

statute of the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the case of the Plywood dispute which hitherto

has   had   dealings   with  the  Singapore   General

Employees'  Union.  On  23rd  February,   1963,   the

Singapore   Manual  and  Mercantile   Workers   Union

approached  the  Commissioner for Labour  to  hold  a

secret ballot to determine union representation.  The

S.M.M.W.U.,  on  23rd  February,  that   is,   before

clarification  was  given  to  the  Commissioner  for

Labour on 30th April, also informed this union, which

the  Member for Thomson accused as belonging  to  the

P.A.P.,  that no secret ballot could be held  because

of a legal ruling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again in the case of Seiclene, as late as 16th

April,   I  think,  the  S.M.M.W.U. approached   the

Commissioner  for Labour to hold a secret  ballot  to

determine   union  representation.   Similarly,   the

Commissioner  for Labour again rejected  the  request

because of the legal ruling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all these cases pertaining to secret balk: were

only  disposed  of after 30th April, 1963, when  the

Commissioner  for  Labour was  advised  that,  though

there  may  be a certified and registered  collective

agreement,  a  secret ballot can be  conducted.  From

that  date  onwards,  all cases  that  were  held  up

because of this ruling had been disposed of by way of

secret ballot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson also

claimed  yesterday that the S.A.T.U. group of  unions

believe  in maintaining industrial peace with justice

through  the  machinery of the  Industrial  Relations

Ordinance.  I think all the workers know how  sincere

the Member for Thomson is with regard to this matter.

He   cited  the  case  of  the  dispute  between  the

S.B.H.E.U. and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>



Fraser  &  Co.  In  this particular case,  the  union

managed    to   reach   agreement   through    direct

negotiations  with the employer on all points  except

the  clause  on retrenchment. Immediately  after  the

deadlock, the union took it upon itself to  lead  the

workers to go on strike, instead of adhering  to  the

Industrial  Relations Ordinance which  provided  that

the  next  step the union should have  taken  was  to

notify  the Commissioner for Labour under section  19

that  they had reached a deadlock although  they  had

direct   negotiations.  Had  that  been   done,   the

Commissioner  would  have  arranged  for  a   further

conciliation.  But in this case, the  union  did  not

resort  to this procedure. They deemed fit to  resort

to direct action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Industrial Relations Ordinance, there are so

many  procedures to go through where  every  facility

and every assistance and every effort can be made  to

settle a dispute. Just now, I referred to section 19.

Under  section  19  where the Commissioner  fails  to

effect  a  conciliation, he could notify the Minister

for  Labour  that no further progress could  be  made

through  conciliation.  The  matter  could  then   be

considered by the Minister as to whether it should be

referred to arbitration or further conciliation could

be  made through his good offices. But no, the  Union

did not avail itself of all these facilities. So this

is  one  of  the classic cases where the  Member  for

Thomson  incited  and misled the  workers  to  go  on

strike.  And when he is in a fix, he always puts  the

blame  on  the  Minister for  Labour  or  the  Labour

Ministry that we make no attempt to help them resolve

their trade disputes. In this case, though they  went

on  strike, nevertheless our conciliation officer  on

his   initiative,  immediately  the  strike  was  on,

approached both parties to resume negotiations at the

office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another case where the S.A.T.U group of unions

deliberately by-passed the conciliation machinery and

the  Industrial  Relations Ordinance was  the  recent

dispute  in Singapore Oxygen Ltd. This case  involves

the  question  of transfer. The union  took  up  this

matter with the management. No progress could be made

through direct negotiations. Immediately after  that,

the union



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>



took it upon itself to lead the workers to go on

strike.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in this case, it was the management itself which

referred  the  matter  to the Labour  Department  and

asked  it  to  assist  in effecting  a  conciliation.

Immediately   upon  this  request,  the  Conciliation

Office brought the two parties together and tried  to

resolve  this  matter.  After several  meetings,  the

dispute was then resolved on certain terms. Among the

terms  of  the  settlement arrived at was  that  this

matter was to be referred to arbitration. Here again,

this  is a matter of interpretation. The union  could

have  approached the management and suggested,  after

the deadlock, to refer the matter to arbitration. No,

they went on strike. So after they went on strike and

failed,  they  put  the blame  again  on  the  Labour

Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday the Member for Thomson

said  that  he  was  sincere in  making  use  of  the

conciliation  machinery and the Industrial  Relations

Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Your record shows that!



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Yes. There is a letter here.

After  the  settlement, the management wrote  to  the

union  saying, "All right, according to our terms  of

settlement,   we   are  to  refer  this   matter   to

arbitration." The employer asked the union to sign  a

joint application to refer the matter to arbitration.

But  what  was the reply from the union?  They  said,

"No,  we  are  not  interested  in  referring  it  to

arbitration.  If  you want to do so,  you  do  it  by

yourself." There you are, Mr Speaker, Sir.  This  is

the  conduct  of  this unionist who, in  this  House,

claims that he is being deprived of the machinery and

that  we  are playing politics in dealing with  trade

disputes - [Interruption] These are the facts.  There

are letters here in the file ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> What did the secretary reply?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, last night the

Member  for Thomson also said that we were  deviating

from  our labour policy. The Minister for Labour  had

in  his reply referred him to our labour policy which

we   have   enunciated  in  our  Five-Year   Election

Programme. If he verifies from the programme and  the

work  we  have  done in the Labour Ministry,  he  can

hardly  find  anything to show that  we  have  fallen

short of our election manifesto.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know, of course, that it is a

waste  of  time  for us to convince or  persuade  the

Member  for  Thomson to agree that we  have  strictly

followed  our labour policy which we have  enunciated

in  our election programme. We know that according to

him, the means justify the end, that is, even if  the

workers  are to be sacrificed or they are to  suffer,

it  is  immaterial  as long as  he  can  achieve  his

ulterior  motive  by  all these means,  that  is,  to

introduce a foreign ideology to this country. Whereas

on  our  side,  Mr Speaker, Sir, we believe  in  our

basic  political philosophy and we are  going  to  go

about  it by peaceful revolution. Therefore, we state

that  that is why there is a basic difference between

the  Member for Thomson and our side. Therefore,  the

machinery  and  the facilities; that prevail  in  the

State are detrimental to the manner and activities of

the  Member  for Thomson, because you are aware,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, that from time to time it is announced

in  the  paper that workers have left the  S.A.  T.U.

group  of unions and joined the other unions, because

the  workers  are fed up with them.  They  have  been

misled  and  a classic case was Borneo Motors,  where

their  backroom boy, Mr Lu Shee Peng, fully realised

that, in the agreement, the understanding reached was

that  the  company would endeavour to pay  an  annual

bonus  of one month's salary or more within the terms

of this agreement. This agreement was entered into on

1st  July,  1961. For the year 1961,  the  union  had

advised  the  employees - their members then - to  accept

the  rate  of  bonus as stipulated in  the  agreement

reached.  But in 1962, they deliberately  misled  the

workers into believing that they could ask for more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>



bonus.  All  right, even if they thought they  had  a

case  to  do  so, then the proper and  peaceful  way,

without  causing  lot, of suffering to  the  workers,

would  be  to  refer this matter to  the  Arbitration

Court,  since  this was not a question of  bargaining

over  the quantum of the rate. It was just a question

of  interpretation of the clause. But, no. Again  the

Singapore  Business Houses Employees' Union  led  the

workers  on a strike. After the management had  stood

firm and pointed out the legal position of this case,

they  then  realised that they had again  misled  the

workers. In this case, they forced the workers to  go

back to work. There is no time for me to read through

all the circulars put up by the members who were then

in their union. These members were suddenly then told

that  they were expelled. They refused to go back  to

work.  They  were asked to call off the strike.  They

were first asked to go on strike; the union tried  to

deceive  them that there was a case for them  to  ask

for more bonus. After the union failed, they realised

the  legal  position there and then they  forced  the

workers  to  call  off the strike. The  workers  then

turned  round and said, "Now, what is this? You  have

asked  us  to go strike because there is a  case  for

more  bonus. How is that you want us to call off  the

strike   and  go  back  to  work  without  anything?"

Therefore, the workers put up some arguments with the

Member for Thomson. The Member for Thomson knew  that

it  was  very  embarrassing. The only simple  way  of

doing it is, as I have said just now, as long as  the

means  justify  the end, he just cuts them  off.  The

workers,   fortunately,   were   conscious   of   the

consequences, because the management was  already  on

the verge of serving them with notices of termination

of  services. They immediately approached the  Labour

Ministry   for  assistance.  It  was  only   at   our

intervention that the workers were not made to suffer

unduly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson also accused us of playing

politics in dealing with trade disputes. Mr Speaker,

Sir,   everyone  in  the  Singapore  Business  Houses

Employees' Union knows what the Member for Thomson is

aiming at,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>



and  how they are going to make use of them. You will

remember,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, immediately  after  the

action  in  February taken by the  Internal  Security

Council,  the  Singapore Business  Houses  Employees'

Union  held a meeting in the Hokkien Huay Kwan.  They

passed  a resolution, the usual thing, demanding  the

release  of their trade unionists. They printed  this

resolution  on  paper. Then they  asked  their  usual

runners to go to every branch to force them to  sign,

saying that they must sign individually, each one  of

them,  one  copy  saying  that  they  supported   the

resolution,  to  show that it was  genuine  that  the

workers  were up in arms against the Government.  Not

only  that, Mi. Speaker, Sir, the workers were  asked

by  force  to  donate one day's wages to support  the

detainees'  families, not by voluntary donations.  It

was  by  force, otherwise they would be subjected  to

intimidation. I have often heard workers who  are  in

the  Singapore General Employees' Union say,  "Though

the union may have obtained one or two cents increase

for me, every month or every now and then, I will  be

asked  to  contribute  either to  a  strike  fund,  a

Barisan  rally  or  legal fees. In  the  end  I  have

suffered  a  loss  instead of  gain  by  joining  the

union."  That is a fact. The Member for  Thomson  can

clarify  it from his own members. There is  a  recent

case  of  United Engineers when an old  man  had  the

courage to stand up and fight against the chairman of

his  own  branch.  He refused to contribute  to  this

fund,  because he had his own political  convictions.

He  said,  "I  refuse to. I do not  want  to  involve

myself  in these political manoeuvres." What did  the

branch  do?  The  Singapore General Employees'  Union

used pressure on the employer and forced the old  man

to be sacked from the firm. This is on record. If the

Member  for  Thomson wants any time, we can  ask  the

Press  to hold a Press conference and ask the workers

to come and reveal the story. That is a fact ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> And again, they say they are

always acting in the interests of the workers. But as

I have pointed out just now - [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. This item goes on till 3.15

p.m.  There will be plenty of opportunity for Members

to speak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Everyone knows that in the Bus

Workers Union, they go and tell the employers that as

a  union, in principle, they should have the right to

recommend workers to be employed in the firm whenever

recruitment  is made. Of course, in that case,  their

argument  was  that in 1955, there  was  a  group  of

workers  who  were  dismissed. They  said  they  were

wrongfully dismissed because, at that time, they said

there  were riots and industrial action. So  on  that

ground, the management conceded to their demand.  But

everyone  in the Bus Workers Union and all  Singapore

bus  workers know that that right was fought  for  by

the  workers themselves in order to bring back  their

colleagues into employment. But instead of  using  it

for  the  good  of the ex-employees, the  Member  for

Thomson's  colleague, Mr Fong Swee Suan,  used  that

right to recruit Barisan cadres into the Bus Company.

He   cannot  deny  that.  All  the  bus  workers  are

challenging  him.  Mr  Tan  Say  Kam,  who  is   the

secretary  of that union, was being pestered  and  he

had  to  hide  himself on certain occasions,  because

groups of workers were chasing after him. That  is  a

tact. He cannot deny that. [Interruption]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think probably I will have to

conclude because of the time limit ---



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

We all like to hear more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> The Member for Thomson accused us

by  saying that the basic point in our labour  policy

is  the  reunification of the trade  union  movement.

Yes,  Mr  Speaker. Sir, the word "reunification"  to

the  Member for Thomson means that all workers should

be  grouped  and  dumped on the laps  of  those  pro-Communist agents, so that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>



they  can  manipulate them. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  that

definitely is not our labour policy. We say  that  we

want  to  promote a united democratic and independent

trade union movement. That is our object, and that is

not the way as the Member for Thomson puts it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, all the workers have now

realised - [Interruption] Yes, it is quite true.  They

are coming out batch by batch ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think that point has been

covered  by  the Minister for Labour, the switch-over

of labour unions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> What I am trying to emphasise

now,  Mr Speaker, Sir, is that the workers have  now

realised that they are not going to be made use of as

tools  for  the interests of the Member for  Thomson.

They  have  said  in the past that  those  that  have

switched   from   the   Singapore   Business   Houses

Employees'  Union are the white-collars.  Last  night

they  accused us saying that that we held in contempt

the English-educated class. But he is now saying that

those chaps who drifted to us were English-educated ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> When did I say that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> You refer to your record. Now,

the  industrial  workers from the General  Employees'

Union are coming out batch by batch. This morning  in

Pepsi-Cola,  known as the Union Ltd.,  a  ballot  was

held.   These  are  the  Chinese-educated  industrial

workers.  Out  of  146 employees, 133  voted  in  the

secret  ballot and 101 voted for the Singapore Manual

and  Mercantile Workers Union; only 27 indicated that

they  were  not members of the Singapore  Manual  and

Mercantile Workers Union. So I presume that this  can

be  an indication that there are only 27 members  now

who  are  members of the Singapore General Employees'

Union.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said last night, I quite appreciate how anxious

and  frightened  the  Member for Thomson  is  getting

nowadays.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I suggested last night that the

Parliamentary Secretary and his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>



Minister  should bring the whole of the  Ministry  of

Labour to this Chamber so that they can refer to  all

their files. It appears that they have at least  half

the Ministry here.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Half the Ministry?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> In terms of documents and files, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I see.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is only a quarter

of an hour, and it is not possible for me to touch on

every  single  case that the Parliamentary  Secretary

raised in the course of his speech. Therefore, I just

want  to confine myself to one or two points and also

to explain our basic accusation that the Government's

labour  policy  is  a  policy of convenience  to  the

Government. I said last night that they  had  a  very

inconsistent  labour policy because the concentration

given in solving trade disputes was political and not

on the merits of trade disputes as such.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take the case of Fraser and Co,

which  is  a  very  recent  case.  The  Parliamentary

Secretary  just  said  that  an  agreement  had  been

reached   between   the  Singapore  Business   Houses

Employees' Union and the employer on all claims  that

were  submitted by the union before the  strike  took

place.  Sir, that is correct. That is so. But in  the

usual  style of fabrication, he has seen fit  not  to

tell the whole truth. Sir, negotiations commenced and

were concluded on all items submitted by the union to

the  employer  under  section 16  of  the  Industrial

Relations  Ordinance as claims of the members.  After

the  settlement was reached in a peaceful atmosphere,

the employer brought up the question of retrenchment.

The  employer  wanted an item to be included  in  the

collective agreement covering retrenchment. Sir,  the

union  objected  to  this. In  this  connection,  Mr

Speaker,  I would like to draw the attention  of  the

House  to  section 27 (a) of the Industrial Relations

Ordinance.  This  is  a recent  amendment  which  was

introduced by the Government last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any person or trade union which enters into

negotiations in relation to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>



industrial matters otherwise than in accordance  with

the  provisions of this Part of this Ordinance  shall

be  guilty of an offence under this Ordinance.'  Sir,

the  provisions in this Ordinance for  a  negotiation

are   sections  16,  17,  etc.  In  section  27  (a),

employers are also included. If the employer wants to

introduce  an  item to be included  in  a  collective

agreement, the employer should serve under section 16

as  provided.  En  the  case of  Fraser  &  Co.,  the

employer did not do this. Surely the union was  right

in insisting that the retrenchment question could not

be  included  in  the collective  agreement.  So  the

strike took place because the employer was insistent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conciliation officers of the Ministry of Labour

who  handled  this dispute know the facts.  Only  two

days ago we received the letter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, on a point of explanation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> No, Mr Speaker, I do not intend to give

way because there is not the time - [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, there is not the time, and I

am sure it is only fair that I try and explain one or

two  points  that the Parliamentary Secretary  raised

just now which gave a completely distorted picture of

the facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that was in the case of Fraser. Only two days

ago,  we  received  the letter from the  conciliation

officer  who  informed us that he regrets  he  cannot

solve this problem because the employer does not want

to  concede  at  all. The current  situation  in  the

dispute  is that the employer wants to sack  all  the

workers. As far as the employer is concerned, he  has

sacked all the workers and they are no more employees

of  Fraser  and  Co., and, therefore,  the  Singapore

Business  Houses  Employees Union cannot  enter  into

negotiations.  This  again  is  a  violation   of   a

provision  in  the I.R.O. There is a provision  which

says  that  no  employer  can victimise  workers  for

having  taken  industrial action. The  employer  also

says  that  the workers had breached the contract  of

service  by staying away from work because they  were

on strike. Sir, a strike, I would like to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>



point out, is a legitimate weapon guaranteed to the

workers under the laws of the country, and,

therefore, that again does not arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would like to deal with is ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No such law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> --- the question of secret ballot. Sir, what

the  Parliamentary  Secretary and the  Minister  have

said,  I  repeat,  only confirms what  I  have  said,

namely,  the  Ministry has no consistent policy.  The

Minister   himself  or  the  Parliamentary  Secretary

admitted that there were two opinions given  to  this

interpretation of secret ballot in the context of  an

industry where a collective agreement exists. Sir, we

know  how  these opinions were got. We know why  they

were got and we know how they were applied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while, on the one hand, the Ministry refused to

hold  a secret ballot on the ground that there was  a

collective  agreement in force, on  the  other  hand,

there  were workers switching sides in certain  firms

where there existed collective agreements. So if  one

goes through the list of these switch-overs, one will

note  that,  in some cases, switch-overs took  place,

although there was a collective agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary said that we were

informed  of  the  reasons why a  secret  ballot  was

refused.  This is untrue. We were not  even  given  a

reply  to  letters that we wrote to the  Commissioner

for  Labour. It is because of this. Mr Speaker, that

last  night  I said that it is regrettable  that  the

Commissioner  for  Labour, who is a  public  servant,

plays  politics also. I said that we appreciated  the

work  of  the  majority  of the  labour  conciliation

officers.  But  I  cannot  say  the  same   for   the

Commissioner  for Labour. His conduct has  been  such

that  he  has treated large groups of unions  with  a

political  bias.  Yesterday it was  reported  in  the

papers.   Mr  Speaker,  he  talks  of  anti-national

elements being a threat to Singapore while he  is  in

Geneva.  I do not know who wrote the speech for  him - by the Minister for ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> He is delivering the

speech on my behalf.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> But the papers did not say that. Perhaps

it  was  a  speech written, as the Minister says,  by

himself.  Sir,  this question of we  being  dangerous

Communists who extort the workers, squeeze money  out

of them, force them to sign circulars, etc., I think,

is  too  stupid a charge for me to reply. I can  only

say  that  the  Government Benchers  must  have  some

respect for the intelligence of the workers. Sir,  we

do not despise people like they do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Business Houses Employees' Union

is just one union. The total membership of that union

is  in the region of 10,000. The 40 odd unions, which

are  directly affiliated to S.A.T.U., represent  over

100,000  workers. I think it is insane for anyone  to

suggest  that 100.000 human beings can be intimidated

by  us.  We  do not have the things they have  -  the

police;  the  State  machinery. We  have  nothing  to

threaten them with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Thugs!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> They have got thugs. The Secretary of the

Singapore  Bus Workers Union was beaten up  by  thugs

who  were  employed  by  the  Manual  and  Mercantile

Workers  Union.  They do this. They  are  talking  of

thugs!  Sir,  as  an incentive to  get  some  leading

workers  to  work for them they have  a  few  agents,

discredited and questionable characters  like  T.  V.

Gomez,  who  spent  money taking chaps  to  bars  and

indulging  in  everything  under  the  sun  which  is

questionable  and  immoral. Sir,  I  am  prepared  to

substantiate  everything that  I  say  here.  If  the

Government  wants, they can give me the  opportunity,

and  I  will have sufficient witnesses to show  which

bars  are  frequented, how much money is used,  where

this  money  comes from. And they talk  of  us  using

thugs!  I do not think anybody can seriously  believe

that if we really use thugs, the Government will say,

"Jolly good, you use thugs. We will just keep quiet."

They  will lock us up. Sure, they will do. Sir,  they

are waiting for the opportunity to smack us down.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They dare not arrest the Assemblymen under the

P.P.S.O., but they are waiting for an opportunity.  I

am  sure they must be very sorry that they have still

not got me because I have been a little slippery.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time has expired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time allotted for Head 46 having expired, the

following amendments, standing in the name of Mr  S.

T. Bani, were not proceeded with:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 46 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (40) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 46 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,101,010 for Head 46 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 47 -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 47 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the benefits - if I may say so - which I

hope  will  ensue  for Singapore out  of  the  recent

drought is the realisation by the Prime Minister that

trees  are  an  essential commodity  which,  if'  not

looked  after  and planted from time  to  time,  will

eventually involve the country in rainless days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the City Council was a going concern,

there  used  to  be a department which was  specially

entrusted  with  the  planting  of  roadside   trees,

pruning them, looking after them, bringing them  down

and  replacing  them  wherever necessary.  Since  the

present  Government took office, they have  wound  up

the  City  Council and with it has gone the incentive

for  the department which was looking after trees and

the planting of trees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it is a phenomenon of recent times that housing

estates  are  springing up in  large  numbers.  Large

areas  which  have  been wooded are being  constantly

felled down and houses being erected, with the result

that a lot of trees have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>



been brought down in Singapore and they have not been

replaced.  Roads have been put through these  housing

estates    and   when   you   visit   these   housing

estates - although  we  have  nice  houses   and   nice

gardens - you  will  find  that  they  are  bereft   of

roadside  trees or big trees. The Prime Minister  has

now realised how important it is that trees should be

planted  and,  where brought down,  others  in  their

place should be planted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the Prime Minister's statement and I

do  hope that in future, not only will the Government

or  the department which has now been entrusted  with

the  planting  of trees take a more active  and  keen

interest  in the planting of trees, but will convince

estate developers that merely to bring down trees  in

their estates to give way to houses and roads is  not

the end of a housing estate and that they should also

be encouraged, if not coerced, into planting trees on

the roads and elsewhere.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this particular

branch  of the City Council, the Parks and Recreation

Division,  was transferred to the Labour Ministry  in

accordance  with the integration of the City  Council

into the Government machinery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that in the last one or two years there

has  not been much work done by this Division  simply

because  we  have  lost the Chief Parks  Officer  who

resigned  for some reason or other, and we have  only

managed  to find a replacement in January this  year.

We  are  now  proceeding actively, as the Member  for

Farrer  Park  has pointed out, with the  planting  of

trees and looking after gardens and playgrounds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,454,030 for Head 47 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 48 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Lin

You Eng ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 48 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am not

moving.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member is not moving.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 48 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (22) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1959, the P.A.P. made a series of promises, but

up  to  today  they  have not  kept  them.  In  their

pamphlet  there is a paragraph which  says  that  the

P.A.P. will  build more creches to enable  women  to

come  out of their homes to take part in the task  of

nation  building. The P.A.P. have been in office  for

four years and their downfall is coming fast. The sun

is  now setting for them. The signs are that they are

not  able  to  build these creches  which  they  have

promised. Of course, a politician can make a  lot  of

promises  at  election time, but  when  he  comes  to

office,  he  pays attention to acquiring  a  car  and

other material luxuries. I would like to ask how many

creches have been built in relation to what has  been

promised?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore are concerned with the

question of whether their interest and welfare can be

looked after. I understand a number of staff who were

not  liked by the Government had been sacked. I would

like  to  ask  whether the staff  employed  in  these

creches are subjected to intimidation, because  there

is  a rumour to this effect. I would also like to ask

the  Government whether such a situation  exists.  If

this  is so, then the people will view with suspicion

the  policies  of the Government. I  would  like  the

Minister to explain.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as I can

gather  from  the speech of the Member for  Moulmein,

what  he  is  asking is, how many creches  have  been

built  by  the  Government since  its  assumption  of

office?  For  his  information, one  new  creche  was

opened  in  1962 and four new creches are  now  under

construction: two will be completed in another two or

three months' time, one will be completed at the  end

of  the year, and the other one probably in the early

part of next year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to how the staff working in the creches are

promoted,  I can only inform the Member for  Moulmein

that   there   are  set  rules  and  procedures   for

recommending  promotions, and in any case  all  staff

promotions  and  appointments  arc  governed  by  the P.S.C.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, just now we have heard the reply  given

by  the Acting Minister for Labour to the Member  for

Moulmein. From his reply, we can see that the workers

of  Singapore, especially the domestic  servants,  do

not  receive  any  benefits from the  Social  Welfare

Department. These people place high hopes on the fact

that  they  will  be  able to  send  their  sons  and

daughters to the creches to receive care in education

and  health. It is not possible for these  people  to

employ  servants. From the reply of the Minister,  we

can  see  what help the Government has given  to  the

domestic  servants.  The Government  claims  to  look

after  the interest of the poorer classes, and  these

domestic  servants belong to the poorer classes.  The

Ministers  who  are elected from the  populated  town

areas  know  that they need people to  help  them  in

their house work. That is why more creches should  be

built.  I  understand the Government have  not  built

more than ten creches during the last four years and

that  some of them have not been completed. In  1961,

only one creche was built. We do not see more creches

coming  up  now.  All  this goes  to  show  that  the

Government are not really sincere in helping to  look

after  the children of housewives and household women

so that they can go out to work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also said that the management and control of the staff employed in the creches are in the hands of the P.S.C.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's method of recruiting staff to the

creches is not according to set rules. I can  give  a

very  clear  example. In the creche in Kreta  Ayer  a

certain  member  of the staff there  was  sacked  not

because   he   committed   an   offence   under   the

regulations,  but  I  believe  because  of  political

reasons. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>



member  of the staff was sacked for only one  reason.

On  that  night in question he was in the creche.  He

invited  his  friends to a makan.  In  the  meantime,

certain members of the P.A.P. branch There telephoned

the  police saying that there was an incident in  the

creche and; asked the police to investigate. A police

inspector went there and took down the identity  card

numbers  of  all  those present at the  makan.  These

people  were all friends of the member of the  staff.

They  used  to frequent that place, i.e.,  the  place

where  they  were then feasting. But  the  Government

sacked  this member on account of his giving a dinner

to  his  friends. Mr Speaker, Sir, this  person  had

been employed for a long time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this we can see that the fate of the staff is

in  the  hands of the P.A.P., and it is their loyalty

to  the  P.A.P. that decides their  appointment  and

fate.  This  should  not be so, because  creches  are

maintained   from  public  money.  The   P.A.P. are

recruiting   their   own  members   into   Government

departments in order to deal with those who  are  not

in the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the resources

of  the State are limited and the amount that we  can

spend  on  social welfare services for the people  of

Singapore  are  limited to a sum that the  State  can

afford. And within this limit of the State resources,

we  are  trying  to  `do as much as  we  can.  Social

welfare   services  are  not  confined  to  providing

creches  for  babies  of working mothers.  There  are

other  forms  of social services. If the  Member  for

Choa  Chu  Kang  fails  to see any  of  these  social

welfare services provided by the Government,  then  I

can only say he is perhaps blind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Choa Chu Kang has

mentioned the dismissal of a creche assistant working

at  the  Kreta  Ayer  creche.  The  creche  assistant

referred  to is a Miss Soh Hwee Hong who incidentally

is  concurrently charged in connection with the  City

Hall riots. During the referendum campaign last year,

this creche assistant happened



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>



also  to  be  an  Executive Committee member  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis Tanjong Pagar Branch.  During  that

campaign,  the Barisan Sosialis Tanjong Pagar  Branch

(it  was  their Kreta Ayer Branch at that  time)  was

finding  it  difficult to get a place to  hold  their

branch meetings. The idea then struck this particular

creche assistant that the creche at Kreta Ayer  could

be  a wonderful place - being very spacious - for branch

committee  meetings and indoctrination  sessions.  So

she applied pressure on a friend who is a creche amah

to  allow  her to invite all members of  the  Barisan

Sosialis Kreta Ayer Branch Committee to hold meetings

in this creche. This was found out. The police raided

the  place  and  found  that there  were  no  cooking

utensils,    no   food.   Subsequently   disciplinary

enquiries were held under the Disciplinary  Rules  of

the City Council.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> Of the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The creche assistant happened to

be  on the City Council staff. Surely the Member  for

Choa  Chu  Kang must admit that the creche is  not  a

dining hail or a guest house for the creche assistant

working there to invite her friends and partake of  a

dinner at a social function. In any case after office

hours  no officer of the creche is supposed to invite

members  who are not the staff of the creche  to  the

creche. The Disciplinary Committee constituted by the

City  Council Disciplinary Rules deliberated and  the

persons   concerned  were  found  guilty  and   their

services terminated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, we all know that the branches of the P.A.P. are without cadres. They are using the community centres for their party activities. As far as I know, there are 112 community centres at present, and the P.A.P. are using them as centres for

political  activity.  For  example,  if  V.I.P.s  are

visiting, or the Prime Minister is visiting, the only

method  of the P.A.P. Government is to hire buses  to

transport  people  from these community  centres  and

take   school  children  with  flags,  and  to   send

supporters  to  receive  the  V.I.P.s  In  fact,  the

community  centres are not used as a means of  social

welfare  work. The Prime Minister has agreed to  make

use  of community centres as clinics during the  day,

and at night to use them as veterinary centres. Up to

now, all we know is that the purpose of the community

centres has not been accomplished. The Government has

used  these  places only to conduct  their  political

activities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, there

is  one thing the P.A.P. can be proud of, and that is

the building of community centres. The reason for the

building of so many community centres in Singapore is

that  the  P.A.P. wants to give  employment  to  its

members.  Therefore,  as more community  centres  are

built they can have more P.A.P. supporters. And  this

can be proved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many P.A.P. branches are situated near community

centres,  because  no one wants to  work  in  a  P.A.P.

branch. So the most convenient way for them to do  is

to build a community centre near a branch or to build

a  branch  near a community centre. The other  reason

for the building of community centres is to install a

television  set in the community centre so  that  the

people can see the beautiful faces of the Ministers.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> The

worst is more beautiful than yours!



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> I am not as beautiful as you

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not know whether that is

a compliment to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>



Speaker or to the Minister. But the Member must

remember that he is addressing the Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my constituency

is very small and, if I am correct, there are nearly

ten community centres there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng (Serangoon Gardens):</b> I am not

speaking.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> I will speak later.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If there is time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rajaratnam is answering for the

Minister for Labour?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Contributing my little bit.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, all right, but time is limited.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, since some Members of the

Barisan  Sosialis are not speaking, though they  have

given notice of the amendment, I thought I might do a

little  service by filling in the gap.  It  is  quite

obvious  that  throughout this  debate,  before  July

1961,   whether   it  was  community   centres,   the

Industrial Arbitration Court, or everything that  the

Government  did was good. After July  1961  the  same

things  have  become bad. The community centres  were

established  long before 1961, and many  Members  who

are now in the Barisan - if you look up the Hansard you

will   see  it -   paid  a  glowing  tribute  to  these

community centres.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was quite a different story after 1961. So it is

quite  clear,  Sir. The community  centres  have  not

changed - the organisation, the method of operation  is

still  the same. But the political objectives of  the

Barisan  Sosialis  have  changed.  They  see  in  the

community  centres  another  bulwark  against   their

political objectives. If the community centres are as

they  now  claim - purely centres for preaching  P.A.P.

propaganda,  for training cadres for the P.A.P.,  for

mobilising people, as they say, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>



bundle  them into lorries to cheer V.I.P.s   - if  that

were  so, then I am quite sure they must give  credit

to  the intelligence of the people of Singapore  that

they are not going to allow themselves to be used  as

cheer  leaders  for  V.I.P.s.  They  can  go  to  any

community centre today, or any night. They will  find

that people go there to play basketball. I cannot see

any  P.A.P. propaganda but I can see basketball being

played, sewing classes and cooking classes going  on,

and people resting. I can tell them, Sir, that if, as

they  have  indicated, the P.A.P. community  centres

are'  recruiting  grounds for the  P.A.P.,  then  the

P.A.P. is even stronger than they deny it is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime last week, I had the good fortune to

celebrate  the third anniversary of the Kampong  Glam

Community Centre. The ordinary people there collected

about  $3,000 or $4,000 to put up a Teochew drama  to

celebrate the occasion of the community centre.  They

were   even   quite   prepared   to   publish   their

names - despite the Member for Thomson, they know  that

if  they published their names, they would be  marked

men - as  they  knew  it had nothing  to  do  with  the

P.A.P.,  and  because they believed in the  community

centres, they felt that the occasion merited spending

some money of their own not on celebrating the P.A.P.

but to say that it is a worthwhile welfare enterprise

by  the Government. They say that their kids now  can

go  there and learn something instead of joining  the

little picnic parties that are occasionally organised

by the Barisan Sosialis. The kids can now go there to

play  basketball, learn to cook, learn  to  sew,  and

watch television. I wish that occasionally Members of

the  Barisan  Sosialis would go to  their  respective

community  centres  and learn something,  instead  of

coming  here  and  saying very silly  things  against

which  we have warned them. If they could only go  to

the  community centres and enjoy the amenities there,

they  themselves  would thank the Government  for  at

least  having  provided them with one social  amenity

which is non-political.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, when

this  House  was  debating the Annual  Estimates,  we

noted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>



that there were some reductions in a number of items.

But  in  this item regarding development of community

centres,  there has been an increase  to  $2  million

from $1½ million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Minister for Finance says that there will be an increase of up to $3 million next year. Is that so? Well, it appears that the P.A.P.'s industrialisation programme has turned into the development of community centres because, in 1959, when the P.A.P. came into office, there were only 18

community  centres.  But  to  date  there   are   112

community centres. This, of course, shows that it  is

a  great  achievement on the part of the  P.A.P.  But

what we are concerned with now is this. For what  and

for whom are the community centres? If they are meant

for  the people, then, of course, they must be  given

all  the  credit. But the community centres of  today

are  meant for the service of the P.A.P. I must point

out  this together with the other facts, to show that

my point is right and how community centres are being

used by the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on 7th June, the Minister for Labour said in this House that there were 485 members staffing the community centres. I believe that of the 485 members of the community centres, there is a percentage of up to 90 belonging to the P.A.P. They are members of the P.A.P., up to 90 per cent ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the

Minister for Labour also said, in reply to a question

put  by  the  Member  for Jalan  Kayu,  that  in  the

community centre in Yio Chu Kang, there was a  person

known  by  the  name of Choh Ee Min. This  person  is

actually a member of the P.A.P. Jalan Kayu Branch. He

is  also working in the community centre. In  my  own

constituency,  I  think the Government  is  going  to

build up to 15 community centres ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You had better watch out!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, out

of  the  15, eight have been built and every  one  of

these  eight is staffed by P.A.P. members. The P.A.P.

are  building community centres as their own branches

in order to deal a blow against the Barisan Sosialis.

My own branch is in Woodlands. But because the P.A.P.

are unable to deal with the activities of the Barisan

Sosialis, the Land Office has given us notice to move

away  from  the place to give way to the construction

of  a community centre within two weeks. Mr Speaker,

the   Minister  for  Culture  and  the  Minister  for

National  Development say that  our  building  is  an

unauthorised  building.  But  I  can  give  them  the

receipt  of  assessment and other documents  to  show

that the building is authorised and has been approved

by the Government. So when I went to the officials in

charge   of   the  Land  Office  and  other   various

departments, these officials told me that they  could

not do anything. When I asked for a reason, they said

it  was  because  the Government wanted  to  build  a

community centre there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, my branch has been demolished and in place of it there is a community centre coming up. This is only one example to show that my point is correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expenditure intended for the community centres

is  very great, up to $2 million. But this sum of  $2

million is only being used for the propaganda work of

the P.A.P. now and in the future. On the 13th of May,

1960,  this  House approved the People's  Association

Bill. A period of three years has elapsed, and during

this  period  we  have  not  been  able  to  see  the

Government giving us the actual accounts with  regard

to  the  expenses in the community centres. How  much

money  has been spent, we do not know; and for  whose

service  are the community centres meant, we  do  not

know  either.  In  fact,  every  department  in   the

Government  has given Annual Reports, but  there  has

been  no  Annual Report from the People's Association

with regard to community centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you will remember that on the 16th of January, 1961, this House

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>



passed a resolution to set up a Commission of Inquiry

into  nepotism in the various Government departments.

About  two  years have passed. How  is  it  that  the

Government  has got no guts to set up this particular

commission  to  look into nepotism in  the  community

centres? Since the Government is so anxious to  carry

out  a  Commission  of  Inquiry  into  the  students'

boycott in the examinations, how is it that it has no

guts  to  set up a similar commission of  Inquiry  to

look  into  the matter of nepotism? Mr Speaker,  the

facts  are  very clear. If the Government sets  up  a

commission  of this nature to look into  nepotism  in

the community centres and other departments, then the

P.A.P. will  not  be  able  to  cover   all   their

irregularities.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I Member must keep an eye on

This  item  gives over at 4.10 p.m. and  there  other

Members wishing to speak; there are other items.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I will

only  take  one  more minute before I  conclude.  The

facts  are  very clear. Every Government department's

expenditure  is  decreasing, but the expenditure  for

the  community centres is increasing. This gives rise

to  much  concern.  Our concern is this.  The  P.A.P.

Government  are  now  attaching their  hopes  to  the

community  centres which they think will replace  the

activities  in  their branches.  In  fact,  they  are

carrying   out  party  activities  in  the  community

centres as they would have done so in their branches.

In  Bukit  Panjang there are activities of the  Party

branch's sewing classes who are paid from the vote of

the  community centre. The Members seem to deny this,

but  I  only hope that the Government will set up  as

quickly  as  possible a Commission  of  Inquiry  into

political nepotism if they have the guts.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for

Culture, when he replied to the allegations  made  by

the  Barisan Sosialis Members that community  centres

are  being used by the Government for political party

purposes, did not deny that allegation. He only said,

"Well, when they were with us,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>



they  liked it. Now that they are no longer with  us,

that is why they are objecting." In other words, what

he  is  trying to say to the Barisan Sosialis now  is

that  the  grapes are sour. We have  always  taken  a

consistent  stand.  We say that the  Government  have

been using this vote for their own political ends. We

have  been  saying  that  for  years.  The  community

centres  (in  other words, the People's  Association)

are the second political arm of the P.A.P., the first

arm  being the Work Brigade. I would have touched  on

that had there been time, but because I lost time,  I

had  no  chance  to  say it. But on  these  community

centres, under the People's Association Ordinance, it

is  a  clear indication that they are nothing  but  a

political arm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the development of community centres is, in

fact,  a  very commendable thing to do and  we  would

have supported the Government every time for more and

more  community development if they had not tried  to

make use of community centres for their own political

ends.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are indeed most concerned, especially now when

we  are getting nearer towards general election time,

that  the  Government want an extra  half  a  million

dollars  for  them  to  play party  politics  in  the

community  centres. There had been community  centres

before  the P.A.P. came to power. But these were  run

by  voluntary organisations. There was no attempt  at

all  to channel community centres for the use of  any

political Party. But since the P.A.P. came to  power.

they  introduced  a  law,  the  People's  Association

Ordinance, and one can see one thing from the  set-up

of  the  Board of the People's Association, with  the

Prime  Minister as Chairman, the Minister for  Labour

and Law as Deputy Chairman, the Minister for Finance,

the Director of Social Welfare, and six members to be

appointed  by  the  Chairman. All  this  is  just  an

attempt on the part of the Government to make use  of

public   funds  to  disseminate  P.A.P. propaganda.

Because of that, we will resist this vote.

community  centres or any other methods to beat  down

the  Barisan  Sosialis because they are already  down

and out ---

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, certainly. They have advised

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> My point is that they will go

down because the people who control them have decided

to  discard  them. Therefore, it is quite unnecessary

for us to use all these devious methods such as using

community centres to break up what is already a

semi-defunct organisation. History in the next few  months

will  bear this out, that these people have disgraced

their  masters  and  they will be rejected  by  their

masters in due course. The manner in which they  will

be done will be done with some finesse. They will not

be  openly  repudiated because they have tried  their

best  to  serve their masters. But no doubt  suitable

means  will  be  found whereby they will  be  brushed

aside  and  cast into the limbo of history, forgotten

men, complete failures.

Barisan Sosialis, that is why we oppose the community

centres   to   be  used  as  centres   of   political

activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember even when I was in the P.A.P. I had

been  all  the  time  opposed to making  use  of  the

community  centres for party politics.  It  is  quite

difficult  to differentiate as to what are  political

activities. But all the time when I was in charge  of

the Havelock Community Centre as well as the Minister

for  Finance's  Kreta Ayer Community  Centre,  I  was

opposed  to  making use of the community centres  for

party politics.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> The other point is that sometime

after  we had parted with the P.A.P., I found  to  my

surprise  that the official plaque at the opening  of

the  Havelock Community Centre, with my name engraved

on it, had disappeared. If my name is so influential,

as the Minister for Finance has said, then I hope the

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the one

hand,  the  Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen  are  saying

that  the  community centres are nothing  but  P.A.P.

branches; and, on the other hand, they say the P.A.P.

Branches  are all deserted, without anybody.  If  the

centres  are  P.A.P. branches, they must  admit  that

these  centres are full of people and, far from being

deserted, there is a hive of activities every night.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the real reason, 1 think, why the

Barisan  Sosialis  are against the community  centres

can be found in what the Member for Choa Chu Kang has

said  just  now.  He says that the community  centres

have affected the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>



Barisan  branch  activities because they  have  drawn

away the crowds from the Barisan branches. Now, if it

<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 49 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead

1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture - the Fascist who wants to teach me to be a better Communist! Sir, we know that the Ministry of Culture is, as a matter of fact, a Ministry of P.A.P. propaganda.

There  have been suggestions by the P.A.P. in  the

past  that  propaganda organs, particularly  Radio

Singapore, be taken over and authority given  over

to a corporation. This was done, I think, prior to

the  elections. However, since the elections,  the

P.A.P., far from setting up an independent body to

run Radio Singapore, has only increased the use of

Radio Singapore. In recent times, to make matters

worse, we have television.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure we are all aware of the fact that

propaganda media like the radio and television can

be  used by those who are in power to spread party

propaganda,  and the P.A.P. undoubtedly  has  used

these  organs for party propaganda. I do not  want

to take much time. I merely want to say this.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On television first. Sir, we know the vigour

with   which   the  Government  have  gone   about

introducing television in Singapore - just like  the

vigour with which they are trying to complete  the

construction of the National Theatre. Sir, various

important    Government   projects   which    will

contribute more to the needs of the people are not

given   the  priority  that  television  and   the

National Theatre have been given.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Such as?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, the National Theatre. The Minister

for   Finance  says  "Budget".  Budget?  They  are

already six months behind time.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, on a point of

explanation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member said that the

Government  did  not give sufficient  priority  to

other worthy projects to improve the livelihood of

the  people as compared with television. I did not

say  "Budget". I asked "Such as?". Would  he  give

some  examples? We would be pleased  to  entertain

his views.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am sorry I misheard the Minister.

Sir,  it  is not my mistake. It is the mistake  of

the  Minister. If he wants to speak next  time,  I

suggest  to  him that he shout at the top  of  his

voice.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. In that case, the Speaker

will have to shout a little louder to pull him  to

order.  I  suggest  that the  Member  for  Thomson

ignore  these interjections which are  made  under

the breath - sotto voce.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, we know that the National Theatre

is  given top priority. It is being done on a

24-hour  shift  work. I do not think there  are  very

many  Government  projects,  development  projects

which  are  given priority to this extent.  It  is

true that they want to build roads and more flats.

Prestige developments are being given priority  to

some  extent and also, to a certain extent,  roads

and  other projects which will be obvious  to  the

people  are given priority, because they  want  to

impress  upon  the people that they  are  doing  good

for  the  people  and that is because  elections  are

around  the  corner, as I said yesterday.  But  I  do

not  think  there are many - in fact,  I  cannot  think

of  even  one  Government  development  project - which

are  given  as much priority as the National  Theater

done on a twenty-four hour shift work.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>



For twenty-four hours a day, construction proceeds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the same way, the television project was

hurried  through and given priority.  And  today,  we

have  television  with four hours'  entertainment  at

home.  Sir,  I  would like to say one or  two  things

about  the material that is televised. It is only  to

the extent that it reflects the general policy of the

Ministry and the Government as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even today the Government claims to be

genuinely   anti-colonial.  But  we  find  television

programmes   which  go  to  glorify  colonialism.   I

remember  very vividly the Minister for Home  Affairs

in  1960 giving directives to the Film Censor on  how

the  censorship  should  be  done,  how  films  which

glorify imperialism and colonialism should be banned.

But  today, over T.V. 1 give you one good example.  I

cannot  remember exactly on what day it  was  and  at

what lime, because it was a few days back. "Stage 7."

[Interruption]  If the Minister does  not  know  what

Stage 7 is, then he had better not sit there. This is

a programme, and I suppose a weekly programme, and in

this  week's  programme, a few days hack,  white  men

were  glorified for killing all the Red Indians. Sir,

this is an example of glorifying colonialism.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

Bankrupt!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, there is no bankruptcy in the first

place,  because the Minister for Education  does  not

understand what colonialism means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You know!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, he is a passenger in the boat. He

does  not  know what anti-colonial slogans mean.  Ask

his  colleague,  the Minister for  Home  Affairs.  He

needs  a directive. Sir, the same directive that  the

Minister  for  Culture referred to the  film  censor.

Killing  Red  Indians is glorifying colonialism.  The

white  men  in America are not the sons of the  soil.

They  are  not the indigenous people of America.  The

Minister for Education surely should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>



know his history when he says this is bankruptcy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Of course - [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> This only confirms ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. All these interjections are so

completely unnecessary in this context. Let us  carry

on with the debate as fast as we can.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, however, I am gratified because it

shows what sort of anti-colonialists the P.A.P. are.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think the Member for

Thomson should pursue that line any further.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, that is one example of the quality of

the  programmes that are being televised.  There  are

also  various other examples. Generally,  I  think - if

this  is to the credit of the Government - I must  say

that  some  of  the best programmes  that  are  being

televised are in fact programmes which were  made  by

overseas television corporations, like the B.B.C. and

so on. The quality of the local programmes very poor.

Of  course,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, the dull  and  dreary

programmes    over   television   are    occasionally

interrupted  by comic operas, as, for  example,  when

Inc Prime Minister visits a constituency, a crowd  is

shown welcoming the Prime Minister. Sir, we also  see

the Prime Minister in weird and strange looking

head-dresses drinking coconut water, etc. In fact, I think

there  was one shot where the Prime Minister appeared

in a strip-tease show. But it was cut abruptly, and I

do  not know exactly what happened. All that we could

see  was that he was rolling up his pants waist high.

Sir, I agree that ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We are on an amendment to item

(1)  which deals with the Minister, and I thought the

hon.  Member was on the right track when  he  started

off by saying that he was going on the general policy

of  the Government in so far as culture is concerned.

Now he comes to the Prime Minister's actions as shown

on television. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1197</b></font><br><br>



cannot  see  how that has any connection  with  the

general policy of culture of the Government.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> These were merely incidental remarks. The

point  I  wish  to  make,  by relating  these  little

incidents  and  examples,  is  that  it  is  a   most

effective propaganda medium as a matter of fact. T.V.

today   does   not  have  material  to  put   forward

constructive educational programmes. Because they are

so  bankrupt they have to show white men shooting Red

Indians,  the  Prime Minister's visits, ten-year  old

Hong Kong films which are very reactionary films.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other reason why these are being put forward is

to  provide  a cover for the need of having  T.V. in

their hands right at the moment. Having given all the

priority, they must dish out something. But, Sir,  if

we   look  at  the  Government's  general  policy - the

Ministry - it would appear clearly that the  radio  and

TV  aside  from  the fact that they  exercise  almost

complete control over the Press, is to further P.A.P.

propaganda.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I need not repeat what I have said before. In

my  view, this is an abuse of State power. That is so

much  for the radio and television and now, Sir,  the

Press.  It  will  be  noted  that  the  control   the

Government  exercises over the Press is reflected  in

the  reporting of political items. P.A.P. news  items

are always played up; news not in the interest of the

P.A.P. is always played down. Sir, this has worsened

since  the  last time we had occasion to  raise  this

matter  in  this  House. That  also  was  during  the

Estimates debate under the Head Ministry of Culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to say this here: that we deplore

the  Government, in the first place, for using  State

organs  to  suppress publication of legitimate  news,

for  using  State  power to prevent the  people  from

knowing the truth. I also deplore the Press. All  the

newspapers  in  the country call themselves  national

newspapers - the  Straits  Times - $20  million   foreign

capital included - call



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>



themselves   national  capital.   Practically   every

newspaper.  Sir, the control over the  Chinese  Press

today  is  greater than that over the Straits  Times,

and  the  majority of the people who  depend  on  the

Chinese  newspapers  for their news  are  denied  the

right to get the news.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say this before I sit down: that

although  we do not possess State power, although  we

do  not  have  the  means of using  State  organs  to

intimidate  and  control  the  Press,  we  have   the

manpower to do it. We do not want to intimidate them,

but  we  tell  them  this: we have  the  manpower  to

cripple them if necessary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> That is intimidation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I could not care less how this is

interpreted by the Minister for Culture. But I  think

it  is  necessary for us, in the interests of justice

and fair play, to state this: that it is not possible

for  the people to accept the situation indefinitely,

and  that  if  it  is necessary, we can  organise  an

effective   boycott   of  one  or   two   newspapers,

particularly the Sin Chew Jit Poh, so that the  point

may be driven home well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is regrettable that as the Government uses

all other State organs, today the Ministry of Culture

is  also used for party propaganda purposes, and  the

Minister for Culture is the party propagandist, and I

think he should take the responsibility for this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the

Ministry  of  Culture  can carry  out  its  aims  and

objectives as declared from time to time, which is to

foster  a  Malayan culture-and they  have  a  leaflet

saying  that their main aim is to foster a  so-called

Malayan culture-then we do not mind their spending so

much  money each year. But during the past four years

we have found that other than ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hong Lim.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> That was also the watershed of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Can the Member for Hong Lim tell me

when  he taught me propaganda, on what occasions  and

for how long?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, from the

time of the general election in 1955, none of us  has

seen this "bird" on the Front Government benches ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I can only indicate to the

Member  for  Hong  Lim to please carry  on  with  the

debate on the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> It was only when victory was

assured that the Minister for Culture quitted his job

in the Straits Times ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have made my ruling. If the

Member  wants  to  invite a  debate  on  the  general

election   with  the  Minister  for  Culture,   then,

according  to  the Standing Orders, he is  completely

irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Now, Mr Deputy Speaker, the

Ministry   of  Culture  has  not  done  anything   in

fostering a Malayan culture. It is nothing but  just

a  propaganda  arm  of the P.A.P.,  using  Government

funds for P.A.P. propaganda purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see how much the P.A.P. has been using, other

than  $6  million  a  year on the  Work  Brigade,  $2

million  on  community centres. The P.A P  Government

will  be  using  $10  million on  television;  a  few

million  dollars more on radio, and these  few  items

are  to replace the P.A.P. branches which have melted

away,  the P.A.P. masses which have melted away,  and

the P.A.P. Party organ, Petir, which has no sales and

no  circulation. We manage to print 50,000 copies  of

each  issue of our Party organ, and that is  why  the

Government  is  so  scared and sends  Special  Branch

people every now and then to intimidate the printers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> 20,000 copies!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> 50,000, if he wants to know. We

can send the bill to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>



him.  And this sum total of about $20 million a  year

to  replace  the  P.A.P. branches which  have  melted

away, to replace the P.A.P. Party organ, Petir, which

has  no  sales  at all, is being taken,  if  I  could

estimate,  as  follows. Each year they  collect  only

three-quarters  of  a million dollars  from  hawkers'

licences.  In  other  words,  what  the  P.A.P. are

spending  to  replace their lost Branches  and  Party

organ  requires 30 years of collections  of  hawkers'

fees. Their collection from school fees from the  few

hundred thousand school children in Singapore is only

$1.5   million.  In  other  words,  what  the  P.A.P.

Government  are spending each year to  replace  their

Branches  and  their Party organ  requires  about  15

years to collect from the school children.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hospital fees: only $1.25 million. They would

require  nearly  20  years to collect  from  all  the

patients in Singapore for the amount to be sufficient

for one year of P.A.P. propaganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, not only have the

Government  these propaganda weapons.  If  only  they

will use them for propaganda, like T.V., the radio or

Rediffusion, which every day just praise the  P.A.P.,

its  merits, its Four-Year Programme, we do not  mind

it  so  much. We do not mind spending $20 million  on

this, but what is worse now is since the introduction

of  T.V., in order to attract crowds to the community

centres,  to  the T.V. shops in town, to attract  the

school  children, they show Western films - shooting.

You  know, this morning. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,  my

little  boy of 15 months just saw one T.V. show  for

five minutes, and this morning he pointed a gun at me - pom,  pom! It shows the influence of T.V. on  small

children. That is why in the past few months the rate

of  juvenile  delinquency has been on  the  increase,

crimes  committed by young children have been on  the

increase ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I always

make it a point in this Chamber to debate only with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>



persons  who are my equal or at least my  equal,  but

never  with  the Minister for Education.  He  is  too

behind in the game of politics --- (Interruption]

<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have indicated to the Member

for  Hong  Lim that he is inviting a debate  on  this

issue which has no connection with the amendment.  Of

course,  the time allotted to Head 49 which  ends  at 6.05  p.m.

is Opposition time, and if the Member  is

really  inviting the Government to debate a different

matter, the Opposition will be losing the chance. Mr

Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, together with

television,  radio and Rediffusion propaganda,  there

is  rigid control of the Press by sending people like

Mr  Lee Vei Chen around town intimidating the  Press

editors,  writing letters to the Press editors  under

fictitious   names.  All  these  are   negations   of

democracy.  They are negations of the  principles  of

our  parliamentary system, and to top the  apparatus,

the  whole  campaign, we have the  "colonial  Straits

Times" helping the P.A.P. Government. I remember once

upon  a time the Prime Minister used to say, "Whoever

is embraced by the Straits Times is in the embrace of

death."  And  today  the Straits Times  embraces  the

P.A.P. and, therefore, according to logic, the P.A.P.

is  finished.  It  will not be  long:  two  or  three

months.  By  August 31st, as I have said  during  the

last  few  days, the P.A.P. will be scratched  out  -

just scratched out from the political arena.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, you will remember during

the  election  campaign  in 1959,  the  Minister  for

Culture  wrote in the Straits Times, "P.A.P. attacks

the  Straits  Times".  He was  exposing  the  Straits

Times, which he knows. He explained to us how a small

`group of two or three colonial shareholders, with  a

very small capital - they controlled less than five per

cent  of  the  shareholdings,  but  because  of   the

manipulation  in  the Articles of  Association,  they

managed to control the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>



Straits  Times. Only they had the voting  power.  The

Minister  for  Culture  in those  days  promised  the

people  - all of us - that if the P.A.P. came to  power

they would close down the Straits Times.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Point of clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman (Mr Mammen): Point of clarification,

Mr Ong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, he will

have  his  chance  to reply. But  this  is  one  more

instance  of the P.A.P. breaking its solemn  election

promises.  Today the Straits Times is  as  strong  as

ever, its sales are still increasing with the support

of the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we do not care a sixpence

or  a farthing about them. We never care at all. They

do   not   count.  If  they  begin  to  publish   our

statements,  we will collapse! But I will  say  this:

whatever  T.V. has  been propagating,  whatever  the

radio  can  do  for  them, whatever Rediffusion,  the

Straits  Times and the control of the Press, whatever

the  techniques with which the Government can employ,

nothing  -  not  even  ten Straits  Times,  ten  T.V.

channels,  can save this bunch of men from  political

extinction.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, of

course,  the Ministry of Culture is a very  important

Ministry.  As I have already pointed out,  a  lot  of

money has been spent on this Ministry. Because it  is

with  this  Ministry and the help of  auxiliaries  of

this  Ministry that the P.A.P. hopes to return a  few

of  the  Ministers in the next election.  Of  course,

most  of  them will probably lose their deposits,  in

spite  of all their talk about people spending  money

on  wayangs  welcoming  them. Well,  as  regards  our

friend  behind  the  Front bench,  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the Prime Minister has no  chance.  He

knows it; therefore he ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman (Mr Mammen): Order. I must remind the

hon.  Member for Queenstown that we are debating  the

Ministry of Culture, not the general election that is

coming  soon.  So  just  touch  on  the  Ministry  of

Culture.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is because of this. Sir, that

there   is   now  a  tussle  between  the   Singapore

Government  and the Federation Government as  regards

control  of  television and local broadcasting.  They

have  transferred  the  control  of  T.V. from   one

Ministry to another hoping thereby to allow the local

Government   to   have  effective  control   of   the

propaganda machinery - the Federation Government or the

Singapore Government. We still do not know who really

controls television. I am sure, if the Minister would

oblige, at least the House would be able to know what

is going to happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think everybody knows that the radio in Singapore

is  a  P.A.P. radio; it sings only P.A.P. songs.  If

there  is  any  news,  it is all about  the  Minister

saying  this, the Prime Minister saying that. As  has

already  been pointed out by many people, it is  also

another  political arm of the P.A.P.  They  have  put

great faith in T.V. and they hope everybody will  buy -   they want everybody to buy - T.V. sets, so much so

that  they  had even sent directives to  coffee-shops

telling  them that they must buy T.V. sets, otherwise

the  usual  consequences might follow.  But  what  we

cannot  understand is why the Minister  should  lower

himself  so  much  as  to go  along  to  be  used  as

propaganda  at  opening functions of various  private

firms - private firms that sell T.V. sets. I remember

reading  in  the  newspapers about the  Minister  for

Finance going along to open the "National Tower"  for

the  firm Matsushita or something like that. I do not

know; maybe the Minister has some vested interests in

this,  and  it may be that because of this  that  the

Minister has been running along, flying all the  time

to Japan and Tokyo. I do not know -

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>



it  or  I  want  to  report him to the  Committee  of

Privileges.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> As far as I remember, the

Member   for  Queenstown  remembers,  but  he   never

confirms  that  the  Minister  opened  the  "National

Tower". If I have heard it and since the Minister has

taken  objection  to  it, the Member  for  Queenstown

should withdraw that statement.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, unfortunately

for  the Minister for Finance, he always comes in  at

the  last minute. He never heard what I said  and  he

started to ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. On this particular aspect:

since  the Minister for Finance was here, I  ask  the

Member for Queenstown to withdraw all the words up to

'open the "National Tower"'.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But, Mr Deputy Speaker, I never

referred  to  the  Finance Minister opening  this.  I

referred to the Minister for Culture.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No, I think the Member might have made

a mistake. That was what I said. What the Member said

was,  "You  will  remember the Minister  for  Finance

opening  the National Tower." Maybe it was a slip  of

the  tongue.  So the Member for Queenstown  has  made

that, and the Minister has made an objection to it. I

have  ordered the Member for Queenstown  to  withdraw

it.   Do  not  use  that  word;  just  withdraw   it. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have made my ruling. I have

asked the Member for Queenstown to withdraw it. After

that,  the Minister can stand up on a point of order.

Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not know what you want me to

withdraw,  but if you say you want me to  withdraw  I

withdraw.  I still do not know what you  want  me  to

withdraw. [Laughter]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman (Mr Mammen): Order. That is exactly

the Member for - [Interruption] Order. The Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>



Queenstown  has indicated, which I myself have  heard

and  Members  in  the  House  have  heard,  that  the

Minister  for  Finance  has opened  or  attended  the

opening  of  the National Tower  - which words  he  has

used,  and  as such, I ask him to withdraw the  words

without any condition. The Member must withdraw those

words.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If you insist, Sir, I withdraw,

but - [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Listen. Order, order. No condition.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> May I explain, Mr Deputy Speaker ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order. I am now insisting. You

used those words; you must withdraw them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will withdraw, Mr Deputy

Speaker, but let me repeat that the Minister for

Culture went along to open certain functions and ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, that is half of his

allegation  and  the  less important  half.  He  also

alleges   that  I  have  vested  interests  in   this

particular  company, and that could  be  one  of  the

reasons  why  I went to Japan so often. I  take  very

grave   objection  to  that  and  unless  the  Member

withdraws  and apologises, I intend to send  this  to

the Committee of Privileges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman (Mr Mammen): If the Minister for

Finance seriously thinks that there has been a breach

of privilege, he is at liberty to file a motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.

And I am sure I will be waiting ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ministry of Culture.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes. But I say. Sir, he is just

lowering  his  dignity when he goes  along  to  these

private firms to perform opening ceremonies for them.

I   was   asking  whether  the  Minister  had  vested

interests  in  the opening of such firms.  Otherwise,

why should he go



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>



along to perform ceremonies for private firms? He  is

a  Minister  of the Government. Is he a  director  of

that  firm?  Just because he happens  to  like  T.V.?

Possibly there must be more reasons What do we see in

these T.V. shows?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> We see you.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I think the Minister is not happy

at seeing me at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in T.V. we see only the Prime Minister

going around toasting one person after another. I  do

not  know if that is the reason why we have T.V., and

why  the  Prime Minister is so insistent on Singapore

having  T.V. But one thing is certain: this  T.V. at

the  present  moment  is doing  the  people  no  good

because many parents object to their children wasting

their  time  on  T.V.  When the  children  should  be

spending  their time on lessons, they  now  spend  on

watching  T.V. And what do they see - American  films

which even the Americans have rejected.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Point of information.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of information. Will the Member

give way?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No, he can wait. Is he trying to

ask us, to convince us to follow the American way  of

life, because, as far as I know, most of the films ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Have you got any?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not have t buy one of that

lousy stuff - [Interruption]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Then steal one - [Interruption]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman (Mr Mammen): Order. May I remind the

Government  Bencher  that  we  are  in  Committee  of

Supply? If any Members wish to speak, they can always

stand  up.  Of  course, if the Member for  Queenstown

will  give way, or after his speech they can  clarify

any point. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I was asking if the Government

was  trying to persuade us to follow the American way

of life.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>



because  the  American  way  of  life  is  now  being

condemned  by the whole world. We have  seen  in  the

newspapers  reports  of  racial  discrimination,   of

leaders  of  the negro population being shot  in  the

back.  Surely  he  is not going to  encourage  us  to

follow that way of life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a new programme these days, I hear - "The

Changing Face of Singapore". A little while back  the

Minister for Finance - er, Culture - was saying  that

everything hinges on the date July 1961. Previous  to

July  1961, we all had pretty faces. All of  us  were

good  men. Immediately after July 1961, Sir, when  we

broke away from them we began to have ugly faces,  we

become Communists, we become everything.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Show your real face!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not know why the Minister

for  Education makes a remark like that, Sir,I think

he  should answer the Member for Hong Lim. I  do  not

want to interfere ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Surely the Member for

Queenstown  is  inviting the Government  to  make  an

irrelevant remark. It is the Ministry of Culture now.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I merely want to comment on one

thing.  If they want to tell the truth to the  people

of   Singapore,  they  should  tell  the  people   of

Singapore that in 1959 they had 43 seats, and,  after

a  little  while, they had 40 seats: then  39;  today

they  have 25 - I think it is 24. Then let them  tell

the  truth to Singapore. Why are they showing  houses

and flats in which nobody stays?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, time for suspension.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I suspend the sitting until

half-past five.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>

<div align="right"><i>5.00 p.m. until 5.30 p.m.</i></div>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.30 p.m.</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate in Committee of Supply resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head 49 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1."



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I was talking -about the radio

and  T.V. at  the rising. The radio is,  of  course,

completely under the control of the Minister. He uses

the  radio and T.V. for party propaganda as  well  as

for the distortion of facts entirely to the advantage

of  P.A.P. I need only refer to the statement of  the

P.A.P.'s  one-time  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the

Minister  for Culture, about a report over radio  and

T.V. about the nurses' strike. The statement from the

now  Member for Kampong Kapor is that Radio Singapore

had  distorted the facts about the strike.  This,  of

course,  was not published in the Straits  Times;  it

was  blacked  out from the Sin Chew Jit Poh,  it  was

blacked out from Nanyang. But, unfortunately for  the

P.A.P.,  it  came out in the Malaya, Times.  This  is

what  the  Parliamentary Secretary  to  the  Ministry

itself  tells  us what Radio Singapore is  doing.  Of

course,  there is great pressure on the  papers - I

have  a  little while back mentioned the pressure  on

the  Sin  Chew and Nanyang. But I might also mention.

Sir,  that  there  is also great  pressure  on  other

papers  like the Min Pao. I think we had occasion  to

refer to this last year. The Min Pao, because it  did

not  toe  the P.A.P. line, was forced to close  shop.

Now they have a new management.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one thing which I want to draw the

attention  of the House to, and that is the  blackout

even  of  news concerning what the M.P.s had to  say.

You  will  remember,  Sir, you read  in  the  English

newspapers,  the  Straits Tunes, about  Mr  Brockway

saying  that the treatment of detainees was barbaric.

We looked through all the Chinese newspapers, the Sin

Chew, Nanyang; but not a single word. Then we learnt



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>



later  on that some pressure was brought to bear,  on

the  right quarters, and all this news was completely

blacked out. Of course, the Press has very often been

called  up  by  the  Prime Minister.  There  was  one

occasion when the Prime Minister called up the Press.

He  told  reporters that if they wanted to  take  any

picture of him in future, they must make pretty  sure

that  they  take pictures of the Prime Minister  only

when  he  is with a crowd. Otherwise they should  not

take  any picture of him - it would show that there  is

nobody around him and nobody supporting him.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown does

not seem to realise that he is eating into Opposition

time.  This item ends at five minutes past  six.  The

second  point  is  that  he must  give  the  Minister

reasonable time to reply to all the points that  have

been made. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I have finished.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, of the Member for

Queenstown,  I  am  reminded of  certain  experiments

performed  by  Dr  Pavlov on his  dogs  which  could

possibly    explain   the   state   of   intellectual

retrogression  that  the Member  for  Queenstown  has

undergone in the last few months. I am told, Sir,  he

projected an oval before the dog to signify food, and

he projected a circle to signify no food. So the dog,

when  he  saw  just the oval started salivating,  and

when  he  saw  a  circle he was quite satisfied  that

there  was  no food. But once the oval was  gradually

extended to a circle the dog became so confused,  not

knowing whether it was a circle or an oval, that  the

result  was a general nervous breakdown and  the  dog

started barking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown has been barking up the

wrong  tree for the last 20 minutes. The first  point

he  makes, Sir, is one to which I need not bother  to

reply, because he has made it repeatedly for the last

three  years,  namely, that radio and television  are

used for party propaganda. When I challenged them  on

innumerable  occasions to state what  kind  of  party

propaganda has been put across over the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>



radio  and television at any time, I think the Member

for Tanglin at least attempted. The others never even

attempted to produce a single specific instance  when

party  propaganda was put out across either radio  or

television. So the Member for Queenstown, the  Member

for  Thomson  and the Member for Hong Lim  have  been

saying repeatedly that radio and television have been

used  for  party propaganda, yet they have  not  been

able to ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> A point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister will give way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember in

June 1960, after my expulsion, the whole apparatus of

the State was being used to disseminate ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. This is not clarification. The

Member is making another speech. Mr Rajaratnam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I would like to explain what they

are  really trying to put across, and it is essential

for us to understand. The Government was elected on a

specific  policy.  Initially the policy  might  have,

been  a  party policy. But once we are elected  as  a

Government, that policy becomes a national policy  as

long   as   that  Government  is  the   legally   and

constitutionally   elected  representative   of   the

people.  Sir,  so it is our duty to put  that  policy

across,  and  we  were  elected  essentially  on  two

things.   That   we   stood  for   a   non-Communist,

democratic, socialist Singapore. That might have been

a  party policy before we were elected. But after  we

were elected it became a national policy because  the

people approved of it, and, therefore, it is our duty

to  put  across over the radio, T.V. and  other  mass

media this policy, because there is the stamp of  the

people on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second objective of the Ministry of Culture,

again  a  policy approved by the people, is  that  we

should  try  and  create a non-communalist  and

non-racialist  united  Malaya  and  Singapore.  You  will

notice, Sir, that I said earlier



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>



that  the charges by the Barisan Sosialis that  Radio Singapore   and  television  have  become  propaganda organs  for the P.A.P. began when we broke away  from them  on the issue of merger, which was party policy, but  became a national policy after we were  elected. The  whole substance of their antipathy and criticism is  not  that  we are putting over party  policy  and propaganda, but that we are putting across  what  has become  a  national policy - merger. It is  quite  true

that  during  the last two years, we  have  used  the

radio  effectively to win the battle for  merger  and

Malaysia.  We  make no bones about  it,  we  make  no

apology  for  it.  And  if  I  may  read,  Sir,  from

Democratic Socialism in Action, a publication by  the

Ministry of Culture ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Hmm!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> --- and we will tell him now how we

used  the radio and television to expose the  Barisan

as  foreign  agents,  as people working  for  foreign

powers,  who want to sell Singapore to people outside

of Malaysia. And we used the radio and television all

out.  I can list some of the things we did. They  are

not  party propaganda. There is a long piece  on  the

Referendum.  I  will read just the essential  points.

There  was  first the Prime Minister's  talks,  which

again annoy them because they were an exposure of the

Communists. And we make no apology for making  use  o

the radio to expose the Communists, and we will still

do  it. Because, after Malaysia, Sir, it is even more

important that the radio and television, and all  the

mass  media, are strengthened, because after Malaysia

the  battle  for Malaysia will go on,  but  not  with

these  gentlemen. These are the tenderfoots  and  the

wolf  cubs.  They  will be out  of  the  scene.  More

powerful  gentlemen are going to come  out,  both  in

Singapore  and outside Singapore to try to  break  up

Malaysia. We are going to ensure that the mass  media

-  radio and television - are up to scratch to  fight

them. That is why we are expanding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why this priority for T.V.?", the Member for Thomson

asked. Because it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>



is important that after Malaysia, the foreign friends

of  these  gentlemen, the people who are  underground

today,  who  have  written off the  Barisan - Sir,  the

Barisan is an ineffective force, they have lost  out.

You will have noticed that recently even the Workers'

Party  has quitted from the United Front, because  it

is  a  dead duck, a sinking ship. Therefore. Sir,  we

are  not going to fight them. [Interruption] In about

80  days  you will know the answer, Sir. In 80  days,

31st August, we will meet bigger boys, more adept  at

propaganda. But we have the resources. For example, a

few  days  ago,  when  we  were  on  the  Development

Estimates, they wanted to know why we wanted a

short-wave  transmitter. They know why we are going to  use

the  short-wave. Because their friends too  have  got

short-wave. [Interruption] Your friends.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Minister has been doing

very well up till now. Now he has forgotten that  the

Speaker  is  here. I suggest he try to put  his  hand

away, probably in his pocket. He is pointing too much

at the Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, Sir, I have tried to overcome

that  habit by holding on to a pencil, as the  Member

for  Farrer  Park advised me once. But I am  not  the

Member  for Farrer Park, Sir. Still I will  take  his

advice and point the right way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other pamphlet, The Battle for Merger, we

distributed 327,000 copies which they sneered at. But

when  we had the Referendum they knew, and they  know

now,  that  those  327,000  copies  did  their  work.

Because  those gentlemen could not get more  than  20

per cent of the votes.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, we had Malaysia Week organised by the

Ministry  of  Culture. There was no party  propaganda

there.  There was a Malaysia Exhibition organised  by

the  Ministry  of Culture - no party propaganda  there.

There  was  a  booklet called Malaysian Heritage,  of

which   245,000  copies  were  distributed - no   party

propaganda.  Copies are available here. I  asked  the

Member for Queenstown or the Member for Thomson to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>



show  where  there  is party propaganda.  But  it  is

national  propaganda. It helps to defeat those

anti-Malaysia  elements who want to destroy  Malaysia.  We

have  even  had  a Malaysian Grand Prix  -  no  party

propaganda.  If  I  recollect, Sir,  Members  of  the

Barisan sneaked in quietly and even had a free  lunch

at the expense of the Ministry of Culture.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> They did not get indigestion!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No, Sir, they were well treated and

sent  off  quite happy. This time I noticed  the  two

Barisan  Assemblymen  did turn  up  and  they  looked

sheepish, unlike at the first Malaysia Grand Prix. We

even  have  Malaysia albums, film shows, posters - none

of these involve party propaganda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the Ministry of Culture has other branches

under  its  care; the Museum. Surely the  Member  for

Queenstown does not suggest that the Museum is being

used  for party propaganda. There are stuffed birds - a

condition  which the Barisan Sosialis might  also  be

reduced  to  after  31st  August!  There  are  flint,

stones, old krises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, we have the Printing Department which

prints  ledgers,  gazettes  - they used  to  print  the

Hansard. So the only objection, therefore, that  they

have is not to the very many other departments of the

Ministry  of Culture as they have for the  radio  and

television.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am always happy that the Barisan Sosialis are

getting more anxious as the radio and television  are

developed.  As  I  have  said  earlier,  we  must  be

prepared after 31st August for a more intense  battle

for  the hearts and minds of the people. We are going

to meet more powerful enemies. This was only a trial.

If  the  Member  for  Queenstown  can  point  to  any

instance where pure party propaganda is used, then  I

will be quite happy to put the matter right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, they were talking about the intimidation of

the  Press.  For example, he wanted to know  why  Mr

Fenner  Brockway's  comments  on  the  treatment   of

detainees  did not appear in the Chinese papers.  I

can  tell him. He did not have to fabricate imaginary

reasons. Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>



Fenner  Brockway and his friends, before  they  left,

had  a  Press  conference where all  the  Press  were

there.  When they were waiting for the plane to  take

off,  two reporters quietly cornered them - one  was  a

Straits Times reporter, the other was a foreign Press

correspondent - because they wanted to  have  a  scoop.

Mr  Fenner Brockway, for some reasons, did not bring

up  the  matter  of detainees before  his  two  other

colleagues. So the two reporters who wanted  a  scoop

took Mr Brockway to a corner and asked him if he had

anything to say about the detainees. And he said what

he  felt. Therefore, the Straits Times published  the

story;  it was a scoop. If we had wanted to stop  it,

we  would  have  stopped the Straits Times  too.  Two

Chinese reporters went off early, so they did not get

a scoop. And the U.P.I. carried the story, which I am

told  appeared  in the Australian Press.  If  we  had

wanted to stop it, we could have stopped it too. This

is  the  kind of imaginary, unfounded speculation  in

which the Member for Queenstown indulges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now see the significance of the experiment

carried  out  by  Pavlov. Here  is  a  gentleman  who

started off as a non-Communist, a socialist - the oval.

Somebody provided him with a circle - Communist circle.

He read a few books. Now he has come to a point where

the oval ---



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> On a point of order, Sir. We have

less  than 15 minutes for the other items under  this

Head, and I submit that the Minister has already made

his point.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is not a point of order. However, a

point of order could be with reference to experiments

indulged  in. I think there was a reference to  Nara.

There was also a reference to stuffed birds. Possibly

these  references might cause offence. They have  not

so  far, and I have not noticed any objection  taken.

But they might cause offence. Mr Rajaratnam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Earlier, Sir, the Member for Thomson

talked  a  great deal about the Minister for  Culture

and the Ministry of Culture intimidating the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>



Press. But he for the first time publicly indulged in

what  is  called "open intimidation". He has  charged

that  if certain newspapers, especially the Sin  Chew

Jit Poh, do not toe his line, he has large numbers of

supporters who can force the paper, by a boycott,  to

change its views. I have openly said that if they can

produce evidence that we intimidate in the sense that

we force the newspapers to say - "Do not publish so and

so's  speeches." What we might do and we often do  is

that  we would like our speeches to go in. As we have

said  so  openly before we want to play up this  news

and  we  want to play up that news. The only occasion

where  we  asked newspapers so far as not to  publish

certain  news  items was in the A.R.T.I.S. case.  We

said though they were news items, certain people were

out  for  mischief, "So please do not  publish."  But

here  openly in this Chamber, under the privilege  of

this Chamber, the Member for Thomson gets up and says

that  if the newspapers do not toe his line,  do  not

play  up the pro-Communist line, he is going to  call

for  a boycott. This is evidence of the typical  type

of  intimidation. Here openly it is being done. Since

it   is  being  done,  nobody  will  have  cause   to

disbelieve us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point before I give way, Sir. The Member

for  Hong Lim - more or less his strategy is to  repeat

what the Barisan did. He knows the Barisan's time  is

up;  so he will inherit the slogans and he hopes also

certain of the followers will escape the net. And  he

says  the  same  thing,  that the  P.A.P.  Radio  and

television are being used for ---

be  corrected. He said that he was the man who taught

and  where but he could not substantiate or name  the

time and place. He also said that he was the man  who

led  us  into the movement. If I remember  correctly,

Sir,  it  is  for the record, since he has  made  the

point,  that  it was I who met him long  before  when

accountant's office, and I said, "Would you  like  to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Dr

Thio Chan Bee ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 49 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (2) of subhead 1.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 49 be reduced

by the whole sum in respect of item (2) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a vote for the Parliamentary Secretary to

the  Minister  for Culture. Sir, the ex-Parliamentary

Secretary  is  either the hero  of  the  day  or  the

villain of the piece. And today if the Opposition had

had  the time, as it now does not have, it could have

made the Government so uncomfortable that in spite of

all  the  propaganda  training of  the  Minister  for

Culture, he would find it difficult to wriggle out of

this position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was mentioned yesterday by the Minister for

Health and Law that letters had been sent to this

ex-Parliamentary Secretary, who is the Secretary-General

of  the  union, and that attempts had  been  made  to

contact him several times, but failed. It would  seem

that the Minister for Culture has therefore failed in

his  duty. I would like to ask him what he  has  been

doing  in allowing his Parliamentary Secretary to  be

doing something else? That surely is a sad reflection

on  the Minister. We have said many a time about this

particular  man - this ex-Parliamentary Secretary,  the

Member   for  Kampong  Kapor,  when  he  was   Deputy

Speaker - in this House that it was wrong on  the  part

of  the  Government to make use of  him  to  try  and

control  the  trade union movement. He was  made  the

Secretary-General  of  the T.U.C.  Not  content  with

that, several Political Secretaries were made the Ten

Tall  Men  of  the T.U.C. They came out very  proudly

that  these were the Tall Men of the T.U.C.  At  that

time,  it  was  well  and good, because  the  Barisan

Members  were  with them. The Barisan  Members  broke

away, and the Ten Tall Men became very short men  - and

not  only are-they short, but they are now in prison.

So that is the type



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>



of  men the P.A.P. wanted to use to capture the trade

union movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, they have made use of the Member for Kampong

Kapor who, at first, was elected Deputy Speaker,  and

later  made a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for  Culture. Of all places the Ministry of  Culture!

It  is a type of P.A.P. culture that they try to make

use  of  public  funds for their own political  ends.

They   thought,   no  doubt,  that  by   making   him

Parliamentary Secretary, paid out of public funds, he

could  be  made to toe the line and that he would  be

leading this union for the benefit of the Government.

I  told  the Member concerned that one day  it  would

happen that there would be a clash of loyalties. That

happened. The clash of loyalties came and the  Member

chose loyalty to the Union rather than loyalty to the

Government.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, he resigned. But another typical P.A.P.

culture  is this. Here is a man who has lent  himself

to  be  made use of by the Government and he has  now

shown  that  he  is a rebel, that he is  prepared  to

fight the Government. What is the Government going to

do about it? Is it because they have now been reduced

to  25 to 25 that they must tolerate this position of

letting  the rebel sit there? Surely, if  it  were  a

clean honest Government, it would have taken only one

action, but it is not taking it. It is not taking it,

because it knows that it cannot. It has got into this

embarrassment  as a result of its own cleverness.  It

tried to control the union. But now if anything  were

to  happen to the Member for Kampong Kapor, he  could

expose  a  lot of things, that it was the  Government

which  tried to make use of him to control the  civil

service. Now there is an open clash and that  is  why

if  he  were removed, there would be a lot of  things

that he could say to damage the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel very strongly about this waste of public

funds  by  the Government to try to do something  for

its  own  party  political ends.  We  hope  that  the

Government has learnt its lessons and will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>



not  continue wasting public funds to fill posts like

Political Secretaries - there are a number of vacancies

there - to achieve their party ends.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a subject

dear  to  the  heart  of  the Member  for  Cairnhill,

because,  as far as I can recollect, the  Member  for

Kampong  Kapor had come for censure when  he  was  an

Assemblyman,  when he was a Deputy Speaker,  when  he

was a Parliamentary Secretary and now when he is back

again   as   an  Assemblyman.  So  the  problem   is,

therefore, an eternal and perennial one, not  related

at  all  to  the  fact whether he was a Parliamentary

Secretary,  an  ex-Deputy  Speaker  or  is   an

ex-Parliamentary Secretary. So, as far as  his  position

as  a  Parliamentary Secretary is concerned,  as  you

know,   Sir,   the   Constitution  provides   for   a

Parliamentary  Secretary to every Ministry.  For  the

hon.  Member  to claim that the post of Parliamentary

Secretary  is  a  waste of public funds  is  no  more

accurate than the fact that vacant posts of Ministers

are  also  a waste of public funds, or the fact  that

any  other post provided for in the Constitution,  if

filled,  is  a  waste  of public funds.  Whether  the

Member for Kampong Kapor is fit to he a Parliamentary

Secretary  or not is a matter of opinion.  When  this

question came up repeatedly, especially when  he  was

made  Parliamentary Secretary, the arguments switched

from Deputy Speaker having connections with the trade

unions    to   a   Parliamentary   Secretary   having

connections with the trade unions. The point was then

made that there might come a time when his duties  as

a   Parliamentary   Secretary - and   a   Parliamentary

Secretary is not a member of the Cabinet. I mean  the

Government  stand collectively: all  Assemblymen  are

part of the constituent elements of a Government just

as in the long run the whole Assembly constitutes the

Legislature  and, therefore, generally speaking,  the

Government  of Singapore. But insofar as he  was  the

Parliamentary Secretary, the point was  then  raised,

and I did say that as the Parliamentary Secretary to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>



the Ministry of Culture, he would have no trade union

functions,  though he might outside  carry  on  trade

union  activities  and  if  there  should  arise   an

occasion when there should be a conflict between  his

duties  as a Parliamentary Secretary and those  of  a

trade  unionist, then he would have to make a choice.

Well,  the conflict has conic, and he has decided  to

opt for his loyalties as a trade unionist. Whether he

did  the right thing or not, is a matter for  him  to

judge.  As  far  as  a  Parliamentary  Secretary   is

concerned, I think the position is as what we  stated

it was the last time.

policy  in regard to Police can be raised. The Member

for  Thomson  has given notice of that amendment.  Is

there any other topic under the Minister?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 50 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (31) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this item concerns the post of Assistant Secretary (Societies and Publications). I would like to ask the Minister concerned this. The United People's Party has made an application to the Assistant Secretary, Societies, and it was only after one year or so that we received a reply from the

official  concerned, sometime in January  this  year.

The  letter  was  addressed to our Secretary-General,

Mr  Ong  Eng Guan. In this letter it was  instructed

that   our   Party   badge  of  three   circles   was

objectionable. Actually, there is nothing wrong  with

it. There had been no objection raised with regard to

our  badge.  How is it that the objection  should  be

raised  after  one  year or so to  change  our  Party

badge? So our Secretary-General, the Member for  Hong

Lim,  replied accordingly. In this reply, we  pointed

out  that  we had done nothing against the rules.  We

asked the official concerned to point out the rule as

to  the power by which he has the right to ask us  to

change  our Party emblem. So we are using  our  Party

emblem for the coming general elections, as is to  be

expected.  But  after this letter, we have  not  been

able  to  get any reply from the Assistant Secretary,

Societies. So I would like the Minister concerned  to

assure us that if there is to be any election or

by-election at all, the undertaking should be given that

we  are  allowed to use the present Party  emblem  of

three circles.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Registrar

of  Societies  has  at  no time  ordered  the  United

People's Action Party to change its symbol. What  the

Registrar  of Societies did was to draw the attention

of the United People's Action Party [Interruption] to

the  fact  that  there  are many other  organisations

which have almost -



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Minister mentioned

the United People's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>

union or not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr Speaker,

Sir.  What the Registrar of Societies did was to draw

the  attention of the United People's  Party  to  the

fact  that  there  are  many other  organisations  in

Singapore having more or less similar symbols to that

of   the  United  People's  Party  and  these   other

organisations  were in existence  very  much  earlier

than  the  United  People's  Party.  The  purpose  of

drawing the attention of the Member for Hong Lim, the

Secretary-General  of the U.P.P.,  was  to  give  him

time;  or  rather, the Registrar was kind-hearted  to

draw his attention, so that in case when it came to a

future  election  and there should be  any  objection

raised  against the use of the present U.P.P. symbol,

he  would have the opportunity and the time to  think

of some other symbols.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind-heartedness of the Registrar of Societies

has  now  been criticised by the Member for  Punggol!

[Interruption] Whether the U.P.P. want to accept  the

advice of the Registrar of Societies or not is up  to

them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I am

not  very much conversant with this legal aspect. All

I  know  is that political Parties and societies  are

different.  The Minister points out that there  is  a

certain  organisation which has an emblem similar  to

our  emblem, but I do not know which organisation has

any  symbol  similar to our Party emblem.  I  am  not

aware  of  any  such  organisation.  May  I  ask  the

Minister  to  tell us in what respect  is  our  Party

emblem similar to that of any other organisation, and

which are the organisations, if any?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are a

number  of  organisations which have  almost  similar

symbols to that of the U.P.P. Off-hand, I can mention

that  the  symbols  of the People's Association,  the

Nanyang   University  Students  Union,  the  Hawker's

Union,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>



the  rural organisations and also a number  of  trade

unions are more or less similar to that of the U.P.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

according  to  what  I can see, there  are  different

features  in  these symbols; for example,  there  are

four   circles   in  the  symbol  of   the   People's

Association.  In  the case of the Nanyang  University

Students  Union, there are different colours  in  the

different  circles and there is one  star  among  the

circles   in  the  case  of  the  Nanyang  University

Students   Union.  I  do  not  know   whether   these

organisations mentioned will be allowed to take  part

in a general election. That is one point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is this: will such organisations

field candidates during a general election? According

to what I understand, organisations and societies are

different from political Parties.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, whether the

Member  for  Punggol and his Party want to  heed  the

advice  of  the  Registrar  of  Societies  is   their

problem. If they like to take the risk, by all  means

they can do so. Nobody is stopping them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 50 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (37) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present identity card in use in Singapore

is  unsatisfactory in one vital aspect,  and  I  hope

that   when  new  identity  cards  are  issued  after

Malaysia the defect will be removed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the present identity card, it is not stated

whether the address is the residence of the person or

just  the postal address. On the back portion of  the

card,  the words stated are "Removed to (Full  postal

address)".  The  result of this is that  anybody  can

register  his postal address in any district  without

residing  in  that  district, because  the  electoral

register  is made up of names of people whose  postal

addresses are so stated in their identity cards. Now,

if that is allowed in the new identity cards, then



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>



2,000 people from different parts of the island could

be   organised   to   register  in   one   particular

constituency and thereby have the right to  vote.  In

that case then, the Member for that constituency will

be  elected not by people residing in that area,  but

by  people  scattered  all over  the  area  who  have

organised  to have their postal addresses so  changed

that  they  can all vote in one area. I  think,  Sir,

that  is  not the purpose of an election. An election

is to enable those living in that area to vote for  a

Member  to represent them as residents in that  area.

So,  unless  something is done to  the  new  identity

cards  to  remove this defect, it may  lead,  in  one

instance  in Singapore in the City Council elections,

to the number of voters being more than the number of

adult residents in one constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder

whether the Member for Tanglin really resides in  the

Tanglin constituency. In any case, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

the present identity card was devised in 1948 when we

were not the Government and it has been in use since.

As  far as my understanding goes, the address in  the

identity  card should be the residential  address  of

the  person.  While  it is true  that  the  electoral

registers are compiled from the identity card, and if

the  address given in the identity card is the postal

address, his name nonetheless will be included in the

particular  constituency. But the Member for  Tanglin

probably  is  aware that all the electoral  registers

are  displayed  during the annual  revision  and  the

public is entitled to inspect these registers and  to

raise  objection. If a voter happens to reside  in  a

particular  constituency but his  name  is  found  in

another  constituency  because  he  gave  his  postal

address, anyone could raise objection against that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was a member

of   the  commission  discussing  the  limitation  of

boundaries  when this point was raised. The  Chairman

maintained  that since the identity card  is  printed

with   the  instructions  "Removed  to  (Full  postal

address)", anybody could have the right to vote



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>



in any area by putting down his new postal address as

in  that  area. Now, Sir, I am residing  in  Tanglin.

Supposing  I  know that the S.P.A. has no  chance  in

Tanglin  and I want to vote in a certain constituency

and  I round up all my supporters all over the island

and  just say to them, "Come along, put down your new

addresses as in that constituency," there is  no  way

of  protesting, because the identity card  shows  the

right  place.  The Chairman of that  commission  said

that  there  was nothing to be done unless  something

was  done  to the identity card. I hope the  Minister

will  look into this, because otherwise we  can  have

all  kinds of unusual things happening. You will  see

20  people  registered as residing at No. 3  Belilios

Lane,  when  actually there will be only  two  voters

residing there. The others are just ghost voters  and

there is no way of taking them out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I think there is a lot in what my

colleague, the Member for Tanglin, says. As the House

is  aware,  the  identity card system was  introduced

sometime in 1947 or 1948 to serve a specific purpose.

Subsequently, the preparation of registers was geared

to meet the system of the National Card Registration.

The   basis   of  registration  under  the  Elections

Ordinance is "residence". "Residence" means where you

reside,  not  a postal address. I think we  all  know

when  we  go  round canvassing certain  houses  where

there  are  60 or 70 votes, there are only about  ten

persons living there, and then someone will tell you,

"Oh,  these  other  ten persons have  lived  in  this

house, but we have never heard of the names of  those

other  40. So far as we know, we have lived here  for

ten years and we do not know their names." I think we

have  all of us met with that situation when we  went

canvassing. So the question arises, "How did these 40

names  get on to the register?" Well, quite obviously

somebody has given the postal address as the  address

of  such  and  such a person. Now,  on  checking  the

election  registers after the elections,  as  it  was

possible to do sometime ago, we found that all  those

40   persons   had  voted.  Although   the   election

propaganda cards had not been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>



distributed because they were all lying there without

being  read,  yet those 40 voters had come  and  cast

their votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, I suggest to the Minister that

there  is  some jiggery-pokery going on. I think  the

Minister is interested to see that a fair register is

compiled and the people who are responsible for  this

jiggery-pokery  do  not  get an  advantage  over  the

honest people who try to contest the elections  on  a

proper basis.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Minister says that anybody can protest. I wonder

who  he envisages can protest, because if I purposely

put  my  postal address on my identity card with  the

intention  of getting the right to vote in a  certain

place, I am not going to protest. Now evidently, if I

put  the address of a friend or relative, he  is  not

going  to  protest. Now, who would be  protesting - the

neighbour  who lives next door and says, "Your  niece

does not live with you. Why is her name there?" I  do

not think that would happen. For instance, if we want

to  protest,  how  do we know that such  a  thing  is

happening  in  Kampong Kapor or in Tanglin?  So,  the

people who would be protesting have no way of finding

out  and  the  people who know about it are  not  the

people who would he making the protest.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, if at all there is any

juggling  there, it has been there for  the  last  10

years  since  we had elections in 1955. In  fact,  we

encountered  the  same problem too  during  the  City

Council election and also the 1959 election, when  we

found quite a large number of voters in the Cairnhill

electoral division were not residing in Cairnhill. In

fact,  the  Member  for Hong Lim  at  that  time  was

wondering whether there was something fishy going on.

I  think the problem can only be solved if the  voter

or the identity card holder will report his change of

address promptly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>



to  the  Registration  Office  and  the  Registration

Office   will  ensure  that  in  future  it  is   the

residential address that should be recorded  and  not

the  postal address. Perhaps, what could be  done  in

future  is  that  when the present identity  card  is

being  re-devised, a column should  be  provided  for

residential as well as postal addresses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> To my mind, Mr Speaker, Sir, the

solution  is  a  simple one.  Just  to  ask  for  "an

address" on the face of the identity card could  mean

a  postal address or a residential address. It should

therefore read "residential address". Where room  for

fraud  does arise is in the phrase "removal to postal

address".  A postal address need not be a residential

address. Under the present system of identity  cards,

if a man intends to commit an election fraud, he just

"changes his postal address". So he is not committing

any   crime.  Now,  if  we  say  "removed   to   full

residential  address" and if he still continues  with

his  jiggery-pokery,  the  Minister  is  then  in   a

position to prosecute him. At the moment, the man who

commits a fraud on the elections cannot be prosecuted

because he is, in fact, complying with the law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

subject of identity cards will come under the Central

Government when Malaysia is formed and we  shall  put

forward  this suggestion to the appropriate authority

to make the necessary changes. Anyone who should want

to  commit a fraud can still do so even though we may

insist on a residential address.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the

assurance that the Minister will pass on the  request

to the proper authority, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 50 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (47) of subhead 1.*



<hr size="2" noshade>

*  The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng Teng Kian.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Federation, they have an independent

Elections Commission. In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>



Singapore, Sir, the Elections Department is under the

Minister   for  Home  Affairs.  The  chief   officer,

therefore,  in a way is not independent.  He  can  be

subjected  to  pressure and  he  will  have  to  obey

instructions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important that during elections in

particular  the  Supervisor  of  Elections  and   all

election officers should be independent. They  should

not  favour  any political Party. Sir, in  the  past,

some of us had to undergo favouritism. There was  one

instance  where  I  protested to  the  Supervisor  of

Elections against certain things that were being done

wrongly   and  the  poor  officer  just   evaded   my

questions. He played for time until after, of course,

the  closing of the polling. Sir, if that officer had

been independent, he would have had the courage to do

what  he  thought was right instead of being  scared,

since  he was after all under orders. Sir, I  do  not

know  whether this could be done because even if  the

Minister says the man is going to be independent,  he

is  still  a  civil servant in the Ministry  of  Home

Affairs. I wonder whether the Minister could  suggest

something so that the public could be sure that  when

once  a  man  is made Supervisor of Elections  during

that  period, he should be free from pressure of  any

kind or anybody, so that the public could be sure and

the  Parties involved in the elections could be  sure

that they have somebody in charge of elections who is

going to treat everybody in the same way.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng Teng Kian is not speaking?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>r Ng Teng Kian</b> indicated dissent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are recent

indications  as  we prophesied in  our  Party  organ,

Bersatu  (Chinese issue) two weeks ago, that  Federal

elections  will come very soon, maybe  in  July  next

month.  We  are very concerned about the  conduct  of

elections because we know too well the dishonesty  of

the P.A.P. Government - the tricks they are prepared to

play.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last referendum campaign, we saw the way

Mr  Ponnuduray was being transferred from some other

department to supervise the referendum.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>



The  way  how the referendum was conducted!  We  have

very little confidence in P.A.P.-conducted elections.

As the Member for Tanglin has said, in the Federation

they  have  an  independent Elections Commission.  In

Singapore  the elections officer is under the  direct

control of the Government. Mr Speaker, this is  more

important  especially when we  have  other  signs  of

repression. For instance, the Government  have  asked

us to change our Party symbol because they are scared

of our three rings ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member for Hong Lim was not

here  when  that  subject was  dealt  with  and  that

subject is closed. It has already been dealt with.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we should have

in   Singapore  the  equivalent  of  the   Federation

Elections  Commission, where an independent  body  to

conduct  the  elections should be appointed  after  a

round-table  conference of all the  Parties  and  not

just  like any other statutory board or any so-called

independent body appointed by the Government.  Unless

this  is  so,  we  do  not believe  that  any  future

election  held under the PAP. Government could  be  a

clean and honest election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the White Paper merger, there are two types of

elections.  One is Federal election, which  is  under

Federal  control,  and the other is  State  election,

which  will  be under State control. Nowhere  in  the

proposed  Malaysian territories could State elections

be  under  State  control. And for what  reason,  Mr

Speaker, Sir? We know. Now with this Bill coming  up,

and,  if  the  British and the Federation Governments

agree,  the  P.A.P.  Government  will  try  to   hold

elections  to  the 15 seats in the Central  Malaysian

Parliament before 31st August this year, so  that  it

will have full control and a full say in running  the

elections. And, Mr Speaker, Sir, we have no faith in

P.A.P. run elections.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Elections

Department  has been in existence since the  Colonial

Secretary  days. From that day onwards until  now,  I

think  it is the same officer who has been in  charge

of the elections. If I recollect,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>



at the time of the City Council elections and also at

the  time  of the last general elections, the  Member

for Hong Lint and other Members, in fact, praised the

officer,  Mr Ponnuduray, for the fair and  impartial

manner in which he conducted all these elections. Now

that he is across the Floor, he is casting aspersions

on the integrity of the same officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are safeguards and

provisions  of  appeal  to  the  High  Court  in  the

Assembly  Elections Ordinance. These same  safeguards

will  also he provided for in the new Bill  that  was

introduced  this afternoon. And if at all the  Member

for  Hong  Lim  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  last

referendum was improperly conducted, he could  always

have recourse to appeal to the High Court.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I regret the

Minister is unwilling to give the assurance that  the

Supervisor of Elections will be free from his control

during  the  period  of election.  He  says  that  if

anything  goes wrong we have the right to  appeal  to

the  High  Court.  Sir,  we know  how  difficult  and

expensive  it  is  to  go through  the  procedure  of

appealing to the High Court. In fact, during election

time  when something goes wrong, immediate action  is

required. We cannot wait until after the polling  has

been  completed, the decision announced, and then  we

appeal  to  the High Court. That really prevents  the

carrying  out of elections in a fair way. I am  sure,

Sir,  that in the interests of all Parties concerned,

we  should  have an independent officer in charge  of

elections in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member for Hong Lim says

he  cannot trust any election organised by the P.A.P.

Government. He says there is some fraud somewhere. In

1960  there was the Hong Lim by-election. May I  know

where  the fraud was practised, and if so,  would  he

like  to  rescind  the result and then  have  another

round?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said

during  the  last few days, the Hong Lim  by-election

was the watershed of P.A.P. policy and P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>



tactics.  In Hong Lim they were sure they were  going

to  win.  They had lion dances ready, dragons  ready,

lire crackers ready and banners ready. They were sure

of a P.A.P. victory. If they had known that they were

going   to   lose,  the  position  would  have   been

different.  But  when the referendum  was  held,  the

whole  position changed. Mr Ponnuduray  was  not  in

charge of the Hong Lim by-election. Mr, de Souza  was

in charge. Mr Ponnuduray was transferred back from a

more  important  and higher position to  conduct  and

supervise the referendum.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Elections Office should

be independent of the Government, as has been done in

the  Federation. They are fond of going back  to  the

referendum.  I  was there. In fact, I  nearly  raised

objections.  Here  was  the Supervisor  of  Elections

taking  orders.  He  was  not  free  to  do  what  he

considered should be done. He was taking orders. Then

he  was  told to say and what not to say. Even before

the  results were announced, the Minister  was  there

sitting  in  that office drafting something  out  and

then it was given to the Supervisor to read out. This

is  all  wrong.  I  do not wish  to  imply  that  the

Government cooks up all this. No - but in order to give

at least a semblance of non-interference, let us make

this office an independent office.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am very glad, Sir, that the

Member for Cairnhill has now come out to confirm what

we  have  been saying all along, that the  referendum

was a sham, that everything was done in such a way  - [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown is

very  fond  of  making reckless  statements  in  this

Chamber  which might land him in serious trouble  one

day  in  the Committee of Privileges. I do not  think

the  Member for Cairnhill said the referendum  was  a

sham. The Member for Cairnhill may wish to deny that.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I have said that the

Supervisor  of  Elections  was  too  much  under  the

control of the Minister. He could not do anything  on

his own



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>



except on instructions, even at the counting place at

the Badminton Stadium.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is what we said also. We

said  that  the Supervisor of Referendum  was  taking

instructions   from  the  Prime  Minister   who   was

conducting  the  whole process  of  counting  at  the

Badminton Hall that night. We mentioned all  this  on

2nd  September. Now, this is confirmed by the  Member

for Cairnhill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I think the Member for Queenstown

again  puts  words into the mouth of the  Member  for

Cairnhill. The Member for Cairnhill said he  did  not

agree  to  certain things. He said instructions  were

being  given,  whereas the Member for  Queenstown  is

obviously on the lookout for some independent witness

to  substantiate the allegations that have been  made

for the last two years-the phoney referendum. Now  he

says the Prime Minister was conducting the balloting.

That  is not true, Sir. There were Opposition Members

there.  Far  from the Prime Minister  conducting  the

actual counting of the balloting, I think the Members

of  the Barisan Sosialis were running from one  table

to  the other looking for the little cards that  were

placed inside the balloting boxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the Member for Hong Lint is concerned, I

think, after the first one or two hours he had  quite

decided  which  way  the wind  was  blowing.  He  was

sitting up in the gallery. Anyway, I quite agree that

there   should  be  an  assurance  given   that   the

referendum  or  any  balloting  would  be   conducted

fairly.  It  was done so in the past. The  system  is

what  has been obtaining since 1948 under the  former

Chief  Minister. We never quarrelled  that  the  1959

elections were unfair, and I do not think the  Member

for  Hong Lim, for whom history starts with Hong Lim,

has ever questioned the propriety of the Hong Lim

by-election. Now he is just safeguarding himself for the

future by-election by saying right beforehand that if

he  and  his  Party  do  not  win  the  next  general

elections  or  elections to the 15 seats,  he  thinks

that  the elections should be phoney; but if he  does

win,  he  will be quite satisfied that the  elections

were fairly conducted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Another point is that it is

important   that   we  should  have  an   independent

Elections  Commission concerned with the delimitation

of  boundaries. Now, in the coming federal  elections

the   boundaries  are  going  to  be   delimited   by

Government ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think a Bill has been

introduced which will deal with that point  and  that

is the time to debate the relevant clauses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, I saw Mr

Ponnuduray at the Badminton Hall during the  counting

in  the  referendum, and I was told  that  the  Prime

Minister was in the room. From my experience ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I must warn Members that these

innuendoes will, if taken up in the right  way,  land

Members  into very serious trouble with the Committee

of   Privileges.  Members  should  not   make   these

innuendoes under the cloak of privilege. If there had

been any foul play, the proper thing to have done was

to  bring the matter up in the High Court. I can only

sound this warning. I cannot stop Members from making

innuendoes,  but  if they choose to  make  statements

loaded  with innuendoes, they take the risk  of  very

serious action by the Committee of Privileges.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to say that the

basic reason why the Opposition would prefer to  have

an  independent  Elections Commission for  conducting

elections is that we do not trust the P.A.P. I do not

think  it  is improper for us to say that  we  cannot

trust   the   P.A.P.  By  the  standards  of   P.A.P.

performance  in the past, they are quite  capable  of

rigging   up   an  election  legally,  if   necessary

otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not proper for Government to have one

department   of   the   Government   conducting   the

elections. Our doubts or fears were proved  when  the

referendum  results were produced. We think  that  if

the Government gets a department of the Government to

conduct  elections,  there is a possibility  of  foul

play.  As  to whether they will do it or not  do  it,

well, that is a different proposition. We cannot say.

But if the Government is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>



sure  that  the  people support them,  as  they  have

always said, - there is absolutely no reason whatsoever

why  they  should object to agreeing in principle  to

have  an independent commission to conduct elections.

There  is  no  reason at all, as is the case  in  the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It is no use to flog a dead

horse,  but  it  appears to me that  Members  of  the

Opposition, both on the right and the left,  seem  to

think  that  there is something wrong in the  present

situation  in that the Department of Elections  is  a

department  of  Government and is not an  independent

statutory  authority. Sir, they can hardly  blame  us

for  this position, because this is the situation  as

laid  down  in the Constitution, and it was  not  the

P.A.P. who negotiated and drew up the Constitution in

1959.  So  if  the Member for Cairnhill dislikes  the

present  situation, then he must bear the major  part

of the responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Barisan Sosialis not liking it, they are

not  trusting it, they are entitled to their dislikes

and  distrusts. It does not move us the slightest bit

on this side of the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

find  that  the Ministry of Home Affairs  has  become

more  reactionary and more repressive to us. When  we

were  in the P.A.P. we were blinded by them, but once

when  we  found that they had become reactionary,  we

lest    them.   Even   concerning   the   Undesirable

Publications  Ordinance,  the  purpose  of  which  is

really to deal with undesirable publications, but  in

actual  fact it is not so, because this Ordinance  is

used  to curb any publications not desirable  to  the

P.A.P.  Ever since the past few years the P.A.P. has

been banning many publications which were opposed  to

it: for instance, the publication by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>



General  Employees'  Union  and  the  publication  of

Nantah - Nanyang University Students' Union. The P.A.P.

Government  is further suppressing us and  preventing

our  publications from being published. Further, they

will not allow many unions and organisations to issue

their  anniversary publications. On the face  of  it,

they  want to show that they are democratic and there

is  freedom, but, in fact, they threatened a printing

house  as  a result of which our Party organ  was  no

longer able to be printed in that printing house. All

this  shows  that the so-called democracy  is  phoney

democracy.  At  present  our  Party  organ  is  being

stencilled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another incident is that in 1959, slogans and

posters  and  printed  matter need  not  have  to  be

approved,  but  nowadays the P.A.P. has  become  more

reactionary.   All   these  publications,   cartoons,

posters and other things will have to be approved  by

the  P.A.P. From this we can see that their amendment

to  the Undesirable Publications Ordinance and  their

so-called  abolishing  of  yellow  culture  are   all

humbug.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> After a long speech he has not moved

purpose   is   to   prohibit  the   publication   and

circulation of publications which are either  morally

undesirable or are against the public interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The publications referred to were banned by the

Government as a result of an I.S.C. decision taken in

February  this  year,  and  these  publications  were

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the policy of film censorship in Singapore is a

mystery  to  many people. Outside the  Film  Censor's

office  and  probably the top men in the  Government,

the  exact  policy with regard to film censorship  in

Singapore is unknown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall be glad if the Minister will kindly

state,  firstly, the policy given to the Film  Censor

for  the  censorship of films in Singapore; secondly,

whether  that  policy  is the same  as  that  of  the

Federation;  and, thirdly, how many  members  of  the

Cinematograph Films Appeal Committee are  members  of

the People's Action Party.

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 52 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps I had better repeat my question.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is not necessary.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I would be much obliged if the

Minister would answer what I asked just now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, as regards

the  policy  on  film  censorship,  I  think  it   is

published  in the newspapers, and I do  not  think  I

should  take up too much time in dealing with  it  in

detail.  The  general principles come  under  matters

affecting  the  organs of the State,  especially  the

Police:  scenes which tend to bring the  police  into

general  disrepute  and  contempt;  defiance  of  the

Police  and  law and order; anything which  tends  to

excite inter-racial feeling or promote religious

ill-feeling  or  rivalry;  anything  that  might  provoke

sedition  or cause disturbance of public tranquility;

certain matters which might contravene good taste  in

regard  to public morals; films which tend to  depict

horror  for its own sake. Of course, there are  broad

political objectives: films which tend to bring  into

disrepute the constitution and the ideals on which  a

State  is founded, or to incite people into political

violence,  political  disorder  and  unconstitutional

acts. These are the broad principles around which the

Film Censor has to work. Naturally, when he comes  to

apply  these  broad  principles  to  specific  cases,

individual  judgment comes in. That  is  one  of  the

reasons why we have to have an appeal committee which

consists of nine members. Again the interpretation is

based  on the individual position of the nine members

collectively. The result is that very  often  you  do

find  that  the Federation censors on rare  occasions

pass a film which we have prohibited. And when a  new

Committee  of Appeal comes in, very often, on  second

thoughts,  they  reverse the  decision  made  by  the

preceding Committee of Appeal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Member for Tanglin has made this issue a

rather  broad one, I have to touch on it  on  general

lines. [Interruption] Yes, the membership. There  are

nine members.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Who are they?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> We have two Political Secretaries

who  will always be there, a Parliamentary Secretary,

three



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>



from  the  University, one from the Dewan Bahasa  and

one,  I  think, is an independent gentleman, Mr  Tan

See Chin.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I notice that

when  the  Minister was giving the list of principles

governing  the censorship of films, what was  missing

was  this: is there not one principle that a  picture

should  be  banned if it is inclined to  make  people

respect  colonialism  and to  belittle  the  people's

aspiration  of wanting to be a free nation?  Are  not

such pictures banned?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes. Any picture

which  tends to glorify colonialism, or bring certain

people,   especially   Asians   or   Africans,   into

unnecessary ridicule and contempt is banned.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

has   not   answered  the  third  question   rightly.

According  to the Government directory here,  out  of

the nine members of the Committee of Appeal, at least

six are members of the People's Action Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as an educationist, I regret to say that I am

of  the  opinion  that  there are  many  pictures  of

gangsters  emphasizing  gun-play,  crime,   sex   and

violence which are passed and freely shown. But under

this  present system, because the Committee of Appeal

is  loaded  with people with a political  bias,  some

good  films,  have been banned. There  are  two  such

films  which were banned in Singapore but  passed  in

the  Federation, strange to say. One of them,  "Satan

Never Sleeps", was shown in Johore Bahru.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> What is it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> "Satan Never Sleeps". I have read

the story, Sir. The main character is a Communist  in

Red  China who rediscovers his soul and ends his life

in  a very noble manner. We do not know why that film

should have been banned in Singapore. I am even  more

curious  to  know why a second film was banned.  This

second film, called "The Crowning Experience", is the

story  of  a  woman educator of Negro extraction  who

rose from a very low position



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>



to become the founder of a college and adviser to two

presidents.  She was known personally to the  present

Vice-Chancellor  of the University of  Malaya  as  an

educator.  This  film  was seen  in  Tokyo  by  three

Malayans  who  went  there to attend  a  U.N.E.S.C.O.

Conference;  one  was the respected  Singapore  State

Advocate-General, another a very well-known lawyer in

Penang,  Mrs B. H. Oon, and the other a Muslim  lady

social  welfare  worker. They were so impressed  that

when  they  came to Singapore, they said, "This  film

must  be  brought  to Singapore and the  Federation."

Now, Sir, knowing that the People's Action Party  may

have  political  considerations. First  I  asked  the

S.A.G. whether he would personally make the  request

to  the film people. He did. He, with the lady lawyer

from  Penang, and I went to the film people and  made

the  request  to have the film brought here.  In  due

course,  the film was brought here and it was  passed

by  the  Film Censor with a few minor cuts. An appeal

was lodged because in no country, except in Communist

countries had this film been banned or cut,  and  the

P.A.P.dominated Committee of Appeal  banned  it.  The

film  went  to  the  Federation, and  it  was  passed

without any cut. The previous Education Minister, who

had seen it in Tokyo, praised it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Which one?



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> The second, i.e. the present

Federation   Education  Minister   who   is   of   an

independent mind, saw it and said that it was a  good

film.  He  was  not  satisfied and  invited  his  own

committee  in charge of films for showing  to  public

schools  to vet it. They passed it, and he  certified

that  it was a film of educational value to be  shown

to  schools.  Educationists in Kuala Lumpur  saw  the

film and they said, "This is the kind of film we must

have  in  Malaya." Of all the places,  here  in  this

Colony - er, this State -



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Colony?



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> P.A.P. colony really, a good film

which  is  rarely to be found is banned, because  the

spirit  of  that film shows that love is better  than

hatred, reconciliation and co-operation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>



are  better  than division and strife.  The  People's

Action  Party  now  talk about a new  spirit  of

co-operation,  less strife, and they ban  a  film  which

has, as its main theme, the kind of spirit which  has

been  shown in Tokyo generated by President  Soekarno

and  our Tunku, and in Manila recently. That  is  the

kind  of  spirit  which the Party in  power  says  in

words,  "We  want", but in deed they do not  seem  to

want,  Sir.  That  is the thing that  perplexes  many

people. If they are really for reconciliation and

co-operation,  why must they ban a film which  has  been

regarded by two Education Ministers as of educational

value  and  highly recommended by their own Singapore

State   Advocate-General  whose  qualities  we   have

praised in this House?



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, one thing about the

Member  for  Tanglin, is that he  is  always  a  year

behind  with his facts. The list that he read out  of

the  Appeals  Committee is an old  one.  The  present

Committee  consists  of my Political  Secretary,  the

Prime Minister's Political Secretary, Dr Huang  from

Nanyang   University,  Dr  Wong  Lincoln  from   the

University of Singapore, Mr Tan See Chin  who  is  a

lawyer,  Mr  K.  C.  Lee  (my  former  Parliamentary

Secretary), Madam Chan (Assemblywoman), Inche  Buyong

bin  Adil from the Dewan Bahasa, and Dr K. J. Ratnam

also from the University of Singapore. These are  not

men whose tastes can be lightly dismissed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that when the Member mentioned

"Satan  Never Sleeps", I was quite interested because

it  is  probably  a  reference  to  Barisan  Sosialis

history. I have not seen the film myself but I made a

quick  enquiry. It is a very poorly produced,  rather

puerile, anti-Communist film. It is not just  because

it  is  an  anti-Communist film, but we believe  that

anything which can intelligently expose Communism, or

Fascism,  or anything else, should be allowed.  There

is   no  greater  dis-service  you  can  do  to   the

democratic cause than to put forward a picture  which

is  so  puerile  that  you are  likely  to  win  more

converts to Communism than anything else.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other film, again I think probably the Member

for  Tanglin is being modest in that he did not  tell

all   the  stories.  "The  Crowning  Experience",   I

understand,   is  a  film  about  Moral   Rearmament.

Personally I have not seen the film, and so  I  would

not  like to make any judgment. But I am told it  has

been   rejected  on  similar  grounds - that  in   this

country, if you are going to expose Communism, do  it

intelligently. But if you do it in such  a  bad  way,

you are more likely to rouse the antagonism of people

who  might  otherwise not be interested in Communism.

As  for the judgment of the film as to whether it  is

good  or  bad,  I  think we should leave  it  to  the

Appeals Committee - nine people who have a directive to

follow.  If  the Member for Tanglin wants  to  get  a

reappeal, he can reappeal to the Committee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am surprised

that the Minister considers a film like "The Crowning

Experience" puerile, as it were. Sir, in addition  to

the  S.A.G. who commended it, the late Tun Leong  Yew

Koh, Minister for Justice in the Federation, said  it

was  very inspiring. Now, could the Minister say that

these  two  men who, you might say, are at  the  very

apex of their professions, had puerile minds?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $320,210 for Head 52 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 53 -



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 53 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 20.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice this is a new vote. I am just wondering

whether this $14,000 new vote is to take over some of

the  duties and services of Head 7, subhead 12,  item

(1) [Maintenance of Fire Fighting Equipment], also on

the  same  subject of fire fighting equipment,  which

has been cut down for the rural areas from $1,150  to

$500.  I am also wondering whether this Head  7  vote

was  cut down because there is this new vote and also

some  of the duties are being carried by this $14,000

vote.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raise this because I feel that equipment for fire

fighting  services  for  the  rural  areas  is   very

important, in view of the fires that are breaking out

in the kampongs. I have brought this to the notice of

the  Minister before, but nothing seems to have  been

done.  Previously  there used  to  be  fire  fighting

squads  in  the kampongs and fire extinguishers  were

provided,  and  the Government saw to it  that  there

were groups of about 20 young volunteers each on whom

the  kampong  could  fall back  in  case  of  a  fire

emergency,  and  also to see that  the  extinguishers

were  kept up to date. Now the extinguishers are  all

dry, the squads no longer exist, as they were ignored

and neglected. I thought it such a pity because these

kampong  fire fighting squads with extinguishers  are

good  safeguards and are a real help to prevent fires

from spreading.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the sum of

$14,000 will be used to purchase equipment sufficient

for 20 kampong fire fighting squads.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> May I withdraw, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $2,591,210 for Head 53 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 54 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Tun Lim

Yew Hock:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 54 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 6.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Tun Lim? He is not here. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 54 be

reduced by $100.*





<hr size="2" noshade>

*  The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr A. P. Rajah, Dato Abdul Hamid bin Haji Jumat and Mr Ng Teng Kian.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask the Government whether they are ready

to reconsider their policy as regards Singapore-born

people who have been to China and are not allowed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>



to  return  to Singapore. The Prime Minister  in  his

rural  visits told the people of Singapore that  such

people   had  not  been  allowed  to  come  back   to

Singapore, because if they did, they would be  taking

away  the  rice bowl  -  the jobs - of quite  a  number  of

people.  We  say  that is all nonsense,  because  the

Prime  Minister  himself has also  said  that  should

Malaysia  be  formed, people from all  the  so-called

Malaysian  territories would be  able  to  come  into

Singapore and compete for jobs, in which case, let me

ask:  how  is  it that outsiders from  the  so-called

Malaysian  territories  are  allowed  to  come   into

Singapore while actual local-born people who went out

of  the  country for a short term are not allowed  to

return  to  Singapore? We would like  an  explanation

from the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Just one matter, Mr Speaker, Sir. The

other day I had a visit from a Singapore citizen  who

is an Indian. He is married to a lady in India and he

was  trying to get her into Singapore. As a Singapore

citizen,  he is entitled under the law, I  think,  to

bring his wife into Singapore although she might  not

be  a  citizen. He produced to me his papers and  the

correspondence  he  had  had  with  the   Immigration

Department.  The  official reply  that  went  to  him

was - no,  first  of all, there were difficulties  made

about  proof  of  marriage,  which  is  a  legitimate

difficulty. He got over that, and the Department  was

satisfied that the lady was, in fact, his wife.  Then

the final reply came saying she was not -  what was the

phrase ? - in the category of persons who were entitled

to  come into Singapore. I think that was the  phrase

used,  although they were satisfied that she was,  in

fact, his lawfully wedded wife. He was persistent, as

a  husband  should be as regards his wife, and  asked

the  Controller of Immigration why she was not in the

category  of persons permitted to come into Singapore

although  she  was  accepted as his  lawfully  wedded

wife.  Came  the reply quoting some regulation  which

said that because he had been separated from his wife

for more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>



than  five years and had not seen her during the five

years,  therefore,  she was not in  the  category  of

persons entitled to come into Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position to me seems ridiculous. Apparently if

he  had gone and seen her two days just prior to  the

five  years  expiring, she would  have  been  in  the

category  entitled to come in. This operates  harshly

against a poor man. The man who is well provided with

money can go to India, see his wife and come back and

he  apparently can bring her into Singapore.  But  if

you  are so poor as not to be able to go and see your

wife  for  five years and you want to  bring  her  in

after  five  years, you would have had it  under  our

law,  so  it seems. A regulation was quoted  to  this

unfortunate husband as the regulation under which  it

was  deemed that his wife was not in the category  of

persons  entitled to come into Singapore. If that  is

the law, Mr Speaker - it may be, I do not know - I think

it  is  a  very harsh, unconscionable and anti-social

law. I think the Government should look into it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

with regard to immigration, the application for wives

coming  into  Singapore is indeed  very  complicated.

Many citizens of Chinese origin who have been staying

in  Singapore  for  a  number of years  and  received

Singapore citizenship rights are not allowed to bring

their  wives  from foreign countries into  Singapore.

Some  of  them who have had approval to  bring  their

wives  are  not allowed to bring their  children  in.

These children are only about 14 years old.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, many citizens of Chinese origin have received citizenship rights. They have looked upon Singapore as their own country. They hope to stay forever in Singapore. We cannot understand why there are such regulations to limit lawful wives to join and stay together with their lawfully wedded

husbands. Some citizens after having gone abroad  for

travel or studies and married foreign girls are still

able  to  bring their wives into Singapore.  In  this

particular case, this person is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>



allowed.  How is that others are allowed  while  this

particular case is not allowed, in spite of her being

a  woman  of  about 50 years old? I  would  like  the

Minister to explain such a question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Queenstown has asked the Government whether it  would

reconsider  the  change  of  policy  with  regard  to

Singapore-born persons who are now in China and could

not  return,  if the House will recollect,  in  1961,

there  was a Review Committee of the P.A.P. of  which

the Member for Queenstown was the Secretary, and this

Committee, after studying this problem, came out with

a recommendation agreeing with government policy that

these  people  should not be allowed to  return.  The

reasons  are  many,  quite apart  from  the  economic

reasons  which the Member for Queenstown alleged  the

Prime Minister had advanced. First, we would like  to

know  why these people left Singapore for China. Most

of these persons left Singapore somewhere around 1950

to  1954. They left because they wanted to take  part

in   the  reconstruction  of  their  motherland,   or

fatherland  as  you  call it.  They  were  very  much

inspired by the great revolution that was going on in

China and they wanted to go in and participate in the

reconstruction of their motherland. So they left this

place with no intention of coming back. Some of  them

even went against their parents' wishes. They did not

consider Singapore their home. So they left. If  that

was  their reason for leaving Singapore, well, so  be

it.  Since  China is their motherland, by  all  means

stay there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, even those persons who claimed to be

registered  Singapore  citizens  or  claimed  to   be

Singapore   citizens  because  they  were   born   in

Singapore  left for China without taking  any  travel

documents.  In  other words, they have exercised  the

rights  accorded to the national of another  country,

and  in  so  doing  they have lost their  citizenship

rights:  and these people, quite properly,  were  not

allowed  to  return.  I do not  see  any  reason  for

changing  the  present policy. But, in any  case,  in

another two months' time, this will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>



a  Central Government matter and it will be up to the

Central Government to review the matter if there is a

case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other case mentioned by the Member for

Farrer  Park, there was such a regulation  where,  if

the  husband is separated from his wife for more than

five years as from 1st December, 1954, then generally

she  would not be allowed to return. Since 1962, this

matter   has   been  taken  up  with  the  Federation

Government  and  we  are yet to hear  the  Federation

Government's views. Because the Immigration Ordinance

and  Regulations are pan-Malayan, it is not  possible

for us to take action on our own. Nevertheless, in  a

few  cases,  certain discretion was made  on  special

compassionate grounds and such persons  were  allowed

to come in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point raised by the Member for

Punggol, I have already mentioned just now that there

are  various reasons why wives and children  are  not

allowed in. Quite apart from economic reasons,  there

is also the security reason. I am sure the Member for

Punggol  was  not aware that in some of these  cases,

approvals  were  given for the wife and  children  to

come  into Singapore. But each case has to be  viewed

on  its own merits. I would say that in most of these

cases,  the  sponsor  could  not  produce  any  proof

whatsoever  that  the applicants  were  either  their

wives or children, and it would be very difficult for

the   Immigration  Department  officers  to  make   a

decision.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am surprised at the Minister,

Sir,I remember the last time when he touched on this

subject,  I  had conclusively proved  then  that  the

Advisory Committee or Review Committee of the  P.A.P.

of which I was then Secretary, had already agreed, on

principle,  that  Singapore-born people  were  to  be

allowed back to Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We recommended that and that was

what  caused us to argue and quarrel about - for  quite

some time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister asks why did they leave Singapore for China in 1956/1957? Surely he must remember that at that time, the P.A.P. was not the Government. It was a colonial government and they objected to the measures of the colonial government. Is the Minister now trying to defend the colonial government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We all know, of course, that he

is  merely the stooge of the colonial power,  but  he

seems to be admitting this fact so openly nowadays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the Minister for Home Affairs at one time

had headed a procession on March 8th, i.e. on Women's

Day,  demanding that Women's Day be recognised.  Now,

because  he  happens to be the Minister  he  turns  a

somersault.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have the impression

that  the  Minister  was not unsympathetic.  He  also

suggested that he has a discretion in this matter.  I

will therefore pursue the matter with him. To put the

position of these Indians in the proper light so that

a  decision  could be taken on a logical basis.  Sir,

this particular Indian who saw me is a messenger.  He

is  earning a salary of $120 or $140 a month.  It  is

not  possible  for  him to visit his  wife  regularly

every year. The mistake he has apparently made is not

to visit her within five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another factor which weighs in favour of these

people  is  this. The population ratio for women  and

men, so far as this group of Indians is concerned, is

heavily  weighted in favour of the male, so  that  if

they  choose to marry, they cannot marry  here  among

their  own  people. So it is incumbent upon  them  to

find  their bride somewhere else. It has happened  to

some  of us here already. I think a sympathetic  view

should be taken of these cases. This is not a case of

where  somebody is trying to defraud the  Immigration

laws and side-step them and bring people here who are

undesirables.  I  think he is  being  a  good  social

creature. He is not doing anything anti-social and is

in no way trying to evade the immigration



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>



laws.  It  is  merely that his financial position  is

such that he has not been able to break the five-year

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not

mention 1956/57. I mentioned 1950 to 1954. The Member

for  Queenstown  said  that, because  in  those  days

Singapore  was under colonial rule and because  these

young   men  disliked  living  under  colonial  rule,

therefore they left for China.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if these young men had regarded

Singapore as their home, their country, and  if  they

had any loyalty to Singapore, they should have stayed

back  and fought against the colonialists, as we have

done, instead of running away to China like cowards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as for the other case which the

Member for Farrer Park has brought up, I think if  he

will give me the particulars, I will look into it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> First of all, I will touch on

this  Police Adviser. The P.A.P. has always professed

that it is an anti-colonial Government. But only last

night  we heard the Minister for Finance saying  that

he  preferred  to  retain  the  services  of  another

Britisher  in order to run the civil service  to  his

satisfaction and in order to make sure  that  he  may

protect the interests of his colonial master.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order, yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member has completely

misrepresented me. I said nothing of the sort.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is not really a point of order. But

I   allowed  it  because  I  think  the  Member   for

Queenstown should be careful in his choice of  words.

I  do not think the Minister said what the Member for

Queenstown alleged that he said.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He is very sensitive about

things like that.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown, I

think,  ought  to  acknowledge that  he  has  made  a

mistake instead of persisting. He has made a mistake.

The  Minister has never said what he has alleged  the

Minister  has  said.  He  must  not  put  words  into

somebody else's mouth which never came out from  that

person's mouth.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Of course, that is our

interpretation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Withdraw.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Well, we will leave it at that.

Why  should the Police Adviser be kept back? We would

like  to  know  that.  Are our local  boys  not  good

enough?  Does the Minister not trust our local  boys?

Must  he  have one of those who can rule from  behind

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>



suggest from behind? If the Minister wants to tell us

that  there  is independence, then, of course,  these

people  must  go.  The whole idea  of  Malayanisation

means  that all who are not local born must go. After

all,  his  loyalty  is  not  towards  Singapore.  The

Minister  for Home Affairs just talks about  loyalty,

and  yet  he  is  retaining people whose  loyalty  is

directed  elsewhere. As far as  I  know,  the  Police

Adviser is not even a Singapore citizen, and yet  our

Minister  is  fighting  to retain  a  non-citizen  of

Singapore  in  order to help - what? - to preserve  the

interests  of  some other outside  power.  They  have

always been talking about being a national Government

and  being  nationalist.  Now,  who  is  fighting  to

preserve the outside power's interests? Is it not the

P.A.P.  Government? So how can they  call  themselves

nationalists in any way? We are the people who  fight

against  outside powers and yet they  are  trying  to

call   us  anti-nationalists.  Who  is  serving   the

interest of outside powers?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You.

asks a question across the Chamber he must expect  an

am  not quite certain -  he will not be interrupted  as

often as he is.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Nowadays, Sir, the police are not

used  to  preserve law and order. They  are  used  to

break strikes. As far as I can see ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I did indicate that if there is

to   be  a  debate  on  the  general  policy  of  the

Government in regard to police, we should wait  until

we  come  to  amendment (3) , that is,  the  amendment

which reads: "That the

total  sum to be allocated for Head 55 be reduced  by

$100."      We      are     now     dealing      with

personalities - personnel.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, they are more or less

connected.  If you will allow me, I will  range  over

the whole matter.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think we had better dispose of

amendments (l)* and (2)+ first. Then,  incidentally,

<hr size="2" noshade>





<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will confine myself to the

Commissioner of Police. The Commissioner of Police is

supposed  to  look  after the civil  liberty  of  the

individuals.   He  is  there  to  ensure   that   the

individual is not subject to interference and  he  is

there  to see that law and order is preserved. But  I

am saying that the Commissioner of Police does not do

his  job properly. When a person is arrested,  he  is

supposed  to  be given the facilities to contact  his

lawyers  and  his family. I am going to give  you  an

instance where the Commissioner of Police, either  on

the  direction of the Minister or the Prime Minister,

does  not allow the individual this freedom. I  refer

to  the  arrest  of  myself and  our  legal  adviser.

[Laughter] The Minister for Finance finds it amusing.

But  he would not find it so amusing if he should  be

placed in the same position as I was. I went along to

the  police station to bail my colleagues at about  a

quarter  to  four. I am not talking about the  actual

case itself. I was given all the consideration by the

Superintendent, or whoever it was who was  in  charge

of  the  police  station. I could  see  the  arrested

Assemblyman,  but  while we were talking  to  him,  a

telephone  rang  and  immediately  after  that,   the

Superintendent of the police station  told  us,  that

is,  our legal adviser and me, that we would be under

arrest.  Mind you, Sir, we were not arrested when  we

went to the police



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>



station.  The  Superintendent did not arrest  us.  He

never thought at any moment that we had done anything

wrong.  But the telephone rang and immediately  after

that  we were put under arrest. That was round  about 4.10  p.m.,

Sir. When we were told that we  were  put

under arrest, we asked, first of all, to contact  our

lawyers.  The Superintendent said no. He  refused  to

allow  us  a  chance to contact our lawyers.  Then  I

asked  if I could inform my family. Again the  answer

was  no.  The Superintendent said that we had  to  go

through  certain processes; he gave certain  excuses.

We  accepted  that for the time being, and  since  he

insisted that we had to make a statement, do this  or

do  that,  we followed what the Superintendent  said.

But every time we asked to contact our lawyers and to

inform  our family, the same answer came back-no.  We

were  told  at  the  time we were arrested  that  the

charges  were bailable charges. But somehow or  other

the  Superintendent refused to allow us to be bailed.

From  4  o'clock  to 5 o'clock, to 6  o'clock,  to  7

o'clock,  to 8 o'clock, and right through the  night.

Sir, while we were kept inside the room we heard  our

legal adviser coming. He had heard of our arrest.  He

wanted  to contact us and to speak to us. But even  a

lawyer was prevented from seeing us. We were kept  in

the Inspectors' Room. We were told that if we were to

make  a  statement, we were told that if we  had  our

thumb printed, we would be allowed to go home. We did

that.  Still  we  were  not allowed  to  contact  our

lawyers  or  our family. Very luckily,  some  of  our

colleagues  brought some rice for us, and we  managed

to  have a little bite. But all the time we were kept

inside  the  police station. We were held,  in  fact,

incommunicado.  I  do not know  under  what  law  the

police  kept  us. But we were so angry when  we  were

prevented  from  even informing our families  that  I

told  them  that if they really wanted to punish  us,

let  them  punish us in any way they liked.  But  let

them  not  punish our families as well.  I  was  very

angry,  Sir, with the Superintendent. But  he  turned

round and said, "Sorry-orders." We asked some of  the

police inspectors there whether this was the normal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>



practice.  They  said  no. That  is  not  the  normal

practice.  We  asked  whether people  arrested  would

normally be allowed to contact their family and their

lawyers.  They said yes. Normally they were  allowed.

Why  then were we treated differently? We tell  those

gangsters opposite ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member must not get so

excited  as to be unparliamentary. He is now  in  the

completely unparliamentary with reference to a Member

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> For the sake of decorum of the

them the same outside this House at any time.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am not interested in what the

and collectedly as we can.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Ministers gave instructions.

We  do  not  blame the policemen for  all  this.  The

inspectors  themselves were surprised at how  such  a

thing  could  have happened. But it is the  Ministers

who   abused  their  powers  just  to  punish   their

political opponents. This is, to say the least,  very

unparliamentary.  Why should they  do  a  thing  like

that?  If they wanted to shoot us, they could. We  do

not  have any guns on us. They have guns around  them

all the time. They could easily do that. I understand

the  Prime  Minister is a crack shot.  He  learns  to

shoot every day.

I  do not want to go now into greater details because

we  tend to reveal more of the facts later on. Let me

just touch a little on the Special Branch ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Special Branch would be under "policy", would it not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Under policy.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Under policy, yes. We will deal with

items (1) and (2) first. The Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head 55 be reduced

by 510 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate may range over the second the second

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head 55 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (2) of subhead 1."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Eng Guan.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government

promised us last time, when we raised the question of

the  Malayanisation  of the post of  Commissioner  of

Police, that it would be done very soon. So far  this

post  has  not  been Malayanised. Particularly  in  a

country where the governing party is feeling that  it

is  losing ground, the post of Commissioner of Police

is   very  important.  We  see  that  they  draw  the

applicant  either from the Director, Special  Branch,

or  the  Assistant Commissioner of the C.I.D.  It  is

very  important, therefore, that the persons who  are

being  groomed, being built up, who are  being  given

all-round  experience for this post, must he  persons

of  sufficient  integrity, and  not  sycophants,  nor

position-seekers.  If  we have  a  Director,  Special

Branch - and  in the past few years most  Directors  of

the  Special Branch automatically subsequently became

Commissioner  of Police - who is a position-seeker  and

takes  orders  from the governing  party,  what  will

happen  is  that  the future Commissioner  of  Police

would be prepared at any time to take orders from the

Government.   You   know,  Mr  Speaker,   Sir,   the

Commissioner  has immense powers under  the  P.P.S.O.

and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>



Criminal   Law  (Temporary  Provisions)   (Amendment)

Ordinance to help the Government in power to suppress

and  repress political rivals. You know, Mr Speaker,

they  can fix up evidence and do all sorts of things,

and  there  will be a good case to detain a political

rival.  Therefore,  it  is in the  interests  of  the

State,  particularly at a time when the  Commissioner

of Police is going to retire, to be Malayanised, that

we  should have in the top ranks of the police men of

integrity,  men who are not prepared to take  orders,

not yes-men but men who believe in carrying out their

duty as police officers in the best traditions of the

British police system.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the present

Commissioner  of Police has selected  by  the  Public

Service  Commission and he is a man  of  considerable

experience,  probably longest in the police  service,

and  he  has had varied experience. I wonder  whether

the  Member for Hong Lim is casting aspersions on the

integrity of this Commissioner of Police.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of clarification, yes. Mr Ong

Eng Guan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Minister,  either  unconsciously  or  purposely,  has

quoted  me  in a different way. I am only giving  the

broad  principles  of  how  we  should  have  men  of

sufficient  integrity who are number two  and  number

three in the police, because when the time comes that

this   Government   carries  out   its   promise   of

Malayanisation of the post of Commissioner of Police,

we  will  have  men of integrity who  are  local  men

capable of taking up this most important post.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the post of

Commissioner of Police has been Malayanised. I do not

know  what the Member for Hong Lim is talking  about.

And below this Commissioner of Police, who is a local

man, the Deputy and the other Assistant Commissioners

are  all  local  men. There are no  more  expatriates

there. Unless he wants to question the present holder

of the post of Commissioner of Police



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>



- that he is not a man of integrity?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the post of Police Adviser is a

supernumerary  post,  and  the  present  holder  will

vacate  this post on 31st August, when the post  will

be  abolished.  He  will not be responsible  for  the

direction and administration of the Police Force; his

function  would be mainly to liaise with the Director

of Police Affairs, Federation of Malaya, in so far as

Singapore is concerned; to discuss matters concerning

the  establishment  of a unified  Police  Service  of

Malaysia,  and to advise the Commissioner of  Police,

Singapore,  on such matters. He will also advise  the

Commissioner  of  Police, Singapore,  on  any  matter

which may be referred to him by the Commissioner.  He

has  no  power to direct or give instructions to  the

Singapore  Commissioner of Police,  and  whether  his

advice  is  to  be  accepted or  not  is  up  to  the

Commissioner of Police. As I have said just now,  his

job  is  mainly to liaise with the Federation  Police

with  regard to a Pan-Malaysian Police Force. In  any

case, his post will be abolished on 31st August.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (2) * has been dealt with. Dr Lee.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* Amendment (2) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 55 be reduced by $10 in respect of item (2) of subhead 1.

<hr size="2" noshade>





<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 55 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is public relations, Sir. The Police are

supposed to be the friends of the people. But we have

a  recent  occasion, Sir, where the police have  been

used  to hit women, and old women especially. I  will

not  enlarge  on  this now because  this  is  a  case

supposed  to be sub judice. But, of course, all  this

has been arranged by the Special Branch of today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I would like to touch on is

that the police today have been used for the breaking

of  strikes. We have been saying this for quite  some

time. Last year, the year before last, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>



had  been  saying that. But, of course,  they  always

turn  round  and  say, "Oh, you are Communists,"  and

therefore the use of the police is justified.  Today,

we  see  employees  of the Home Ministry  itself,  in

front of the Central Police Station, in front of  the

C.I.D. in  Robinson Road. They are camping  out  and

they  are on strike. And one of their placards  says,

"We  condemn Government for forcing mata-mata  to  be

strike-breakers." I have pictures here to  show,  and

these are pictures taken from Robinson Road, from the

Home  Affairs  Ministry, and from the Central  Police

Station.  I wonder whether they have suddenly  become

Communists,  or that the P.A.P. has in fact  all  the

time  been  using  the  police  to  break  legitimate

strikes.  That  is point number two. And  then,  Sir,

when  it  comes  to  a quarrel between  employer  and

employee,  and when both the employers and  employees

request  help from the Police, the P.A.P. make  sure

that  the employers are served and the employees  are

ignored.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quote, Sir, the instance of the Fraser strike. The

employers  asked the police for help and the  workers

also  asked  the police for help. What happened?  The

police  went to the aid of the employers and  not  to

the  employees. If the Government were really a

pro-workers'  Government, they would most certainly  have

used  the  police to help the employees and  not  the

employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I want to bring up is the Special

Branch. The Director of Special Branch, as you  might

know, Sir, is a direct appointee of the Minister  for

Finance.  In fact, we say that he has specially  been

planted in the Special Branch. We say that there  are

quite a number of key posts held by appointees of the

Minister  for  Finance. I do not know, but  if  there

should be a clash between the Prime Minister and  the

Minister  for Finance, the Minister for Finance  will

know exactly what his position is. He has all his men

planted in the right places.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the thing I want to inform the House of: it

is  the  Special Branch lock-up in the Central Police

Station. This does not come under Prisons, because we

as  Assemblymen  have no chance of  going  into  that

place. I went to that place once, not as a chap to be

put  inside,  but as a then Parliamentary  Secretary.

The  police  saluted me smartly, took me around.  But

nowadays, the position is slightly different. What  I

want to inform the House is this: the treatment given

to  the  political detainees in the  lock-up  of  the

police  station is too terrible for words.  There  is

one political detainee who was so ill-treated that he

had to bang his head against the wall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> That is not the real story.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> All right, we are willing to hear

the real story. But the fact is this: this person was

transferred to the General Hospital and  he  has  now

four  stitches  in  his scalp. How  can  a  political

detainee  inside a cell, with no interference  so  to

speak,  get  a  scalp  wound? I rang  up  the  Prison

doctor, and he informed me that the detainee would he

out  of danger after three or four days. The fact  is

that  this  political detainee still has a  lacerated

scalp  wound. We would like the Minister  to  explain

how  a detainee can have a lacerated scalp wound.  If

it is not a case of his being driven to knock his own

head  against the wall, then it must be  the  Special

Branch  using  inhuman and barbaric  methods  on  the

political detainee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the

Member  for  Queens-town alleged that the police  hit

women.  Unfortunately this case is pending. I do  not

wish  to  say  more.  But I can  tell  him  that  the

contrary is true. The police have never been used  to

break strikes. In fact, we have been very careful  in

not  allowing the police to be involved in a  strike.

If the Member for Queenstown would cast his mind back

to  1959 or 1960, he would be aware of the number  of

circulars and instructions that I had issued  to  the

police  advising  them how to deal with  the  workers

whenever

there  was a strike. As I have said again and  again,

if  the  workers  were to observe peaceful  picketing

rules  and  if  the employers were  to  refrain  from

taking  provoking action, there is no  need  for  the

police  to  be there. The police are there only  when

there  is a danger of a breach of the peace.  I  must

say   that   over  the  last  two  or  three   years,

particularly  in  1961  and  1962,  there  were  many

instances  of  workers belonging to the pro-Communist

unions  who  took the law into their  own  hands  and

assaulted  members  of  the police  as  well  as  the

public.  One clear example was the President  of  the

Singapore  Business Houses Employees Union,  Mr  Foo

Yong  Fong, who used a burning cigarette  butt  on  a

member  of  the  public. These are  the  persons  who

commit  all these offences. The job of the police  is

to see that there is peace in a strike-bound area. It

is  not  the job of the police to serve the employers

or the unions.



<br><br>8.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown mentioned a detainee who

had  a  head injury. Mr Speaker, Sir, this  detainee

was transferred to the Central Police Station lock-up

only very recently, and within four days in the

lock-up  he attempted suicide. The reasons are, (1) he was

a  bit  disturbed over the news that his  mother  was

ill; but the second and main reason was that his wife

was  fed up with him. His wife advised him not to get

involved with all the pro-Communist elements  and  he

refused  to  heed  her  advice. Eventually  he  found

himself  in  the prison, and the wife  threatened  to

divorce  him  unless he recanted from  his  Communist

beliefs. That had a great effect on him, so  much  so

that  he  attempted to commit suicide by banging  his

head  on  the floor. How he did it is still a mystery

to the investigating officers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, the Minister says that the

detainee  was only transferred there for  four  days.

Does  the  Minister know that he had been in solitary

confinement for four months? Have we not been telling

the Ministers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>



that  solitary confinement can cause terrible  injury

to  the mind as well as to the body? Does he not know

that?  Now he says that it is the wife. I am  ashamed

of him. Already married, and with a family ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown

should  try  to keep his temper in this Chamber.  Dr

Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I have finished.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, .1 will take

just  half  a  minute.  The Minister  says  that  the

Government  never  use  mata  mata  to  interfere  in

strikes.  I want to ask him this: how is he going  to

explain the fact that all the members of the staff of

his  Ministry who are members of the A.U.P.E. put  up

posters  or  placards stating, "We condemn Government

for forcing mata mata to be strike-breakers."? How is

he going to explain this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the job of the

police is to maintain law and order. This service  of

the Police cannot be dispensed with. It does not mean

that  because  there  is a strike,  the  police  must

therefore  refrain from carrying out their duty.  For

the  police to carry out their duty of protecting the

lives  and  property of the people, certain  services

must carry on, such as tele- printing, telephone  and

telecommunications services. These services  must  be

kept  going  24  hours a day and if certain  civilian

employees  go on strike, then the uniformed  services

must come in.



<br><br>8.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time has expired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $28,478,320 for Head 55 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I beg to move, Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 56 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1.*

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This item is in respect of the Commissioner of

Prisons. Sir, the Commissioner of Prisons, I take it,

looks after the prisons and all the conditions inside

them.  Political detainees have been kept  in  Outram

Prison  for four months. As far as I understand,  the

recommendations  of the Commission  of  Inquiry  into

Prisons,  1960, say that there should be no  solitary

confinement and that political detainees  should  not

be kept in the way that they are being kept today. In

addition,  we  have found out that the detainees  had

been  allowed  to come out of their  cells  for  only

limited  periods of the day. When we enquired  as  to

why  this was so, the Commissioner said that this was

because  he could not help it. Can the Minister  tell

us whether the Commissioner was receiving orders from

him  or from the Special Branch, and why this has  to

be so?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already

said  sometime ago in this Assembly that some of  the

detainees were kept separately from the others during

the interrogation period. We could not help it. After

the interrogation ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> How long?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> --- they were removed to another

place  where the" could live together. We  have  been

doing  so,  and  so  far only  11  persons  are  left

segregated  from  the  others.  In  fact,   on   this

question,  I think the good friend of the Member  for

Queenstown,   Mr  Fenner  Brockway,   made   certain

suggestions  as to how the Government could  overcome

this objection. He suggested that we should bring  in

non-political  detainees to live with the  politic  d

detainees. I can tell the Members for Queenstown that

we are putting this recommendation into effect.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the

Minister for Home Affairs said that at present  there

are   11   persons   kept   separately   because   of

interrogation. I would like to ask whether  these  11

persons are kept in the Central Police Station

lock-up or in Outram Prison.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I want to raise is the designation

of  this  post-Commissioner of Prisons.  I  remember,

Sir,   at  the  last  sitting,  the  designation   of

Commissioner  of Prisons was altered to  Director  of

Prisons.  It  seems that the Estimates of  1963  must

have  been prepared quite some time ago. This  proves

the  Government purposely allow us insufficient  time

for a more detailed debate on the Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the post of

Commissioner of Prisons was re-designated Director of

Prisons  only very recently. I suppose  that  is  the

reason  why  the  old designation of Commissioner  of

Prisons is still there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I still do not

have  an  answer to my first question  about  the  11

persons who are kept separately. Where are they kept?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> They are detained in Outram

Prison.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, there may be 11

persons  in Outram Prison, but what about the  number

of  detainees who are still being segregated  in  the

Central  Police Station lock-up? I want to  know  how

many  persons are still being detained in the Central

Police Station lock-up.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That does not arise really, but if

the Minister has the information, he can give it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not have

the  exact figure, but I would think it is around  10

to  12  persons. I think they are under interrogation

now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Sir, if that is the case, the

Minister  is  not giving us the true  number  of  the

actual  persons who are kept separately. He is trying

to give us a wrong impression, that there are only 11

persons at present when, in fact, the total figure is

23.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The question was in connection

with  Prisons, and the Minister answered  that  there

were 11 or 12 - is it 11 or l2?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Eleven.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> --- eleven persons still in prison. Now

the  Member  for Havelock has ascertained  there  are

some  in the Central Police Station as welt, and that

is  the end of it. I do not know how the Minister can

be accused of misleading the Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is half-past eight. Shall we take a vote on that?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is time to suspend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 56 (contd.) -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 56 be reduced

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Amendments (2)++, (3) and (4).



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, certainly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Because I am not mentioning them

in respect of the persons so much as the posts.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, the political detainees in

the   prisons   have  recently  been  supplied   with

newspapers.  But these newspapers have  "windows"  in

them: certain portions are cut out, and I do not know

whether  it  is  the  duty of the  Superintendent  of

Prisons  to  cut  out  or  make  "windows"   in   the

newspapers  before  handing the newspapers  to  them.

Moreover.  I understand newspapers have to be  bought

by  the detainees themselves. The Government has  $97

million  surplus  last year. I do  not  see  why  the

Government cannot supply newspapers to our  Political

detainees who have been deprived of their freedom  by

the  Government. The food rations are  very  poor.  I

know what the rations are: I have had a taste of them

and  I can assure you, Sir, that they are not fit for

consumption. People eat them because they are  forced

to  eat  them. I understand during the Lim  Yew  Hock

regime  that  dry rations were supplied to  political

detainees and they could cook their own food. Similar

requests  have  been made to the present  Government,

but until now no decision has yet been made regarding

dry  rations to be given to the political  detainees.

Then  there  are  no  chairs  and  tables  given   to

detainees.  They have been allowed to  write  letters

once  a week, but the last time I saw detainees doing

any  writing, it was done on the floor. They  had  to

kneel and write on the floor. Surely that is not  the

proper way for anybody to write any letter. In Changi

also,  although  they are supposed to have  badminton

and other recreational facilities, these have not yet

been provided them in spite of repeated requests from

the detainees. Until today, the detainees are allowed

only  20 minutes for visits from their families,  and

that,  Sir,  is not sufficient. Not only  that,  Sir,

there are certain political detainees who have asked



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>



to  see  their fiancees, but the Government has  seen

fit  to prevent them from seeing them, although  they

have no other next-of-kin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not quite catch what the Minister said about

Mr Brockway, but we do know what the comments of Mr

Brockway are. There is already the case of Mr  Szeto

who  has, according to the Minister, tried to  commit

suicide. He tries to pass the blame on to the family,

but  let  him look at himself. Let him look into  the

mirror, and see how much he should blame himself  for

this  state of affairs. If only the Minister  suffers

just  one-tenth of the sufferings of these  political

detainees  today. I think he would not  be  so  happy

here today. The callous, completely heartless way  in

which  the  Ministers are treating this  question  of

detainees  has aroused not only complaints  from  the

detainees' families themselves and from us, but  also

the  P.A.P.'s own political supporters, the M.P.s who

are  supporting  them today like John Strachey,  like

Arthur Bottomley - complaints, Sir, in England when I

told them of what was happening in Singapore today of

the  way  the P.A.P. is treating political detainees.

They  could not understand why the Government  should

confine  these prisoners to tiny solitary cells  and

not  implement  the  Report of  the  Prisons  Inquiry

Commission of 1960. Sir, the people who put  in  this

Report  are  people who have the trust of  the  Prime

Minister. The Prime Minister always praises Mr Devan

Nair, and you will see that Mr Devan Nair himself is

the  Chairman  of this Commission that has  given  us

this  Report today. In page 5, paragraph 15  of  this

Report, it tells us that political detainees are  and

should  be  regarded as an anomaly  in  a  democratic

society.  I  do  not  have to go  through  the  whole

paragraph, but the Minister should realise that  what

he  is  doing  today is in complete contradiction  to

what has been recommended by the Commission appointed

by the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Minister there are still 11 in

Outram  and there are 11 or 12 in the Central  Police

Station,  but let him remember this. The year  before

last



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>



there  was one death in the C.I.D. Let him  not  have

another  death  before he considers transferring  all

the detainees out of solitary confinement into better

surroundings. If there should be another death,  then

the  Minister  will have to bear full responsibility,

and  I  am  sure, when the time comes, the people  of

Singapore  will  know how to deal with the P.A.P.  At

the  present  moment, so far as  we  understand,  the

Special  Branch  has  a  special  interest  in  those

prisoners in Changi. Outram and in the Central Police

Station lock-ups. I want to remind our Ministers that

the people in charge of the Special Branch today  - Mr

Blades,  Mr  Corridon. Mr Ahmad Khan - are  all

non-citizens.  Their  loyalty is not  to  the  people  of

Singapore.  We  cannot  expect  people  who  are  not

citizens  and  who  are not loyal to  the  people  of

Singapore  to  look  after the  people  of  Singapore

properly.  These  non-citizens of Singapore  are  the

people  who  serve  the  interests  of  the  colonial

masters.   Let  the  Minister  tell  us  whether   he

subscribes to all that the Special Branch advises and

does and whether he has a hand in everything that  is

happening  in the lock-ups and in the prisons  today.

Let him give us an answer.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Did I bear the Member for Queenstown

correctly when he said he was also dealing with the

Superintendent of the Pulau Senang Settlement, i.e.,

item (49)?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No. I did not mean to speak on

Pulau Senang at all.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> So it is on item (15) and item (125)?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head 56 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (15) of subhead

1."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate may range over amendment (4) , which is

"That  the sum to be allocated for Head 56 be reduced

by  $10 in respect of item (125) of subhead 1."  That

is the Superintendent of Changi Prisons.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all detainees

are  now  given reading material. It is true that  on

certain  occasions,  certain  newspapers  have   been

censored before they are given to detainees, and  for

good  reasons. The censorship is presumably  done  by

Special  Branch officers. I do not think  the  prison

officers   do   the  censoring  of   the   newspapers

themselves. I mean, it is quite normal. I do not  see

what is wrong with that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown complains that the rations

are  poor  and that they are not fit for consumption.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir  the rations are  given  to  these

detainees  in  accordance with the  regulations  laid

down.  In  fact,  I  would  remind  the  Member   for

Queenstown that even the Member for Anson who visited

these detainees had no complaint whatsoever about the

food. In fact, no detainees ever complained about the

food  being  poor.  The political  detainees  in  the

prisons do receive a special ration very much  better

than ordinary convicted prisoners. As to why they are

not  allowed  to cook their own food,  the  answer  I

would  imagine  is obvious. Surely you cannot  expect

cooking  to be allowed in the prison with  smoke  and

fumes and all that floating around the place. Cooking

by the detainees themselves was allowed in the Changi

open camps and in St. John's Island. Those are places

where   cooking   can  be  done  by   the   detainees

themselves.  But  if they are in the  prison  blocks,

surely you do not expect cooking to be allowed.



<br><br>9.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We will consult the Commissioner.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The visits of families are

limited to 20 minutes for obvious reasons. The number

is  large and supervision is difficult and we have to

confine the visits to 20 minutes. As time goes on, as

more  detainees are released, there are  less  people

around  which makes supervision easier  and  we  will

consider  extending the time for visits by  families,

it  is  true we did refuse in one case to  allow  the

fiancee  to  visit  a detainee. Why,  Sir?  For  good

reasons also in this case, because the fiancee too



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>



has  a  long history of pro-Communist activities  and

naturally  we would not allow this particular  person

to see the detainee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already explained just now about somebody in

the  Central Police Station lock-up who attempted  to

commit  suicide. If the Member for Queens-town  would

be  honest  with  himself, he would  know  that  this

person is a very emotional person. The reason why  he

attempted  committing  suicide  is  not  because   of

solitary  confinement. He was  perfectly  normal  and

happy  in Outram Prison. In fact, he was coming round

very   well.   He  was  responding   very   well   to

interrogations  until the wife made  that  visit  and

told him that unless he gave up all his pro-Communist

sympathies  and stopped getting himself involved  any

further with his pro-Communist colleagues, she  would

divorce him.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You had better go into solitary

yourself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> If the conditions of detention in

our Singapore prison are really that bad, then I fail

to  see  the Member for Havelock moving a  motion  in

this  House,  asking  that  those  detainees  in  the

Federation  should be brought back  to  Singapore.  I

just could not understand.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You will never understand.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The motion moved by the Member

for   Havelock   would  surely  indicate   that   the

conditions  of detention in Singapore are  much  more

favourable than those in the Federation and  that  is

why  he  is asking the House to bring in his detainee

colleagues from the Federation to Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, on this matter I actually have a lot to talk

because  I  myself have had the experience  of  being

imprisoned for some 10 days. But because of the  time

limit,  I  do  not wish to touch on my  own  personal

experience. I have been paying close attention to all

these  debates, but I find that the Minister  himself

has not made adequate replies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>



to  the charges that we have made. Our Party Chairman

has said that when we paid visits to the prisons,  we

noticed that the detainees had been ill-treated,  and

so  we  made our complaints to the Superintendent  of

Prisons.  But  he  said all these  were  instructions

given   from   the  top.  We  asked  who   gave   the

instructions   - was  it  the  Special  Branch  or  the

Minister? No answer was given. Can the Minister  give

us the answer?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, just

now  the  Minister for Home Affairs has said in  this

House  that  only one of the political detainees  was

refused  visits  from members of the family  and  the

others were all allowed family visits. That was  what

he said. Perhaps this is because the Minister himself

does  not understand the true position or perhaps  he

has  told us an untruth in this House. I can give him

a very clear example. Mr Lim Woon Chye is flow being

detained  in  Muar.  His wife is  being  detained  in

Outram  Prison. When the father of Mr Lim Woon  Chye

wrote  two letters to the Government making a request

to  visit his daughter-in-law, it was not granted and

so  the  father of Mr Lim Woon Chye personally  came

down to Singapura from Muar to see the Superintendent

of  Outram  Prison and the officials of  the  Special

Branch. But the result is that he has not been  given

permission to see his daughter-in-law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the matter of detainees who have not been convicted, I will say that the Government is not giving them a fair deal. These people are now being detained in the remand prison. Because they have not been convicted by any court, they should be given all the rights that they could be enjoying outside. I

myself  spent  about one week in the  remand  prison.

Many of the prisoners in remand complained to us that

they  were unable to contact their counsel. They were

unable  to  tell  members of their family  and  their

counsel  to get bail arranged. As a result  of  this,

those  who are actually bailable are not actually  on

bail  and  so the only way out for them is  to  write

letters to their families. But the letters will  take

some  two weeks before they can actually be delivered

to the homes. Sir, this is a very unfair way of doing

things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the 1st of May, Mr T. T. Rajah, a lawyer, was detained together with the rest of us. He brought along some law books making some references on the 2nd of May, but the Superintendent of Prisons did not allow the law books to he brought in for the benefit of Mr T. T. Rajah. His reason was that all

these  books must be censored. Mr Speaker, a  lawyer

must  be allowed to look through the law books before

he  can  argue  it  in the court. I  see  no  reason,

however,  why  the Prison authority should  have  any

reason  to  refuse such facilities  to  be  given  to

counsel -  to this particular lawyer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, I would like to ask the

Minister for Home Affairs one question. When we  gave

a  statement in protest against the ill-treatment  of

political  detainees, the Government  also  issued  a

statement  to  say  that  Outram  Prison   would   be

demolished  soon. It appears that the  Government  is

trying  to give the public this impression: that  the

prison in Outram Road will be demolished very soon so

that the period of detention will come to an end very

soon. I would like the Minister to tell us when  this

prison  in Outram Road will be demolished, or whether

it is to be expanded.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Communists

and  their  running dogs have always intimidated  and

deceived the people with the myth that should any  of

them  be  rendered  inactive  for  acts  against  the

interest of the people and the State, the masses will

rise up in arms and there will he riots and bloodshed

in  the  streets.  However, when the Communist  front

cadres were neutralised by the I.S.C. in February ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Who wrote that!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> --- there was complete calm and

peace, with nobody getting excited over the arrests.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Who wrote that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Communists

and  their  underlings must have felt  the  situation

most disconcerting. And having failed to work up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1272</b></font><br><br>



public excitement over the arrests, they then met the

pro-Communists in the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Answer our questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> They next attempted to work up

this public excitement by making use of the detainees

and the conditions of their detention.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am just trying to figure out

how  that  is  a  reply to the points raised  by  the

Opposition Members. They raised certain points and  I

called the Minister to answer these points.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I am just going to explain that.

The  reason why they raised the question of detainees

and  how they were ill-treated and all that was  that

they  could  not  get  the public  excited  over  the

arrests, and therefore the next best thing they could

do was to exploit the issue.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Go and jump into the river.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> And in so doing they even made

use of the detainees' families by leading them to the

City  Hall,  hoping that there would he  a  collision

with  the  police. Well, I will not  proceed  further

than  that. But that is the whole purpose of bringing

up  the issue of these detainees here. They know that

the  detainees were treated in accordance with prison

regulations  and,  in  fact,  they  do   get   better

treatment  than  the  ordinary prisoners.  And  those

detainees now in Changi receive much better treatment

than many of the others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Mr Lim Woon Chye's case was brought up.

Now,  his  wife was under interrogation and naturally

she  was not allowed to see her husband. Now that the

interrogation  is over, arrangements have  been  made

for her to go to Muar to see her husband.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has on many occasions

stated  inside  and  outside this  House  that  equal

treatment for the four streams of education  will  be

given. Four years have gone by and the promise of the

Minister  has  not been implemented.  I  believe  the

Minister for Education knows what he would become  if

the policy of equal treatment for the four streams of

education  cannot be implemented. For four  years  he

has  been sitting there in his office doing his  best

to  clean up all the dishonest and dirty work left by

the former Minister for Education, Mr Chew Swee Kee,

and  his colonial masters. For four years. I believe,

he has worked very hard, but it is regrettable to say

that his promise still has not been carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir in a multi-racial society like

Singapore the education problem is a very complicated

one,  and  it  must be handled with  care,  otherwise

there will be resentment from the people. We have  in

Singapore  four  different streams of  education  but

these four different streams of education are treated

under two different kinds of policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the treatment given to English education is

very  much  better  than  that  given  to  the  other

streams,  especially in the field of employment.  The

Government has only a few months to go, or maybe  one

year,  and the four-year old promise of the  Minister

is still in his mouth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, has the Government any plan to solve the Nantah

problem,   especially  the  recognition  of   Nanyang

University  degrees and financial  help,  and  is  he

prepared to give any help to Ngee Ann College?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1962 the number of enrolments to enter

Primary I in Chinese schools was very, very small  if

compared  to the enrolments in English schools.  Why?

The reason is because of the unequal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>



treatment given to Chinese education, is the Minister

aware  why there is such a great decrease of  Chinese

pupils  in  primary schools? If an elected Government

of  Singapore cannot solve the education  problem  in

Singapore,  how  can we expect, after  Malaysia,  the

Federation Government to solve the education  problem

in Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very

unusual for a Member of the Barisan Sosialis to  pay

compliments  to  me, saying that I have  worked  very

hard,  tried  my best, et cetera, for the  last  four

yours  to clear the legacy of the past, and to  admit

that  it  is a pretty complicated educational  system

that has to be solve in Singapore and that it has  to

be  treated  with care. It is, therefore, because  of

this that, whereas in most countries of the world the

educational system would be based on one language  as

the  chief  medium of instruction, we  in  Singapore,

having  inherited  four  language  streams,  have  to

proceed carefully.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to answer the first criticism made by

the  Member  for  Changi why the 1962  enrolment  was

small in respect of Chinese schools. It is the policy

of the Government to allow parents to make the choice

for their children as to which language medium school

they wish their children to be in, and it is the duty

of the Government to provide the facilities once that

choice  has  been made. It is, therefore, a  decision

made by the parents and citizens of Singapore. If the

Member  for  Changi really wants  to  know  the  real

reason  why parents choose not to send their children

to  Chinese schools, then it is time that  they  stop

doing  the  foolish  things of introducing  polities,

misleading young, innocent children by dragging  them

into political controversy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then comes again the statement of alleging better

treatment for the English-educated. This has been the

theme  song  of  the  Barisan Sosialis  that  has  no

foundation   whatsoever.  They  always   persist   in

distorting what is true. When the thing is white,  it

is black to them. When we talk of truth, they talk of

falsehoods.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his ignorance, the Member talks of when the

Government  will  recognise the  degrees  of  Nanyang

University. Way back in February 1960 when the Member

for Changi was a Back-bencher, when the Report of the

Review Committee of Nanyang University was tabled  in

his  Assembly, we had already indicated that we would

conditionally  recognise  the  degrees   of   Nanyang

University  graduates  for  employment  both  to  our

secondary schools and to Government service. That has

been  carried  out  for  the  last  four  years  when

graduates of Nanyang University, wishing to teach  in

our secondary schools or to enter Government service,

would  have  to  have their applications  subject  to

consideration  by the Public Service  Commission  and

appointed thereby. Of course, he follows up with  the

question  of  financial  aid to  Nanyang  University.

Indeed   two   Members  of  his  Party,   my   former

Parliamentary Secretary, now the Member for  Seagoing

Gardens,  and  the Member for Upper  Serangoon,  were

members  of  the Liaison Committee then  representing

the  Government to discuss conditions and terms  with

the  Nanyang  University authorities, and  they  know

very  well  how  the discussions came to  a  grinding

halt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have indicated at the last convocation ceremony at

Nanyang University that the undertaking given by  the

Singapore Government more than three years ago  still

stands,  that  financial  aid  would  be  granted  to

Nanyang University on the same basis as the aid given

to  the  University of Singapore, subject to  Nanyang

University  reorganising along the lines  recommended

by  the  Gwee  Ah  Leng Review Committee  on  Nanyang

University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Ngee Ann College, the sponsors, Ngee Ann

Kongsi, have expressed a desire that this should be a

private  institution, but at the opening ceremony,  I

was  pleased  to disclose to those present  that  the

Singapore   Government  have   decided   to   provide

bursaries  to  the  students - Singapore  students,  of

course,   or  the  children  of  Singapore   citizens

admitted  to  the college - on the same basis  as  that

accorded to Nanyang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>



University,  the  University  of  Singapore  and  the

Polytechnic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi, unfortunately, asked how the

Government   of   Singapore  would   tackle   Chinese

education once Malaysia was established and ended  up

by  saying  that  it would have to  be  left  to  the

Federation  authorities. Sad to say, the  Member  for

Changi   is   unaware  that  with  merger   and   the

establishment of Malaysia Singapore will continue  to

have  autonomy  in education and will therefore  give

Chinese  education equal treatment as has been  given

hitherto.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the

Minister  has  said that the number of enrolments  in

the  Chinese  schools  was  very  small  because   of

political infiltration, but let me quote the Sin Chew

Jit Poh of 8th June.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1959 the P.A.P. Government have built only

eight  schools  in the rural area. All  of  them  are

integrated schools, but only one school is being used

as  a Chinese! English integrated school. How can you

expect  parents to send their children to  a  Chinese

school if there is no school for them to go to?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that there is not much chance

for  a  Chinese-educated student to  seek  a  job  in

Government service. This is the most important point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The Member for Changi is fully

aware that when Government built schools, they do not

decide that such and such a school would be used  for

the  English  medium, or the Chinese medium,  or  the

Malay medium, or the Tamil medium. A school is built,

and  if  there are more Chinese pupils in that  area,

that school becomes a Chinese medium school, if there

are  more  who  wish to study English, then  it  will

become  an  English  med urn school.  And  if  it  so

happens that there are as many students who enrol for

English  as  well as for Chinese, then it becomes  an

integrated Chinese/English school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is just a waste of time, I think, to try to drive

the facts into the mind of the Member for Changi.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>10.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> He has got a thick skull.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> As for the seeking of jobs,

surely  that  is not the function of the Ministry  of

Education.  What the Ministry of Education endeavours

to  do  is to train them so that they could look  for

jobs. For this reason, we are endeavouring, in course

of  time,  to  be  able to switch the  emphasis  from

academic schools to vocational and technical  schools

and  that, I am pleased to say, will happen  by  next

year,  because by that time we should  be  having  no

less  than  five  secondary vocational  school's  and

another  four Secondary technical schools  and  thus,

for  the  first time, making it possible for students

to  have  something different from what they used  to

have in the past.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the Minister

still  keeps on blaming politics for the small number

of  students going to Chinese schools. Let me ask him

one  simple question. I will give a concrete  example

to  show him - Queenstown. There are. I think, 12 or 13

schools  in  Queenstown - he can tell me the number - but

there  is  not a single primary Chinese school.  Does

the   Minister  mean  to  tell  us  that  nobody   in

Queenstown has applied to study in a Chinese  school?

There is a secondary Chinese school. In fact, I spoke

to  the Minister about this when we were still in the P.A.P. ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You were?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- and he told me that the P.A.P.

at  that  time  was really carrying out the  building

programme  for  1959.  In  other  words,  the  P.A.P.

Government  was  carrying out the building  programme

which had been laid down by the S.P.A. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a matter of the choice of the parents, let

the  Minister  explain to us how a  parent,  say,  in

Queenstown is to ask for his son to go to  a  Chinese

school when there is no Chinese school in Queenstown?

Does  it  mean that a hawker, who cannot even support

his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>



own  family,  will have to send his son to  Bedok  or

Changi in order to attend a Chinese school?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> We will send you to as far as

Changi.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Therefore, if the Minister really

was  sincere  in wanting the parents  to  send  their

children  to a Chinese school, as in this case,  then

he  most build the school near the people who want to

study   in   them.  Otherwise  this  is  economically

impossible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present moment, I see in the newspapers that

there is a call by the Singapore Chinese: Chamber  of

Commerce  that parents should send their  chi1iren.to

schools to study their mother tongue. "Mother tongue"

means  Indian  for  Indians, Malay  for  Malays,  and

Chinese for Chinese. It does not mean to say that you

study  only  the  mother tongue of  course.  Let  the

Government,  if  it is sincere, also issue  the  same

call.  Tell  the  parents to send their  children  to

study  the mother tongue, and build schools for  them

so  that  they  may  have a chance  to  go  to  these

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of jobs, at the present moment, all of us

realise that the best job facilities are open to  the

English-educated. It is quite true that it is not the

duty  of  the  Education Ministry to lock  after  job

seeking.  But if the Government is really sincere  in

the  implementation of equal treatment  of  the  four

streams of education, then it must make sure that job

opportunities are available equally in all  the  four

streams.  At the present moment, the Chinese-educated

can  go to Nantah, but Nantah qualifications are  not

recognised.  And  when  a Nantah  student  comes  out

looking for a job, he gets a smaller pay for it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Nonsense.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Nonsense? Then recognise Nantah

qualifications.  It is as simple as that.  Give  them

the  opportunity and if you still find that in  spite

of  all that they want to study English, then I  say.

"Most  certainly. It is because they  like  to  study

English." But first



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>



give them the opportunity to have equal job

opportunities and equal ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Equal rights.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- equal salaries. For example, I

understand that at present quite a number of students

are asking for opportunities to have a polytechnic in

the  Chinese medium. If this Government were  sincere

in  all this, surely it could provide facilities  and

opportunities for Chinese-educated students to go for

studies  that  are already provided in the  Singapore

Polytechnic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even on the matter of bursaries, Sir, the Minister

talked  so much about the Government wanting to  give

bursaries  to  Ngee Ann. We know for certain  that  a

certain  number of Nantah students were quite worried

as to whether they were going to get the bursaries or

not. They were not informed until quite late. We  had

a Question here in this Assembly not so very long ago

about  this. Whenever the Government talks of wanting

to  give  bursaries to students, it makes  sure  that

that  person is not against the P.A.P. Politics  come

in-the Government makes use of the Special Branch and

their  hirelings  to  find out  whether  or  not  the

applicant is against the P.A.P. If he is against  the

P.A.P. he  has no chance of getting a bursary  or  a

scholarship.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> How stupid.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> So what is the use of talking

about   equal  treatment  of  the  four  streams   of

education?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

it  seems  that  every Minister in the Government  is

blaming the Communists for its wrongs if he could not

face   his   responsibilities  and   cover   up   his

shortcomings.  A  little while ago the  Minister  for

Education has said that the decrease in the number of

enrolments   in  Chinese  schools  is  due   to   the

Communists. This reason is expected because it is the

way  by which he can evade his responsibilities.  The

Minister  has also said that the decrease is  due  to

party politics and the choice of parents. It is  true

that parents in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  can  choose the medium of instruction  for

their children. But the question before us is not the

choice  of parents. There are many schools at present

and  when  the parents bring their children to  these

schools  for  registration in Chinese  schools,  they

would  be told, "Sorry, this year we have only a  few

Primary  I  classes of 40 pupils each." Mr  Speaker,

the population is increasing daily and the number  of

school-going population is also increasing,  but  the

vacancies   in   Chinese  schools  do  not   increase

correspondingly. The number of enrolments is  related

to    the   number   of   vacancies.   Under    these

circumstances,  a  parent has no alternative  but  to

send  his  child to another school. It is a  case  of

Hobson's  choice. Therefore, it is not  a  matter  of

free  choice  of  the parents. For instance,  when  a

person  has  to ea, the Government says, "I  have  no

rice  for  you; accept bread. So the only alternative

is for you to take this loaf of bread or go hungry."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has not denied the fact that there

has  been  a  decrease in the number of  students  in

Chinese  schools.  On  the 5th April  this  year  the

Minister for Education replied to a Question in  this

House [Hansard, 5th April, 1963, col. 74] in which he

gave  detailed  figures.  He  gave  the  figures   as

follows:

<pre>



                                1962      1963

Malay medium schools           21,249    24,311

Chinese medium schools        132,632   130,995

English medium schools        163,669   177,440

Tamil medium schools            1,406     1,518

</pre>

<br><br>10.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these figures given by the Minister, we can

clearly  see that there is a decrease of about  2,000

pupils in the Chinese schools, whereas for the  other

streams   the  figures  remain  the  same.  We   can,

therefore,  see  that  the education  policy  of  the

Government  is  not to fulfil their policy  of  equal

treatment of the four streams of education.  That  is

why  educational societies, organisations,  including

the  Chinese Chamber of Commerce, have no alternative

but to make a call to parents to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>



send  their children to educational institutions  run

in  the  mother tongue. Had the Government encouraged

the development of education in the mother tongue.  I

believe  these educational bodies would have  had  no

need  to  appeal  to  parents.  This  simple  example

clearly shows that the Government is not carrying out

its   policy  of  equal  treatment  but  instead  has

indulged in discrimination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education has also said that eight Government schools have been built in the rural areas, and that because parents choose to send their children to English schools the number of Government Chinese schools is small. That is not so in fact, 98 per cent of the schools in the rural areas are

Government-aided  schools. When these  aided  schools

wish  to  expand, they should get a 60-year lease  of

the land, as otherwise Government would not allow the

expansion.  In  addition, the Health Department  also

requires such schools to have sanitary facilities and

other  conditions before approval of expansion  could

be given. Under these conditions, these aided schools

cannot  expand their accommodation for  pupils.  Many

such  schools are also built on Government land,  and

threescore they have a right to apply for  a  60-year

lease for expansion. But replies from the Land Office

are very disappointing to every one of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister is really and truly willing to

assist  and  encourage Chinese  students  to  receive

education  in  their mother tongue,  then  he  should

relax these conditions. If he could do so, then I  am

sure  many  people  will come out to  assist  him  in

carrying  out this policy. But, in fact,  he  is  not

doing so. On the contrary, he is implementing a  kind

of  education policy that suppresses education in our

mother tongue. So in spite of all the excuses he  can

think  of,  I  do  not think he can escape  from  his

responsibility  of  adopting  a  suppressive  policy,

which is pointing a finger at him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy)</b> rose ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Parliamentary Secretary

answering for the Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Yes, in Mandarin. (In Mandarin)

Mr  Speaker, the Opposition Members in  the  Barisan

Sosialis  say every now and then that the  Government

has  not been implementing the policy of giving equal

treatment to the four streams of education.  In  this

respect,  I  believe that they, the Barisan  Sosialis

Members,  will  have paid attention to the  Singapore

Chinese   School  Teachers'  Union  and  the  Parents

Association's  statements in  the  Press.  These  two

educational organisations have made statements  after

careful  consideration. The two main  points  in  the

statements  point to the true position regarding  the

first  point indicated in the appeal of the Singapore

Chinese  Chamber of Commerce made after the students'

boycott  of the Secondary IV Examination.  There  are

two  points raised in this statement. The first point

is  that  the  students have lost interest  in  their

studies  and  are  spending their time  in  political

activities  because  they have  been  misled  by  the

agitation  of  irresponsible politicians.  They  take

part  in Hsueh-hsi lessons to learn Leninism and  are

also  engaged  in  other activities  to  subvert  the

Government. These facts are not new. We had a similar

experience during our school days. You cannot deceive

us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that these people are of the

opinion  that in this multi-racial society  of  ours,

what  the students learn in school should be  revised

according  to  the context of local conditions.  They

think  that apart from political infiltration,  those

students after leaving Chinese schools cannot acquire

a  high standard of English. They are therefore at  a

disadvantage  when  it  comes to  getting  employment

because  their standard of English is law. There  has

been  this  sort of conception. In the  past,  during

colonial days, if anybody were to say that we  should

raise the standard of English in Chinese schools,  he

would he called a pro-colonialist. But now, we cannot

say that this slogan is still up to date. In fact, it

is  already an outmoded slogan. It is not in  keeping

with the present times. In fact, it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>



necessary  to  have another language in  addition  to

one's  own mother tongue. I do not mean to  say  that

the  Chinese  school students must acquire  the  same

standard of English as those students in the  English

stream. But from my own personal experience, I myself

was  educated in the Chinese High School  in  Penang,

the  Chung  Ling  High School and I  believe  that  a

Middle  school student on leaving school  should  not

only be quite well versed in Chinese, but be able  to

acquire  such a standard of English as  to  pass  the

School  Certificate Examination. This is not  a  very

difficult  task  to  achieve  because, from  my  own

personal  experience, anybody who has  learnt  up  to

Senior  Middle Standard must have acquired a standard

of  English  equivalent  to  the  School  Certificate

Examination.  This will not only be a personal  asset

to  him,  but  it  will also be his  contribution  to

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if you want to put in the context of political slogans by saying that Singapore has been under colonial rule and so English is an official language of the colonialists and anybody who is good in English is a pro-colonialist, then it is all wrong because we know now that English is an international

language.  I  believe  that when those  organisations

suggest  that  the  standard  of  English  should  be

raised,  they  recognise the fact that English  is  a

useful   language.  It  is  indeed  a   very   useful

international language. They recognise it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the decreasing number of enrolments of

students in the Chinese schools, my own view is  that

the  students' boycott that took place  recently  was

one  of the important factors that accounted for this

decrease. Those students who took part in the boycott

of  the  examination were unable to  get  any  school

certificate.  They arc now facing great difficulties.

I  would  ask  those  people who were  agitating  the

students'  boycott behind the scenes, how  they  have

sacrificed these students, and how are they going  to

help  those students so sacrificed? As leaders,  they

have already misled some students and they should  be

held  responsible  for  this shortcoming.  They  just

cannot  run  away  from  the  fact  that  they   have

sacrificed the interest of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>



the  students. They just cannot be indifferent to the

whole  matter.  In  fact, if they  remain  to  be  so

irresponsible, it will be very wrong indeed.  So  the

very  simple example I wish to make now is  this.  If

there  are politics in school and they do not  affect

the students, you just cannot say it is possible.  In

the  Chung Cheng High School there is a senior member

of  the Board of Directors. He himself is a member of

the  Board of Directors for Chung Cheng High  School.

If  you  want  his name, I can give it to  you.  This

person came to see me and told me that he would  like

to  send  his own son to the Catholic High School.  I

asked  him,  "Since you yourself are  a  director  of

Chung Cheng High School, why should you send your son

to  the  Catholic High School?" He said,  "Well,  you

know  and  I  know.  There is  no  point  for  me  to

elaborate."  It  occurred to me that  this  was  very

strange.  "You  are a director of  Chung  Cheng."  He

said,  "I have my own difficulty. I shall be grateful

if  you can help me." I referred him to the principal

concerned.  So  this is a very simple  example.  This

particular  director of the school knows  that  there

are  politics  in his own school. That is  the  first

point.



<br><br>10.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that he knows that in the case

of the Catholic High School, the student who has come

up  to  Senior Middle I will be able to sit  for  the

School Certificate in the English stream. In time  to

come,  I will say that students in the Catholic  High

School  will  have acquired quite a high standard  in

Malay. So this knowledge of three different languages

will  be  of  use to the students themselves  and  to

society  in  general. The Parents  Association  think

that in order to enable Chinese schools to exist, the

standard  of  English in Chinese  schools  should  be

raised. Because by then the parents will realise that

students  in  Chinese  schools  will  not  only  know

Chinese  but English as well. So I believe  that  the

director that I have mentioned has similar ideas.  In

the  meantime,  the  Singapore  Chinese  Chamber   of

Commerce  has  made some high-sounding  slogans - "Love

Chinese Education", "Save Chinese Education",



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>



etc.  But I would like to ask those people concerned:

To what schools have they sent their own children?  I

have two of my children in Chinese schools. I am  not

ashamed  of  this.  My two children  are  in  Chinese

schools.   But  some  children  of  a  certain   Vice

Chancellor  of a Chinese university are  sent  to  an

English  school. So those people who pay lip  service

to  Chinese  education,  who  claim  that  they  must

safeguard Chinese education, send their own  children

to  English schools. So there is no point in shouting

empty slogans. All that we must do now is to think of

a  practical  way to ensure that our future  citizens

will  be able to become useful citizens in our

multi-racial  society.  That  is the practical  problem  we

should face ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have to remind the Hon.

Parliamentary Secretary that this item gives over  at 11.55  p.m.

I think this item has had  a  very  good

innings.  It  has lasted for 45 minutes.  I  am  sure

other  Members  would like to raise other  points  on

education.  Perhaps we should wind up this particular

item. Perhaps the Minister would like to wind up?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If Mr Low Por Tuck will take only

about two minutes, I will let him speak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> One minute, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Thank you very much.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to

ask  a  question  on policy regarding  the  so-called

equal treatment given to the four streams. At present

in  the Chinese, Malay and Tamil schools, the English

language  is  compulsory  and  is  one  of  the  main

subjects.  If  you fail in the English language,  you

cannot  be  promoted. But in the English school,  the

Chinese, Malay or Tamil language is optional.  It  is

not compulsory. Even if you fail in Chinese, Malay or

Tamil,  you  can  still  be  promoted.  This  is  the

question that I want to ask.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Out of date.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Yong to wind up?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> First of all, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

do want to clear up one point mentioned by the Member

for  Queenstown, that there is no Chinese  Government

school  in the Queenstown area. There is the new  Hua

Yi  Integrated Primary School, which uses the Chinese

and English media, which was opened a few months ago,

and  which has an enrolment of nearly 2,000  pupils.

So he is only half right there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my Parliamentary Secretary has said, if only the

Barisan  Sosialis would stop the boycott and  strikes

in  Chinese schools, they would be doing a service to

Chinese education in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Havelock is somewhat behind time when

he  says that whilst English is compulsory in Chinese

medium   schools,   the  local  languages   are   not

compulsory  in the English medium schools.  Well,  in

1960, for the Primary School Leaving Examination,  we

did indicate that if children have had three years of

second language teaching, they will have to take this

subject  for  the Primary Leaving School Examination,

which,  in  effect,  means that it  is  a  compulsory

subject in schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I should like to answer the Member for Choa

Chu  Kang  who  says that the present  Government  is

following  a  colonial  educational  policy.  It   is

typical of them. Everything is colonial which is  not

in  accordance  with  the Barisan  Sosialis  who  are

playing nothing but the communal line, which  is  the

Barisan  Sosialis  line. Anyway, Sir,  the  last  few

speakers have been talking about the same old subject

for  the  last two years. However, since the Lim  Tay

Boh  Commission of Inquiry into Education is sitting,

if  the  Barisan Sosialis intend to be  constructive,

they  should submit a memorandum on education to this

Commission.  They can take an oath and  justify  what

they  say and what they believe in and stand the test

of scrutiny.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for head 57 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (2) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is only one thing to say about him. Sir,

of    all   the   Parliamentary   Secretaries,    the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education

is the only one well educated in Chinese. That is why

the   Government  sent  him  there  to  help  Chinese

education.  If anything happens to Chinese education,

he himself must also bear the responsibility.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Has the Member moved the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Giving it with one hand and taking

away $10 with the other!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, sometimes

Members  of  the  Opposition give right  answers.  My

Parliamentary  Secretary is sufficiently  versed  and

educated in Chinese to know what he is doing,  unlike

the  so-called Chinese-educated people in the Barisan

Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Parliamentary Secretary has done a great service

to  Singapore  and  to  Chinese education.  When  the

boycott  by  the  Chinese  school  students  of   the

Secondary  IV examinations was about to  take  place,

and  when  certain student representatives called  on

him   and  asked  for  a  calling-off  of  the  first

Government    Secondary    IV    examination,     the

Parliamentary Secretary told the student leaders that

they  were  the  people  who  would  destroy  Chinese

education. He has been proved right. Anyone like  the

Barisan  Sosialis  who instigate  these  students  to

persist  in  foolish boycotts and strikes in  Chinese

schools  are  the  ones  who are  destroying  Chinese

education. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Minister is now inviting a

debate.  He can take a month to complete it.  I  will

allow  just a short reply from the Barisan  Sosialis.

Mr Chan Sun Wing has not spoken yet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr   Speaker,   Sir,  from  what  the  Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Education has  done  in

educational matters and his showing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>



in  the House, we can only say that he is the biggest

blacksheep in Chinese education. If I were to go into

all  the  matters  relating to  the  raising  of  the

standard  of Chinese education in detail,  I  can  go

through them for more than 10 hours and still I  will

not  be  able to finish it. For example, let us  take

the  case  of the Secondary IV examinations  and  the

boycott.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest to the Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Education that  if  the

P.A.P. radio  would allow us time for  a  series  of

forums  and allow the Parliamentary Secretary and  me

to  discuss  the  P.A.P. education policy  and  their

actions,  I  would be very glad to do so. The  public

can then pass judgment on who is really doing good to

Chinese   education.  It  is  because  I   had   been

Parliamentary  Secretary to the Prime  Minister,  and

also  before I was elected as a Member I had for many

years   been  discussing  the  problems  of   Chinese

education  with him. I had done this even  before  he

was a Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what starting point does the P.A.P. base its

education  policy? How is it that they are unable  to

tackle   the  education  problems  and  the   various

problems which are in the mind of the Prime Minister?

All  these  problems are increasing and they  do  not

know   how  to  deal  with  them.  The  Parliamentary

Secretary, as the self-proclaimed champion of Chinese

education,  should  accept my  challenge  and  invite

other  Members  in the Party, who are  the  so-called

Chinese educationists, to a series of forums on  this

question over Radio Singapore so that members of  the

public can pass judgment on us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, at

the  very  beginning, the Member for Upper  Serangoon

called  me a blacksheep in Chinese education. But  he

has not been able to give me any concrete example.  I

must  refute what he has said. If today and in future

there is a decrease of enrolments in Chinese schools,

then  the  Member for Upper Serangoon should  bear  a

great  responsibility. He is actually the  blacksheep

in Chinese education. He is the, greatest criminal in

respect of the destruction of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>



Chinese  education  because  he  was  one  of   those

agitating for the boycott of the Chinese Secondary IV

examination. But now the students are victimised. Has

he  been able to help the students? I do not claim to

be  an expert on Chinese education. I am not bragging

that  I  have  made  a  very comprehensive  study  of

Chinese education. I am not claiming that. But within

the  solemn walls of the Assembly House, this  Member

at  the  very  outset  has called  another  Member  a

blacksheep.  This shows that he is a very  despicable

person.  He says that he would like a debate with  me

over Radio Singapore. That shows what a boastful  and

arrogant person he is. What a conceited man he is!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to this matter, I will say that I am the

Parliamentary   Secretary   to   the   Minister   for

Education.  I  have no control over Radio  Singapore.

But your suggestion will receive our consideration. I

am not like you who say things at random.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not know whether the

Parliamentary Secretary is addressing the Member  for

Upper Serangoon or the Speaker. He should address the

Speaker, and perhaps he could now wind up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Talking about the anxiety of the

Prime Minister, as he says, I think he knows what  it

is  all  about.  He  knows full well  why  the  Prime

Minister is anxious and what the anxiety is. If  this

particular  Member can search his own  conscience  in

the  calm of the night, then he will know that he has

done  many  things for which he should  be  sorry  in

respect  of  the people of Singapore  and  the  Prime

Minister.

this  point  before and I asked, since  equality  of'

treatment  is  recognised,  whether  they  could  not

recognise certain schools in the aided schools system

as  being  of  a  similar standing. In  the  case  of

personal to myself.

this matter so that if the Government would recognise

certain  premier schools in the aided schools  system

as  being  of  equal ranking with the top  Government

schools, then there would be no cause for, complaint.

I  am  not  talking  of just the  English  stream.  I

believe Chung Cheng High School. Chinese High  School

and  Nanyang Girls High School to be, you might  say,

of  the same ranking in the Chinese stream. I am sure

Education   Service  Scheme  which  was   only   made

applicable  to English schools. I had  at  that  time

indicated  that this was a matter for  review  to  be

made  applicable to all streams. I am  happy  to  say

that  my  Ministry has been able to  put  up  certain

some schools are more equal than others, and it takes

quite some time to sort out the relevant merits.  But

as  the Minister has just said, this matter is  under

consideration. Maybe something will' come out of  it,

although  I do not want to raise hopes too  high.  We

are  making progress in the right direction,  but  we

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concerns Malay teachers of the Malay language.

Sir,  I  understand that at the moment the number  of

trained  teachers able to teach Malay  in  the  other

streams is not adequate, and I wonder whether that is

correct.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The assumption made by the Member

for  Tanglin  about the inadequacy of Malay  language

teachers  in  our schools is correct. Because,  after

all,  only  6  per cent of pupils, and  therefore  of

teachers  in  Singapore, use Malay as the  medium  of

instruction.  So,  having  accepted  Malay   as   the

National Language of Singapore, we have to make it so

that 94 per cent of the pupils and 94 per cent of the

teachers  in  Singapore will  pick  up  the  National

Language  in course of time. This is a problem  which

we will have to do our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>



best to resolve. In this respect, I must say that  we

have,  I  think, progressed well. For the  last  four

years  at least 5,000 people have been able  to  take

public examinations in the National Language,  and  a

good  number of them are qualified teachers. In fact,

for  the  last  few  years we have  been  continually

conducting  courses  in  the  National  Language  for

qualified  teachers,  but, unfortunately,  we  cannot

take in all the teachers at one time and the most,  I

think, that we are able to handle is 1,000 per annum.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> In view of the situation being

like  that. I am sure the Minister will realise  that

he  cannot make passing the Malay language in Primary

School   Leaving  Examinations  compulsory.  At   the

moment,  it  is  not. It means that  we  have  to  be

practical, and until we have enough Malay teachers, I

think  we  cannot enforce this ruling,  because  some

parents are very worried about it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> In reply to the Member for

Havelock, I said that in 1960 for the Primary  School

Leaving  Examination, we gave notice to teachers  and

pupils  that  if  a  pupil has  had  three  years  of

continuous teaching in a second language,  then  they

will  have to take that paper for the Primary  School

Leaving  Examination.  The  standard  of  the  second

language for three years in a primary school  is  not

very  high. That is the precaution we are  taking  in

this regard.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, the reason why I stress that

is  this. This craze for examinations, almost a mania

now  with  parents, teachers, students  and  Ministry

officials, is psychologically bad for young children.

I remember that when you and the old Members all here

were  at school, we were not thinking of examinations

as being the most serious thing in life until we were

more  or less in the secondary school stage.  In  the

primary school stage you had plenty of time for play.

I  think  that  should be the privilege of  children;

their  childhood days are made happy, and they should

not be swotting over their homework



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>



day   in  and  day  out,  making  their  young  lives

miserable. If, therefore, the examination load  could

be  made  as light as possible for the young children

in  their younger days, I think that would be all  to

the  good.  So the less we say, "This is compulsory,"

and  "That  is  compulsory."  I  think  the  less  we

frighten them, and in the end they will be able to do

better  when  they  are older,  and  make  the  spurt

necessary in the secondary school phase.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there

was  equal  pay  introduced for  civil  servants  and

teachers, too. But among the Malay teachers, I notice

that there is a scale for women and another scale for

men. I believe Sultan Idris is the counterpart of the

Men's Training College, but there are two scales.  Is

there no equal pay amongst Malay teachers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to reply

to  the  Member for Tanglin, examinations are  always

controversial, but I think in Singapore  we  are  not

overdoing  it, considering the fact that we  have  an

examination  for the primary schools  at  Primary  VI

level,  that is the sixth year of education,  another

at  secondary school level when they reach the end of

lower   secondary  school  in  the  tenth   year   of

education, and the Higher School Certificate  in  the

twelfth  year  of  education,  before  entering   the

University.  In reply to the Member for  Mountbatten,

it  is  true that the Government sometime ago decided

on equal pay for equal work in respect of women.



<br><br>11.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it also did say that it would not be done

immediately,  but over a period of  three  years.  So

these   are   present   salary  scales   subject   to

adjustment.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, why does

this apply only to Malay teachers? Unless I have made

a  mistake - I did look through as far as the  English

teachers  are  concerned, there is  only  One  scale,

although  I  know  the transitional period  is  three

years  for  the English teachers, but two scales  are

put down for the Malay teachers only.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I have indicated that present

women   officers,  whether  in  English  schools   or

elsewhere, are on different scales, but over a period

of three years their adjustments are being made.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I

understand  that. What I am saying is this.  Whatever

happens  to English teachers and Malay teachers,  the

same  things are happening to Malay teachers, whether

it  is  three  years or the period of adjustment,  or

whatever  it  is.  Why in the Estimates  is  there  a

difference?  In  practice  there  is  no  difference.

Whatever  transitional  changes  there  are  for  the

English  teachers,  the same applies  for  the  Malay

teachers.  But  why  is  it necessary  to  have  this

differentiation where Malay teachers  are  concerned?

It  gives  one the impression that Malay teachers  do

not get equal pay, or will not be getting equal pay.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am not able to answer that

question  because  I  am  not  responsible  for   the

printing  of  these things in the Estimates.  I  have

given  my assurance that equal pay for women  applies

to all teachers irrespective of race.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 57 be reduced

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I just want to know whether those teachers in

the  T.T.C., whose services have been terminated, can

still  be  trained in the T.T.C. I ask this  question

because  those  teachers who have been dismissed  are

puzzled about it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, if what the

Member  for Changi says is correct, that the services

of  certain  teacher trainees are  being  terminated,

then they should not be trained in the T.T.C. because

there  are very many teachers who wish to be admitted

into  the T.T.C. and we have had to prevent  some  of

them   from  undergoing  training  because   of   the

limitation of facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Teo

Hock Guan ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 57 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (69) of subhead 1.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> I am not moving, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 57 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (92) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister, what are the qualifications of such trainees? Secondly, in what medium of instruction is such training carried out? Thirdly, what 1 would like to ask is this. At the end of the training, to what schools will such successful trainees he sent?

Fourthly,  at  the  present  moment,  since   it   is

necessary to train so many technical teachers for the

technical  schools, how many such  technical  schools

use  Chinese as a medium of instruction: how many use

English; how many use Malay, and how many use Tamil?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, in reply to

the Member for Serangoon Gardens. There are about 192

teachers  in  training for the technical streams.  Of

this, 104 are from the English stream and 88 from the

Chinese   stream,  making  a  total   of   192.   The

qualifications  of  these teacher  trainees  are,  in

respect  of the English stream, the Cambridge  School

Certificate;  in respect of the Chinese  stream,  the

Senior  Middle  III certificate or the  Secondary  IV

Certificate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe his second question was on the languages

of instruction. I believe they are given instructions

in English, and in respect of Chinese students, there

are  some  subjects in Chinese. I have  not  got  the

brief  in that respect, but since most of the Chinese

secondary  school  graduates  have  had  studies   in

English, I think they are able to get by with English

as the medium of instruction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On graduation - the first batch of teacher trainees

should  be graduating in a month's time - they will  be

posted to secondary technical schools. There will  be

four  new  secondary  technical  schools  ready   for

occupation at the end of this year for 1964. We  hope

to  post  the  first  batch of 41 technically-trained

teachers for these secondary schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Minister has

not  answered my last question, and that is, how many

technical  schools  use English.  Chinese,  Malay  or

Indian as the medium of instruction?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> It is not likely that the

secondary  technical  schools will  be  conducted  in

Malay  or  Tamil, because, as I have  indicated  just

now,  the  192 teachers who are now being trained  at

the  T.T.C. for  technical  teaching  are  from  the

English  and the Chinese streams. As to how  many  of

the  four  secondary  technical schools  will  be  in

English or in Chinese, that has not been decided. But

it   is   likely   that  they  will   be   integrated

Chinese/English secondary technical schools.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I will deal, first of all, Sir,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>



in  the University of Singapore and the University of

Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Press release announcing the award of bursaries

was  issued  on  25th  April, and  I  think  we  have

received  257 applications. The Selection  Board  has

not yet been constituted, and we feel that it will be

constituted any moment now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Selection Board for the - award of

bursaries  to  Nanyang University students,  a  Press

release  was  issued  inviting applications  on  14th

March,  1963. 210 applications were received and  the

names  of  members  of  the Selection  Board  are  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chairman - Professor Li Hsiang Lin of Nanyang University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members - The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry

<br><br>I understand that they have since interviewed the 210

applicants,  and  I am awaiting the Report  from  the

Selection Board.



<br><br>11.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, with

regard  to  the bursaries for Nanyang University  and

the University of Singapore, I would like to say that

they are very important to the poor students. Without

sufficient aid, such poor students will not  be  able

to go through their university and higher education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Estimates in respect of the

Universities  of Singapore and Malaya, the  estimated

amount  for bursaries is $585,950, whereas in respect

of  Nanyang  University it is $680,000. Mr  Speaker,

from  the  1961  Financial Statement, page  181,  the

Government  agreed  to pay the University  of  Malaya $473,000



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>



but  the actual amount spent was $402,677. In respect

of   Nanyang   University,  the  bursaries   approved

amounted  to  $680,000, which is the same  amount  as

that  asked for in respect of this year. But in 1961,

the   Government  only  spent  $388,000  on   Nanyang

University students by way of bursaries.  So  we  can

see  that  in  1961, the Government only spent  about

half   the  amount  of  the  vote  made  to   Nanyang

University and the other half was not used at all. In

this  year's Estimates, the Government is asking  for

more  than  that  for last year  in  respect  of  the

Universities  of  Singapore and Malaya,  whereas  the

amount for this year in respect of Nanyang University

is  the same as that for last year, So, according  to

the  Financial Statement for 1961, we can come  to  a

very  clear conclusion, that in the case of bursaries

for  Nanyang University students, the Government  has

not gone all out to help them. The Government has not

made  full  use of the money available to  help  poor

students in Nanyang University to enable them to have

a higher education



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there are many Nanyang University undergraduates who have to go round borrowing money from their friends and relatives to pay for their fees and boarding, and their only hope of continuing their studies is by means of the bursaries given by the Government. If these are not granted to them,

then  they will have to leave the University half-way

without  being  able to continue  with  their  higher

education,   The   Government,  when   dealing   with

applications  for  bursaries from Nanyang  University

students,  attach  a lot of conditions  and  strings.

Generally   speaking,   the  Nanyang   undergraduates

complied  with all the conditions, because  I  myself

was  a member of the Selection Committee at one time,

but   from  the  Financial  Statement  of  1961,  the

Government  did  not  go  all  out  to  help  Nanyang

University graduates by way of giving bursaries. As a

result of this, many students were unable to continue

studying in Nanyang University. They had to leave and

work  for one year, and then return to the University

to  complete their third year, because they were  not

given bursaries. But if the Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>



Education, including his Parliamentary Secretary, had

paid  attention  to  this  matter,  they  would  have

understood the whole position. So I hope this  amount

of  $680,000  in respect of bursaries will  be  fully

utilised so that more Nanyang undergraduates can  get

the  benefit  of  the bursaries  to  enable  them  to

continue with their studies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us get to the root of the matter. This money

comes  from  the  people, but to the Government  this

amount  is  what is due to them. Because  this  money

comes from the people, the poor students are entitled

to  get  the bursaries. It is not a grace granted  by

the  Government.  I hope the Minister  for  Education

will  give  an  undertaking in this  House  that  the

Estimates in respect of this item will not be  partly

used.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it just shows

how irresponsible the Member for Chua Chu Kang is  in

assuming that if there is a vote, therefore it should

be  spent  regardless of anything. In the awards  for

bursaries,  he  himself has admitted that  he  was  a

member  of the 1961 Bursary Selection Board, and  his

colleague,  the Member for Changi, was a  member  for

the  years 1959 and 1960. These bursaries are awarded

to  students  on  the  basis of  financial  need  and

scholastic merits. So it does not mean that  everyone

who  applies will get it. That is why we  have  taken

the  precaution  to  have  someone  from  the  Inland

Revenue  Department  amongst  the  members   of   the

Selection Board, just in case declarations  are  made

that  they  are very poor but are really fairly  well

off financially, and also someone from the Department

of   Social   Welfare,   so   that   if   needs   be,

investigations could be made as regards the financial

position  of the applicant. I think it is just  utter

rubbish for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>



Member for Choa Chu Kang to suggest that there should

be  a guarantee by the Minister that the whole sum of

$680,000  must be spent or given out in the  form  of

bursaries.  God  help Singapore if  such  people  are

going   to   disburse   public  money:   these   most

irresponsible  suggestions coming  from  the  Barisan

Sosialis.

Amendment   (21)  is  not  being  moved.  Dr   Thio,

amendment (22) .



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg te move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 57 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 30.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is about free textbooks. Sir, could the

Minister  please  explain the  procedure  as  to  how

parents  apply  for free textbooks  and  whether  the

textbooks are supplied in time before the school year

begins?  It is because on previous occasions  I  have

had poor parents coming to me for free textbooks, and

when  I  wrote  to  the  heads of  schools  for  free

textbooks  to be given to the children of these  poor

parents, the answer was that either the parents  were

too  late in applying or that there were no more free

textbooks  to be given to them. I wonder whether  the

Minister could please enlighten us on that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The Member for Tanglin has

retired from the education service for some time  and

things have moved on. It is correct that in the  past

there were certain difficulties over the granting  of

textbooks. They are actually not free. It  is  really

lending.  Textbooks  are  being  lent  out  to   poor

students  to use for the year and when they move  up,

books are left behind, provided they are not tattered

and  torn, for the next poor student to use them. The

system was somewhat faulty for the last few years and

there were certain complaints that poor students were

not  able  to  borrow books in order to pursue  their

studies.  So  in  1962 we had a  position  where  335

schools in Singapore, both Government and

Government-aided,  applied  for aid under this  scheme  and  the

money  involved was around $130,000, although we  had

$190,000  in  the Estimates. This year a  notice  was

issued on 5th January, a few days after schools  were

opened  on  2nd January this year, and  a  simplified

form  of  application was then evolved. This time  we

were somewhat faster, and I am happy to say that  for

this  year more schools have taken advantage  of  the

scheme;  as  many  as  440 schools  involving  22,300

children.  We  have actually exhausted  the  vote  of

$192,000  shown in the Estimates. It is  likely  that

the figure will go up to more than $215,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in this subhead

30, item (4), I notice that the money provided for in

the  1963 Estimates is $1,500 less than that  in  the 1962 Estimates.

Can the Minister explain why this  is

so?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The Member for Havelock was at

one time associated with the Ministry of Finance, and

I  think  this  is  one of those little  calculations

which  officials  in the Ministry like  to  hack  at.

Anyway, I have already indicated that it is more than

likely  that what we require would be more  than  the

present Estimates, and we would have to go



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>



through   the  rather  stringent  test   of   getting

Treasury's approval for it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we know that every time the Prime Minister goes down to the rural areas he plans for many teachers and students to welcome him. Does the Minister for Education know that these teachers and students are forced to send representatives to the welcoming committee on which there are also

representatives   from   other   organisations    and

political   Parties?  This  puts  the  teachers   and

students  in  a  very  invidious  position  which  is

political  in nature. How would the Minister  explain

this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. Does the Minister know that

at  every welcoming party small school children  have

to stand in the hot sun or even in heavy rain waiting

for  several hours for the Prime Minister to  arrive?

Is it correct to ask young school children to welcome

the  Prime  Minister? I would like the  Minister  for

Education  to  investigate into this and  to  explain

whether it is proper for them to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. When the Prime Minister went

to  the  rural areas, he once said that after  a  few

years all the secondary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>



school students would be given free  education.

On  this  point  I am very doubtful, because  in  the

past, when school fees were rationalised in secondary

schools, the boys were charged $4 and the girls  were

charged  $3.  Why can they not reduce the  $4  to  $3

instead of raising $3 to $4? The Minister for Finance

has  also  said  that  it is likely  that  in  middle

schools  the school fees will be raised  to  $10  per

student. How is that the Prime Minister talked  about

giving  free education to the students? Is  this  not

cheap political propaganda?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will explain all this so that we

can understand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister should be given an

opportunity to reply. Mr Ong Chang Sam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, a

little  while ago the Parliamentary Secretary to  the

Minister  for Education was very red in the face.  He

also  touched on the Commission of Inquiry  into  the

Junior IV boycott. He said that the Member for  Upper

Serangoon  was  behind  the  scenes  instigating  the

boycott.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have completed that subject

already. Any other new subject?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir,

the  Member for Upper Serangoon has been waiting  for

several  months  hoping that the  Commissioner  would

summon him to give evidence, but, unfortunately, this

Commission  has already concluded its business  in  a

haphazard way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government used to condemn

the Barisan Sosialis for carrying out political

activities in schools. In fact ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have just mentioned that we have

completed all those subjects. Is there any other new

subject? We have only got five minutes left. Any

other new subject?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

what I want to say is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>



this.   The   Government   has   asked   all   school

principals - especially the Parliamentary Secretary has

asked them - to summon many principals to take part  in

political  activities.  I  would  like  to  ask   the

Minister whether he intends to sack these principals.

At  one time, the Straits Times and the Malayan Times

reported   that  there  would  be  a   Minister   for

Education. I want to enquire whether it is true.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I think it is useless to answer

the Member for Choa Chu Kang who is always irrelevant

and has nothing new to offer, and who repeats himself

time  and again and has to be called to order. I will

restrict  my  remarks  to answering  the  Member  for

Serangoon Gardens. Well, the Prime Minister's tour of

the constituencies is an event which is well received

by  the people in the constituencies concerned,  and,

in  fact,  with every visit of his, it  would  appear

that   there   is  severe  competition  between   the

constituencies to do one better than  the  other,  so

that it is snowballing and gaining great popularity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that when the Prime Minister intends to

visit    a    constituency,   certain    groups    of

people - community   leaders   and   others - would   get

together,  hold meetings and plan for  the  reception

and  welcome  of  the Prime Minister and  this  would

naturally  include organisations, schools, committees

of  management, principals, and so forth. In fact, if

such   community   leaders   are   not   invited - even

principals and teachers of schools - they will feel  as

if  they  have been slighted. Therefore, if community

leaders  get  together and call upon  principals  and

teachers to send representatives for this preparatory

committee,  I  see  no  reason why  they  cannot  get

together to plan a welcome for our Prime Minister. If

the visit of the Prime Minister to the rural areas is

an  event  of  no mean order and if both parents  and

pupils  are very excited about it and would therefore

like to celebrate, I think standing in the sun for  a

little  while will be good for their health, just  as

on  National Day. I am sure the Member for  Serangoon

Gardens,  when he was on this side of the House,  was

the better for it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>



when  standing  for  a few hours  to  witness  the

national  parade. These are things that one  meets

with - the  waving  of flags or the  Prime  Minister

pinching  their  cheeks,  perhaps,  while  passing

through  and  having the thrill of  shaking  their

hands.  These  are things we should  not  prevent.

People - young  children, parents and old  women - are

making  it possible for the Prime Minister  to  be

with  the people. After all, he has to look  after

them; so he might as well get to know them better.

Well,  the  tour  of the Prime  Minister  has  now

become such an event that teachers and pupils  get

excited and rather tired. Requests have come  into

my  Ministry for a holiday to be declared the  day

after  a  visit so that they can recover from  all

the excitement. I have granted holidays - certainly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to the question of free secondary

education.  The Member for Serangoon Gardens  says

that  this  has  come to him as a surprise.  Three

years  ago  we  rationalised  fees  for  secondary

schools,  so  that the girls in secondary  schools

would  be paying the same fees as the boys  at  $4

per  month. The hon. Member asks: why is it he now

hears  that  the  Government is contemplating  the

provision  of  free  secondary education  at  some

later stage? Well, this is not just propaganda. It

is  something, which a good Government, if  it  is

financially   able  to  provide   free   secondary

education, should endeavour to do.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time has expired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $94,774,100 for Head 57 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The remaining heads of expenditure

in  respect  of which no amendment stands  on  the

Order  Paper -   I  take it that  the  Minister  for

Finance  will be following the list very carefully

if he wants his votes. I hope I will not leave out

any Heads of Expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He cannot concentrate. He is

worried.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I know it is a late hour, but I am
