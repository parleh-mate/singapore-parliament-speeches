is one of the chief concerns among Singaporeans, particularly among
those in the 20th percentile whose real income had stagnated, rising only
0.3 per cent over the last 10 years, after taking into account inflation.
This group of Singaporeans struggle with the intense competition
and rapid changes brought about by globalisation. For them, it is
almost as if they are running on a treadmill which has been increasing
relentlessly both in speed and incline. It seems that all they can
do is to keep themselves from falling off. </p>

Agency (WDA) is in the process of helping them through retraining.
It is a step in the right direction but it would take time for these workers
to pick up new skills and get better paying jobs. Therefore, in
the meantime, there is a need for us to control the cost of living
as such increases have a much larger impact on this group of Singaporeans.
The Government should continue to look at reduction in charges,
fees and even rental to reduce their cost burden. A good example of
this was the removal of the TV licence fee after many years of lobbying
by MPs and residents. This has been much appreciated.</p>

a significant proportion of the budgets of lower income groups.
Our hawker centres have always played a key role in providing affordable
food for the masses and have provided opportunities for the needy
and low-income groups to make a living. Hence, I would like to thank
the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources for deciding
to resume the building of hawker centres to meet the needs of the
residents in new population centres. Everyone has welcomed this
announcement.</p>

component is housing. The steep rise in property prices has caused
much anxiety, particularly among young couples. Hence, I am in support
of the cooling measures that have been implemented by the Ministry
of National Development. The assurance to increase supply and stabilise
prices will also encourage more Singaporeans to set up families
and have children. </p>

is the foreign workers quota. Businesses continue to face severe
labour shortages even as the foreign workers quotas are being lowered.
MOM may wish to review their foreign workers quota policy to base
it upon the wages of the Singaporean workers instead of the number
employed. This may better serve the needs of both Singaporeans and
businesses. Doing so will incentivise businesses to upgrade the
skills of their Singaporean employees and to invest in technology
which enhance productivity in order to attain and justify higher
salaries for Singaporean workers. Singaporean workers will get to
benefit directly, unlike the present situation where the punitive
policies of increasing workers' levy push up business cost. In this
way, neither businesses nor Singaporean workers benefit directly. </p>

that only those companies employing local full-time workers with
a minimum salary of $1,500 will be considered eligible for application
for work permits for foreign workers. A higher ratio can be extended
to an employer whose Singaporean workers earn more than $1,500.
We should also explore the possibility of linking foreign worker
quotas to the number of women with children employed in the company,
to the number of Singaporean workers sent for skill upgrading and
to the number of re-employed older workers in the company.</p>

we should continue to encourage young Singaporeans to have more
babies. The times have changed and our environment is getting increasingly competitive
due to globalisation. Hence, we need to give a helping hand to our
young men and women, even though they are more highly educated and
affluent than their parents. They work longer hours and have to
go for courses continuously to upgrade themselves. Let us do more
to lessen their burden so that they will be motivated to have more
children.</p>

a 10% to 20% discount or rebate for their HDB flat if they have children
or for each child they have. HDB may also consider removing the
income ceiling for first-time home buyers. Or more heavily subsidised
or free infant and childcare centres run by the Government can be
set up at schools and community centres to provide convenience and
accessibility to parents. We should also have measures to encourage
more Singaporeans to take up childcare as their profession. The
Minister for Manpower may wish to consider reducing the maid levy
for each child born. Another suggestion is mandatory shorter working
hours for mothers at the workplace.</p>

                  </span>.] Next,
I would like to talk about re-employment. According to data issued
by MOM in July, in 2010, 94% of workers aged 62 are still working.
This is good news. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ce6ab48c-f8e5-42fe-ac4c-85b34dad67f4">
                  <a name="president-address__id-ce6ab48c-f8e5-42fe-ac4c-85b34dad67f4"><!--a--></a>Currently, our labour market
is facing a shortage of labour. To allow healthy and good-performing
older workers to continue working is not only a legal obligation,
but also a solution to the labour shortage problem. I hope the Government
can continue to encourage employers to employ older workers and
re-employ retired ones, through various measures. Although the older
workers may not be as efficient or productive as the younger ones,
with their experience accumulated over the years, they will definitely make
meaningful contributions to the company. Hence, I suggest that MOM
consider re-employment of older workers as one of the conditions
to hire foreign workers, to encourage more companies to continue
employing older workers. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b93f03b5-09c3-4115-a06a-d9047846cfc1">

to help top-up employers' CPF contribution for older workers. I
believe this will reduce some employers' resistance to hiring older
workers.</p>

my support for MOE's decision to put more emphasis on cultivating
values in students and to launch new civic and moral education courses. Moral
education is the basics of education. Our education system has all
along emphasised academic performance, with students' future employment
as the target. Some employers said that their staff's examination
results and EQ are not in line, and they also noticed that some
young people and students lack compassion, are self-centred and
inconsiderate. I am not sure if our education system has neglected
this aspect, or it is inevitable that every city or country is bound
to have this kind of citizens. Nonetheless, I support MOE's new
direction to emphasise character and values. Of course, to create
the environment to promote a holistic education, besides the school, parents
must also play an important role. If parents' behaviour contradicts
the values that are taught in school, teachings by the school will
have limited effect.</p>

with MOE's new direction of placing emphasis on character and values
education. However, since parents are generally concerned with their
children's academic results, to achieve a balance between character
building and academic excellence will be a challenge, considering
the limited time and manpower resources. In the past, we were always
able to achieve what we set our mind on. Hence, I believe we can
achieve this target. I am eager to see how MOE will strike a balance between
character building and academic excellence.</p>

moral education and character building, the other development in
education which I find very encouraging is the Government's mission
"to better cater to the strengths and interests of each child, and
to allow every child to find his or her own path to success". While
it is impossible to ensure that every child has the same opportunities,
the Ministry's commitment to provide every child with access to opportunities,
regardless of family circumstances and background, is as close as
we can get. </p>

the Ministry's plan to explore how more university places and pathways
can be created to allow Singaporeans to get degrees. Every Singaporean
is important to us. We need to help each and everyone realise his
or her potential for the benefit of our nation and society. Not
only should we provide multiple pathways to success, we also have
to re-define and widen our vision of success. We must be willing
to give more than a second chance to those among us who stumble.

society compassionate, forgiving and accommodating enough to help

Many may equate compassion with handouts or donations but often
what they really want are opportunities. There is a Hokkien saying:
"<em class="ph i">Bo lobang, kor dei pua zi kang</em>" (which when translated literally
means that without opportunities, one would have a hole in his pocket).
I have come across quite a number of residents who turn down my

and National Development (Mr Lee Yi Shyan)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, I rise to thank the President for his address in opening the
session of this Parliament. The General Elections 2011 has been
described as a "watershed" election. Some others went further to
comment that two elections on, Singapore's fundamentals have not
changed. We would ask a number of questions about Singapore's fundamentals. </p>

"fundamental" as "forming a necessary base or core; of central importance".
On what fundamentals did we build the modern Singapore? Are they
still relevant? Is it possible to have less of the "normal", and
more of the "new", in the "new normal", so to speak? Several months
ago, I met with a former Asian leader. Commenting on the political
culture of the day, he said, "We live in the days of pop culture.
People like to see new faces in politics, like the many new pop
stars on the top charts. They expect political leaders to whip up
new programmes like new pop songs". He added, "But the tenets of
good governance require stability, predictability and long-term
planning". He sounded somewhat frustrated but I think he has a point.</p>

histories have seen frequent changes in political leadership and
hence, policy directions. For instance, since year 1980, there have
been five Prime Ministers in Great Britain. In the same period,
Japan has seen 17 Prime Ministers. So, one Prime Minister, on the
average, lasted about six years in the UK and less than two years
in Japan. </p>

model that corresponds to its circumstances. For Singapore, we benefited
from an extended period of political stability and policy consistency.
We were able to put national interests first and focus on nation
building. We have not compromised long-term goals with short-term
gains; nor traded in majority's interests for sectoral privileges.
We have thrived on the basis of shared vision and unity of purpose. </p>

is whether we will be able to make progress with these same characteristics,
with the help of this new Parliament. Or will we be embroiled in partisan
politics, divided by sectional interests and alienated by the "they
and us" segregation so commonly seen in other countries? Preserving
the sound fundamentals that have kept Singapore going is therefore
my key concern for Singapore in our next phase of development.</p>

are tiny. By world ranking in terms of land size, we are 179th amongst
196 countries in the world. In fact, Singapore is no larger than
Batam and one third of the size of Bintan. The strategic location
of being in the Straits of Malacca connecting to the South China
Sea and Indian Ocean is not our monopoly. Batam, Bintan and many
other islands along the Straits, too, enjoy the same locational
advantage and deep-water access. What makes Singapore tick and become
a little red dot of contrast?</p>

on par with the top 10 in the world. To achieve incremental 3% to
5% growth today, will be harder than yesterday. Neither will there
be ready-made nor off-the-shelf solutions for the problems we face.
In many areas, we are at new frontiers, whether it is providing
for an ageing population, or upscaling workers whose jobs have gone
to low-cost countries. In all these and more, we have to devise
our own policies and solutions. We have to chart our own path, learn
from others, and make our own assessments the best way forward. </p>

Eng Hwa and Dr Amy Khor spoke much about Greece, the epicentre of
the world's current economic problems. While pictures of rioters
clashing with police and buildings on fire may still be vivid in
our memories, Greece's financial turmoil is more than a recent phenomenon.
It has been in ruins even before it joined the Euro zone in 2001.
A bloated civil service, generous pension and social programmes
and rampant tax evasion. Several rounds of negotiations led to the
two bailout packages of US$380 billion we know today. Fresh rounds
of steep austerity measures ensued. Greece needs to squeeze savings
of some $38 billion through 2012 from public sector salary cuts,
higher taxes on alcohol and cigarettes, and tighter retirement rules.
This belt tightening, however, is expected to deepen poverty and
aggravate hardships in Greece. Greece's GDP in 2012 is estimated
to be back to the year 2003. Economists call this Greece's "Lost
Decade". However, Greece is not alone in piling up "IOU" notes.</p>

welfare models were the envy of the world. The State provides for
cradle-to-grave welfare to just about everyone, from free medical

federal budget is about US$3.6 trillion. Of this, 60% goes to expenditures
that are called "mandatory spending" and 40% to "discretionary". "Mandatory
spending" is mainly made up of social transfers, such as Social
Security, unemployment benefits, Medicare, MedicAid and interests
for debt. These social programmes actually started out rather modestly
and benignly at conception. Over time, they grew to the enormous
sizes we know today, by successive rounds of "enhancements and expansions".
Let me illustrate.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-40fbf453-dde7-4e6f-9dc5-e686da98e019">
                  <a name="president-address__id-40fbf453-dde7-4e6f-9dc5-e686da98e019"><!--a--></a>President Franklin D Roosevelt
started the New Deal and Social Security programme in 1935 during
the Great Depression. Fiscal trouble began in earnest with bills
that increased the benefits immediately by 20% and an introduction
of a cost-of-living escalator which was pegged to wage rise. Subsequent
tweaks added trillions of dollars of unfunded liabilities to the
programme. In 1965, President Lyndon B Johnson launched the Great
Society, marking the dawn of the healthcare state. When Medicare
and MedicAid were launched that year, they, too, were thought to
be manageable. Medicare, the social programme for the elderly, was
supposed to cost only US$12 billion. It became 10 times more − US$110
billion in 1990. MedicAid, which funds healthcare for the low-income
groups, gradually ballooned from US$4 billion in 1966 to US$41 billion in
1986 and US$290 billion last year. By 2010 last year, all such social
transfers account for 60% of the US federal budget, up from 28%
in 1965. The US now spends a staggering US$2.1 trillion on these
redistribution programmes. </p>

economies, Europe, US and Japan incur debts that are testing their
ability to repay. It makes me wonder if it is also the inevitable
path that Singapore would follow as a newly-developed economy. Will
we ever end up in a high debt nation's club by choice, or forced
into it by circumstances? Sir, as we strive to refine our social
safety net, as we consider the requests from many interest groups,
as we seek to bridge the widening income gaps, as we cater to more
single-parent families and their children, as we provide for more
elderly care for the growing population, would we not need to spend
more? Where would the funding come from?</p>

the US and Greece provide us with the following lessons. Firstly,
they reveal to us that national policies have a long tail. Any new
structure, policy and formula we create today and implement tomorrow
can have long term impact which will be felt throughout the decades.
As seen in these examples, they can slowly chip away the strength
of our society or weaken its base. The challenge for us, as legislators, is
that many of the new policy designs will show no immediate side
or ill effects, and can look extremely benign and harmless. When
tax revenues slow – perhaps due to slower workforce growth coupled
with recession for instance – or when a population greys or when
we lose competitiveness, symptoms of a weak or bad policy can quickly
show up. Beyond the point of no return, it will be very hard, if
at all, to reverse an entrenched policy that has been set in place
without causing major upheaval in the society. </p>

us the importance of living within our means. "Living within thy
means" seems like a good old adage that everyone understands since
young. But why is it difficult, so it seems, to be implemented at
the country level? Some people think that the State's money is not
their money. And, hence, if it is not mine, why do I save? People
in the West have pressured politicians to spend more on them. Each sectional
group has asked for increased funding for their pet projects. Soon, discretionary
spending becomes mandatory and short-term projects become long-term obligations. </p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-66d0efbb-8aa9-4ad2-b166-9e1eba81897a"><!--a--></a>Small dependency groups
grow large. One-off payments become entitlements. When you marry
unlimited wants with a populist government, you will have a bankrupt country.
Some may argue that borrowing can be harmless. After all, many countries borrow
against their oil, gas, coal, rare earth or bauxites. They argue
that their national balance sheet is still very strong. In Singapore,
we have none of the above, what would we borrow against? If we ever
borrow, it will be against our future's earnings, against the taxes
we have yet to collect, and placing debt burdens on our children
even before they leave school. Fortunately, we have avoided debt
financing altogether so far. This is because we have been prudent
as a government.</p>

us the importance of economic independence. The fact that we operate
in a highly globalised and integrated world is no longer a secret.
What has become obvious is the increased frequency and magnitude
of shocks this integrated system now generates. Right after the
Lehman Brothers debacle was a period of severe liquidity crunch.
In the next eighteen months, we had excessive liquidity chasing
up asset prices and causing high inflations. The sudden entry and
departure of international funds unsettle small economies. To stay
afloat in such choppy waters, we need to have strong stomachs. We
must continually shock-proof our economy, protect our jobs, up-skill
our workers, and invest in our schools, ITEs and the universities.
To accomplish all these, we must generate growth, create surpluses,
and redistribute some of these to help those who are lagging behind.
We must continue to save so that we have what it takes to protect
our economic and financial independence in times of need.</p>

the trade-off inherent in any chosen policy. As law-makers of this
land, as we debate policies and programmes to improve the lives
of ordinary Singaporeans, let us be mindful of the trade-off each
policy brings. However much as we desire, we cannot have our cake
and eat it. We are operating with very tight parameters in an already
highly optimised system. If we build more flats, we will forgo more
open spaces. If we build more roads, we will have fewer parks. If
we intensify building at MRT locations, it will also mean denser
living. If we allow property values to appreciate, it will mean
a bigger gap between the existing asset owners and the aspirants.
Sir, the nature of policy-making is full of inherent trade-offs.
Each policy has its mult-faceted effects. So, let us be mindful
of them and make the best of it.</p>

is the bottom line. When downgrading the US' credit rating, Standard
and Poor's (S&amp;P) said that the "political brinkmanship" in the
debate over the debt had affected the US government's ability to
manage its finances. It is now "less stable, less effective and
less predictable".</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-701cdd6d-7183-4354-96bd-44ef5f7a7ccc"><!--a--></a>S&amp;P's pronouncement
is a grave reminder that the "first-world parliament", as what the
US is perceived to be, has not prevented the country from spending
to the point of near bankruptcy. A "first-world parliament" has
not been proven to be effective in dispensing decisive and speedy
solutions to contain the current debt crisis. If you look at the
facts, the crisis the West and the US are in, they are struggling
very hard to rein in debts, stabilise their banks and stem further
job losses. This is despite the "first-world parliament" status.</p>

but the substance. Good governance led by competent leadership,
supported by active citizenry and inspired by a shared vision, is
in my view the best way to secure the future of Singapore. Sir,
at the Opening of this Twelfth Parliament, I behold the future of
Singapore with confidence and expectation. We have overcome many
trials and tribulations in the last 46 years. Our fundamental values

Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion. Sir Stamford Raffles may
have founded Singapore but it was our forefathers' qualities of
drive, determination, enterprise and resourcefulness that helped
build Singapore to be a trading capital of the East. But it is we
the descendants who have carried on the good work and made Singapore
to be what it is today.</p>

the contributions of each and every member of our society towards
nation building. Many of them worked very hard, earning very little and
have very little savings left for rainy days, looking after its
own citizens. But now with global changes, progress and competition,
they are forced into early retirement, made redundant, have become
obsolete in our modern fast-paced and expensive world. Many of them
are struggling. Many are trying to find the money to pay for their
next meal or their next bill. The progress of society has passed
them by and I hope our Government will not also forget them all.</p>

hope to urge our Government to think and care more for this early
generation of pioneers who have now become the stragglers in our
society. We can be more compassionate to our citizens and their
families who are struggling to make ends meet. We are now living
in a faster and shrinking world due to globalisation. Singapore
will continue to evolve in order to adapt to global changes and
trends. </p>

must remember that economic growth is a means to an end. The end
is inclusive growth where Singaporeans progress upwards collectively
as a society. In other words, we must be mindful about the widening
income gap that will create tensions in society. When creating employment,
we should consider creating sustainable jobs that provide for reasonable
remuneration. In the last decade, the influx of cheaper foreign
labour has depressed wage growth. As we pursue growth at the top line,
Singapore should consider efficiency of labour with indexes, such
as value-added per worker. Besides increasing workforce in large
quantities, Singapore needs to grow resourcefulness and creativity
in order to compete in the global arena. This means we have to re-shape
our educational system as well. We also need to embrace diversity
in society, accept new-age skills, social media to be able to live
and work together in harmony, respect each other's beliefs and ideas,
and to be gracious and compassionate to each other's community by
helping each other. </p>

a shared culture and lived through a common history to give a shared
meaning to this country as a nation. For Singapore to continue being
a cohesive nation, we need to ensure our talented citizens, who
have been born and bred here or are newly acquired, will continue
to regard Singapore as their home. Younger Singaporeans, often better
educated than their parents, feel that they do not have much to
say in the affairs of the country. They may be comfortable materialistically,
but share very little emotional attachment to Singapore. Singing
National Day songs like "Majulah Singapura" or "Count on Me, Singapore"
will not be enough to provide a strong cultural and historical glue
to bind the younger Singaporeans. If the Government wants its citizens
to participate in the affairs of the country and in order for its
citizens' participation to have good meaning, there must be real
freedom to generate, test and implement ideas and not to decide
how, what, when and where it should be done.</p>

we must not forget Singapore's political exiles. I am sorry this
is a very touchy subject. The Government should look into allowing
political exiles and their families to come back to Singapore freely,
without fear and without pre-conditions. These people with their
families are also our future, our home-grown Singapore talent.</p>

less prescriptive when designing policies affecting citizens' lives
with its social-engineering agenda. The decision to restrict the
purchase of HDB flats only when Singaporeans get married or are
over 35 years old may no longer be appropriate. I urge the Government
to reconsider this restriction and allow Singapore-born citizens
to buy their first HDB flats simply when they reach the age of 21. We
understand the sky-rocketing HDB prices. By the time a citizen reaches
35 years old to obtain a flat, the price of the flat may have tripled
and that would be out of the person's reach. We want to emphasise
that it has become the right and aspiration of every young Singaporean
to desire to own an HDB flat as soon as possible at a reasonable
price. Expectedly, many divorces in our society today can be blamed
on the HDB's policy on this matter. </p>

the Government announced that it wants to seek inclusive growth
that will benefit all its citizens in all walks of life. It is my
hope that a comprehensive programme is being set up to work towards
this goal over the next five years. We should also consider creating
an index to track the value-added per worker for different economic
sectors ranging from the manufacturing, services and financial industries.
We should consider adjusting the mix of industries in Singapore
to increase worker efficiency. We must also pursue more information
and data points, such as the split of local and foreigners employed
in every sector. The Government should focus on industries with
a higher mix of local employment.</p>

indicators can be introduced to mark the performances of our Ministers

build pyramids from surpluses but must share its wealth equally
among Singaporeans through sufficient spending in essential services
and infrastructure. We can afford to spend more and allow our citizens
some of the essential services in greater comfort like less waiting
time to see doctors at our polyclinics, hospitals and shorter time
for appointments at polyclinics and the National Dental Centre.
We must also help to bridge the income gap between the rich and
the poor, more subsidies should be disbursed to the lower income
Singaporeans like the old and the elderly in 1-room rental flats,
the handicapped, mentally ill, caregivers, single parents, pensioners
and the jobless. There is also a need for additional health subsidies
for medicines and non-standard drugs without GST and also dental
care subsidies as well. There should be fixed pricing on expensive
hawker food by adjusting and looking into the high rentals of newly
renovated hawker centres and markets. More money should be pumped
into welfare homes that rely on Government funding. There should
be less red-tape for citizens applying for subsidies. Also, hawker
licences for the handicapped should be waived. How much can a wheelchair-bound
or handicapped person earn a day by selling tissue papers and other
small items when they are being imposed a hefty fine of $150 to
$170 from numerous illegal hawking summonses? The Government should
improve the living conditions of the poor in their homes, with special
attention to those living in 1-room rental flats. It is insufficient
to beautify the facade of HDB void decks and lifts when living conditions
inside such flats can be deplorable. It is where humanity and compassion
must be imbued in us.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I support Dr Lam Pin Min's Motion to thank the
President. In his Address, the President said that Singapore is
entering a new phase of development. Europe, US and Japan's economic
outlook is not looking good, which will definitely impact our economy.
Therefore, the Government and our people must work together to face
the challenges so that our economy can continue to grow.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7213587b-1e0e-4e4b-a39f-6cf33087797e">
                  <a name="president-address__id-7213587b-1e0e-4e4b-a39f-6cf33087797e"><!--a--></a>The General Election in
May and the Presidential election in August this year demonstrated
our changing political landscape. The new phase reflects Singaporeans' political
awareness which could be partially attributed to our years of economic
growth and high level of education attainment. Can we stay united
in this diversified political environment? I believe that as long
as Singaporeans have the big picture in mind and stay objective,
rational and accommodating, we can still remain competitive. On
the contrary, if we become polarised, the result can be devastating.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d2bb03d9-4146-41e7-a71b-decac1434c29">

closely linked to the values held by its citizens. At this juncture,
we need to take stock of our values so that we can cultivate the
right shared values for the country to move forward. Let me cite
an example. During a NTU graduation ceremony in August this year,
a graduate blurted out a four-letter word at the end of her valedictory
speech. Subsequently, she apologised for the inappropriate phrase
and explained that she did it in a moment of euphoria. Usually,
we will accept her explanation. However, the responses from the
academic circle were unexpectedly polarised. From this incident,
we observe the change and polarisation of our society's values.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 164</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9a0a59c6-8b89-4ebd-bbd9-76e8aaf91895">
                  <a name="president-address__id-9a0a59c6-8b89-4ebd-bbd9-76e8aaf91895"><!--a--></a>How should we uphold our
good traditional values? This is a challenge. Let me illustrate
with an example of how the traditional values of the Chinese family
have changed over time in China and Taiwan. According to a <em class="ph i">Lianhe
Zaobao</em> report on 3 June 2011, there were 1.2 million couples
getting married in China while 1.96 million couples were divorced
in 2010. This shows that divorce rate in China is fast catching
up with that in the Western countries. In Taiwan, the birth rate
is even lower than Singapore, with a total fertility rate (TFR)
of less than 1 in 2010. According to a <em class="ph i">Straits Times'</em> report
on 10 October 2011, there was a reversal of this trend only after
the Taiwanese Government offered financial incentives to encourage
couples to have children. In short, the Chinese families no longer
believe in the importance of procreation.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-86200340-77cb-496e-960d-124b398480aa">
                  <a name="president-address__id-86200340-77cb-496e-960d-124b398480aa"><!--a--></a>Not only do traditional
values deteriorate in countries or areas with mainly ethnic Chinese,
many other Asian countries also experienced disintegrating traditional
values. We need to learn from these experiences and try to avoid
similar problems in Singapore. We need to establish our own shared
values. I am pleased that the Ministry of Education announced last
month that they would re-emphasise the importance of values and character
building in schools. Thus, parents, schools, clan associations and
religious organisations must also play a more active role in preserving
and advocating our time-tested traditional values by working closely
with community organisations.</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-fc807ce5-739b-4905-8a2e-04cb96b81761"><!--a--></a>	Mr Speaker, Sir, I would
like to proceed to the next topic on housing policies. We have done
well by providing affordable housing for our citizens. Home ownership
is the pillar of our country's success. Many countries and the United
Nations have sent representatives to study our public housing. During
my weekly house visits, many older blue-collar workers, such as
factory workers and taxi drivers, lamented that they used to be
able to pay their 5-room HDB housing loan in less than 20 years
but now, their graduate children could hardly afford a 4-room flat.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-555ed4c9-7f26-44ad-bae3-31379a3eada0">
                  <a name="president-address__id-555ed4c9-7f26-44ad-bae3-31379a3eada0"><!--a--></a>Currently, prices of new
HDB flats are largely influenced by that of resale flats in the open
market. In recent years, resale flat prices have risen sharply,
perhaps due to the increasing housing demand of new immigrants.
To ensure that more young couples and first-time flat buyers can
afford their new flats, the Government could consider lowering the
price of new 3- and 4-room flats or provide more subsidies. Those
who want to buy flats with higher subsidies will have to meet more
stringent criteria, such as longer minimum occupation period of,
say, 15 years as compared to the current five years. Otherwise,
buyers of such flats will have to return the additional subsidies
if they sell their flats between five to 15 years of occupation.
Such scheme could help to stabilise the prices of new 3-4 room HDB
flats.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-078b04b5-bb41-4e62-be19-7deba4c4b6fe">
                  <a name="president-address__id-078b04b5-bb41-4e62-be19-7deba4c4b6fe"><!--a--></a>Many Singaporeans merely
consider their HDB flat to serve as a roof over their head rather
than use it as a means to encash and earn quick profit. At the same
time, they also do not want to become a slave to their house and
spend their entire working life paying off the housing loan. This
type of highly subsidised flats with more stringent requirements
can then serve their needs. Those who prefer to encash their flats
after five years will have to pay the current price and accept the
existing requirements. Our housing policy is the jewel of Government's
policies. I hope the Government can review the housing policy so
that more people can afford their new flats. </p>

issue that is close to my heart is special education. In his speech,
the President said that we need to "seek inclusive growth that benefits
all citizens, not just a lucky few". He also said that "we want
a fair and just society that ensures the well-being of every citizen;
a gracious and compassionate community whose members care for one
another." I am heartened to see that Ministry of Education has increased
its funding to Special Education (SPED) schools over the past five
years. However, there is still a gap between what has been achieved
against the expectation. The number of students who could find meaningful
employment after graduating from SPED schools has not increased
substantially. </p>

to attend a seminar on special education. The seminar was attended
by more than 10 SPED school principals to discuss about the vision
for special education. Most of these educators would like the Government
to form a single entity to manage all the 20 SPED schools in Singapore.
Other "helping hands" can still provide assistance in their areas
of specialties. This is not an issue about subsidy. Special Education
practitioners hope that this new entity can help to develop a standard curriculum
and tighten the quality requirements for Special Education. In contrast,
the current policy direction is to "let a hundred flowers bloom"
and thus, different management boards of SPED schools tend to have
differing visions and expectations of their students. As a result,
we observe that the quality of education provided by the various
SPED schools also differs significantly.</p>

practitioners aspire to have a single entity to manage all the SPED
schools, why is the Government so reluctant to form one? We hope
the Government can implement more proactive policies to improve
the quality of special education so that more SPED school graduates
could be meaningfully employed and become self-reliant.</p>

Sir, please allow me to present my next topic on tertiary education

polytechnic graduates tell me that they have the desire to upgrade
themselves or are already taking part-time degree courses. This
is a good sign and inevitable as we encourage life-long learning.</p>

makes it to the local universities. As reported in <em class="ph i">The Straits

undergraduate courses at the three local universities and SIT. At
the same time, the Council for Private Education said that as at
31 December 2010, there were about 41,100 Singaporeans studying
for undergraduate courses at private institutions. Meanwhile, we
also have full, or almost full employment. This means that our current
job market can sustain a significantly higher number of graduates
than what the local universities can produce. As Singapore gears
itself towards a knowledge-based economy, we would probably need
more graduates, not less.</p>

Could we not consider extending Government subsidy to offset the
tuition fees of other reputable local private universities so that
more Singaporeans who embark on continuous education can enjoy similar benefits?
I understand that Minister of State Mr Lawrence Wong is chairing
a committee to look into expanding university places for Singaporeans.
I hope he can take the above suggestions into consideration. </p>

topic is transport. Let me declare my interest in this industry as
I am a Vice President in SBS Transit. Much has been said about the
public transport model in and outside this House. Let me recount
one experience I had in Taiwan last year about its public bus service.
I was at a bus stop along a major road in Taipei at about 10 o'clock
in the morning. I observed that the bus services were very frequent.
Every five minutes or so, there was a bus of the same service passing
by the bus stop with about five to 10 passengers on board each bus.
I reckoned that the passengers on board the buses were happy as
they could easily find a seat. The bus driver was probably also equally
happy as he did not have to carry many passengers and risk passengers' complaints.
The bus company was also probably happy if it was paid the same
for the trips operated regardless of the number of passengers on
board the bus like the bus operators in London. </p>

subsidising the bus company would unlikely be happy as it was not
the best use of resources. Mother Earth is also not happy as more than
necessary carbon is emitted. At the same time, we recognise that
the frequency of bus services during off-peak hours cannot be too
low. Otherwise, it will come with a social cost. People still need
connectivity. On the other hand, we know that market forces are
the best way to allocate resources efficiently based on supply and
demand. What then is the balance? </p>

listed companies running public transport services. However, the
public transport operators (PTOs) are tightly regulated. Unlike
other service industries such as supermarket or telecommunication
companies, the PTOs cannot fix the selling price or the public transport
fare in this context. The PTOs are subjected to the strict regime
of Quality of Service (QoS) to ensure that the minimum service standards
are adhered to. Within such a framework, the Government and the shareholders
expect the public listed PTOs to make a profit so that resources
are best allocated, wastages are minimised and at the same time,
the PTOs are able to pay for asset replacement. What then is the
acceptable level of profit? </p>

sensitive matter even if it means a two-cent adjustment. Maybe we
can take a leaf from Hong Kong. Many consider Hong Kong's train
and bus services to be very efficient and they are also provided
for by public listed companies. The Hong Kong government allows
PTOs to raise fare only when the rate of return on average net fixed
asset falls below a pre-determined level. If the rate of return
on average net fixed asset exceeds a certain rate that was determined
by the government, the PTOs have to share 50% of the profit in excess
of the pre-determined rate with the commuters. The PTOs are allowed
to keep the remaining profit as an incentive for them to continue
to improve their productivity and increase non-fare revenue such
as advertising and rental revenue. </p>

look at this model and adapt it to our local context? It is for

Youth and Sports (Mdm Halimah Yacob)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, I rise to thank the President for his Address to this Parliament.
Listening to Mr Lee Yi Shyan and Mrs Lina Chiam, Sir, is actually
a study of speeches in contradiction. Mrs Chiam wanted the Government
to do more and more, for example, even ensuring that the prices
of meals in hawker centres are fixed, more subsidies in almost everything,
and even allowing singles to purchase flats once they reach the
age of 21 years. Mr Lee Yi Shyan reminded us that there are genuine
trade-offs. If we put more money in one area, we have to be prepared
to have less in other areas. Such is the reality of any government.
He had also pointed out the problems faced by governments that had
adopted the welfare state. At the end of the day, it is taxpayers who
are Singaporeans who have to pay for these expenditures. But this
does not mean that the Government has not been investing in social
protection measures. Indeed, our investment in health care, housing,
education and social assistance has increased over the years. For
example, subsidies for needy families with children in kindergarten
and childcare were just increased from a family with an income level
of $2,000 to $3,000 to families with income levels of $3,500, allowing
a significant number of families to benefit from these subsidies.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9a4b13d3-b3bf-4b4b-8cfb-689b94c68fb7">
                  <a name="president-address__id-9a4b13d3-b3bf-4b4b-8cfb-689b94c68fb7"><!--a--></a>Sir, in his speech, the
President also stressed that economic growth is basic to improving
our lives. But he also reminded us that growth is not an end in
itself. We seek quality and inclusive growth that benefits all citizens,
not just a lucky few. This same point was reiterated in a report
titled "Making Economic Growth More Pro-Poor: The Role of Employment
and Social Protection" released by the Organization for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD). It said that sustained economic growth,
in which poor women and men participate directly as both agents
and beneficiaries, is essential for reducing poverty. It also said
that employment and social protection are two critical avenues towards
achieving Pro-Poor Growth. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-874b1da9-405a-43e1-bf7f-ed44b783ccd9">
                  <a name="president-address__id-874b1da9-405a-43e1-bf7f-ed44b783ccd9"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, Sir, there is
no doubt that sustained strong economic growth is a pre-requisite
and a necessity, if we want to help the poor and the needy in our
society. Without growth, we will not have the means to support strong
investment in education, healthcare, housing and social assistance
programmes for all Singaporeans but more so for our low income so
that they, too, can benefit from our growth. In other words, our growth
pattern has been one where strong growth is supported by strong
social protection schemes to ensure inclusive growth and a balanced
development. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3b29ef9c-1b5e-4a8c-87e9-7eb1ca7993d4">

experience in the last recession was insightful. Singapore was one
of the fastest countries to emerge from the 2008 crisis because
we quickly put in place the Jobs Credit Scheme and the Skills Programme
for Upgrading and Resilience (SPUR). These were two very important
programmes that helped to minimise retrenchment, also helped workers
acquire better skills and companies to quickly ramp up when orders
started picking up. But we could not have done all that if we did
not have the reserves to tap on which were built up from previous
years of good economic growth.</p>

also agree with MPs that we have to be mindful of the potential divides
arising among us, particularly from the widening income gap and
a rapidly ageing population. On this point, I strongly welcome the
President's stress on the need to create good jobs for Singaporeans.
This is an important point, as there are jobs that are created specifically
in the services sector, that pay little, provide poor benefits and are
not quality jobs, which will continue to depress wage growth.</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-16e5a38a-cc46-4706-abd9-cce23bc072ff"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, Sir, even as
we continue to strengthen our social safety net, we should do this
in a way that would strengthen the resolve of those we help and
empower them. There is much that individuals and families can do
to improve their situation and we have to build on these strengths.
We empower those who need aid if we involve them in the solutions
and help them to have control over the decisions made to help them. Often,
the approach taken is as if these families are invalids and are
mere passive recipients of aid. But the many cases that I have come
across tell me that even those in need have something to contribute
and want to do so if they have the support. We should give them
that dignity and that support.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5a01c9c1-4a8c-48b0-ba17-062112e394e6">

our ComCare network which provides a very strong foundation to assist
families who are in need. But to be effective in helping the needy, we
must constantly review our social assistance policies and delivery
methods. For example, we had recently enhanced the Public Assistance
Scheme and ComCare Financial Assistance schemes for childcare and
kindergarten. But needs are never constant. New challenges and circumstances
develop and we need to ensure that our outreach and assistance schemes
are relevant and useful in meeting these new needs. We need to look
at three areas.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3346fe79-8d6c-4422-a9ce-bea2c13a699b">
                  <a name="president-address__id-3346fe79-8d6c-4422-a9ce-bea2c13a699b"><!--a--></a>First, like many MPs, I,
too, feel that it is important for us to ensure that those who need
help receive them. We also cannot ignore the needs of emerging groups
and those at the margins. Greater flexibility in providing assistance,
including supporting initiatives at the local level, which can be
more easily tailored and customised to local needs, are some of
the ways to address these needs.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-64284df7-be90-4129-af87-c9214609fab3">
                  <a name="president-address__id-64284df7-be90-4129-af87-c9214609fab3"><!--a--></a>Second, in providing assistance
for the needy, we should also strive for a no-wrong-door policy,
meaning that those in need will get the help regardless of which
door they go through. We recognise that our needy sometimes do not
know where to turn to for help, and it is often frustrating to be
referred to multiple agencies, or worse, to fall through the cracks.
We need better coordination among the various touchpoint agencies that
are serving our needy. The focus is to better integrate the service
delivery, placing the needy at the heart of our policy design and
service delivery. To do this, we will continue to leverage on existing
platforms, such as the ComCare Local Network. Such networks encourage
social service agencies to deliver complementary services and share
ideas and experiences to serve the needy more holistically and effectively.
We will better synchronise our assistance to the needy through closer
partnership with key touchpoints agencies, such as the CDCs, FSCs,
CCCs, as well as the larger community. Our grassroots leaders and
volunteers play a critical role in this regard, through their knowledge
of and ties with their residents. Together, those efforts will help
us move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach to one which is more
family-centric and flexible, to better serve the needs of at-risk
families.</p>

at how better to measure our outcomes beyond just the numbers, so
that we have a more comprehensive indication of how we have helped families.
We should also start measuring how families have managed to stand
on their own two feet as indicators. We will work closely with our
agencies delivering the services to the needy to develop these indicators
to ensure the outcome that we want to achieve. We will also need
more research and data to assist us in such strategic planning.</p>

we review our social safety net in the longer term, our concern
is also over the short-term challenges that may arise from the deteriorating global
economy. From our experience during the previous downturn, we understand
the serious impact brought about by an economic recession on low-income
and needy families. Let me share with the House what we will be
doing to step up assistance where needed.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b8823882-b0f1-4ffe-8212-a6aba53d95ef">
                  <a name="president-address__id-b8823882-b0f1-4ffe-8212-a6aba53d95ef"><!--a--></a>First, we will refine our
ComCare schemes to help those affected by the downturn. For example,
for families that need more time to get back on their feet, we can
be flexible in providing a longer period of assistance. Second,
we will allocate more resources to the CDCs, which interact directly
with and also provide other forms of local assistance to the needy
on the ground. Like the last recession, we can provide assistance
packages to Singaporeans through the CDCs to help them tide over
the difficult times. Third, Sir, we can give more funding and support
to social service agencies such as the FSCs to cope with the potential
increase in workload and potential drop in charity dollars.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-538f775c-3352-42f9-bf41-ec232bc44240">
                  <a name="president-address__id-538f775c-3352-42f9-bf41-ec232bc44240"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday,
many MPs also spoke about the important role of families, particularly
in providing support to the frail elderly in our community. I agree with
them that our families are and should always remain a core pillar
of support. But I have also seen how families struggle to take care
of their frail elderly or disabled members. With an ageing population
and smaller families, the pressures on caregivers will escalate
and the Government should provide more support to families, otherwise we
will need more hospitals and nursing homes or we will see more neglected
elderly. I also agree with other hon. MPs that this is not the way
to treat our elderly who have given so much to build up Singapore.
We do not want to see them spend the twilight years of their lives
in institutions cared for by strangers and away from their loved
ones.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-008538ce-a670-4020-bef9-8b70d80d1d8d">
                  <a name="president-address__id-008538ce-a670-4020-bef9-8b70d80d1d8d"><!--a--></a>So, our caregivers need
more holistic support to reduce the financial, emotional and physical
stress on them. One critical area that we need to look at is how
to provide more accessible home-care and community-based services
for the elderly. This is one sector that is under-developed and
under-resourced. We need a seamless continuum of health and social
home and community support services to help our elderly age in place. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-26851177-00f9-45e3-8aa6-1e1f957a6e99">
                  <a name="president-address__id-26851177-00f9-45e3-8aa6-1e1f957a6e99"><!--a--></a>Let me just come to the
next point. Well, Sir, to do so, it would be useful for us to look at
the subsidies for home-based care, something that I have also spoken
on in previous sessions of Parliament. The way our health care subsidies
are structured today encourages families to put their frail elderly
in institutions, as they get a higher level of subsidy. Therefore,
it is important that we take a closer look at this and explore providing more
subsidies for home-based care, if we truly want to ensure ageing
in place for our elderly. We also need more accessible and affordable
medical, nursing and physiotherapy services at home.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 170</p>

is not well-provided for today is respite care for caregivers, which
seeks to relieve the stresses of caregiving and support their well-being.
Often we focus so much on the frail elderly that we forgot about
the needs and well-being of those taking care of them. Increasingly,
these caregivers are also ageing and are in need of medical care
themselves. I am glad to say, Sir, that this is one area in MCYS
that I am working on, in partnership with the Ministry of Health
and we are exploring a range of solutions to support care at home
and in the community. This includes assistive technology and home
modification. We will also look into expanding the range of structured
caregiver training programmes to meet the diverse needs of families.</p>

I feel that there is a gap between what our Government is doing
and the perceptions on the ground. The Government feels that it
is doing a lot and indeed it is doing so much more than other governments
in taking care of its people, a positive feedback which I get all
the time when I meet people at the International Labour Organization
(ILO). Yet, Singaporeans feel that we are not doing enough or do not
care enough. This gap has arisen not only because of the social
media. It has been building up for some time and I feel that one
of the problems could be because of the way we are communicating
with the people. </p>

well why certain options cannot work because it has thought through
the issues thoroughly and this Government does not believe in making promises
that it cannot fulfil. But to the public, the Government's message
may come across as dismissive and uncaring. The public today is
also asking for more information and greater transparency. The step
taken by the Ministry of Manpower recently in sharing some labour-related
information that was not previously released is a step in the right
direction. Previously, when such information is not revealed, for
example, the unemployment rate of citizens, it led to all kinds
of bizarre speculations, which over time people began to believe
is the truth. I feel that we need to find a better way to communicate,
and be prepared to share more information so that in this way we
could also help people to understand issues better, and to debate
in a rational, informed and balanced manner. Overall, this would
result in a positive outcome of a more mature and engaged relationship

I would like to present three matters concerning Malay families.
First, we should not regard Malay families as weak or brittle. In
fact, to me, Malay families are now in a stronger and better position
compared to the past. Family ties are also strong. For example,
there are Malay families who rent buses just for the purpose of
visiting one another during the <em class="ph i">Hari Raya</em> season. Many parents
are now putting emphasis on their children's education and make
the necessary provisions to meet their children's education needs.
In addition, the number of Malay families who send their elderly parents
to nursing homes is small. This is because they believe that the
responsibility of taking care of parents will bring blessings to
the family.</p>

are also increasingly aware of the initiatives being done by Malay/Muslim
bodies through the Community Leaders' Forum. They truly appreciate these
noble efforts. I daresay that every week, Malay MPs are usually
invited to attend events organised by Malay/Muslim bodies or attend
to show support to specific programmes especially for the Malay
community.</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-bd271a0d-eaf3-41ed-8977-a65eb5e31576"><!--a--></a>MCYS also implements many
programmes to assist and empower Malay families through Marriage
Central or the National Family Council. There are also programmes
for Malay families like the marriage preparation courses called <em class="ph i">Bersama
Mu</em>. The programmes at the Inspiration Hub aims to help young
couples who wish to get married, while <em class="ph i">Vista Sakinah</em> provides
a comprehensive service to couples who wish to re-marry, as well
as those with step-children.</p>

contributed to family stability for the past few years. We will
continue these efforts. I would like to share an example that can
be an inspiration to everyone. I was invited to attend a scholarship
presentation ceremony at the <em class="ph i">Darul Ihsan</em> Orphanage two weeks
ago. For the first time, <em class="ph i">Darul Ihsan</em> provided a scholarship
worth $6,000 to an engineering undergraduate from NUS, Mr Ahmad
Haider Bagesher. His father was a taxi driver who passed away. Both
his sisters are studying in NIE. I asked Ahmad Haider what was the
main factor for his success. He said that the factor is family support.
Ahmed Haider's mother is a housewife.</p>

though we have achieved so much, we can still continue the efforts
to empower families − with the support of the Government and strong cooperation
from each member of our community. One major area is early education
for the first five years of a child.</p>

centre in San Francisco and an agency that promotes early childhood
development. What this agency does is to identify children from
at-risk families and work together with the community and respective
families to monitor the child's development. The development of
that child is monitored by a paediatrician or other experts so that
the child will grow up in a stimulating environment.</p>

this area and am interested to work with community organisations
to develop a similar project for at-risk families in our community.
I am confident that this project has potential to help children
of a similar profile here.</p>

end by giving an example of an individual, Mr Abdul Rahman Mahmood,
who managed to overcome many obstacles to improve his family's fate.
Mr Abdul Rahman sought help as he faced difficulties to pay for
basic necessities that are in arrears as he did not have a stable
job. With the help of the North East Community Development Council,
he was registered under the Work Support Programme while his five-
year-old son received the Kindergarten Financial Assistance Scheme.
Through these programmes, he was able to upgrade his skills while
the needs of his children were given attention. I am pleased to
share with Members that Mr Abdul Rahman now has a stable job as
a technician and is able to take home a salary of about $1,800 a
month. I praise the resilience of Mr Abdul Rahman and his determination
to stand on his own feet. His commitment to fulfil the needs of
the present day and the future of his family should be an example
to the community.</p>

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in resounding support of the Motion of thanks
to the President for his speech. The President has called for us
to work together to give all Singaporeans a better life and a brighter
tomorrow, and notes that this vision is predicated on continued
economic growth but equally he warns us that growth is not an end
in itself and that furthermore this growth that we strive for should be
of a high quality and it should be inclusive.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8955f3e5-5dac-4332-8ca5-9c25a981410f">
                  <a name="president-address__id-8955f3e5-5dac-4332-8ca5-9c25a981410f"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, Sir, to many
of us, inclusive growth may simply mean an equitable share by all
citizens in the country's prosperity but inclusive growth is really
much more than that. It also denotes a model of economic growth
that favours the creation of equal opportunities for employment
rather than just a system of wealth redistribution. This is achieved
by the provision of an adequate framework of enablers such as quality education,
housing, healthcare that is accessible to each and every one of
us. Wealth redistribution alone will ultimately fail to equalise
incomes and reduce inequality. The Government in its wisdom has
been pursuing such a policy for many years and our people have benefited
from this vision of economic development, a vision which some less
than enlightened governments are now beginning to embrace. However,
in a rapidly changing and growing economy like ours, despite our
best efforts to equalise the playing field, the more nimble amongst
us will sprint ahead and some of us may be left breathless.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8bee2e48-63a6-47fb-897c-e83847698f27">
                  <a name="president-address__id-8bee2e48-63a6-47fb-897c-e83847698f27"><!--a--></a> Do we then slow the pace
of the race so that everyone can keep up? That would seem ideal
but other teams in this global foot race may rush ahead of us and
falling down the finishing order may not be very pleasant for us
at all. The villain of the piece it seems to me is not economic
growth in itself but rather how it reaches different segments of
our society. I welcome the recent remarks by my Parliamentary and
GRC colleague Mr Chan Chun Sing who spoke on wide-ranging measures
that his Ministry intends to introduce to strengthen our social
safety net and, in particular, the renewed focus on families who are
at risk and the efforts to champion the family man. I was further
heartened by Dr Amy Khor's remarks yesterday about the need to beef
up welfare assistance. However, we are all well aware of this. There
are still many families who continued to struggle financially in
spite of the many helping hands that are available to them.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-255db832-9b10-47ca-8571-d15c253d638f">
                  <a name="president-address__id-255db832-9b10-47ca-8571-d15c253d638f"><!--a--></a> For my work with financially
troubled families, both within my constituency of Queenstown and
elsewhere, I sense that in our country many families fall into economic difficulties
not because the system has denied them the opportunity to provide
for themselves but often because of a specific catastrophic and
often unexpected trigger such as business failure, indebtedness
of various causes, debilitating illnesses, incarceration or divorce.
Various assistance schemes, whether governmental or voluntary, mainly
help to keep the families or the heads of these families above water rather
than to propel them gently towards the shore. The risk with this
mainly supportive approach is that many families may, in fact, become
entangled in a poverty trap that may slowly spiral into a cycle
of poverty which succeeding generations will find themselves difficult
to extricate themselves from.</p>

long recognised that for most illnesses early and aggressive intervention
is often the best way to effect a complete cure, reduce complications
or the very least facilitate good long-term control of the condition.
I think that some military strategists and business leaders will
also expound a similar philosophy. Similarly, I hope that this Government
in all its wisdom would consider implementing even more targeted,
even more aggressive but yet calibrated measures to assist this
group of highly vulnerable families that have fallen on hard times.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9190345f-4c5f-4299-84e1-de164bc2b229">
                  <a name="president-address__id-9190345f-4c5f-4299-84e1-de164bc2b229"><!--a--></a>Sir, there is a constant
debate about what should be the ideal size of Government. How big
or how small should Government be. Meaning to what extent should
the State directly intervene and provide for its citizens. The arguments
for and against big government are well known to us. Big government
provides greater security for its citizens from all manner of traps,
be it economic or social. But they come at a high cost, not only
physically but also in regard to a perceived diminution in active
citizenship. Many governments that have advocated smaller governments
in the past have often ended with the contrary, due to political
pressures and they are now finding it increasingly difficult to
afford such largesse as we are now witnessing in the physical tribulations
of many Western economies.</p>

a partnership between the Government and citizens to address a whole
spectrum of social challenges. We, as a country, have always been mindful
of the trap of welfare but in an increasing globalised world with
ever more capricious economic cycles, perhaps this Government will
have to be big wherever and whenever it needs to be. For those stricken
families I spoke about earlier, a more direct, perhaps more comprehensive,
and a more generous aid package should be offered as early as possible
and continue until they are out of harm's way. But the Government need
not be alone in this and neither does assistance always have to
be in the form of a handout. In fact, many of these families have
indicated to me that they were willing to and able to pay back the
sum of money that they needed to get back on their feet, only that
there was nowhere to turn to for this sort of financial aid. Just
to give some examples, one elderly couple whose son has just gone
to prison was trying to save their son's flat. The husband was still
working but needed a short-term loan to pay off some debts and arrears,
a loan that they needed and could well pay back given time but which they
could not get. Another young woman has just delivered a beautiful
baby girl when her husband suddenly left and despite maximum assistance
from the various agencies, she was still unable to provide optimally
for herself and her children. She would have appreciated a small
loan to get herself and her family back more quickly on their feet
and she intended to go back to work as soon as her baby was a little
bit older. Hopefully, in the new hawker centre that I am hoping
the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources will strongly
consider building at the Strathmore-Dawson areas in Queenstown.</p>

previously called for micro-finance schemes to be considered, with
the support of Government, and I would urge this Government to consider
a similar approach not just to start businesses but rather for community support
and social enterprises. The concept of a community social bank is
not new and has met with some success in other countries. Such a
community bank could either directly help needy families by providing
short-term and small loans above what our social safety net can
normally provide or indirectly by funding social enterprises that perform
such functions. Commercial banks can help to capitalise such a community bank
and also provide volunteer staff to ensure that it is run efficiently
and professionally. </p>

                  </span>.] Sir,
I now move on to another area that I believe would benefit from
further calibration, and that is healthcare. As both a provider
and consumer of healthcare, I can honestly say we have a world-class
system in most respects. The challenge as always is to maintain quality
without sacrificing affordability. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ebc2f42f-3bfa-4381-a4fb-70f79c4190c7">

by the recent measures announced by the Ministry of Health which
will further improve the delivery of quality and affordable healthcare
to our people, focusing on health promotion, disease prevention
and out-of-hospital care. Our "3Ms" of Medisave, MediShield and
Medifund provide comprehensive financial cover for most Singaporeans
while still encouraging individual responsibility for healthcare costs,
but some vulnerable groups remain. </p>

worried about the cost of medical care, and this worry grows as
they grow older. Studies show that the majority of our lifetime
healthcare expenditure occurs in the last decade or so of our life,
and the very elderly in particular consume a disproportionately
high quantity of medical care. Many of my residents and patients
have asked me, "Dr Chia, the elderly get a special discount when
taking the bus or MRT, why not for medical care?" </p>

request. Presently, the elderly receive the same amount of healthcare
subsidies as younger patients in most areas. I hope that further
provisions can be made to help buffer the elderly and their carers
from healthcare costs, above and beyond the "3Ms". For instance,
above and beyond existing subsidies, certain treatments and investigations
could be given a stepped level of additional rebates according to
the patient's age. </p>

an appreciation of the unique and increased healthcare needs of
the more elderly. It would also be a way of respectfully acknowledging
the contributions of our more elderly Singaporeans to the building
of our nation.</p>

since our inception, have always been focused on the search for
future drivers of economic growth, the next big thing, and with
good reason. I would also urge that we pay equal attention to the
search for drivers of social growth. I put to this House that the
search for engines of social growth is as challenging, if not more
so, than our quest for economic expansion. Where and what are these
engines of social and community development that will crystalise
our identity as one people, diverse yet united, pragmatic yet aspirational?

to yesterday's debate which I enjoyed very much, I myself have also
read with some amusement about how some countries have been trying
to measure the happiness of their people, which is an entirely honourable
pursuit, I am sure. But, perhaps, what it says is that modern societies
find that the present language of expressing national well-being
is inadequate. Still, as a young nation, we ourselves are trying
hard to define ourselves, but the vocabulary remains a little offbeat.
But, surely, we do not need just words or an elaborately constructed
index to tell us who we are or what we want. Perhaps, once we have
food on our tables and a roof over our heads, what defines us a
nation becomes more about how we care for each other, how we relate
to each other, how we look after the less fortunate, and generally
how we decide to lead our lives. Just as the relationship between
the people and the Government should not become merely a transactional
one, so too must our relationship to each other to avoid the trap
of mere civility and disinterest. We have to constantly find ways
to grow our social capital, to strengthen our resolve, to work together
towards a shared understanding of what our country means to us.</p>

not so much by cheering but by tears from our leaders, since the
challenges faced by our young nation then would have been seen insurmountable
to most. The challenges facing us today seem equally fluid, told
of a different complexion. Some countries are lamenting that entire
generations have become lost due to missed opportunities and a lack
of a shared purpose. We must avoid this at all cost and be resolute
that our generation finds itself and embraces the wealth of opportunities available
to build a better life and a better future for each and every one
of us. On this note, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to reaffirm my
steadfast support of the Motion of thanks.</p>

Member)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker, thank you for giving me the
opportunity to make this, my maiden speech to this House. In his address
to Parliament, the President gave a broad outline of this Government's
goals for the next five years. The Government says it wants "every
Singaporean worker to hold a skilled, well-paid job; every family
to live in an affordable, comfortable home; every young person to
develop himself fully and pursue his dreams; every senior citizen
to stay active and to live with dignity". These are bold goals which
my colleagues and I in the Workers' Party will hold the Government
accountable for over the next five years.</p>

to focus on three areas that many senior citizens, families and workers
have pressing concerns about. They are healthcare, public housing
and public transport. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c4ba80ca-7e0d-4c35-b921-6edb46fc8abf">
                  <a name="president-address__id-c4ba80ca-7e0d-4c35-b921-6edb46fc8abf"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, the axiom, "it's
better to die than to fall ill in Singapore" has been heard time
and again, I believe, at least twice in this debate. Many Singaporeans,
especially the poor, worry greatly about falling ill. They are concerned
not just about the painful treatment they will have to go through
but more often about the high costs involved, and the financial
burden that may place on their already struggling children. In Singapore, Government
subsidies make up only a quarter of total health expenditure. Out-of-pocket expenses,
employer benefits and private insurance make up most of the remainder.
The much-vaunted "3Ms" of Medisave, MediShield and Medifund pay
for less than 10% of total healthcare expenses, the lion's share
of which comes from Medisave, which is really patients' own savings.
MediShield is a self-funding insurance scheme, which members pay
premiums to join. These premiums rise as they grow older. They also have
to fork out large deductibles and co-insurance before receiving
pay-outs, and the coverage ends at age 85. </p>

that we have Medifund. But Medifund is subject to extremely stringent
means testing and disbursements are not exactly generous. In 2009, an
average of $1,029 was given to less than 24,000 inpatient Medifund
applicants. This represented just 5% of total hospital admissions
that year.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d349c7f1-03be-421c-944c-6768e8525b94">
                  <a name="president-address__id-d349c7f1-03be-421c-944c-6768e8525b94"><!--a--></a>For seniors with no income
and little savings, the burden of healthcare is shifted to their
children. In 2005, 60% of the elderly had their medical bills paid
from their adult children's Medisave accounts. This is a very high
percentage and is, in fact, a departure from the principle of "self-reliance".
If these patients' children are also low-income earners − as is
often the case − the Government is merely shifting the burden of
poverty within the pool of the poor. Basically, we are asking one
disadvantaged group to pay for another.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f5a05492-97be-4db8-b526-beccd6457ac9">
                  <a name="president-address__id-f5a05492-97be-4db8-b526-beccd6457ac9"><!--a--></a>The Government seems very
reluctant to take on a larger financial burden for caring of our
senior citizens. Instead, it hides behind the mantras of self-reliance
and filial piety to justify its relatively low expenditure on healthcare
for the elderly. Self-reliance is good in principle, but when a
patient has exhausted his own savings and has to rely on his own
struggling family members, then we, as a society, are not being
fair to both the patient and his family.</p>

to provide universal health coverage to citizens, but I believe
we are still some way from that. The World Health Organization defines universal
health coverage as having a healthcare financing system that provides
all people with access to adequate healthcare services without suffering
financial hardship paying for them. </p>

goal, we need to expand the coverage of MediShield and reduce the
over-reliance on direct payments by patients at the time they need
the care. To fund this, we need to strengthen the current forms
of pre-payments and risk-pooling, and provide assistance to those
who cannot afford the premiums, like housewives and the elderly.
All these point to a need to perform major surgery on MediShield.</p>

now, our public hospitals have been running at near full capacity,
with bed occupancy rates often exceeding 90% for Tan Tock Seng Hospital
and over 85% for National University Hospital. Khoo Teck Puat Hospital,
which opened just last year, was supposed to ease the crunch. But
it too has been running at almost 85% capacity for the past months.
The Royal College of Surgeons in the United Kingdom has advised
that bed occupancy rates above 82% put patients at an increased
risk of infection.</p>

                  <em class="ph i">Straits
Times</em> on 20 August this year that hospitals in Singapore are
facing such a severe crunch in beds that some are "borrowing" space
from other nearby organisations to house their patients. How did
we get into such a situation? Between the year 2000 and 2010, our
population has seen an increase of 26%, mostly through immigration.
The number of hospital admissions has seen an increase of 15% in
the same period. However, not only has the number of hospital beds
not kept pace with population growth, but it has actually decreased
during this period. In the past decade, there had been a 7% drop
in the number of public sector hospital beds, according to the Department
of Statistics.</p>

Health Minister admitted that, on hindsight, his Ministry made a
mistake by not building a new hospital two years earlier. Recently,
the Health Minister floated the idea of bringing forward the opening
of Sengkang Hospital, currently scheduled for 2020. I support this
move, but this is still a long time to wait, and by that time, our
population would have increased even more.</p>

is why this self-proclaimed "far-sighted" Government failed in the
last 10 years to build our healthcare infrastructure to keep pace
with population growth and an ageing population. Was the Government
instead fixated on the near-sighted goals of boosting economic growth
by increasing our population?</p>

like to address many Singaporeans' concerns about the public housing
situation in Singapore. In the past 10 years, the HDB had grossly
under-supplied new housing units to the market. According to figures
from the HDB, between 2001 and 2009, an average of just 7,700 new
flats was built each year. This was far short of the average annual
resident household growth figure of 24,280 since 2005. Even when the
population surged from 2007 onwards, because of the liberalisation
of our immigration policies, the Government failed to react by building
more flats for our people. Instead, they permitted more cash-rich
foreigners to purchase almost any types of private property, which
increased their prices and pulled up the HDB flat prices, since the
two are linked. This combination of low supply and high demand resulted
in a severe housing shortage, causing a sharp and sustained rise
in property prices. HDB resale flat prices are now 92% higher than
they were 10 years ago. This has not only caused much distress for
many Singaporean families but has also created potential asset bubble which
could severely damage Singapore's economy in a downturn. </p>

from its slumber this year and ramped up the supply of Build-to-Order
(BTO) flats to an expected 25,000 this year and another 25,000 next year.
This is a move in the right direction. However, BTO flats do not
solve the immediate housing problem, because it takes up to two
to three years before the new flat owners get their keys. In the
meantime, many are still without a home of their own.</p>

of BTO and Sale of Balance Flats this year, we still saw the third-quarter
HDB Retail Price Index shoot up 3.8% over the previous quarter.
The cooling measures that the Ministry of National Development put
in place earlier this year do not seem to be having their intended
effects on the resale flat market. </p>

some way in reducing the housing problem for first-timer couples,
but not for singles, divorcees and those who need to downgrade to
smaller flats because of financial difficulty. We need to find a
way to help these people who are caught in between the policies.
In particular, more measures need to be put in place to cool down
the resale HDB flat market. The HDB market, whether direct or resale,
cannot simply be left to market forces. As a provider of this public
good, the Government must step in to ensure that the welfare of
its citizens comes first. </p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-78035203-3744-4bd1-88b8-331e60570a54"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, please allow
me to share some longstanding concerns about public transport in
Singapore. In March this year, just before the General Election
was announced, SMRT and SBS Transit said they would add 590 additional
MRT train trips. This was expected to ease the squeeze on trains.
However, many regular commuters will testify that the trains now
seem even more crowded than ever. The recently-opened Circle Line
may improve the situation nearer the city, but for those commuting
from the suburbs like Sembawang and Simei, finding room to board
the trains will still be a challenge. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 178</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d12286ed-fa00-45b6-ad80-2ee3ab42aef2">
                  <a name="president-address__id-d12286ed-fa00-45b6-ad80-2ee3ab42aef2"><!--a--></a>One key factor that affects
the train loads is the waiting time. I understand that the current
signalling systems on the ageing North-South and East-West lines
allow for maximum train arrival intervals of about two minutes without
compromising commuter safety. But if the trains really arrive once
every two minutes, the overcrowding problem would not be so severe.
Unfortunately, this is seldom the case. Outside of the narrow window
of about half an hour on weekday mornings and evenings, the frequency
drops to three to five minutes, or even more. This results in trains
arriving packed with passengers, making it impossible for many of
those on the platform to board. As a daily commuter myself, I often
have to wait two, sometimes three, trains to pass by before I can
board, during the morning and evening rush hours. </p>

serious about encouraging our people to drive less and use more
public transport, it must give priority to tackling the overcrowding
problem on trains. The solution lies not only in building more lines
but making better use of existing lines by increasing train frequency
and maintaining that frequency for longer periods, especially during
peak periods. Why can the MRT operators not maintain a train interval of
two minutes from, let us say, 7.00 am to 9.00 am, and from 5.00
pm to 8.00 pm? Is it because of technical constraints, or is it
because it would increase their costs and reduce their profits? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c0dad39e-0cf9-434a-9aca-65fe99dfe99d">
                  <a name="president-address__id-c0dad39e-0cf9-434a-9aca-65fe99dfe99d"><!--a--></a>Under the current profit-maximising
model, operators are incentivised to cut costs and service levels
just to maintain their high margins. Their duopoly position in the
local market reinforces this behaviour. It is time for the Government
to demand that these operators provide a higher level of service
to commuters, even if it reduces their profit margins. </p>

public housing or public transport, the Government has gone too
far down the road of pursuing free market efficiency, often to the
detriment of the elderly and low-wage workers. At the time when
our citizens are exposed to heightened risks in the form of global
competition, increased economic volatility, rising inequality and
wage stagnation, the Government is exposing them to more competition
from foreigners. Our workers are told to be "cheaper, better, faster", more
self-reliant and less selective about their jobs. This regressive
transfer of risks from Government to citizens must count as one
of the PAP Government's biggest policy failures in the last decade. </p>

dawn of a new era in the history of our nation. The phrase "new

with more Workers' Party members in Parliament, some pundits wonder

Will we help to build our country, or be obsessed with tearing down
our political opponents? I believe this is related to a concern
raised by <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">Mr Lee Yi

MPs does not change our rational and responsible approach to politics.
We want to be a force for good in this country − to help uncover solutions,
not to add to the problems. However, it takes two hands to clap.
The responsibility for ensuring fair and constructive debates, in
and out of this House, rests not only on the Opposition but also
on the Government. I hope the debates in this House will not just
be about winning the argument or scoring political points, but leveraging on
the arguments, and counter-arguments, to elicit better policy outcomes.
This will ultimately benefit Singaporeans who put us here to serve
them. </p>

I am always very delighted, or I would say heartened, that people
can send us messages to highlight certain individuals − old lady
or old man − who are hawking around with tissue papers. How do we
approach it? We do not give them a fine. We send officers down to
talk to them, and see what they need. In fact, just last week, I
received another message through Facebook that highlighted that
there was this lady selling tissue papers and needed help. Immediately, we
sent our officers there, talk to the lady and see what she needs.
And it turned out that she needed some financial assistance and
so, we helped her. </p>

daily issues </span>– healthcare, transport, housing. While
there could be planning and forecasting in the past, but who can
predict the right number between demand and supply so accurately?
And it is always a challenge to always find the optimal balance.
And as the Member <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">Mr
Lee Yi Shyan</span> has also mentioned, there are a lot of trade-offs.
But, nevertheless, with the issues that we face today, there are
a lot of different policy announcements that have come out after
the 2011 General Elections. Most notably, one of those that really
interests me is healthcare. That is because in my own constituency,
I do have a polyclinic and I do understand it is crowded. But I
think the Ministry of Health has also made certain announcements.
There were three major ones: community health centre which actually
deals with partnering the community to provide health screening
efforts, Primary Care Partnership Schemes, family medicine clinics.
I think all these are policies and measures to help bring healthcare
nearer to the community to ensure that they do not crowd into a
centralised area. Personally for me, within my constituency and
district, we have the intent to set up community health screening
centres to help our constituency out there. So, these are policies
put in place to help the situation. It is not that the Government
has done nothing about it. There are things being done right now.
I would suggest that we be patient, and I agree with the Member, <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">Mr Gerald Giam, that we
have to be constructive and, hopefully, with all these robust debates
we can come up with a good solution for all. </span>

                  <a name="president-address__id-45e1e46d-da82-4005-81a1-e7b960e1d9e0"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, Sir, let me
come back to what I had wanted to speak on. I believe the President's
Address touches on inclusiveness and realising dreams for ourselves,
our family and our country. It was also especially inspiring when
the President set the direction for Singapore to be a place where
"we dare to dream, because dreams can come true". The President's
Address really is quite similar to the story of Singapore and the
journey ahead for Singapore itself. And this journey ahead for Singapore
is really quite close to what I want to speak about today because
this journey has more similarities than differences for entrepreneurship
and businesses in Singapore. And these words cannot be more true
and encouraging for anyone taking that leap of faith into business
through unchartered waters as an entrepreneur. As encouraging as
it may sound, there is much to be done for local businesses and
tackling head-on the difficult task of changing mindsets and culture
on entrepreneurship. So, today, my speech will revolve around realising
the dreams in a risk-adverse culture through the journey of an entrepreneur. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8f3b5c89-4714-4bb8-aac4-5a65f87b632d">
                  <a name="president-address__id-8f3b5c89-4714-4bb8-aac4-5a65f87b632d"><!--a--></a>Singapore started as an
entrepot for entrepreneurs. So, you see skyscrapers, large buildings,
big companies. These are businesses started years before Singapore€˜s Independence
and, in recent years, we have also done much to develop the entrepreneurial
spirit. And I think I should give the credit to some of the individuals
here, the office-holders, like the founding chairman of ACE (Action
Community for Entreprenuers), Mr Raymond Lim; <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and
Mr Lee Yi Shyan. We all know more can be done even with their efforts.
In </span>many ways, this is a mountain we are trying to surmount
although we have made a good start and are steadily progressing. </p>

as in any climb, we cannot let up. We must keep up the momentum
and, in fact, the incline could get steeper as we climb higher.
This is like the story of Singapore. We are always climbing and
it does get harder. But if our foundations are strong, it can overcome
challenges and carry us to the destination. If we want to make it
to the summit, we must continue to tackle issues, and some very fundamental
and basic issues. One of which I have identified is the risk-adverse
culture that resides in Singapore. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-fa2471dd-069b-49fe-9bd0-646bcdee09de">
                  <a name="president-address__id-fa2471dd-069b-49fe-9bd0-646bcdee09de"><!--a--></a>I have lived and worked
overseas for a few years – China, Hong Kong. When I came back, the
comfort level of Singapore made me rather uncomfortable in the areas
of entrepreneurship or business. Because, sometimes, I wonder if
we can give up just testing the waters and just take the risk ourselves.
Sometimes, I do wonder as well − has the comfort of Singapore made
it less than conducive for taking risks, and even less so to set
up a business? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d4ded642-b145-49d3-b134-8f410c441204">
                  <a name="president-address__id-d4ded642-b145-49d3-b134-8f410c441204"><!--a--></a>Over the past decade, the
Government has committed a lot of resources to fostering an environment
that encourages and nurtures entrepreneurship. The result? There
are some changes from 10 years ago. And the change which is most
obvious is probably the number of young people who now desire more
to become entrepreneurs and more are also expanding their choices
in this area. But even then, I would like to point out that having
the desire and actually doing it, stepping forward, are entirely
two different things. They can be dreamers but we will still fail
if they are not doers. So we need to make sure that we can inspire
them to make that leap of faith as well as encouraging a broader
base of entrepreneurs, regardless of age. The fact remains that
the number of actual entrepreneurs is still much smaller than what
we hoped for. I believe there is still a gap that we should try
to close and maybe we can do more.</p>

Sir, there are many reasons for this. But I would like to focus
on two key points in my speech today, on how we can chart our route
forward. First, we need to take a fresh new look at our current
approach while taking into this recent backdrop of new expectations
from a changing electorate; and, second, Singaporeans need to reflect
about coming forward and taking the best of what has been created
for them.</p>

crisis, socio-economic changes have drastically changed the way
companies conduct their business. Take employment practices, for
example, many now prefer to hire on contract and short-term basis.
Even in the area of entrepreneurship, a growing trend is social
and green entrepreneurship which was unheard of 10 years ago, has
now become something of a buzz and in-thing. We need to be mindful
that such socio-economic changes are taking place, and we should
also reconsider our current practices and focus. Entrepreneurship
itself is not age biased. In fact, increasingly we read media reports
about Singaporeans leaving corporate jobs to strike out on their
own. Neither are entrepreneurs one hit wonders and many may fold and
come back, rising again. There is great potential in tapping this
wisdom of this growing segment of Singaporeans who are now seeking,
possibly, a second career in their lives and for those who were
burnt during the crisis, it may be a second chance for them to start
up again.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4cb3ac6d-9185-42cc-9cf8-44270686f8a3">

are becoming entrepreneurs also later in their age; some maybe late
bloomers, some in their late 30s, 40s or even older. And we hear famous
stories like McDonalds' founder, Ray Kroc, started McDonalds in
his 50s. So some may be trying to rise from a business failure and
decided to start up a new business to ride the upturn, say, post-2009
after the crisis. Our present entrepreneur environment may have
covered a lot of the key bases but there are many who still fall through
the cracks. I believe the systems still need some tweaking and refinement.</p>

illustrates my point. Just recently, I got to know this two-man
web design company that has been in operation for six years. Business
was not that great but they made enough for the two to get by. It
helped that they have some good clients, notable list of clients
– some Government-linked and some MNCs. What happened was one of
the business owners decided to have a second child and the revenue
he was earning from his set-up was no longer sufficient. Times were
bad and the family struggled to make ends meet. And the business
owner could no longer get any access to loans because his company
was, in a way, a sole-proprietorship. He could not get grants either
because in order to make any claim under the scheme, they have to
spend first and then get reimbursed later. That is tough on the
cash-flow. As his business was not a new invention, he could not
get any start-up funds nor were any VCs interested. The point is
that he did not want to give up his dreams of being a business owner.
But he had to. And the funny thing was that he was also not allowed
to renew his sole-proprietor licence because he could not top-up
his Medisave. Neither his client list nor track record helped. </p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-6aa142ef-b00b-4951-8858-278da3443acf"><!--a--></a>But just to clarify that
for start-up grants, they cannot be seen as a welfare fund. That is
an important point for entrepreneurs or aspiring ones to note. Grants
should not be the top priority to decide if they will start a business.
As long as their business can be differentiated from their competitors
and to be able to differentiate themselves within the industry,
there is a possibility that it can be supported, and should be supported. </p>

not have been the first hard luck story my fellow colleagues in
this House would have heard of. Many of you may have heard of other similar
stories. The point I would like to make is that the social stigma
of a business failure in Singapore can sometimes be as bad as that
of a HIV carrier's or an ex-convict's. So, more can and should be
done to change these societal attitudes and reverse this risk-averse
culture. But it is going to take time. </p>

should also start with some of our Government agencies. Someone
recently related to me the story of a start-up trying to secure
a major project in a developing country. The company went to one
of our Government agencies for advice, but only to be frowned upon
and asked to answer why an "unheard of" company like them was trying
to secure such a large project. The company, incidentally, was a newbie
in the new eco-business with in-house R&amp;D specialists and employees
with the right experience. But it was just that it was a start-up,
so with very little track record. Needless to say, nothing came
out of that conversation.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8141004c-f9ab-4993-ae5d-7faffae9de1a">
                  <a name="president-address__id-8141004c-f9ab-4993-ae5d-7faffae9de1a"><!--a--></a>But then there are good
agencies. And for this same company, another Government agency took
a completely different approach, and introduced them to other relevant Government
agencies and let them showcase their credentials. This, in turn,
led the company to the right contacts. And in just a few months,
the company managed to secure a test pilot project technology here
and overseas too. Currently, the company still does not qualify
for any R&amp;D grants because it is still too new. And the fact
is that we want to bet on companies that have a clear track record,
and it will always be difficult. So we have to broaden the outreach
to identify companies and not just bet on winners because in business
there is no sure winner anyway. </p>

the importance of a two-way relationship, the trust and the confidence
between private and public sectors. We can do more than just infrastructure and
funding support. Similarly, the private sector must also be ready
to step forward and work with the Government. It is all about a
change of mindset on both sides towards supporting each other. It
cannot be more true between the Government and the people itself.
As the President has said in his Address, "The Government will reach
out to all Singaporeans to help them get good jobs, own their homes,
and see their children gain confidence and blossom. But the Government
cannot, and should not, try to do everything by itself. Singaporeans
play an equally important role."</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-76811063-2521-447c-806f-a8b021504ee8"><!--a--></a>Yes, the Government will
reach out to all Singaporeans and do its part. We must constantly
review feedback and work hand-in-hand with the private sector to
improve the administration of funding, grants and loans to SMEs
or even early business start-ups. We did not over-engineer and we
may not need huge stacks of forms for the application. In fact,
this complexity of grant application has also created a new consultancy
industry. So, that helps create jobs.</p>

continue to do more to inspire this entrepreneurship culture in
Singapore. But we need to also give due consideration to a growing
segment of Singaporeans who do want to make an entrepreneurial switch
later in their lives and supporting changes in attitudes to help
entrepreneurs to make that "come back". And I know there is no lack
of ideas out there, young or old, those in career − we just need
to inspire and encourage them to take that step forward as long
as they can show that their business can differentiate, not just
innovate, but can differentiate their business, I think they deserve
support.</p>

to be taken by both parties − the Government and the private sector.
And this will involve taking new risks to narrow the gap, but a
meeting of minds will certainly help to close ranks and ensure we
reach that summit. Now, when we do that, it is up to you to take
that step forward, take that leap of faith, to build the dream for
yourselves, your family and for this country. With that, I support

Sir, I would like to seek a point of clarification from Mr Teo Ser
Luck in regard to the selling of tissue papers. This is a real case
involving a Potong Pasir resident. He was given two summonses, I
think last year, for illegal hawking. He was a wheelchair-bound
resident and he was given two summonses, with fines ranging from
$550 to $700, and I personally saw the fines. I did try to help
him to settle the case, but I do not know what happened after that.
So, I just like to point out to him that I have seen it personally
myself. As regards Mdm Halimah Yacob's point about subsidies, I
would like to make a clarification that those subsidies that she
mentioned were from Government funding. What I would like to see
is more Government funding in this respect.</p>

Mr Speaker, I would like to respond to a point of clarification
from Mr Teo Ser Luck. He asked who can predict the right number,
the right figure between supply and demand in the area of transport,
healthcare and housing capacity. Did the MOM and ICA not know we
were letting in this huge influx of foreigners? Did they inform
MOH, MOT and MND? And was the left hand not talking to the right
hand, or was it because the imperative of economic growth took precedence over
the welfare and the comfort of our people? </p>

Youth and Sports and Minister of State for Information, Communications
and the Arts (MG [NS] Chan Chun Sing)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, I would like to join fellow MPs in thanking the President for
setting out the directions of this Government in the coming years.
Since Independence, three fundamentals have underpinned our survival
and success − a disciplined and cohesive society that is able to
move ahead together; pragmatic policies to grow our economy for
us to be able to share the fruits of our labour with all sectors of
society; and steady investments in ensuring a safe and secure environment.
These same fundamentals will continue to underpin our future. However,
new forces have emerged or evolved to impact our social cohesion.
We must take proactive steps to address these challenges. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9c027c81-0642-4924-b41a-74a6b203d59f">
                  <a name="president-address__id-9c027c81-0642-4924-b41a-74a6b203d59f"><!--a--></a>I will touch on three challenges
to our social cohesion – possible socio-economic divide; socio-stratification
or immobility; and greater diversity, including differences in aspirations
and expectations.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2ce534e3-1e66-4fa3-954a-31e0b290befd">
                  <a name="president-address__id-2ce534e3-1e66-4fa3-954a-31e0b290befd"><!--a--></a> Every rapidly developing
society has to deal with widening social inequity. Every society,
over time, may stratify and risk losing its social mobility. In
each society, some will make it through their own efforts and some
will not, no matter how hard they try. The majority will benefit
from a system that allows them to maximise their potential for success.
By and large, we have done well. Our system enables the majority
of our people to succeed through their own efforts. For those who
are unable to keep up, despite their best efforts, our society must
find a way to bring them along. These include those with disabilities,
the chronically-ill, vulnerable seniors with no family support,
families who need guiding hands beyond financial help, children
without positive home environments and other examples. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-57236e91-7e14-4258-8da8-ac1a605d3150">
                  <a name="president-address__id-57236e91-7e14-4258-8da8-ac1a605d3150"><!--a--></a>Our society must work together
to prevent a permanent underclass from emerging, be it social or
economic. Even if the current generation cannot do as well, we must endeavour
to help their next generation do better. Social mobility provides
hope. Hope and shared vision underpins social cohesion. A country
divided will collapse even without external challenges.</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-769a8172-beea-41d8-89b4-bf83b9ec7f2a"><!--a--></a> To better manage social
inequities and improve social mobility, MCYS is committed to doing
more and doing better in the following areas:</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d35e4aff-fe47-49ec-988c-e6c963b35103">
                  <a name="president-address__id-d35e4aff-fe47-49ec-988c-e6c963b35103"><!--a--></a> First, to not only help
the "in-risk" groups but also to carefully watch the "at-risk" groups
to prevent them from joining the in-risk groups. Prevention is better
than cure. This is also the reason why we enhanced accessibility
to pre-school among low-income families, fund programmes for at-risk
youth and promote active ageing amongst seniors.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-31c97e82-d32d-4afb-81a0-ddfcfe041d8b">
                  <a name="president-address__id-31c97e82-d32d-4afb-81a0-ddfcfe041d8b"><!--a--></a>Second, to continue improving
our social support and service delivery model in a more holistic
and client-centric manner. We will always put the person needing
help rather than our schemes at the centre of our focus. We are
also prepared to exercise greater flexibility at the margins and
at the local levels and extend more support, where needed. This
is so that those who genuinely need help do not fall through the
cracks. Members of Parliament, the media and members of public have
at times highlighted to us individuals who may have fallen through
the cracks. We welcome the partnership to work with like-minded
people and organisations to reach out to them. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 185</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-57d356ec-400e-4e1f-9af3-6c68257e3efd">
                  <a name="president-address__id-57d356ec-400e-4e1f-9af3-6c68257e3efd"><!--a--></a>Every case highlighted can
point us in the direction where we can possibly do more or better.
Every individual or family whose life we can touch is one small
step towards a more inclusive and cohesive society. Yet in every
effort to help, there is also a delicate balance between preserving
individual motivation and extending assistance and between family
responsibility, community outreach and Government support to ensure the
best outcome possible. In my encounters with many needy, I am proud
that many of them have told me that they are not asking for handouts
but that they would like us to help them stand tall and proud on
their own two feet again.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2ba5f6a8-e080-4441-8d90-c6ba7c5b0079">

better integration, integration across different help agencies within
the public, private and people sectors, integration of our efforts
to reach out to at-risk groups across the time dimension with greater
emphasis on upstream measures. Let me elaborate on what I mean by
the above. An example of integration across agencies working closely
includes working closely with MOH as well as VWOs and private sector
providers to provide a better continuum of care options for the
elderly from home care to community care and institutional care.
Examples of integration across time dimension include working closely
with MOF and MOE to invest more in preventive measures. These include
helping children from at-risk families to stay the course in schools,
enhancing intervention programmes for children with special needs and
ensuring that low-income families have access to affordable and
quality pre-school.</p>

We do not have to worry about the gap between the Ministry of Education
(MOE) and the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS).
This is because the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Community Development,
Youth and Sports have chosen the right path to ensure that everybody will
be taken care of.</p>

of integration of the public, private and people sector efforts include
encouraging individuals and corporations who have done well to play
a part to help those who have not done as well. Each of us is able
to be where we are not entirely through our own efforts. We are
able to come this far because of the opportunities afforded to us
by society. It is thus incumbent upon the more successful to help
the less successful. To paraphrase Spiderman, "to those with great
accomplishments come great responsibilities". Our forefathers understood
this well. We must bring forth the next generation of Tan Kah Kee,
Alsagoff and Govindasamy Pillai.</p>

I have benefited from various Government scholarships and bursaries.
But I have also benefited from the help of the community and individuals like
the Tung On Wui Jun, Kwong Wai Shiu Peck San Teng, and the Old Rafflesian Association.
As you can see, I was someone from the at-risk group, but was supported by
helping hands from the public, private and people sectors which
I am eternally grateful for. We must grow this partnership for the
benefit of many more who may need help. We must continue to pay
it forward. </p>

in financial means. Giving can also be extending a hand to those
who need help. Through volunteering and community participation,
we also strengthen our community safety net, and extend care and
compassion to our fellow Singaporeans. </p>

less fortunate is not just about doing more. Of course, we appreciate
any additional resources from Government, charitable private organisations and
philanthropic individuals. But it is also about doing better with
the resources that we have. To this end, my Ministry will strengthen
the social service sector to bring out its potential and to build
the caring community.</p>

we want to help each player in the sector to be stronger. Some may
grow in size; others may remain small but have the ability to fill
a niche or specialisation. Collectively, as a sector, we hope to
develop enough capacity to meet increased demand, capability to
meet complex needs and dynamism to innovate in response to changing
needs. There is no magic formula to this. Different things have
to be done in concert.</p>

in the care and professional development of our social service professionals.
I am particularly touched by their passion. As they play the critical frontline
role in our social service delivery model, the least that we can
do is to provide a better route of advancement for them. Indeed,
my colleague, Dr Maliki, had alluded to this yesterday when he highlighted
the importance of providing support to help social workers to do
their part well. This is also a means for us to attract more much-needed talent.
We also nurture stronger administrative and professional leadership
in the sector to drive change and innovation. We should also promote
good HR practices − so crucial to attracting and retaining talent,
and getting the best out of them.</p>

VWOs to improve their management capability and to facilitate social
innovation. We want to see more experimentation in this sector.
It is only with constant experimentation that we can achieve more
service innovation and productivity enhancement in the sector. There
is scope to learn from other societies, such as Japan's technological
applications in eldercare, as mentioned by Mr Sitoh Yih Pin yesterday.
We will also work with those who have the capacity to scale up their operations
and others to specialise in niche areas of needs.</p>

models of service delivery, encouraging pooling of resources for
higher efficiency and impact, and help redesign jobs to improve productivity.
I have asked my MCYS colleagues to examine how we can widen the coverage
of the VWO Capability Development Fund to also encourage and support
this.</p>

sector will require resources. We will systematically review where
else we need to provide more resources and better support essential social
services. Over the last month, I had announced increased funding
for community-based eldercare services as well as new initiatives
for childcare professionals working with younger children. We have
started reviewing the funding norms for social services as well
as our investment in the VWO Capability Development Fund. We hope
to complete these by early next year.</p>

social services, we also aim to provide better care for the family

we make as a society will affect future generations of Singaporeans.

third challenge to our social cohesion – greater diversity. We are
familiar with the traditional forms of diversity − in race, language
and religion. In recent years, as we welcome more foreigners and
immigrants, we will have to manage the associated opportunities
and challenges. When well integrated, "new immigrants and their
children" will join "old immigrants and our children" to play a
constructive partnership for our country. We cannot take for granted
that integration will happen naturally. We have to work on it −
all of us. </p>

other emerging forms of diversity. As technology opens up more opportunities
for people to access information and entertainment, we will have greater
diversity in our perspectives, values system and aspirations. The
ease of access and connection means that people can form new groupings
and find alternative identities. These new groupings and identities
may no longer be geographically bounded. This is both a challenge
and an opportunity − opportunity to grow our network and be a node
in the global network; challenge to maintain our identity as a people
and as a nation.</p>

we know that diversity can strengthen our resilience as a nation.
Diversity need not mean wider division within our society. We should
strive for, and we can achieve, "unity in diversity". To this end,
how we engage our people, young and old; how we share the challenges
of governance; how we imbue ourselves with our shared values, will
determine if diversity in perspectives will lead to a stronger or
weaker society. MCYS will work closely with all stakeholders in
our society to ensure that as we become more diverse in the sea
of change, we do not lose our shared and common values that serve
as our anchor.</p>

it is equally important for us to share with and imbue in the next
generation the very fundamentals that make Singapore possible and
survive the odds of history against small states without much natural
resources. Sports has an important role in this. We will use sports
as a strategy to develop our people to be future-ready for tomorrow's
challenges, to bond our increasingly diverse communities, and to ignite
our passion and pride for our nation. A few months back, I convened
a committee from different walks of lives − called Vision2030 −
and together with all our sporting partners, to chart the future
of sports as a strategy for our nation. They will present their recommendations
in due course. </p>

off highlighting how our disciplined and cohesive society has helped
secure our survival and success thus far. I have also shared the
challenges ahead, our thinking and actions to address these. Just
as we have invested much resources and talent in our security, defence
and economic development, we will similarly need to invest in our
social cohesion. Social cohesion comes from shared responsibility
and shared vision. The mark of a great society is not just how well
we do economically, but also how well we care for our weak and less
fortunate. Shared vision requires engaged citizenry. Engaged citizenry
requires shared understanding of our fundamentals, constraints and
options. But most of all, we require passion − passion to build
a better future for our families and children. We may never be perfect,
but we must all endeavour to leave behind something less imperfect
for our future generations to have the option and desire to want
to be called Singaporeans.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>
                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Motion and thank the President
for his Address. The opening of the Twelfth Parliament portends
new aspirations and challenges for Singapore as it enters her next
phase of development. That part of Mr Gerald Giam's speech, I agree
with. Mr Gerald Giam says he agrees with the Government's bold measures
laid out in the President's Address. So, he agrees they are "bold".
In other words, measures of conviction, and then adds, "The Workers'
Party will hold the Government accountable to achieve these measures."
I am afraid that displays a misunderstanding of the process. The
Government is not accountable to the Workers' Party. The Government
is accountable to the people of Singapore. I, as an elected Member
of Parliament for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, am accountable to all
my Singaporean residents. Therefore, it is the people of Singapore
to whom we are and must remain accountable as a government. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8ec0a2cb-6ce4-45ea-bff3-aefdd45ec4e3">
                  <a name="president-address__id-8ec0a2cb-6ce4-45ea-bff3-aefdd45ec4e3"><!--a--></a>Mr Giam then talks about
housing and transport, and I would like to ask him not to "throw
the baby out with the bath water". Housing in Singapore − 80% of
the people are housed in public housing – good quality flats, good
neighbourhoods. And a large amount of Singaporeans − about 80% or
more − own their own homes. Our housing is the envy of many First
World countries. Therefore, to suggest we have failed in housing, I
think that is unfair. Finetune housing, yes, I think we can agree.
Everybody in this House can agree. Finetuning housing, as Mr Gerald
Giam, I think, intends to do, is a tacit concession that the PAP
foundations in housing are correct. Finetuning is always an admission
that the foundations, to start with, were good, long-lasting and
should be preserved. So finetuning, together with Mr Giam, we can
do. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-42988b6a-14b8-4517-8ce1-c4cc18249c8d">

I ask Mr Giam not to "throw the baby out with the bath water". In
major cities proximate to Singapore, like Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur,
gridlock is the characteristic when you are on public roads; in
Singapore, less so. So what Mr Giam is subconsciously doing is finetuning
PAP policies, which is a tacit concession, that the foundations
are correct.</p>

with this Government. The Member wants to work together to scale
new apexes. I can agree with that. I think everybody in this House
can agree with that. But we should not chide the foundations upon
which we were built. </p>

which surfaced in the recent General and Presidential elections
reflect a maturing electorate whose concerns span beyond typical
bread-and-butter issues. Nevertheless, very practical concerns remain
foremost on the minds of Singaporeans from all walks of life. The
Government must address and tackle these issues in a comprehensive
and calibrated manner so as to ensure that all Singaporeans are
taken care of and no one is left behind. </p>

issues today is that of Singapore's growing population. Our total
population hit 5.18 million as at the end of June, which is an increase
of 107,000 compared to last year. According to the Department of
Statistics, the total population grew by 2.1%, with the number of
Singaporeans growing by 0.8%. The number of non-resident foreigners,
on the other hand, grew by 6.9%. </p>

weight to the fears expressed by many Singaporeans over the adequacy
of the nation's infrastructure to absorb such rapidly increasing numbers.
The population issue has been linked to overcrowding on public buses
and trains, soaring home prices, as well as intensified competition
for jobs. Some of these ground sentiments have over time culminated
in feelings of frustration.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-20296385-f15f-4d77-bab0-d8918a056410">

too, acknowledge the vital need to keep our economy open and competitive
in today's increasingly globalised and interdependent world, the Government
must also do its part to formulate policies that benefit Singaporeans.
It must ensure that our public infrastructures − such as transport,
housing and hospitals − are able to continue to provide for Singaporeans
from all classes of society. This includes reviewing employment
statistics of the relevant industries to ensure that Singaporeans
are not under-represented, as well as monitoring current healthcare
costs to ensure they remain affordable, especially for vulnerable
groups such as the elderly and those in the lower-middle income
class. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-86956760-4340-4d82-8776-36ea4450890a">
                  <a name="president-address__id-86956760-4340-4d82-8776-36ea4450890a"><!--a--></a>It is heartening to note
the call to tread a balanced path in Singapore's manpower policies
in the Deputy Prime Minister's Ministry of Manpower's Addendum to
the President's Address. While recognising that it is important
for our economy to remain welcoming to both businesses and talents
from abroad for the creation and sustenance of good jobs, the Ministry
has assured Singaporeans that it will seek to keep the overall share
of foreigners in the workforce at no higher than one-third over
the long term. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b1b8362b-d47b-4ce3-a37b-259fc8310282">
                  <a name="president-address__id-b1b8362b-d47b-4ce3-a37b-259fc8310282"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, Sir, having
discussed manpower ratio, foreigners and public infrastructure,
I would like to move on to the subject of immigration inflow. Since
2009, the Government has tightened the immigration policy to better
manage the inflow and qualifications the new immigrants bring. For
example, it granted only 29,625 Permanent Resident (PR) passes last
year, which is fewer than half of about 60,000 passes given out the
year before. This is the lowest PR intake at least for the last
five years. The Government has also pledged to raise levies for
foreign workers and tighten the foreign labour flow. The tangible
effect of these tightening measures is reflected in the sharp drop
of the number of non-residents entering Singapore, from about 130,000
in 2007 to just 51,300 last year, even when the economy recovered
and grew at 14.5%.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-03f72d2b-aedf-4092-8532-b70671d91849">
                  <a name="president-address__id-03f72d2b-aedf-4092-8532-b70671d91849"><!--a--></a>While these measures mark
a step in the right direction, many Singaporeans, among whom are
my residents, have questioned whether our existing infrastructural
support is adequate to handle even the present increase in numbers.
In the area of transport, common concerns have to do with fare hikes,
waiting times, as well as congestion and overcrowding on buses and
trains. Current measures by the Government to improve the public
transport infrastructure are significant and very welcomed. Some
of these include expanding the bus bays, providing accurate timetables
for buses and extending the MRT network. The recently opened Circle
Line, which opened two stations within my ward − thank you very
much, Mr Lui − for example, has significantly increased network connectivity
to the benefit of commuters, businesses and residents. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 190</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-29b796c7-54dc-4124-943a-014a7a2f88d1">
                  <a name="president-address__id-29b796c7-54dc-4124-943a-014a7a2f88d1"><!--a--></a>Nevertheless, much more
needs to be done to expand the capacity, reliability and frequency
of public transport. Some 590,000 people commute by train daily,
and complaints about overcrowding and long waits crop up regularly.
In response to increased demand, the two train operators have rolled
out a further 590 trips per week or a 5% increase since March. However,
the benefit of these extra trips to commuters is questionable given
that more than 400 of them are outside peak hours. What more can be
done to help those travelling in peak hours? Expanding the current
infrastructure will take time, and the Government could also explore
creative options to provide more immediate relief, such as off-peak
fare discounts to spread out demand during peak hours. In line with
Singapore's aspirations to become a more inclusive society, past suggestions
for transport operators to offer concessionary fares to disabled
commuters should be revisited. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-46e378ac-6eb6-491a-a930-06d8259cd15a">
                  <a name="president-address__id-46e378ac-6eb6-491a-a930-06d8259cd15a"><!--a--></a>Sir, the issue of housing
is also a contentious one among Singaporeans. Demand for homes remains
high, given reports which indicated that population growth has outpaced
the increase in housing stock over the past 10 years. This resulted
in a housing stock shortfall of about 87,000 homes last year. Besides
building infrastructure in the designated new towns, the Government's
move to ramp up supply in older estates is a step in the right direction.
The latter allows homes to take full advantage of the excellent amenities
in mature towns. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2b3accd2-7882-4043-a328-438206fe4a28">
                  <a name="president-address__id-2b3accd2-7882-4043-a328-438206fe4a28"><!--a--></a>In addition to supply side
measures which will take time to filter down, demand management
initiatives are also crucial in achieving stable and sustainable
home prices for the populace. Although cooling measures have been
introduced, rising home prices, particularly experienced by people
in my generation – 35 years and younger − remain a major concern
among first-time buyers. Figures show that HDB flat prices are the
fastest rising across the board. According to preliminary estimates,
the Housing Board Resale Price Index in the second quarter rose
by 2.9% in contrast to private homes, which increased at a slower
pace of 1.9%. These figures are telling as they suggest that newly-built
flats may still not be affordable to younger start-up families and
the working-class families. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5b7888cb-2e48-4e17-b5c9-54fa12176eb0">
                  <a name="president-address__id-5b7888cb-2e48-4e17-b5c9-54fa12176eb0"><!--a--></a>Recent income ceiling revisions
for those applying for BTO flats and executive condominiums, as
well as the Government's timely intervention in the recent DBSS debacle,
signify that it is indeed responsive to the needs of a wide spectrum
of Singaporeans. However, more still can be done to help out target
groups, such as young couples, divorcees with children and low-income
families. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d73bcd8a-1d06-48ae-bfcf-10c505313f48">
                  <a name="president-address__id-d73bcd8a-1d06-48ae-bfcf-10c505313f48"><!--a--></a>Another aspect to resolving
the housing affordability issue requires that policies be put in
place to deal with excessive property speculation. While the Government
has implemented cooling measures to curb speculation in the property
market and concurrently ramped up the supply of public flats, these
appear to affect only Singaporeans. Prices, fuelled by foreign demand,
continue to spike where private properties are concerned. Figures
show that private home prices moved up close to 18%, or 17.6% to
be exact, last year after rising just 1.6% the year before. Flash
estimates from the Urban Redevelopment Authority may point to a
softening market, but it is significant that private home prices
are still 15.8% over the 2008 peak. </p>

has tightened restrictions on ownership of property, this and other
cooling measures have not been tough enough to cool what some term
as foreign speculative interest in our domestic property market.
We must also aim to help our Singaporean prospective home buyers
eyeing their first private property and those seeking to upgrade
from HDB flats. Many countries, including land-rich Australia, have measures
to limit foreign ownership of properties or at least speculative
interest in property. More of such measures should be implemented
or considered to be implemented, as this would place coveted ownership
of private property within the reach of more Singaporeans. This
is especially pertinent given that home ownership is an emotional
issue for most Singaporeans. In short, while we must continue to
be an open economy, we cannot allow speculative foreign ownership
in private property to drive prices to a level beyond which our
own genuine Singaporean home buyers can afford. It is imperative
that we keep property prices affordable for our Singaporeans. </p>

pledged to expand healthcare facilities and manpower to keep up
with the local demand for medical services. Capacity challenges
cannot simply be met by building more hospitals as this is not feasible
in the long term. In addressing the issue, the Government should
go beyond the qualitative to a more quantitative approach, which
could involve the exploration of private-public partnerships. The Eastern
Regional Health System is an example of a health cluster with such
links to public and private healthcare providers. </p>

are a pressing concern, especially for retirees and middle-income
families with elderly parents and sick children to care for. A review
of the existing funding framework and various financial assistance
schemes is timely. While the Government has pledged to increase
subsidies and extend more financial aid to the low-income and elderly
poor, it must be mindful of the importance of primary and palliative
care in light of Singapore's ageing population. </p>

city is a prerequisite to our nation's survival, Singaporeans must
also feel that this is a home in which they belong. It is imperative that
the Government focus on acceptance and respect as the key social
cohesion amongst the various communities. Integration may well pose
a challenge with the influx of immigrants and new citizens, and
the Government should look to see how bonds can be forged through
community-building initiatives.</p>

we move to a diverse politics, politics must not lose its decorum.
It is the hope of many Singaporeans and many residents I represent
that a more diverse and open politics does not fuel divisiveness
in society. Political discourse and public debate must be carried
out in an honourable fashion. A case in point would be the reported
jeering of Dr Tony Tan by a group aligned to Mr Tan Jee Say at the Nomination
Centre in the recent presidential elections. While Mr Tan Jee Say
expressed that it was not "correct" of his supporters to do so and
that he would address the issue with them, he also added quickly
that he could not control the crowd as it was made up of mixed groups
of supporters. All Singaporeans I spoke with about this felt very disappointed
about the behaviour of those who jeered. </p>

is a prerequisite for effective public debate, and this cannot be
achieved when participants are rude. The need for restraint is all
the more pertinent in the context of our evolving political scene,
where more voices clamour to be heard and more people contend to
represent diverse groups and interests. The prerogatives of political
participation, whether as supporters or as candidates standing for
election, are not to be taken for granted and must accordingly be
tempered by an appropriate sense of decorum and responsibility.
Conduct that runs contrary to such standards should not be tolerated
but kept in check. Only then can Singapore progress and mature politically as
a nation. Sir, I support the Motion.</p>

ask Mr de Souza, does he accept this constitutional principle? Secondly,
he pointed out that I was throwing the baby out of the bath water.
I did not say that the PAP had got everything wrong or that we had
failed in housing. He had put those words in my mouth. What I did
say is that there are many things that need to be corrected in housing, transport
and healthcare. Some of them may be finetuning; some of them may
amount to rather large overhauls of the system. And it does not
mean that because we are overhauling the system, it means that we
are throwing the baby out of the bath water.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not say that the government of the day is
not accountable to MPs. I did not say that the government of the
day is not accountable to the Workers' Party MPs. The government
of the day is not accountable to the People's Action Party. In the
same vein, the government of the day is accountable to the people
of Singapore and, therefore, that is a cornerstone, a hallmark of
our democratic process. On his point about throwing the baby out
with the bath water: it is not throwing out the baby out of the
bath water. There were tacit remarks about how the PAP Government
had failed the people, especially in the last few years where housing is
concerned, because the supply of housing had not met with the demand
which the Member attributes to the high number of foreigners and
the left hand not talking to the right hand – MOT not talking to
MOM, MOM not talking to ICA, and so on. While we can agree that
these policies need finetuning, what I cannot agree with the Member
is that the foundations of the policy are incorrect because however
you skin the cat, however you look at it, 80% of Singaporeans live
in public housing and 80% of Singaporeans own their own homes. So,
I beg to differ. I think I was correct to say that we should be
very careful not to throw the baby out with the bath water, given
the sturdy foundations.</p>

Mr Speaker, Singapore has witnessed a period of high growth in the
last two decades. The per capita GDP has increased and has given
us a strong position in the league of First World nations. In response
to healthcare in our city of Singapore, as a practitioner for the
last 21 years practising medicine full time and having visited and
worked in places such as the USA, United Kingdom, Scotland, and
being an international consultant to India, and also having visited
many Third World nations' healthcare systems, I have to say the following:
we have a good healthcare system in place. We have strong fundamentals and
we have a strong brand name. Of course, we continue to do this,
but we do not always have things right but we will have to review,
we will have to enhance, we will have to finetune. This is exactly
what all systems in the world do. Many First World nations, many
First World healthcare institutions, are grappling with the same
problems that we face today. So it is not unique, it is not new.
It is something that we have to be very dynamic and mobile about
and make all the necessary changes, as we move on into the future.</p>

very low doctor-to-patient ratio. We have a 1.7 per 1,000 patient
compared to a range of 2.14 to 4.49 per 1,000 in North America and
Europe. It is estimated that we need another 2,000 doctors by 2015.
To ameliorate this problem, we have alternatives which include more
medical schools to train doctors, recruiting more foreign trained
doctors and also a few other possibilities which have been discussed
by Ministry of Health. However, we need to get our sums right in
doing this. </p>

registered doctors serve in the public sector, which provides the
bulk of healthcare, which is about 80%; whilst 45% are in the private
sector, providing about 20% of care. This would mean that the real
or actual doctor-to-patient ratio is much lower than the national
ratio quoted. This is also why we have some very long waiting times,
eg, the Specialist Clinic's waiting time for some disciplines can
be up to 25 to 30 weeks. So we need to act on that. </p>

little bit on the public-private partnership (PPP) that has been spoken

is characterised by central planning, global budgeting and some
free provisions. In the private sector, we talk of devolved budgeting,
user fees, reimbursement mechanisms and contracting, and contracting
refers to formalised market exchanges of services. In Europe, for
example, there is the model of "managed markets", where clinical
services are subjected to this process.</p>

Block contracting will enable the continuation of a global budgeting
system in the form of a contract. A total amount to be paid is specified and
the private institution is to deal with the demands of the service
in question. We have to be cautious not to overload the private
sector as well. </p>

at least part retention of the public financing as it will allow determination
of the level and amount to remain in the public domain. Resource allocation
decision can also remain in the public domain. But a balance must
be struck between the determination of resource allocation according
to the professionally-based needs assessment. That is to be done.
Basically, it boils down to two things: financing and delivery of
care for Singaporeans. </p>

MediShield to private insurance as well as out-of-pocket payments
has to be decided if we embark on this. There will be a need for
extension of the one-patient-one-medical record and electronic medical
record system to be used and shared with the private sector as well.
Decisions such as which elective procedures and which DRGs to be
allowed must also be made. Will we be ready to relax the private hospitals'
emergency departments to receive patients conveyed by SCDF's ambulances which
they do not receive now? Now, world-wide systems that have PPP have
shown a higher level of support by stakeholders, more innovative
designs, faster time to healthcare services, better accessibility
and sustainability as well. So, therefore, we have to get our sums
right and see what is the best way shown for Singapore.</p>

I think it needs a bit of restructuring with the onslaught of demographic
changes that is before us. There is a need to liberalise our "3Ms"
system which has been around for quite many years now. I welcome
the upgrade from Medisave 300 to 400 but feel we can still go to
Medisave 500 in view of the push towards more ambulatory management
of chronic diseases, our very rapidly ageing populace and the increase
in the average salaries of Singaporeans. This will definitely help
reduce the out-of-pocket payments.</p>

to MOH to allow the use of MediShield for treatment related to congenital
diseases. The costs for such treatment can be high and often multiple
treatment and procedures are required. Moreover, now that we have MediShield
for youth and newborn, it is only appropriate that we liberalise
this as well. Also, for our MediShield fund, as we build up, can
MOH consider increasing the coverage, eventually making it a comprehensive

insurance coverage after retirement, besides Eldercare and ElderShield,
as this is a period where people need the most cover and yet it
is the most difficult to get. Moreover, currently, many elderly
have to tap on their children's accounts and this creates a greater
demand on their children's Medisave. Consider the scenario where
the child's Medisave account holder is 60 years of age and the elderly
parent 85 years of age, this is going to become more and more prominent
as we move on and our life span gets longer with our ageing population.</p>

debate on happiness and, as someone who has visited Bhutan, I have
to give my piece as well. Gross National Happiness index cannot
be literally and bluntly taken for what it is. Happiness can indeed
be very personal and subjective. It is very much tied to expectations,
character and personality. It also very much depends on one's taste
which is acquired from one's environment and social context. Social
scientists have found that happiness is affected by both material
and non-material factors. There are seven factors which have been
shown to have strong correlation to happiness: (1) income; (2) work
and employment; (3) private and family life; (4) your community;
(5) healthcare; (6) freedom; and finally, having a philosophy and
meaning in life. I think these are important factors but we are
already doing some of these things and we are going to continue
to do it. It represents indirect measures and as evidenced by the
social scientists' studies, it certainly contributes towards overall happiness.
Therefore, Sir, this goes to show we are already mainstreaming initiatives which
contribute towards happiness and must continue to do so, and they
may not be directly happiness-generating policies. But then what
makes me happy may not make you happy and we will never be able
to satisfy everyone and make everybody happy all the time.</p>

for Aljunied GRC, Mr Muhamad Faisal, who claimed, and I quote, "that
fault lines were created in this House". I beg to differ, Sir. We
are all here to debate and discuss on exactly how to make life better,
help the low-income and needy through more than 30 different schemes
under MCYS, close up the gaps which exist in society and increase
happiness, improve productivity, create a safer environment and country,
all in line with the President's call to give all Singaporeans a
better life and a brighter tomorrow, and I quote, "a future we build
together".</p>

Sir, I feel there is a need to be more crisp, more transparent and
have a lot of more consultation in this arena. Policies are a necessity
but we have far to go on presentation and communications. I would
like to propose that the machinery of the civil service and Ministries
focused on the following: (1) to enhance the level of communications
with the public and this is one of the weakest link currently I
feel; (2) to have more public consultation on a wider scale; (3)
to engage, especially the appropriate and targeted sectors; and
(4) to be more grounded. Join me on my house visits, and I do not
mean just on one session where you are formally attached to us.
No, you can come more frequently to our condominium parties, night house
visits, targeted checks on the ground and on all complaints that
we received, for example. Sure, it can be very labour-intensive
but it is a practice that will yield the best understanding of the
issues for your policy-making decision.</p>

must, firstly, educate ourselves, including for our next generation.
The number of Malays who are university degree holders has tripled
to 14,300 in 2010 compared to the year 2000. Our community has shown
a better performance in other educational levels too. </p>

available to enhance our skills and learn new skills. I have seen
many who feel they are already too old to pursue new skills, even

our relations and understanding with the various communities. We
already serve as a model community to other Muslim communities in other
countries. While other communities abroad hold all kinds of protests
when sensitive and critical issues arise, the Malay/Muslim community
in Singapore responds in a rational, calm and mature way, while

health conscious and vigilant with screenings and treatment, especially
for those with chronic illnesses. Our community has one of the highest
complication rates from multiple chronic diseases. This is due to
having the wrong mindset, unhealthy lifestyle and non-compliance
to treatment. </p>

that is active and willing to participate. Put forth constructive
ideas that bring progress to the community. Do use social media responsibly,
with sensitivity and wisdom, with an intention to educate, using
accurate facts and positive engagement. Information can spread very
rapidly, but so can negativity. Thus, it is important to "think
before we type" when using social media. Anonymity behind the computer
screen is not to be treated lightly.</p>

on Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef's speech because she alluded to my
reference to Bhutan yesterday. I am glad she did because, to clarify,
I never said at any time that we should transplant wholesale the
index that Bhutan has. In fact, the reason why there is so much
international interest and in the UN itself is because this index
actually has latitude to be considered by each country on its own merits
for its own national well-being. And if you look at the indicators
there, it is not about whether we are happy as in laughing or things
like that, but it has got a lot to do with things like sustainable
development, whether we are preserving our culture for future generations,
and things of that nature. So, what I wanted the Government to clarify
was, since in July, there was this UN resolution which we apparently
supported to say that we will look at indicators of our country
too, how does that change things going forward now? Does it change
the way we will look at different factors because the resolution
says that these indicators have to be put in place to guide our
policy formulation?</p>

Mr Speaker, thank you, and congratulations. Following our two elections
this year, some commentators tell us that Singaporeans' political
differences are rising to the surface. Many of our leaders have
expressed their concerns about the differences. They warned of divisions
and called for unity. I would like to remind us that differences
are not divisions. It is the intolerance of differences that will
be divisive. </p>

man who is not able to join us here today. In a newspaper interview,
former Minister for Foreign Affairs George Yeo related what a Roman
Catholic cardinal had told him about the late Pope John Paul II.
The cardinal had drafted, "Even though we're all different because
we speak different languages, we are one". The Pope corrected him.
"No, it is not even though we're different, we are one. It is because
we are different, we are one." Mr Yeo then said, "I thought that
was so profound and beautiful. In my first speech to the United
Nations, I repeated that story because in the UN, it is also because
we are different that we are one. To be a human being is to be different.
The whole logic and driving force of biological life is diversification.
An imposed unity is a false unity; it is a contradiction in terms.
To me, that is a core position, and Singapore is an expression of
that core position." </p>

of that core position of diversity, and this must include political
diversity in this day and age. Let me state quite clearly how I
see myself as an Opposition Member of this Parliament. I may challenge
Government policy in Parliament, but I do not by definition oppose
Government policy. It does not mean that I do not support the Government
in its work. It is very simple. I am an Opposition MP and will perform
my role to voice alternative and opposing views in the law-making process,
based on my party philosophy. But I submit to laws properly made
because I believe they express the sovereign will of our people.
You see, I do not believe that Parliament is all form, and no substance.
I have been elected to serve in this Parliament and I will do what
I can to help make it work for Singapore, make it a First World Parliament
after our own fashion. As an Opposition MP, I am not the enemy of
the Government, I am a Singaporean and a patriot.</p>

will come out of robust debates alive and stronger. Not just in
Parliament but in larger society as well. Social cohesion will be
strengthened when we give people, including our young people, room
to voice their views and grievances and participate in community
affairs. This is being recognised in households and at work places
all around us. It is changing how they are being run and there is
no reason why we cannot learn from it. But we must start from a
position of difference, not a forced unity.</p>

goes on, "The aim is not to impose one's view over the other but
to find as much common ground as possible for the good of the common objectives
both parties share€¦ And yes, I have always practised this in the
office and with the wife and so far so good." </p>

it will be best done through strengthening our institutions that

office of the Presidency, for example. President Tan clearly intends
this. In his swearing in ceremony, he said, "I will strive to strengthen our

economic challenge". Adam Smith wrote many years ago about investments
in a person, such as by the acquisition of new talents, he wrote,
"such acquisition of talents always costs a real expense, which
is a capital realised in his person. Those talents, as they make
the fortune of the individual, so do they likewise that of the society
to which he belongs." </p>

regarded expenditures on education and healthcare as investments
in human capital. They produce income and other useful outputs for
the individual over long periods of time. They also produce external
benefits for the rest of society. When growing disparity in wealth
suggest that more and more households may not be able to make the
investments necessary to give their children a place at the same starting
line as their cohorts, it is even more appropriate for the Government
to increase public investments in the human capital of our young
people.</p>

Following the two elections this year, many of our leaders speak
of the importance of unity. They stress that the entire nation must
now be united and march forward in step. Some of them feel that
Singapore is becoming politically divided, which does not portend
well for our unity or future development. But let me ask you, how
do divisions come about? Is it because different voices have surfaced
in our society? Or is it the intolerance of different voices that
will result in division?</p>

If you set a good example by being righteous, who would dare not
to be righteous?" "He who governs by means of his virtue may be compared
to the North Star which keeps its place, and all the stars turn
toward it." "People will be convinced if you lead by virtue." These
are all sayings by Confucius that describe a good ruler. A good
leader, who is confident and embarks on the correct course of action
with the moral strength and competence to deliver results of good government,
will naturally win over the people. There will be no need to fear
a divided nation and harp on unity.</p>

right of any one political party. No matter how great a party, it
is only a part of the country. It does not constitute the entire
country! Chen Duxiu once said, "To think that there should only
be one party is to think like an emperor". In a democratic society,
it is both natural and healthy for people to have different views
and offer different suggestions.</p>

ago that gentlemen can achieve harmony with differences. Be harmonious,
but not identical. Yan Ying once asked, if the whole orchestra plays
only one note, who can bear to listen to it? If there is only plain
water after plain water, who can bear to drink it? A harmonious
society does not have only one voice in it. Instead, within the
boundaries of the law, people express their views peaceably and
engage in political activities. We should not need to guard against
the people as we guard against thieves.</p>

generation to be creative and independent, we have to provide them

Mr Speaker, Sir, I was just now trying to listen very attentively
to what the hon. Member Chen has mentioned about the definition
of "differences". I tried very hard to understand, but I really
do not know what is the difference he has made so far. I think the
PAP MPs are different, but we work together as a team to serve our
people, to make a difference to improve the lives of Singaporeans. But
I cannot see that in the contribution in what he has made in terms
of defining the differences.</p>

my speech on the elderly. First, I rise in support of the Motion.
I fully support the call by our President to strive for a better
life for all Singaporeans. I understand that the Government has
allocated lots of resources to nurture our young and build a competitive
workforce. But I hope that more could be done to help the elderly
in our community. Thus, I would like to urge this House and the Government
to work together to make Singapore an "Elderly-friendly city". An
elderly-friendly city will not only benefit the seniors but also
improve the quality of life for Singaporeans across all age groups. </p>

Singaporeans will be aged 65 and above. Our fast ageing population
will pose immense challenges to our society and country. If we want
our elderly to age actively and positively, urgent measures must
be taken to provide opportunities for seniors to stay independent
and healthy. </p>

Singaporeans do not understand and appreciate the importance of
having CPF savings which help to provide financial security to our
elderly. Some have called for the early withdrawal of CPF savings,
while others have lost some CPF savings through investments. For
many Singaporeans, their flats are their most valuable assets. Unfortunately,
some Singaporeans have lost their flats or entire life savings by
selling their flats and spending their sale proceeds too quickly.
Sir, I have come across cases of older Singaporeans who were ill-advised
to sell their flats, thus resulting in them becoming homeless and
facing financial hardships. </p>

like to urge the Government to provide more measures to protect
the CPF savings and flats of Singaporeans, especially the elderly
who are more vulnerable to unscrupulous practices in the market
place. We must safeguard the CPF savings used for flat purchase
and ensure that flat owners do not expend their CPF savings prematurely.
At the same time, the Government should allow more flexibility for the
elderly to exercise reverse mortgage so that they can age in place.
Alternatively, the Government can build more elderly studio apartments
within existing housing estates to facilitate seniors to live near
their children when they grow old. In this way, the elderly can
have more options to safeguard their financial security and get
support from their families. </p>

precious resource which is often ignored by policy-makers and the
industry. We always receive feedback that firms prefer younger and
more energetic workers, thus limiting employment opportunities for
older people. Although various Government measures were introduced
to help older workers to remain in the workforce, some still find
it challenging to secure quality jobs. </p>

the Government to consider a special Jobs Credit Scheme for older
workers in the social service sector. Many voluntary welfare organisations
and institutions of public character lack resources to employ staff

Older people can be a valuable resource to these organisations as
they have lifeskills, they have experiences and also the right temperament

health of our elderly is also the wealth of our country. With longer
life expectancy, more Singaporeans will have more silver years,
that is, living from 50 to 80 years old. Even with the retirement
age of 62, many Singaporeans will be retirees for about 18 years.
How can we help our seniors to be active and healthy? In this aspect,
I would like to make three suggestions to improve the health and
quality of life of our seniors.</p>

for sports facilities. Sir, the Government must be prepared to fund
and facilitate easy access of sports facilities to seniors. For
instance, public swimming pools, sports complexes, community clubs,
should allow free usage or affordable usage for seniors during the
day time, especially from 9.00 am to 5.00 pm on weekdays as these
facilities are under-utilised during these periods. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ff696d24-39fe-4ee3-ae62-7eef47be03e6">

groups. We should help more seniors to form sports interest groups
so that they can encourage one another to exercise regularly. Sir,
I recently formed a senior table tennis interest group at Bukit
Panjang Community Club (CC) and allow them free usage of my CC hall
and table tennis tables. I am surprised to see a steady stream of
seniors coming to join this interest group. Now, it has grown to about
30 of them, and they are playing five times a week at the CC. </p>

connectors. Besides sports facilities, I would urge the Government
to expedite the construction of park connectors in Singapore. Today,
many Singaporeans have taken up brisk walking, but it is indeed
very challenging to brisk walk in a group along our park connectors
and our road pavements. Our park connectors and road pavements are
usually very narrow and not seamless. Many park connectors and parks
also do not have convenient facilities, such as toilets and water

people fear being sidelined and left alone. Over the years, I have
seen cases of elderly being left in isolation due to marriage failures,
broken families or abandonment by family members. I have come across
cases where the elderly have many children but none of the children
will take care of them. In some cases, the children dumped their
parents after the parents transferred flat ownership to them or
sold their flats to help finance their children's flats. Some children
left their parents at nursing homes and refused to visit them. </p>

the erosion of values such as respect, gratitude and filial piety
among Singaporeans. Our education system must inculcate these values
in our children as many parents are facing difficulty to guide their
children to be respectful, grateful and filial. I received such
feedback from many parents. This erosion of values is further compounded
by the prevalence of dual-income families, with both parents at work
and the influence of media and Internet exposure. As a result, more
elderly are left in isolation both physically and emotionally in
our society. </p>

elderly to overcome loneliness? In what ways can the Government
help to strengthen the fabric of our families and society? The key
to setting up strong families is through proper education and Government
support. Children must be taught individual responsibility, encouraged
to set up families, learn to respect their elders and nurtured to
be filial to their parents. If these fundamental values were not taught
properly, the foundation of families will be weak. Subsequently,
the fabric of our families and society will be fragile, resulting
in fewer family formations, more broken families and many lonely
elderly. </p>

(Mr Lawrence Wong)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the
Motion of thanks to the President. I was here in this House five years
ago but seated in the gallery as a civil servant, watching from
the sidelines rather than participating in the debate. I still remember
the then President warning that the global environment would change
"rapidly and often unpredictably". I do not know what Mr Nathan
had in mind when he said those words, but I do not think he or anyone in
this House then would have anticipated what happened in the ensuing
years. Globally, we lived through the biggest bank bailout in history
and the deepest recession since the global depression. Singapore,
too, suffered its worst recession since Independence. Understandably,
this roller-coaster ride caused anxiety for many Singaporeans. </p>

first, during the General Election and then over the last few months
in my house visits and Meet-the-People Sessions (MPS). One experience
with a 60-year-old resident stood out. I first met him shortly after
I was elected as a Member of Parliament. My helpers warned me that
this was going to be a difficult case. I looked at his case file
which was very thick. He had been coming to the MPS since 2009 when
he lost his job as a driver. Since then, he had been looking for
a job but without any success. He was angry and he lost his temper
easily. But the anger stemmed from a deep sense of despair, hurt
and hopelessness. I continued to see him several times over the
past few months and provided him with temporary assistance through
ComCare and NTUC vouchers. I also encouraged him to apply for a
taxi licence because I found out that he had driven a taxi some
years back. Recently, he came to see me again. And this time, he
looked like a completely transformed person with a new lease of
life. He was well dressed, clean shaven and his hair was properly
combed for the first time. He then took out a freshly-minted taxi
licence from his pocket and showed it to me. The pride and joy was
visible on his face, and I was delighted for him. But this resident
is still not out of the woods. He has just started driving, and
needs to earn enough money to pay off his outstanding debts, and
so he still has lingering anxiety and concerns about the future.
And there are probably many others like him – people who have gone
through the roller-coaster ride of the last five years and they
do not feel that their lives have improved, and they worry about
the unexpected twists and turns that may lie ahead. They see prices
and bills going up and they worry about their future and their children's
future. I fully emphathise with these sentiments and our hearts
go out to all those who need help. </p>

steps to strengthen our social safety nets, to look after the lower-income,
the disabled and the elderly. We are working with the many helping hands
in the community to make sure that no one falls through the cracks.
We have, and will continue, to do all we can to address the strains
and stresses that people feel on the ground. Some Members of this
House have suggested that the problems we face today are the results
of the Government's focus on growth. I think the suggestion is completely disingenuous.
To begin with, the Government has never pursued GDP as an end in
itself. Rather, growth has been pursued with a firm commitment to
fairness and as a foundation for broader benefits for all, the provision
of equal opportunity, greater social mobility and a quality of life
that improves with each generation. </p>

are not uniquely heard in this House. There are also heard in other
developed countries where growth becomes tainted by the excesses
of capitalism and financial markets. But they have arisen more fundamentally
due to the pressures in the workplace brought about by globalisation
and the IT revolution. In the past, competition came from low-wage,
low-skilled workers. Now, there is also competition from low-wage,
high-skilled workers. Reading X-rays or filing tax returns can be
done by lower-paid radiologists or accountants. They simply do the
work in India and send the results back the next day via fibre optic
cable.</p>

a US-based solar panel company, decided to build the world's largest
commercial solar R&amp;D centre, it chose Xi'an, China, as the location. Applied
Materials had openings for 260 scientist or technologist jobs. It
received 26,000 applications, 100 times more than there were openings,
and 30% of the people eventually hired had Masters or PhDs. In this
highly connected and interdependent world, there is a wider polarisation
of jobs and employment opportunities. Those who do well are the
ones who can think critically, who can tackle complex non-routine
tasks and who can come up with creative, innovative ideas. All others
are vulnerable to outsourcing or automation. This is contributing
to rising income gaps around the world, and this is at least partly
why there is widespread social malaise and discontent manifesting
itself in protests and street demonstrations in some countries. </p>

of what is happening around us. Singapore is not immune from these
global pressures. But we are in a much stronger position than other countries,
and this is in large part because of the measures taken by the Government. We
have to look at these measures in the context of the economic cycles
over the past decade. In the first half of the decade, it was a
very difficult period for Singapore, for the world and for us. We
had two recessions, overall growth was very slow, and the impact of
all these was felt on our people, on ordinary Singaporeans. The
common call then, if Members will recall, was about jobs. Median
income in the first half was flat, in real terms. At the 20th percentile
it dropped by 11%. Then, the second half came and, at the beginning
of the second half, we could see the opportunities because we could
see the external environment improving. We took full advantage of
these opportunities. This meant more foreign workers. It meant bringing
in more investments. But, ultimately, it meant creating more jobs
for our people. In doing so, it is true that we ran into some infrastructural
bottlenecks – in transport, in hospitals, in housing. We could have decided
not to seize the opportunities and to leave things be. But these
opportunities come in cycles. If we had failed to seize the opportunities
then, our people, Singaporeans, would be worse off today. But because
we did what we did at that time, Singaporeans benefited. And if
you look at the second half of the decade, median incomes rose in
real terms by 11%, from flat in the first half to 11% in the second
half. At the 20th percentile, real incomes rose even more sharply
by 13%, from a drop of 11% in the first half to an increase of 13%
in the second half. Overall, our economic growth for the whole decade
was 5.6% − hardly the outcome of a grow-at-all-cost policy. It was
the Government steering the economy through economic storms, that
enabled us to achieve decent growth. And by doing so, we created
jobs, we raised incomes and we did good for the people.</p>

taken some time to go through the details of what happened to the
last decade because, listening to some of the points that were made
earlier by Members, I do not think a full picture was given to Members
and to Singaporeans. Earlier, Mr Gerald Giam and Mr Chen Show Mao
spoke about the value of diversity, about different views and about
constructive debate in the House, and not scoring political points.
I fully agree with them and I share these views. I hope therefore
that Members of the Workers' Party will look at the data and the
facts of what happened over the past decade, to appreciate the hard
trade-offs that we faced and to understand the basis of the decisions
that were made. Perhaps if Mr Giam does that, then I hope he will be
persuaded that what happened in the last 10 years was not the PAP's
biggest policy failure, as he put it, but the PAP's success in steering
Singapore through difficult times and doing good for our people. </p>

what happened in the last decade, are that very few other countries
have emerged from that period of global turmoil to achieve the kind
of positive result that Singapore did. We made it happen because
of the Government working for the people, because of our policies
to promote sustainable and inclusive growth – growth that benefits
every citizen, strengthens social solidarity and increases living standards
not just for today but for future generations as well. And this
is the way to build a fair, just and inclusive Singapore and, indeed,
to stay true to our founding ideals and achieve happiness, prosperity
and progress for our nation. We want to be a nation where every
citizen has a place, where every contribution is valued, where all
can live in dignity and harmony. We also want to be a gracious,
caring and compassionate society, for the strength of any society
is measured by how well it treats its weakest members. As Singapore
progresses, we must ensure that our vulnerable members are not left behind.
These are high and aspirational goals, but I am confident we can
achieve them because of our people and our spirit. While we should
never rest on our laurels, how we have overcome past challenges
as a nation provides inspiration and strength for how we should
face the future together. </p>

to develop their thinking and problem-solving skills. One parent

be about, and this is what we are seeking to achieve in every class,

a pail with knowledge; it is to light a fire in our young people.
With the right education, both at home and at school, our children
will not only be equipped with skills but will also be fired up
to do great things. For this to happen, we all need to change our
mindsets, to embrace a broader definition of success, and there

These students recognise that a degree is not the only route to

from Ngee Ann Polytechnic in 2000. He commercialised the IT technology
he developed during his studies and started a company with venture
funding from several sources, including the co-founder of Skype.
Darren has been so engrossed in his work that he has deferred his degree
studies for the past 10 years. So we will increase our investments

to ensure that the radar was in good working condition. When they
were asked to extend the deployment of the radar from nine months
to 15 months, the engineers sought advice from the experts. The
radar manufacturers and other armies said that this was mission impossible
− the radar could not function that long under the extreme weather conditions
in Afghanistan. But our engineers made it possible. They improvised
and they came up with their own technical solutions. And this was
done not in civilian comfort at home, but on the battlefield of
Afghanistan. Our boys kept the radar going for the entire 15 months
stretch, enabling the crew to detect all incoming enemy rockets
and saved lives.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I am privileged to rise in support of the Motion
of thanks to the President for his Address. I had intended to demonstrate
some diversity in highlighting two Government policies that I would
like to criticise, but I feel I must digress a little regarding
the points that Mr Gerald Giam made about the healthcare system.
Sir, I realise that this is not an academic convention or a scientific
meeting. It is a political debate and one may argue about the balance
between fact and opinion, perspective and data. It is my humble
opinion that the data Mr Giam quoted is based on flawed study, and
not generalisable to our situation in healthcare regardless of whoever
endorsed it at that time it was done. </p>

location, I would also wholeheartedly endorse the bringing forward
of the timeframe for the building of healthcare facilities in Sengkang. Although
Mr Giam highlighted the issue of total hospital bed capacity, he
failed to highlight the fact that the real issue is one of a balance
between acute hospital bed capacity and chronic and convalesce in
care, which is the largest burden on our relatively excellent healthcare
system, and that this was debated extensively in previous parliaments,
and that the need for a shift in funding towards community care
was already established by the previous Government.</p>

my diverse viewpoints. I would like to speak on two issues which I
believe merit re-examination as to what is the "right thing" for
our citizens. I would also like to use them as examples as to how
we may move forward in considering what we want our society to become.
Should we focus on the hard-headed pragmatic realism or should we
occasionally pay heed to our hearts and emotions? Can we do both?
Is there a role for an ideology in our development as a nation?
How do we go about deciding what values to use as a framework for
policy development?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-905ba90f-7bc3-46b3-88e7-ec902b007922">
                  <a name="president-address__id-905ba90f-7bc3-46b3-88e7-ec902b007922"><!--a--></a>The first issue I would
like to speak on concerns single unwed parents. Before any confusion
arises, let me state categorically that I completely endorse and
support the position that the best family environment for a child
is to have both parents fully engaged in their upbringing. Nevertheless,
that ideal is not always realised or possible, regardless of our
best intentions. Whatever our efforts, the issue of single unwed parents
persists. The numbers of such parents are not huge, but despite
the policy positions taken in this House on occasions in the past,
the incidence of single parenthood is not decreasing, and the issue
continues to affect us in several areas of social work.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2a0cd2b3-2595-49c6-8dab-07964e1efeb7">
                  <a name="president-address__id-2a0cd2b3-2595-49c6-8dab-07964e1efeb7"><!--a--></a>Raising a child can be challenging
enough for a married couple even with the help of an extended family.
More so if a young parent is doing it herself. In examining the inequality
faced by a single unwed parent, I am not advocating any extra assistance above
and beyond what a couple receives, merely that as a family unit
a single parent and her child should not be discriminated against,
and that they should be treated as equal to any family unit and
treated with dignity.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-fec383f1-13c1-47f5-8565-6b42639c0370">
                  <a name="president-address__id-fec383f1-13c1-47f5-8565-6b42639c0370"><!--a--></a>The inequality starts around
the time of birth. A married Singaporean woman is potentially entitled
to 16 weeks of paid maternity leave, half supported by the employer, and
half by the Government. In stark contrast, the employer of a single,
unwed Singaporean woman giving birth to a Singaporean child, is
required to provide eight weeks of paid maternity leave, and a further
four unpaid with no Government funding.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8138c1e9-1dea-42de-9161-639367f0da3f">
                  <a name="president-address__id-8138c1e9-1dea-42de-9161-639367f0da3f"><!--a--></a>Sir, one question I would
ask is who benefits from the maternity leave? Is it purely a reward
for the mother? If so, reducing the amount of maternity leave is
essentially a punishment. In truth, the women who make the choice
to have a child out of wedlock are likely not aware of this specific
consequence, hence the deterrent value is limited. However, maternity
leave also serves a very specific purpose for the well-being and health
of the child. The time allows an increased level of care when the
infant is most at-risk, and also allows the establishment of breastfeeding
which has a measurable, objective impact on the health and development
of the child. Women who have adequate maternity leave are far more
likely to fully breastfeed for the recommended time. While there
are provisions for mothers to claim more maternity benefits if they subsequently
marry, this is a narrow view and only addresses the concept of reward
and not what is in the best interest of the child. Why is it that
we are denying a Singaporean child, during his most vulnerable days,
equality of access to his mother?</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 211</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-fdfe343f-aaf9-492c-becf-0a6316cdfbff">
                  <a name="president-address__id-fdfe343f-aaf9-492c-becf-0a6316cdfbff"><!--a--></a>After birth, the indignity
continues. An unmarried parent will need to adopt the child, for
a fee, if they wish to "regularise" their relationship, according
to MCYS. This adoption is not mandatory but this tack has implications.
This is an affront to the mother who has carried this child for
nine months and gone through labour. Why should the State have to
endorse the relationship between a mother and her child? The social stigma
of being single and unwed is already a huge burden to both parent
and child. Why do we need to add to it, if it fails to reduce the
likelihood that such family units will occur?</p>

the world, the policies that are most likely to reduce single parenthood
address three fundamentals: extending the number of years in formal education,
pro-active sexual health education and the availability of birth
control measures. My purpose here today is not to expound upon these,
but merely to emphasise that punitive measures do not work.</p>

of a single unmarried parent, she is entitled to only two days of
childcare leave per year for a child below the age of seven. The
two days are capped, regardless of the number of children, whereas
married parents are entitled to six days of childcare leave for
children of that age. Is childcare leave a reward to the mother?
Is the inequality a punishment for the single unmarried parent?
Is it part of an effective deterrent? As a father of three, I would
say that such leave is absolutely necessary to allow a parent to
work and yet when needed also care for a child that falls sick.
Withholding it affects the child most of all. Why do we feel a need
to deny a Singaporean child the care of her parent when she falls
sick?</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-4553f7b1-9c42-460c-8d6c-a98cbb7b59d9"><!--a--></a>If I may turn to the problem
of housing, I recognise that HDB exercises considerable judgment
and I have seen single mothers in difficult circumstances rapidly
and effectively assisted appropriately. However, Sir, I question
the logic where a divorcee with a child, a widower with a child,
and even two orphaned siblings can be considered as eligible to
apply for a flat from the HDB as a family unit, but not a single
unwed mother with her child.</p>

                  <a name="president-address__id-b153b9fa-1163-4ef9-98a1-5a3d8228b4e7"><!--a--></a>Sir, a single unwed mother
will not qualify for the tax relief for a foreign domestic worker.
Given the stress of bringing up a child, let alone the difficulty
resulting from doing so on a single income, she needs it most. Consider
what happens when the daughter of an unwed mother grows up. Her
mother is now aged, now dependent and now in poor health. What do
we say to the caregiver? We say, "You are the first source of support
for your mother, we support caregivers in the community; we will
provide help, we will support you in looking after your aged mother."
The relationship has not changed. Contrast the assistance provided
to a single unwed mother with that available for a single, filial
daughter who remains within the family home to care for her mother. How
is it that we feel a need to support and assist one, but punish
and burden the other? Is there here an opportunity to emphasise
our values better?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-26f63374-9079-4026-bb09-1a2b3340e101">
                  <a name="president-address__id-26f63374-9079-4026-bb09-1a2b3340e101"><!--a--></a>Sir, the social stigma and
the challenges of raising a child alone will function as a deterrent.
We should not penalise or punish either the parent or the child.
We should ask what it is that we are trying to achieve. I would
ask: is the Government looking at the unintended negative consequences
that result from the policies affecting single unwed parents? Are
we examining the policies to see if there is an effect on the health, development
and social mobility of the child? Are we looking to see if inter-generational poverty
is more likely to result? Do we care more about a set of stated
principles or do we care more about the effects on our citizens?
If the Government wants to discourage the incidence of single unwed
parents, there are much better ways that do not have such negative
consequences.</p>

up directly affect a small number of Singaporeans, but the presence
of these policies concerns us all as we think of where we want to
go as a nation. They can be reflective of our ability to forgive,
to be compassionate, and to focus on the future. Each policy position
may make specific sense but taken together and examined from an
individual's point of view, they result in an unnecessary burden.
As we build and create societal norms, whether they are old norms
or new norms, we can make decisions about those of our fellow citizens
that fall outside of those norms. Do we ignore them, punish them,
or hope they find their own way? Or do we extend a compassionate
hand, reach outside those norms, reach outside our comfort zones,
and help those who need it?</p>

to another policy which thankfully affects even fewer Singaporeans,
and yet potentially weighs heavily on all of us − the Internal Security
Act (ISA). This issue has been debated extensively both in the House
and in public. In my heart, I feel it inappropriate to detain a
citizen without trial and prior to the act of committing a crime.
I suspect I will hold that personal position for the foreseeable
future. Nevertheless, in my head, I am swayed and perhaps even convinced
by the hard logic that the safety and security of our nation must
be paramount, that there are many number of threats that we face,
and which must be dealt with swiftly and decisively. The world has
changed beyond recognition since the Act was conceived and written. Similarly,
its utility and impact have shifted as the threats to our nation
have changed. This is especially so in the last decade with the
rise of terrorism. In this issue, perhaps the heart has to give
way to the head.</p>

view with many Singaporeans, we understand the need to ensure our
security despite our misgivings. We recognise the cold hard facts
despite the uncomfortable feeling they generate. However, we lack
confidence and assurance that the extraordinary power of a State
to detain its own citizens without trial will not be abused. The
process of the safeguards around the ISA needs to be discussed in
a more transparent manner, even as the facts associated with a given
detainee may need to be kept secret. We need to know that the review
process works and operates independently of Cabinet. We need to
see the President exercising his authority on this issue. We need to
know that the system is robust enough to pick up and deal with potential
abuse. We need to see that there is an understanding that errors
can be made, and that the system will correct these.</p>

the safeguards to prevent the ISA from being abused. Will the Ministry
be introducing further measures to enhance these safeguards? To
what extent can the decisions of Cabinet be challenged? Can Cabinet
challenge the review? Is there an opportunity for independent legal
scrutiny, essentially a judicial review? Should there not be periodic
re-examination of the process and the detainees by an independent party?</p>

the issues I have brought up seem at two ends of the spectrum. One
directly affects our security and stability as a nation. The other
affects individual mothers and children. In one perhaps the heart
needs to listen to the head; in the other perhaps we have been too
hard-headed. Sir, the issues I have brought up will not affect our
GDP, they will not affect our foreign affairs, they will not affect
the vast majority of Singaporeans directly. Nevertheless, I urge
that we re-examine them. How we deal with them reflects our aspirations
for the type of society we want to become. How we move forward in
these, as in other areas, will reflect our intent for the process of
development. What we do with and to those of our fellow citizens

Mr Speaker, a point of clarification in response to <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">Dr Janil Puthucheary. He
said my data and my speech were based on flawed study. Now, let
me quote from the Department of Statistics' Yearbook of Statistics
Singapore 2011. He said that the figures I gave were based on "Acute
Care". That is incorrect. It was based on "Overall Hospital Beds"
in Singapore. The Member was suggesting that there are actually
more beds in the "Extended Care" sector because of our ageing population. That
is actually not true because in 2000, there were 4,007 Extended
Care beds but in 2010, there were 3,172 which is a 20% overall drop.
In the public sector Extended Care alone, there is a 39% drop from
3,292 to 2,010. And the only saving grace actually is in the private
sector which saw an increase from 715 in 2000 to 1,162, that is
a 447-bed increase. But I note that in the footnote it says that
with effect from 2002, the management of Ang Mo Kio-Thye Hua Kwan
Hospital has been handed over to Thye Hua Kwan Moral Society. So,
that probably accounts for the figure in 2005 jumping to 1,302.
But from 2005 to 2010, it has actually dropped off again to 1,162.</span>

literature. I do not take issue with his facts quoting the number
of hospital beds. What I was suggesting was that the improvement
in total bed capacity that is going to occur over the next few years
was a result of far-sighted policy put in place over the last two

Mr Speaker, Sir, I speak in support of the Motion to thank the President
for his speech. Let me provide a little bit more data regarding hospitalisation
since everybody is at this now. I am a visiting consultant to Tan
Tock Seng Hospital as well as Singapore National Eye Centre. From
what I know of the waiting time for hospital beds now in Singapore's
public hospitals: in 2010, the median waiting time is 1.4 hours.
The 95th percentile waiting time is 4.8 hours. This is a significant
improvement from 2007 when the median was 1.5 hours and the 95th percentile
was 6.7 hours. Compared to Western advanced countries with First
World parliaments such as Canada, the median time is 1.7 hours and
the 95th percentile is 15 hours. So, we are actually doing way much
better compared to the West despite our doctors ratio not being
as high and our expenditure not being as high as theirs. In terms of
hospitals having not enough beds: if there are not enough beds,
then why is the waiting time so short?</p>

that I completely agree with MP <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">Chen Show Mao</span> that we are all unique
biological creatures. Every one of us is unique. All 87 elected
MPs are unique, and listening to the speeches, it is obvious we
are all very different. Even among PAP MPs, sometimes I cannot tell
if they are PAP MPs or Opposition MPs. But I can certainly tell
a difference when they are Opposition because they all seem to speak
with one voice, one note.</p>

somebody asked me what the opening of this Parliament was going
to be like. I said it is going to be different from the last five
years that I have experienced. I am waiting eagerly to hear alternative
views, alternative suggestions. MP <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">Chen Show Mao</span> also mentioned that
they are here to provide alternative views. And I was listening
very carefully to my Opposition colleagues and trying to pick up
where are the alternative suggestions. Of the three areas brought
up so far − perhaps esteemed hon. Members can read up the <em class="ph i">Hansard</em> −
we have mentioned about transport, in particular congestion, which
has been aired by me in this House. We have talked about healthcare
− I think <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">Dr Lam Pin
Min</span> has talked about it. HDB problems − many, many of the
MPs have spoken about it. I think we do not need more rhetorics
but we need to help and assist the Executive in providing more solutions,
more suggestions. I totally agree with Minister of State <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">Lawrence Wong</span> when
he said nobody has monopoly over all ideas and all suggestions.
As a result, we should all chip in, all 87 of us, for the betterment
of Singapore; simple as that. </p>

a Singaporean, I am proud of what we have collectively achieved
as a nation over the last 46 years. I have stayed in this country
for 42 years – I was away in the US for one year. We have progressed
from the Third Word to the First World. The journey is by no means
easy and our forefathers worked hard to get us here today. On the
other hand, the direction of the country then was very clear. There
were pressing concerns of unemployment, inadequate housing, lack
of education, racial tensions and population control. The crisis
faced by the country then was daunting but what happened was that
it made the people of Singapore more united and more resolved to
support the Government in tackling all the pressing issues of the
day.</p>

fruits of labour of our forefathers. We are enjoying First World
living standards. The question is, where do we go from here? What
is after the First World? Where are we progressing to? Are we now
in uncharted territories and waters? In fact, increasingly, I believe
the road ahead is actually tougher than when we started. Just like
the Chinese proverb, "starting a business is easy but maintaining
it, keeping it going, is tough". It is now more than ever that we
need a good government with a clear vision, with a clear mission
to rally all Singaporeans together to tackle our challenges ahead
and to write the next chapter of the Singapore Story together. </p>

just before the riots. I chanced upon an article in <em class="ph i">The Daily Telegraph</em> discussing
a very interesting issue – that the Left might actually be right.
We are at the dawn of probably another big ideological revolution,
judging from the protests on Wall Street, in London and many of
the Western cities. One thing that is different is that people in
general have lost faith in the free market, the Western democratic
order and their First World parliament. The greatest capitalist
country in history is now dependent on other people's capital to
survive. Many governments in the West are on the verge of bankruptcy
or are already bankrupt while the private corporations and rich individuals
amass billions. The governments have mismanaged their countries'
finances and now the people are paying the price. I hope we will
not go that way.</p>

who is always so prudent in finances, sometimes in my view to the
point of being stingy. However, I do ponder whether moving to the
Left might actually be right for us, too, in certain issues. I would
like to illustrate this with two points – one, our housing policy;
and the other, our retirement adequacy. </p>

come as a nation, we must not forget how we got here. Every system
that we have created, built and developed has always been in response
to the needs of the people of Singapore at that point in time. Take,
for example, HDB. Homeownership is the key mission. The HDB came
into being as a response to a severe housing shortage at a time
when people lived in squatter settlements and squalid conditions.
The original intention was homeownership for the people. I firmly
believe it should remain so. The low-cost housing was priced likewise
and everyone was contented to have a roof over his head that he
could call "home". </p>

flat cost $6,200. In the 1980s, a 4-room flat cost $85,000. Prices
moved up due to various reasons as we progressed. In fact, the value
of HDB flats continued to be supported by the Government's Asset
Enhancement programmes such as MUP, IUP, and later the LUP and the
HIP. These massive programmes are costly but the Government undertook
them as a means of wealth transfer to HDB dwellers and to the general
public. The policy to regard HDB flats as an asset rather than just homeownership
could be right at that point in time but, in my opinion, it may
have gone a bit overboard. Although HDB flats are 99-year leasehold
properties, they behave like freehold properties as there is hardly
any reduction in price as the flats age. A 30-year old 3-room flat
in Ang Mo Kio costs more than a brand new three-room flat in a non-mature
estate. This is never the case with a 99-year leasehold private
property. </p>

upgrade to a private property were not allowed to retain their HDB
flat ownership. It was mandatory for them to sell the flat in the
open market such that these flats are released back or recycled
back to the market to supplement the supply. But now, HDB flat owners
who have completed their minimum occupancy period are allowed to
retain their HDB flats when they upgrade to private properties. They
are allowed to rent out the whole unit to gain recurrent rental
income from their subsidised HDB flats. The large influx of foreigners
during the last few years has driven up the demand and hence the
rental rate of HDB flats. Allowing PRs to purchase HDB flats has
also added pressure to the already high demand. The resale market
is driven sky high by people who cannot wait for a Built-to-Order
flat or are afraid that prices may increase if they wait further
or they are afraid that their salary may go up by the next salary
increment and they will miss out the chance to buy an HDB flat.</p>

5-room flat in the resale market. At the rate we are going, we will
be seeing $1 million HDB flats quite soon. It is a paradox that
we see more people losing their HDB flats when our economy performs
well and when HDB flat prices rise, many monetise their flats for
a quick profit and for various reasons. Personally, I do not think
that over-investment in property is good in general for our country.
In the 1990s, Japan was also done in by high property prices domestically
and likewise in the US in 2007. There are signs that China may be
heading for the same direction. Our excessive investments in property
do not generate more jobs, more services or more goods for the country.
On the contrary, over-investment in property will result in less disposable
income for other investments that may generate jobs, services or
goods. There will be less disposable income for other personal pursuits
including further education, health and family needs.</p>

of an HDB flat is akin to a dwindled CPF account at retirement,
a time when we expect to sit back and enjoy our hard-earned savings.
It takes one up to 25 years to fully repay his loan, by which time
the average Singaporean would have depleted the bulk of his retirement
savings in his CPF account. </p>

of HDB flats has risen over the years in tandem with costs, but
the question of affordability enters one's mind. In turn, everyone
now who owns a brand new HDB flat dreams of the day, five years
later, when he can liquidate his investment for a tidy profit for
himself. The original objective of pure homeownership has turned
into one of a stepping stone to upgrade oneself. Not that having
a better life is a bad thing but we have to bear in mind that there
are those who are only asking for a roof over their heads and because
of the consistent and ever-increasing prices of an HDB flat, they
are forever chasing but never attaining the Singapore dream of affordable home
for all citizens. </p>

for our retirement? I think we have argued on this topic before
where we talked about CPF LIFE policy. CPF was originally intended
as a savings scheme to meet our basic needs for old age. We all
know that we are ageing and we all hope that every individual Singaporean
has a comfortable nest egg to take care of his own needs in old
age without having to rely too much on the younger generation. CPF LIFE
annuity plan was introduced a few years ago which I fully supported. </p>

more and more requests to use the CPF for other purposes such as

housing needs. </p>

do more to help with the retirement financing of this group and
also for homemakers who have no CPF at all. One suggestion is to
move towards the left by the formation of a common pool pension
fund apart from CPF where everyone contributes according to their
income level but disbursed equally to all aged Singaporeans. This
can be done in addition to our current CPF LIFE scheme to supplement
Singapore's retirement adequacy. </p>

of demand − I am glad that the Government in the Addendum to the
President's Address stated the intent to build facilities ahead
of demand. Part of the reason why non-mature estate was not popular
was the lack of facilities. The early settlers and pioneers of HDB
estates were penalised as such. Instead of a first movers' advantage,
I coined it the first movers' disadvantage. </p>

for certain facilities such as airport and seaport, the Government
takes a long-term view and builds much ahead of demand. But for
HDB estate facilities such as swimming pool and stadium, the Government
takes a different approach. Investments in such facilities may not
expand our GDP directly but may have many intangible benefits such
as promoting a healthier and happier population, as my Workers'
Party's colleague has mentioned. Sports facilities and hawker centres
are also a magnet for people to congregate as well as mingle. They
serve as platforms for a closer community and play an important
role in community building. </p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang)</strong>
                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in support of the Motion of thanks
to the President. The President had emphasised the concepts of "inclusive
growth" and "quality growth" in his Address to the Parliament. These
are two points which are close to my heart and I wish to share my
humble perspectives on these with the House. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a2c64b51-a5ac-465d-878c-f6118bb39848">
                  <a name="president-address__id-a2c64b51-a5ac-465d-878c-f6118bb39848"><!--a--></a>It appears that the word
"growth" has somewhat taken on a negative connotation recently,
and it seems almost fashionable to associate it with a government
that blindly pursues it at the expense of Singaporeans. This cannot
be further from the truth. It was therefore timely for the President
to remind us that this Government is very much focused on achieving
what he described as "inclusive and quality growth", which is "growth"
that the majority of Singaporeans can and will benefit from. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-84baf348-a847-4ffb-8d48-bb95a3fb66e8">
                  <a name="president-address__id-84baf348-a847-4ffb-8d48-bb95a3fb66e8"><!--a--></a>What is growth? Stripped
to its fundamentals, growth, to me, means jobs. It means livelihood
for our people. It allows Singaporeans to afford better housing,
better transport, better education, and better healthcare. Most
importantly, it allows Singaporeans to aspire towards a better life
for themselves and their families. Without growth, in the words
of the late Dr Goh Keng Swee, we will die as a nation. </p>

the Government caring and being compassionate to our citizens. There
remains yet to be seen a better form of welfare than a government working
to provide ample job opportunities for its citizenry. During the
recent financial crisis of 2008, I have seen firsthand what joblessness
does to a person, and I can attest to the fear and anxiety associated
with being unemployed. A government which is focused on providing
a livelihood for its citizens is, to my mind, a government that
has the utmost concern for its citizens' welfare at heart. </p>

a willingness to work hard and to better ourselves as our fathers,
and their fathers, did. We can be very certain that if this country
is not prepared to work hard and remain competitive, there are many
countries out there which are more than willing to take our place
in the global economy and to take away our rice bowls. No one owes
us a living.</p>

emphasis that managing the economy well is not an exact science.
This uncertainty is compounded by the inevitable reality of globalisation.
As the world's economies become much more intertwined, the storms
that rage in other parts of the world have the potential of affecting
our tiny island with greater acuity. As Lord Peter Mandelson alluded
to during his recent visit to Singapore, with globalisation, what governments
can do become less and less effective.</p>

as saying we sacrifice a point of GDP for a point of Gross National
Happiness (GNH). The right thing to do therefore is to make hay
while the sun shines. This is so that when the menacing storm clouds
gather over us, we can rest assured that we had, over the years,
garnered sufficient financial resources to keep ourselves warm.
Indeed, a government which neglects to provision for contingencies will
be remiss in its duties to the people. </p>

that we have seen no real wage growth in the income for the bottom
20% of the workforce, notwithstanding the fact that the Singapore
economy as a whole has moved forward in the last 10 years. But if
I may remind this House, taking this proposition in its converse,
I shudder to think what the real wage growth for the bottom 20%
will be if the economy has not grown at all. Will it be negative
perhaps? How then will this House answer to her people?</p>

there must be growth. This is first and foremost. How then do we
ensure that the Singaporean brand of "growth" is inclusive and of
high quality? A very tall order indeed. This Government has through
the years demonstrated that she is in tune with the concerns and
aspirations of Singaporeans. The watershed election in May brought
into sharper focus the fact that Singaporeans expect even more from
the Government. I have no doubt that this Government will be able
to rise to the occasion.</p>

Minister set a tangible target of 30% growth of the median wage
in the next 10 years. He had during the Budget Debate of 2011 explained
in detail how the Government hopes to achieve this. This is an ambitious
target and I applaud the Finance Minister for this. For as any statistician
will say, it is extremely difficult to target something such as
the median. However, the difficult thing to do is often the right
thing to do. </p>

the shorter term? For a worker in the bottom 20% of the wage structure,
he is concerned with cost of living issues. How will he face inflationary pressures?
He is concerned with the price of utilities, food, transport, housing, healthcare,
all basic necessities of life. He might be a 45-year-old sole breadwinner
to a family of four, armed with a primary school or secondary school
education in a blue-collar position. He is worried about foreigners
who might be abroad or in Singapore, and who expect lower wages
and are willing to work for longer hours than he is. In short, he is
worried that he may become uncompetitive. These are concerns which
this Government must meet with the greatest urgency.</p>

is to retrain him with more marketable skills, increase his productivity
so that he is competitive again. However, it is not always possible
to alleviate the short-term sufferings associated with structural
unemployment problems through these measures. I would propose that
the Finance Minister consider extending targeted dosages of "grow
and care" packages for this group of Singaporeans. This, I believe,
will go a long way to alleviate his fears and to assure him that
the Government is there to help him deal with the immediate concerns
of cost of living.</p>

the Government must continue its policy to create multiple peaks
of excellence in its educational programmes. The vagaries of the
global economy necessitates that we have a supple and well diversified
workforce. We cannot be sure where the next area of growth will
be, but we must ensure that we provide a conducive environment for
our young to pursue their passions − be it in the sciences, medicine,

a platform exists in Singapore for them to take centre stage and

MP (NMP) Scheme was introduced in 1990 − a move to appoint (instead

politics to have a voice and/or present alternate views in Parliament.</p>

Scheme was instituted in 1991 and transformed the presidency from
a ceremonial head of state to a directly elected office with additional power
to safeguard Singapore's rich financial reserves. The move was intended
to ensure institutional checks to prevent any irresponsible government
in raiding our national reserves, subjecting our country to economic
loss. </p>

the President alluded to is indeed an awakened, no-holds-barred
world facilitated by an open-access, free-speech new media. Even
in new media, evolution is taking place. The emergence of moderate
voices in both pro-Government and pro-Opposition online communities
are signs of a politically maturing electorate. I was encouraged
recently to read several postings by pro-Opposition netizens who
chided their online peers for their hobby of posting videos and photographs
depicting often poor, vulnerable, elderly individuals without the
intent to help the individuals. These moderate voices demanded that
instead of simply publicising these stories on cyberspace, netizens
have the duty to direct them to the relevant agencies, or even their
MPs for necessary help.</p>

backdrop which also features the many vocal PAP backbenchers and
Opposition MPs in this House, I believe it is time for a review
of the current political blueprint of Singapore. It is time for
the Government to study the relevance of the modifications it has
made to the political system thus far, and consider the merits of
reverting to the parliamentary democracy system that trusts an electorate to
vote and be represented by the candidates they elect to office.
I believe that there is no need for the Ruling party to play the
paternal role and artificially inject alternative voices in Parliament
or install additional checks on elected representatives of Singaporeans. </p>

to examine if the created offices of NMP, NCMP and EP are still
relevant in today's new political environment. If the conditions
under which they were introduced are no longer the same, let us
have the courage to slay these sacred cows before they become overgrown
and irrelevant. </p>

policy area that I strongly seek clarity is in funding public services.
Wikipedia defines "public services" to mean services provided by
government to its citizens, either directly (through the public
sector) or by financing providers for services that are deemed desirable
for outsourcing or are under or not provided by the private sector.
The term "public service" is associated with a social consensus
that certain services should be available to all, regardless of
income and are expected to be provided by government. </p>

that asking for more money or funds is becoming a standard conversation
piece in most dialogues held between Government agencies and especially
Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) who are often assigned the
task of providing some form of public good or other community services. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-569d686a-2881-47e6-8f42-3e868f313a26">

between (1) how much the Government thinks it should be funding,
eg, social services; and (2) how much the public and service providers
expect and demand. Prime Minister Lee has a point when he cautioned
VWOs at the ComCare Fifth Anniversary event last December, and I
quote, "We should always be mindful that welfare schemes start with
the best of intentions but, over time, they grow, they get bigger,
they get more comprehensive and they build up into a taxing burden,
because they are easy to implement, easy to expand, hard to trim,
impossible to stop." While I fully agree with the Prime Minister
about the danger of unstoppable welfare services, I think it is
also important for us to clarify on what constitutes welfare schemes
and what are essential services that the people expect the State
to provide and fund.</p>

crucial conversations take place between Government and the rest
of Singapore to clarify and try to seek consensus in which and how
public services are funded and charged. In modern developed countries,
the term "public services" often covers education, public transportation,
town planning, public housing, healthcare, military, police, fire
services, broadcasting, waste management and social services, especially
for the disadvantaged. </p>

of their services need a framework that provides more clarity in
funding philosophy and guidelines that take into account at least
three kinds of services – essential services, community services
and other form of services:</p>

public goods such as healthcare, education of both mainstream and
special schools, public housing, national security services and
welfare for the vulnerable; </p>

support Government strategies such as eldercare, active ageing,
health promotions, disability support and assistance for the poor;
and </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4230dccb-0bbe-4b51-bd8f-bbf3b0037831">

by public-spirited parties who wish to promote better quality of
life such as Make A Wish Foundation which grants wishes to children
with chronic illnesses and Food From The Heart which distributes
unsold food items to the poor through a volunteer network. </p>

be a public good, and outsourced, then the provider should be treated
as any outsourced vendor and be paid a competitive price. An appointed provider
should not then have to pitch and raise funds either directly or
through agents such as the National Council of Social Services (NCSS)
to pay for their basic operational cost. </p>

for instance, the State should be bearing the full cost of operating
the special schools for agreed expected outcomes. But the current
funding formula which calls for 75% funding by MOE and 25% by NCSS
seems to reflect a lack of clarity on whether special education
is a public good. Formulae of this nature make little sense, complicate
the reporting matrix and distract our special school leaders from their
core education mission. I therefore recommend a review of the funding
policies and practices of public and other community services and
ask for more clarity in this area. </p>

and non-English-speaking workforce, Sir, the "Occupy" movement which

I applaud the excellent work of the Government in helping Singapore

feat I often feel is under-stated and under-appreciated. I support
the strategy of increasing the real incomes of Singaporeans through
productivity enhancements. </p>

Glam, which houses many uneducated or less-educated, elderly and
poor. I often have to seek jobs, with the help of other agencies.
Because of their profiles, many of these residents were placed in
the security and cleaning industries – a fact which often disturbs
me. I now fear that the new productivity movement which emphasises
multi-plexing job scopes and higher value-add and, in many cases,
English proficiency, are no longer within the reach of my residents.
The security industry, for instance, which reported a higher increase
in average income due to better designed higher-value jobs, now
appears to be not so accessible to those who do not qualify. Many
of my people seem to be resigned now to a career cleaning and picking
up after other people. </p>

− still on the subject of conscience − recently, when I asked a
youth with special needs what "Family" meant, he said "Ohana" –
a term echoed from his favourite cartoon "Lilo and Stitch". When
I further asked what the Hawaiian word "Ohana" meant, the teenager
repeated what he heard from TV, "Ohana means €˜family'. Family means
nobody gets left behind or forgotten." Although I am not quite sure
he understood what he said or repeated, I felt the words were profound
and they reminded me and my fellow volunteers to persevere and plod
on to not leave behind or forget those who are vulnerable and at
risk in our society. </p>

a congenital condition, he is not covered under the MediShield,
the national medical insurance plan. If a special-needs child needs
special education, he cannot be guaranteed of a good education because
the quality of education he receives is determined by the aspiration
and expectation of the charity leader who operates his special school.
Unlike his mainstream peers, his school records are likely to be
stored in an Excel spreadsheet or database rather than the sophisticated million-dollar
IT student tracking and records system that only Government can
afford for other students of his same age. The special school students'

means physically barely surviving, one worries about getting one's
next meal or a roof over one's head. Whilst the majority of Singaporeans are
not at this survival level, there are nonetheless some who fall
through the holes of our social safety net and it is the duty of
both the Government and people to find them and help them; to move
them from survival to the next level. </p>

it concerns the pursuit of happiness for oneself; happiness being
defined as, all of us agree, more than the chase for GDP, encompassing
quality of life factors like owning a home of one's choice, elevators
that never break down, an environment that is free of air and noise
pollution, worklife balance, financial security, and the like. I
assume that is what the other Members of the House were talking
about yesterday, and that is happiness, success.</p>

level of living – significance – that Singapore can be a truly inspiring
place to live in. Significance goes beyond looking out for the interest
of oneself and one's family only. It is not simply reading the President's
Address, play the role of critique, and holding other people accountable
to pursue the Singapore Dream. It is not simply having something
to live on, but something to live for. It is applying conscience and
courage to stick our necks out, roll up our sleeves, give up some
of our own comfort and convenience to add value to the lives of
other people, especially those who are at risk of being left behind
or forgotten; perhaps not just within Singapore but also in communities
who are barely surviving beyond the shores of Singapore, our neighbours. </p>

Government and Singaporeans to apply courage, clarity and conscience
as we partner to create a better future for all of us. And I pledge
my best to help Singapore achieve not just success but significance.
With that, Sir, I support the Motion. [<em class="ph i">Applause</em>.]</p>
