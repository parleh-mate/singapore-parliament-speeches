<div align="center"><b>INSTITUTE OF ESTATE AGENTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Waiver of agency commission)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following question stood in the name of Dr Teo Ho

Pin -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To ask the Minister for Trade and Industry whether

his  Ministry  will take a stand on the recent  move  by  the

Institute  of  Estate  Agents to restrict  its  members  from

waiving their agency commission.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Question No. 1.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, although we do not have

specific  legislation against price fixing  or  cartels,  the

Government's  policy is to discourage them.  For  markets  to

work  well  there must be free competition, not collusion  or

price fixing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the Government has been progressively

liberalising sectors such as telecommunications, finance  and

power.   In  the  areas where prices have traditionally  been

fixed,  such  as conveyancing fees, stockbroking  commissions

and interest rates for chequing accounts, we have now allowed

the  market  to  set prices.  In other words, the  Government

strongly  encourages  price competition.   For  instance,  we

facilitate parallel imports of motorcars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In promoting greater competition in our economy,

Singapore  has  not  taken the approach  of  implementing  an

umbrella competition law as in OECD countries because  it  is

complicated  and  can reduce business flexibility.   MTI  has

found  moral  suasion  effective  when  the  occasional  case

occurs.  We will, however, review the need for legislation.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE AIRLINES AND COST OF TICKET</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Name of passenger's contact person and telephone number)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following question stood in the name of Mr Chiam See Tong -

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To ask the Minister for Communications and

Information  Technology  (a)  whether  he  will  suggest   to

Singapore Airlines that every passenger be required  to  give

the  name  of the contact person and his telephone number  at

the  check-in counter before a flight departure; and (b)  why

does  an  SIA ticket cost more than that of any other airline

for  a  Singaporean  flying  to  the  same  destination  from

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Question No. 2,

Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, SIA

relies  on the contact numbers provided by passengers at  the

point  of  booking their tickets if they have to contact  the

passenger  or  the next-of-kin.  Currently,  it  is  not  the

standard  industry practice for airlines  to  take  down  the

particulars  of passengers' next-of-kin.  Singapore  Airlines

would  have to assess how to reconcile the need for essential

passenger  information  without compromising  its  speed  and

efficiency.   It  would also have to take  into  account  the

sensitivity of some passengers who might not wish to  provide

personal  information  to the airline.   Nonetheless,  I  can

convey Mr Chiam's suggestion to SIA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the question on SIA's ticket pricing, the Civil

Aviation  Authority of Singapore does not  intervene  in  the

pricing   policies  of  airlines  operating   in   Singapore.

Singapore is a major international aviation hub with over  60

airlines operating here.  Airlines price their tickets  based

on commercial considerations and consumers are free to choose

the  airlines which best suit their requirements in terms  of

services,  price, routing and flight frequencies,  etc.   The

prices  of airline tickets are therefore determined by market

forces.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Does the Minister not

think  that something is amiss when Singaporeans are made  to

pay  higher prices than foreigners when they buy SIA  tickets

in Singapore?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, foreigners buying tickets in

Singapore pay the same price as any Singaporean.   The market

forces are at play.  There are many airlines operating out of

Singapore, and there are many airlines flying the same routes

as SIA.  So consumers should choose carefully.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, but in the case of SIA,

Singaporeans prefer to fly by SIA and they are made to pay  a

higher  price.   In  a  way, they are forced  to  take  other

airlines.  Do you not think there is something wrong there?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I do not think anybody forces

Singaporeans to fly on either SIA or any other  airline.   In

fact,  many Singaporeans fly on non-SQ flights.  I think  the

market  is a very open one.  As with every product and  every

service,  if  a  product or service is of a  higher  quality,

normally  a premium will be applied, and we leave it  to  the

market to determine whether a premium is applicable.  In  the

case of airline tickets, the same mechanism applies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, that is the point. When

Singaporeans  fly in other airlines, and they start  to  talk

with their fellow passengers, and they found out that we  are

from  Singapore, they would wonder, "How come you  never  fly

your  own SIA airline?"  What are you going to tell the other

person?   Tell  him that we have to pay more?   Does  it  not

sound rather embarrassing for Singaporeans?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> I do not think there is anything

embarrassing about buying non-Singapore products.

<div align="center"><b>STAMP DUTIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the  Bill  be  now

read a Second time."

<br><br><i>Introduction</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Stamp Duties Act to give

legislative authority to the tax changes announced in  Budget

2000.

<br><br><i>Rationale</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current section 15 of the Stamp Duties Act provides

stamp  duty  relief for corporate restructuring and  mergers.

Relief  from ad valorem duty is given based on the  principle

that there will be no substantial change in ownership of  the

transferred  assets.  As section 15 is a  relieving  section,

several conditions have been set for the concession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recognition that companies restructure and merge to

obtain  greater  synergy,  achieve cost  competitiveness  and

deliver   better   products  and  services  to   increasingly

sophisticated  consumers, Dr Richard Hu announced  in  Budget

2000  that  the  conditions for section  15  relief  will  be

relaxed so that more companies can enjoy the tax savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Hu also announced that relief would be granted to a

transfer of assets between associated companies.  This relief

was previously not available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To effect the above changes, the Bill repeals the

current  section 15 and introduces a new section 15 to  allow

ad valorem duty relief for:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a transfer of the undertaking or shares in respect

of  a  scheme  for  the  reconstruction  or  amalgamation  of

companies; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the transfer, conveyance or assignment of any

beneficial   interest   in  any  asset   between   associated

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent abuse and to limit the concession to

deserving  restructuring and merger schemes, we have  imposed

qualifying conditions. The conditions to be imposed have been

announced  via  a  circular  issued  by  the  Inland  Revenue

Authority of Singapore.  The expanded relief scheme has  been

effected administratively since 1st July 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response to the expanded relief scheme has been

encouraging. We will continue to monitor industry trends  and

amend  the conditions when necessary, to make sure that  they

remain relevant to the business community.

<div align="center"><b>GOODS AND SERVICES TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the  Bill  be  now

read a Second time."

<br><br><i>Introduction</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Goods and Services Tax Act

to give legislative effect to the change in tax treatment for

trustee services announced in the 2000 Budget Statement.   It

also  incorporates  two other amendments  to  the  Goods  and

Services Tax Act.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Change   in  tax  treatment  announced  in  the  2000  Budget Statement</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have earlier in the fiscal year 2000 Budget announced

that  trustee  services  supplied  by  trustees  situated  in

Singapore  that satisfy the following two conditions  can  be

zero-rated.  Firstly, at least 80% of the value of the  trust

property  is contributed by overseas settlors, and  secondly,

at  least  80%  of  the beneficiaries and settlors  are  non-residents of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cardinal principle underlying the Goods and Services

Tax  is that it is a tax on domestic consumption of goods and

services.   Before  the  above changes  were  announced,  the

provision  of trustee services by a trustee to the  trust  is

standard-rated even if the settlors and beneficiaries of  the

trust   are   all  or  mostly  foreigners,  as  the   trustee

representing  the  trust is situated in Singapore.   In  such

cases, there is in-principle no domestic consumption, as  the

recipients of the services are in fact the beneficiaries  and

the settlors who are foreigners.  Therefore, to put Singapore

trustees   on  a  more  competitive  footing  with   offshore

trustees,  I  have decided to zero-rate the trustee  services

provided by the local trustee for such cases.  Section 21  of

the GST Act will be amended for this purpose.

<br><br><i>Changes to the Act not arising from the 2000 Budget Statement</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this amendment, the following amendments

will also be made to the GST Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections 33(3) of the GST Act will be amended to specify

the  rules  to  be  used  by a local taxable  person  who  is

entrusted  by his overseas clients to import and  supply  the

goods  in Singapore.  The rules will provide greater  clarity

to  businesses to determine the circumstances in  which  they

can  claim the GST paid on the goods imported and to  account

for GST on any supply of such goods in Singapore, as if he is

the   person  making  the  supply.   Arising  from  this,   a

consequential amendment will also be made to section 33(1).

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>

These amendments will serve to provide clarity to businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new section 34A will be inserted to the Act to deem

input  tax  as  being deducted by the transferee  for  assets

transferred under a "Transfer of Business as a Going  Concern

(TOGC)"  arrangement.   This is to  place  a  transferee  who

acquires assets under a TOGC on par with other GST-registered

traders who purchase assets and pay the GST.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.

<div align="center"><b>CUSTOMS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the  Bill  be  now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Customs Act to give

legislative effect to a change of definition of customs  duty

to  exclude  excise duty.  It also incorporates  three  other

amendments to the Customs Act.

<br><br><i>Re-definition of Customs Duty</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, our Customs Act defines customs duty as `any

import  or  excise duty imposed by or under  this  Act'.  The

common  international practice is that  customs  duty  refers

exclusively  to  tariffs  applied  on  imported   goods   for

protective  and  other  trade policy purposes.   Our  current

definition  of customs duty may therefore cause confusion  to

our trading partners since it also includes excise duty which

is  applied in a non-discriminatory manner on imported  goods

and  locally  manufactured  products  for  fiscal  and  other

domestic policy purposes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make clear to our trading partners the respective

purposes  of our customs duty and excise duty, our definition

of customs duty should be amended to exclude excise duty.  In

this  connection,  a  new  subsection  10(1A)  will  also  be

inserted  to state clearly that excise duty shall be  imposed

in  a  non-discriminatory basis regardless of  the  place  of

origin  or manufacture of the goods.  For equal treatment  of

imported  goods  and locally manufactured goods,  section  22

will also be amended so that the same basis of valuation will

be  applied on imported goods and locally manufactured  goods

for the purposes of levying excise duty.

<br><br><i>Other Changes to the Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the aforementioned amendments, the

following amendments will also be made to the Customs Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, all sellers of liquors must apply for a

licence.   A  new  subsection 71(3A)  would  be  inserted  to

empower  the  Minister to exempt any person  from  having  to

apply  for  a  licence  for the sale of  liquors  subject  to

conditions  imposed  by the Minister.   This  amendment  will

allow individuals who sell small quantities of liquors to  be

exempted from applying for a licence.  An example would be  a

person  who  wants to auction a few bottles of  his  personal

collection of wine through the Internet.  We have decided  to

cap the sales limit at 9 litres per calendar year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 75 provides for specific duties and requirements

to   be   imposed  on  persons  licensed  for  the  sale   of

intoxicating liquors. This section will be repealed. The  new

section   75  will  enable  the  Minister  to  prescribe   by

regulations  certain  duties  and  requirements  of   persons

licensed  to sell liquors.  This will give us the flexibility

to  revise  those  duties and requirements to  keep  up  with

changing circumstances without having to amend the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, a new section 90E will be inserted to require

every  importer and exporter of dutiable goods and his agents

to retain specified documents relating to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>

the  goods  for not less than seven years.  This new  section

will  facilitate the enforcement of other provisions  of  the

Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 2000, the Government announced that, with

effect from 1st of January 2001, CPF members would be allowed

to  invest  their Special Account savings in  the  lower-risk

financial   instruments  that  are  suitable  for  retirement

savings.   The  CPF (Amendment) Bill before the  House  today

seeks  to  amend the CPF Act to allow for the  withdrawal  of

moneys  from  the  Special Account for approved  investments.

The  Bill  also  seeks to amend the CPF  Act  to  enable  the

implementation of new schemes announced by the  Minister  for

Finance  at the financial year 2000 Budget Statement  and  to

give effect to other changes to better serve CPF members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the investment of Special Account fund. Since

its  introduction in July 1977, the CPF Special  Account  had

remained  the  most  protected  portion  of  a  CPF  member's

savings.   Over  the years, we had gradually liberalised  the

CPF  rules to allow members to use savings in their  Ordinary

Account  to  purchase homes, invest in shares, buy  insurance

policies, unit trusts, or even place in fixed deposits.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>

Only   the  savings  in  the  Special  Account  had  remained

untouched.  Why?  Because the Special Account was seen  as  a

member's  cash  savings  for  his  retirement.   The  Special

Account  complements  the Minimum Sum  Scheme.   This  is  so

because, for most of the CPF members, the cash needed  to  be

set  aside  for the Minimum Sum would come largely  from  the

Special  Account savings.  Most members by age 55 would  have

withdrawn  a  large part of the Ordinary Account  savings  to

finance  the  purchase of their homes.   Hence,  the  Special

Account would provide most of the cash savings for their old-age needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 1999, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on

Ageing Population recommended that Special Account savings in

excess  of  the  Minimum Sum be allowed  for  investments  in

retirement-related instruments.  The Committee concluded that

there  are in existence today adequate avenues for  low  risk

long-term  investments which can help CPF members to  enhance

their  old-age  cash savings.  The Government  accepted  this

recommendation  to give CPF members the opportunity  to  earn

higher returns on their retirement savings.  On closer study,

my  Ministry  concluded  that by  restricting  the  class  of

retirement-related instruments, we did not even  require  CPF

members to lock up the Minimum Sum.  In other words,  it  was

possible  to  allow members to invest all  of  their  Special

Account savings in such a retirement-related instrument.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the basic principle that the Special Account

savings should not be exposed to high investment risk remains

valid.   Hence, such investment should not go  to  high  risk

high  return  speculative instruments.  We  have  to  make  a

risk/return  trade-off and balance the goal of  enabling  CPF

members  to  earn higher returns against the  fact  that  the

Special  Account savings represent the basic safety  net  for

many  Singaporeans.   The advantage of allowing  all  Special

Account  funds,  including  the  Minimum  Sum,  for  approved

investments  is  to encourage our citizens  to  take  greater

responsibility  for  their  old  age  security  and  to  take

financial planning more seriously.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to reduce the exposure of Special Account savings

to  investment  risk,  only lower-risk instruments  would  be

allowed.  Products that are suitable for investment using the

Special  Account  savings  include long-term  bank  deposits;

deferred  annuities; endowment insurance policies;  Singapore

Government/statutory board and other bonds guaranteed by  the

Government;  and  selected unit trusts and  investment-linked

insurance policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list of approved unit trusts and investment-linked

insurance policies will be based on the lowest three tiers of

the   Risk  Classification  System  adopted  under  the   CPF

Investment Scheme.  These comprise mainly money market, fixed

income  and  balanced  funds.  Higher risk  unit  trusts  and

investment-linked policies, comprising funds wholly or mainly

invested  in equities, will not be allowed under the  scheme.

CPF  members  are  also not allowed to invest  their  Special

Account  savings in individual stocks and gold.  This  is  to

prevent  their Special Account savings from being exposed  to

unhedged risks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the CPF Act currently does not have any

provision to allow the withdrawal of Special Account  savings

for investment, clause 4 of the Bill amends section 13(1)  of

the  Act  to  allow  moneys from the Special  Account  to  be

withdrawn  for  approved investments under  existing  section

77(1)(m).   This will give CPF members wider access  to  more

investment  options.   However, as with any  investment,  CPF

members  would have to exercise careful judgement and  decide

for  themselves  the level of risk that they are  willing  to

take  in their investment decision.  If they take a long-term

view  and  exercise prudence in their investments,  they  are

likely  to  enhance  their old-age  savings  to  better  meet

retirement  needs.  But if CPF members do not  wish  to  risk

investing their CPF savings, they can keep their savings with

the CPF Board which provides a guaranteed minimum return of 2

1/2%  for savings in the Ordinary Account and 4% for  savings

in the Special Account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now touch on the amendments affecting the

Budget 2000 measures.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>

Currently, under the Minimum Sum Scheme, a member  may,  upon

reaching  age 55, leave his Minimum Sum with the  CPF  Board,

deposit  it with an approved bank or use it to buy an annuity

from  an  insurance company.  CPF savings in  excess  of  the

Minimum Sum can be withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage more prudent financial planning with CPF

savings,  Finance  Minister announced in  the  FY2000  Budget

Statement that the current tax exemption for annuities bought

with  the  Minimum Sum would be extended to annuities  bought

with  CPF  savings  beyond the Minimum  Sum.   The  same  tax

treatment  would be accorded to interest income arising  from

CPF  savings  beyond the Minimum Sum deposited with  approved

banks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill introduces a new section 15B to

provide  that  a member who is entitled to withdraw  his  CPF

savings  may  set aside, in addition to the Minimum  Sum,  an

additional sum and deposit it with any approved bank  or  use

it  to buy any approved annuity.  CPF members will enjoy  tax

exemption on the monthly withdrawals from this additional sum

set aside.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Finance Minister's FY2000 Budget Statement, he had

also  announced  that  the tax relief for  cash  top-ups  for

parents  under  the Minimum Sum Topping-Up  Scheme  would  be

extended  to grandparents with effect from Year of Assessment

2001.   Clause 7 amends section 18 of the CPF Act  to  extend

the Minimum Sum Topping-Up Scheme to grandparents.  This will

help  to  strengthen the multi-generational family bonds  and

reinforce  the Asian tradition of looking after  our  parents

and  grandparents in their old age.  Clause 9 amends  section

19 to provide for the monies paid to a member's grandparents'

retirement  account  shall, on the  grandparents'  death,  be

returned to the account of the member who made the payment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will now touch on the CPF Home

Protection  Insurance  Scheme and the Dependant's  Protection

Insurance Scheme.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Home Protection Insurance Scheme was introduced

to  protect CPF members and their families from losing  their

HDB  flats  should  the  insured die  or  become  permanently

incapacitated before their housing loans are  paid  up.   The

Dependant's  Protection Insurance Scheme aims to provide  CPF

members and their dependants with financial assistance in the

event that the insured member becomes permanently disabled or

die prematurely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, under both insurance schemes, claims are not

payable  if  the  death or permanent injury  of  the  insured

member  arising from deliberate self-injury occurs  within  1

year from the date that he is insured under the schemes.  The

1-year  time  bar  is imposed to prevent abuse  where  a  CPF

member  may intentionally join the schemes before he attempts

to  commit  suicide.   This  policy  is  valid  and  will  be

continued.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are cases where the act of suicide is

committed  within  the 1-year period but  the  death  happens

after  the  period.   Claims for such  cases  should  not  be

accepted, as the intention to inflict self-injury within  the

time bar has been made clear.  Similarly, the 1-year time bar

would  apply  in  cases where the insured member's  death  or

permanent  incapacity was the result of his  own  intentional

criminal  act.   In such cases, the CPF Board  shall  not  be

required to pay the insurance claims if the criminal  act  is

committed  within  1 year from the date that  he  is  insured

under  the  scheme(s).  Clauses 14 and 16 of the  Bill  amend

sections 36(5) and 49(4) of the Act to provide for the above.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me qualify what I mean by intentional criminal act.

I  am  not  referring to minor offences or acts of negligence

such  as  some offences committed while driving a  car  which

could,  in  fact,  result in the offender's  injury  or  even

death.   In  such  cases, the CPF Board has been  paying  the

claims and they will continue to do so.  Intentional criminal

act in this context

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>

means a premeditated act, which any citizen would know,  will

draw serious penalties such as drug trafficking, gang robbery

and murder.  For example, if a member was involved in robbing

a  bank  and was shot dead in the exchange of fire  with  the

police,  the  1-year  time  bar  will  apply.   Or,   if   he

participated  in gang robbery and murdered a  victim  in  the

course  of  the  robbery and was subsequently  convicted  and

executed,  the 1-year time bar will also apply.  Likewise  if

he  was convicted of a drug trafficking offence and executed,

the 1-year time bar will also apply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now move on to clause 10 which amends section 29

to enable the Minister to prescribe conditions for members to

be exempted from taking the Home Protection Insurance Scheme.

The  need  for  this arose from the Board's experience  of  a

sharp  increase  in  the number of cases  applying  for  such

exemption on account of their private insurance coverage.  In

other words, there are CPF members who buy a HDB flat and say

that  they already have an existing private insurance  policy

which  will  ensure that they can pay up their  mortgage  and

they  ask for an exemption, and such exemption is then given.

There is a real concern that some members may not be able  to

service  their private insurance policies for  a  variety  of

reasons, maybe as a result of retrenchment, loss of  job,  or

some  other  financial difficulties.  It could easily  happen

that they would then let the policy to lapse.  The result  is

that   the  member's  dependants  would  then  be  completely

unprotected  in  the  event of untimely  death  or  permanent

incapacity  of  the  member.   Hence,  while  exemption  will

continue to be allowed, there should be some conditions so as

to require the member to resume the Home Protection Insurance

Scheme  once  he  has allowed the private  insurance  or  the

personal  insurance policy that he has to lapse.   This  will

ensure  that the family will continue to be protected and  do

not lose a home due to an unfortunate event.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, there is an upper age limit for Home

Protection Insurance Scheme.  Clause 10 of the Bill will also

extend the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>

age  limit of such a coverage from 60 to 65 years.  This will

provide  older members who are still servicing their mortgage

loans  five  extra  years  of coverage  and  protection.   In

particular, those who have upgraded to bigger HDB flats later

in  life, will now enjoy the Home Protection Insurance Scheme

protection for a longer period.  Clause 11 amends section  30

to  clarify  that the Home Protection Insurance  Scheme  will

provide cover for only one property at any one time.   Clause

12  amends  section 32 to give priority to the  deduction  of

premiums over other deductions.  It also enables the Board to

decide  how  a  member is to make-up for  any  shortfalls  in

premium  payment and allow joint owners of the  property  who

are  husband and wife, to pay for each other's share  of  the

premium.   Clause 13 repeals sections 34 and 35 which  relate

to  when premiums under the Home Protection Insurance  Scheme

and  Dependants Protection Insurance Scheme are due, and  the

period  of  cover  for the Home Protection Insurance  Scheme.

Clause  14  clarifies  that the Board's  payment  under  Home

Protection  Insurance Scheme shall be in  proportion  to  the

member's liability for the repayment of the housing loan.  It

also  clarifies the Board's payment under different scenarios

of  incapacity  or  death  of the member.  Clause  15  amends

section  39 to enable the Minister to prescribe the  mode  of

Home  Protection Insurance Scheme premium payment.  This will

replace the repealed sections 34 and 35, and pave the way for

the  CPF Board to allow premium payments by instalments under

the scheme in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill also introduces other amendments to meet

the administrative and operational needs of the CPF Board and

to better serve members' needs.  These include:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Clause 2 to amend the definition of "wages" in

section  2  so  as to enable the Minister to  exempt  certain

payments  from  being  included  for  the  purpose   of   CPF

contribution.  This is not intended to change the  basis  for

calculating CPF contribution which will continue to be  based

on remuneration in money, including any bonus, due or granted

to a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>

person   in   respect  of  his  employment.   The   exemption

introduced  by  this  amendment  is  directed  at  occasional

payments,  such  as "long service awards".  Such  awards  are

given by employers to reward employees for their loyalty, for

having  remained with the company for long periods  of  time.

We  see no need for such awards to attract CPF contributions.

In  exempting such "long service awards", we will  spell  out

conditions to safeguard employees' interest;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Clause 3 to empower the Minister to appoint a

temporary   Chairman  during  the  temporary  incapacity   or

temporary  absence of the Chairman, and empower the  Chairman

to  authorize any members of the Board to exercise any  power

or perform any function conferred on the Chairman by or under

the CPF Act;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Clause 5 will allow CPF members to pledge their

properties in lieu of part of the Minimum Sum if they  co-own

the  properties  with their immediate family  members.   This

will  enable  such members to meet part of  the  Minimum  Sum

requirement by such pledges and enable them to withdraw  some

cash at age 55 from their CPF account;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Clause 18 will allow the court to order the

recovery  of  CPF  arrears, in addition to  the  fine  and/or

imprisonment  under section 7(3) of the Act; and  to  recover

the  CPF  arrears in the same manner as a judgement in  civil

proceedings.  This will enable the CPF Board to help  members

to recover the arrears more expeditiously; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Clause 19 will allow members who are legal owners

of a piece of land or a property by way of inheritance to use

their  CPF savings for the construction of properties on  the

land and the servicing of outstanding housing loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the amendments proposed in this Bill will

allow CPF members to invest their Special Account savings  to

enhance   their  old  age  savings  and  enjoy  tax  benefits

announced  by  the  Finance Minister  in  the  FY2000  Budget

Statement.  It will ensure that the provisions of the CPF Act

continue to be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>

relevant  and in line with the objectives of the CPF  system.

Last  but not least, it will safeguard members' interests  by

extending  the Home Protection Insurance Scheme cover  to  65

years  of age and ensure that the employer's arrears  can  be

recovered more expeditiously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

support the Bill moved by the Minister for Manpower and would

just like to comment briefly on several clauses in the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 4 of the Bill proposes to amend section 13

of  the CPF Act to enable CPF members to withdraw funds  from

their  Special  Account  for approved  low-risk  investments.

This  amendment will provide CPF members greater  flexibility

to manage their own funds and, hopefully, maximise returns on

the  investments.   However, CPF members should  be  reminded

that  money in the Special Account is risk-free and tax-free,

and  currently  attracts an interest rate of  1.5  percentage

points  more  than  the  interest rate  for  savings  in  the

Ordinary  Account.  This means a minimum of 4%  interest  per

annum, which is higher than most fixed deposit rates and some

low-risk investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it may not be practical for the Government to

legislate  all  the safeguards on CPF investments  such  that

there  will  be  a  100% protection for  investors  from  the

consequences  of their own investment actions.  However,  the

Ministry  of  Manpower  and the CPF  Board  should,  wherever

possible, provide sufficient warning to CPF members that  the

majority  of investments carry some degree of risk  and  that

members should seek professional advice if they are in doubt.

For  those who are not savvy in investment strategies, it may

well  be worth their while to keep their money in the Special

Account for the low risk and the respectable interest rate it

currently attracts.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill proposes to amend section 18 of the

CPF  Act to enable CPF account holders to transfer funds into

their grandparents' retirement accounts, in addition to their

parents' and spouse's retirement accounts.  This is a welcome

amendment  that  will  provide  some  financial  relief   for

families  who  support their grandparents.   Hopefully,  this

amendment  will  also  create an additional  opportunity  for

people  to  financially  assist their aged  grandparents  and

promote stronger bonds within the extended family unit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the proposed amendment to section 29 of

the Act that will raise the age limit for the Home Protection

Insurance Scheme from 60 to 65 years of age, which is in line

with  the  rising  life expectancy and  health  standards  of

Singaporeans, and the extension of the age limit for granting

HDB loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, clause 14 of the Bill will exclude claims made

under  the  Home Protection Insurance Scheme and  Dependant's

Protection   Insurance  Scheme  should  death  or   permanent

disability of the insured arise directly or indirectly out of

suicide,  a  deliberate act of self-injury or an  intentional

criminal  act within one year of the date of the commencement

of  the  policy.   In  addition to these exclusions,  capital

punishment of any criminal act committed within one year from

the date of the start of the policy also voids any claim.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am able to understand and support the rationale

for such exclusions but would be more comfortable if there is

also  a  provision in the Bill that empowers the Minister  to

grant  exemptions should the circumstances of a case  warrant

such an exemption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, clause 18 of the Bill

receives  my  strong  support.  This  clause,  amongst  other

things, will empower the CPF Board to recover money owed  for

CPF  contributions from errant employers who fail to pay  CPF

contributions  to  the  employees.  The  current  legislation

provides  a  fine and/or a jail term but does  not  have  any

provision to enable

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>

recovery  of  money owed for CPF contributions. The  proposed

new section 61A of the Bill will address this problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those comments, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the CPF (Amendment)

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Bill, there is one clause which allows members

to  top-up  the CPF account of their grandparents  for  their

retirement  benefits. This is a move in the right  direction.

This  will  enable  our senior citizens to be  provided  with

adequate  savings for their old age.  There is another  point

that  merits our attention in that there is no age  limit  to

the topping-up arrangement. In other words, the grandchildren

will  be able to transfer their CPF money into the retirement

account  of their grandparents, with no age limit.   However,

in  the  present Act, children are allowed to transfer  their

CPF  money  into their parents' account up to  age  65  years

only. There is a time limit and an age limit.  There seems to

be  some  contradiction here.  Let me give you an example  to

illustrate my point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Mr A is now 70 years old. He was married

at  the age of 20, and his son, Mr B,  is now about 50  years

old.  Mr B was married at the age of 25,  and his son, Mr  C,

is now 25 years old.  Now, Mr C can transfer his CPF money to

the  account of his grandfather, and can also put money  into

Mr  B's  account.  However,  Mr B who is the  son  of  Mr  A,

cannot  put  his CPF money into the father's account  because

the latter is past 65 years of age.  There seems to be double

standards.   So  I  hope the Minister will consider  allowing

the  son  to  put  his CPF  money into the parents'  account.

There should not be any age limit.  In this way, the benefits

will  be  more consistent.  In the old days, there were  many

children  in  the  family, for example, I  have  8  siblings.

Now,  with  the small family concept, there are only  two  or

three  children, or just one child, to maintain the  parents.

So if the law can be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>

consistent without any age limit for parents or grandparents,

the children and grandchildren together will be able to share

the  cost  of  looking after the retirement  needs  of  their

elders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Amendment Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I want to say

that this amendment to the CPF Act is very positive and is in

harmony  with  the  recommendations of the  Inter-Ministerial

Committee  on Ageing Population. The Committee had  expressed

some  concerns that CPF holders may not have adequate balance

to  see  them  through retirement and some of these  measures

seem to meet those concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly happy about some of the amendments and

one  of  it  is that it is actually very pro-family,  in  the

sense that the definition of a related person in the Act  has

been  amended  from  just  spouse  to  include  grandparents,

grandchildren and siblings.  This a positive move. And  there

are  also incentives for grandchildren to contribute  to  the

grandparents' retirement account.  This is also a  good  move

as it strengthens the family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also support the increase of the Minimum Sum from

$40,000  to $65,000, as well as the improvements in the  Home

Protection  Insurance  Scheme and the Dependants'  Protection

Insurance Scheme. And very important for us are the  enhanced

powers to recover arrears from defaulters.  Mr Charles  Chong

had spoken on it and I fully endorse what he said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In expressing my satisfaction, I also have to express

some concerns and suggestions that I have.  Section 2 of  the

Act,  which  is going to be amended, is to give the  Minister

powers  to  exclude certain payments from the  definition  of

"wages".   The Minister has clarified that he meant  payments

like long service awards.  Excluding long service awards is a

good thing and I support it. I also want to say that payments

which are exempted from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>

CPF should also not be taxable.  I hope that the Minister for

Finance would take the cue and not tax on long service awards

and one-off incentive payments which employers give.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I also want to express a bit of

concern  which workers have.  How far would the Minister  use

his  powers in granting exclusions and exemptions?   We  know

that  whenever there is financial difficulty, employers  will

scrimp on cost and there is also some concern on whether this

provision  will be used to increase the amount of exemptions,

resulting in lower CPF contributions in the long run.  I hope

that  this  provision will, in the long  run,  be  used  very

discreetly  and  sparingly, with  the  workers'  interest  at

heart.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of increasing the Minimum Sum from

$40,000   to   $65,000,  it  is  positive   and   meets   the

recommendations of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on  Ageing

Population.  But the question is how many of our CPF  holders

will  be  able to meet this Minimum Sum.  The other  question

is:   can retirees live adequately on this sum?  We know that

CPF  will not fully replace earnings, so the Ministry and the

CPF  Board  should  also  come out with  more  education,  in

addition to what they are doing now, to tell people how  much

they  need  to  have in order to maintain the same  lifestyle

comfortably.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If CPF is extremely important, then the question is:

CPF  has  been  cut at least two times during  the  recession

period, and now that the economy is doing well, when  is  the

rate  going  to  be  restored?  Can it  be  restored  quickly

enough?  Cutting CPF is painful and workers suffer. The  same

people  who  need the protection of CPF have  suffered  most.

Parallel  to  enhancing the safety net for CPF, the  Ministry

must  also  tell  us what is the progress in  developing  the

flexible  wage system and how much of push is there  so  that

the workers' interest is fully protected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to say that CPF only covers wage earners.

It does not cover those who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>

are  not  wage earners.  But even for these non-wage earners,

the  contingent workforce is going up.  The number  is  going

up.  We  are also encouraging people to be entrepreneurs  and

self-employed, and these people are not covered.  At present,

there  is provision for some of these self-employed who  have

applied   for  licences  to  contribute  to  Medisave.    Can

provision  be made for more people to be covered by  the  CPF

and  at  least be part of the social safety net  that  is  in

place?   I  also  observe that there will  be  amendments  to

section 39 which talks about different classes of members.  I

would like to ask what is being meant by "different classes"?

Will  there be different types of schemes for different types

of employees?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, just a suggestion for the Government to take

up, that is, to enable people to have more money in CPF.   At

the   present  moment  and  also  in  support  of  pro-family

policies,  a  lot  of  people use CPF  to  buy  their  homes.

However, our national servicemen do not contribute to CPF. So

maybe,  at this time, we can also make provision to  increase

the national servicemen's allowance from the present $240  to

market rate, ie, whatever an 18 or 19-year old boy would have

earned outside, and put the additional amount into CPF.  When

they complete their national service, they have some money in

their  CPF account to pay the deposit for a home and start  a

new family very soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I would like to support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy  Speaker, in principle, I support the CPF  (Amendment)

Bill  introduced  by  the Minister for  Manpower  to  further

improve  on the implementation of the CPF system in Singapore

and  to enable every Singaporean to have adequate savings for

use in their old age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, after years of implementation and

with the continuous review and fine-tuning by the Government,

the  CPF  system  in Singapore is sound  and has  contributed

greatly to the economic development of Singapore.  It is  now

a model of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>

our  national  policy.  It is also a very important  national

policy that the policymakers from other countries would  like

to learn and emulate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the perspective of nation-building, the CPF system

is  not  only  a  compulsory national  savings  scheme.   Its

greatest  effect is that it has laid a very solid  foundation

in our labour-management cooperation and relationship.  Prior

to  the  financial  crisis,  the CPF  contribution  rate  for

employers  and  employees was 20% on each side,  totalling  a

high  of  40% of the employee's salary. This compulsory  high

savings  rate  is a rarity in the world and it  is  something

which  other  countries will find difficult  to  follow.   If

there  is  no  strong support from labour and management,  it

would  be extremely difficult for the Government to implement

the CPF system in Singapore. Therefore, the Government should

treasure   this   spirit  and  strengthen   this   tripartite

relationship among labour, management and Government. So when

adjusting the CPF contribution rates and formulating  related

regulations, the Government should be prudent and careful not

to  ignore  the  interest and feelings of the  employers  and

employees.  Otherwise,  it will lead  to  some  very  serious

consequences resulting in mutual distrust among the parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the employers, CPF is a very heavy monthly

expenditure.  The quantum of the CPF contribution  rate  will

affect their short-term and long-term business cost.  To most

employers, the 20% contribution rate is too high and  is  not

conducive   to  the  maintenance  of  Singapore's   long-term

competitiveness.  Therefore, when the Government reduced  the

CPF  rate  to  10% during the financial crisis, the  business

community  was very grateful.  However, with the Government's

eagerness  to raise it back to 16% by January next year,  the

feeling of gratitude has faded.  In fact, many employers  are

not  comfortable with the signal sent out by  the  Government

and  the labour side that they want the employers to not only

raise  the  salaries of the workers to reward  them  for  the

sacrifices  made during the crisis, but also to  restore  the

CPF  contribution  rate  to 20% as soon  as  possible.   Many

businesses are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>

having  difficulty  coping with such pressure  of  escalating

business  cost.   On top of that, the Government  is  rapidly

raising taxes, rents and utility charges, and many businesses

are  beginning to doubt the Singapore Government's  so-called

"pro-business" strategy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from information released by MTI, our economy has

recovered,  and this year's growth rate can  be  as  high  as

9.5%.   However, to most businesses, particularly  the  SMEs,

they have not completely got out from the financial hardship.

Many  of  them are still having difficulties coping with  the

various  business cost increases.  Apart from  a  handful  of

large enterprises in the electronic, chemical engineering and

financial  industries,  most  industries  like  construction,

renovation,   furniture,  restaurants,  watches,   jewellery,

garments  and  departmental stores,  are  performing  poorly.

Many  of  them  are  having problems with cash  flow,  labour

shortage and high business cost.  On top of that, because  of

Government's  policy  of opening up,  the  various  MNCs  and

Government-linked companies are competing with  the  SMEs  in

the  limited and almost saturated market, and many  of  these

companies  may have to resort to retrenchment again  or  face

closure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to information released by the Ministry of

Manpower,  in the first eight months of this year, more  than

400  employers were in default of CPF contributions amounting

to  some $16 billion and had to face legal action.  In  fact,

more  and more enterprises are facing difficulties and  these

enterprises  have  made  a  lot of contributions  during  the

crisis.  At this moment, they are required to continue making

sacrifices.   They are not as fortunate as the employees  who

can  ask for pay- rise from the employers and to put pressure

on the Government to force the employers to restore their CPF

contributions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Tay, we are discussing the CPF

(Amendment) Bill.  Could you try to confine yourself  to  the

narrow field of the amendments?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): All right. Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  I believe when the Government  was  promoting

tripartism among labour, management and the Government,  they

are  very  determined,  because this is  Singapore's  way  to

success.   However,  the Government cannot unilaterally  want

the  employers to continue to contribute to satisfy the needs

of  labour  in conjunction with the Government's policy.   In

the  CPF  system, the Government, so far, has only asked  the

employers  to  restore  the  20%  contribution  rate  and  be

accountable  to  the labour side, but no innovative  measures

have been introduced by the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I would like to take this opportunity to

urge  the  Government  to  consider the  predicament  of  the

businesses, so as to adopt more practical and prompt  action.

Maybe  the Government could consider using some of its budget

surpluses to make up  the difference of 2% to 4% in  the  CPF

employer's  contribution, so that they can  restore  the  20%

contribution  rate  sooner.  By so  doing,  both  labour  and

management  will  be  more convinced  with  the  Government's

support and participation in the CPF system in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendment Bill and I hope that the

Government will  consider my above suggestion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

while  expressing  general  support  for  the  Bill,  I  have

reservations on the provision for investment of  the  Special

Account savings by members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When CPF savings were allowed for investments some years

ago, I spoke against this measure.  I urged caution then,  as

I  did not believe that this is good for members in the  long

term.   I  believe that the general trend is for  members  to

invest  in  high risk equities and stocks.  As  a  result,  I

believe  that  today most members actually lost money  rather

than  make money.  In other words, overall, members'  savings

would  not  be enhanced by high-risk investments, other  than

investments in property.  Sir, the point is that by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>

investing  in stocks and shares, many CPF members are  poorer

rather than richer.  The only mitigating factor is that  most

members  do  have investments in properties and that  is  why

they have done well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investment of Special Account savings in lower-risk

financial  instruments also means that returns will  be  low.

Since  most  members do not have much savings in the  Special

Account, it will be  very difficult for any particular member

to  diversify his portfolio of investments or instruments  to

maximise  his  returns.   As  a result,  I  do  believe  that

members,  with  the little bit of money they  have  in  their

Special Accounts, will invest in some higher risk investments

or perhaps in unit trusts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Bill will be passed, may I urge the Minister

to  consider  setting up a Special Accounts funds  management

unit in the CPF, and allow members to transfer part or all of

their Special Account savings into this funds management unit

to  be  managed by the CPF Board.  With the funds  management

unit, there is a volume with a larger scale of operations and

therefore  members' savings could naturally  be  diversified.

If  we  allow members to invest their Special Account savings

in  one  or two instruments, the risk is high, no matter  how

you put it, even with the lower-risk financial instruments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge the Minister to consider my suggestion of

setting  up  a  funds management unit to manage  the  Special

Accounts for members when this Bill is passed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first, I

would like to thank Mr Charles Chong, Chairman of the GPC for

Manpower,  and  all the other hon. Members who  spoke  up  in

support of this amendment Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to respond to the points that were raised

by Members.  Mr Charles Chong supported the provision for the

cash  top-up for grandparents, and I think most of the  other

Members who spoke on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>

it  also  supported it.  For instance, Mr Ang Mong Seng,  who

while   supporting  this  provision  for  cash   top-up   for

grandparents, pointed out what appears to be an inconsistency

between the cash top-up for grandparents and the top-ups  for

parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, under the Minimum Sum Topping-Up Scheme, the

children  have  10 years to top up their parent's  retirement

account,  from  the  age  of 55 when the  parent  could  have

withdrawn the CPF money.  The time bar was introduced when we

first  had  this Minimum Sum Topping-Up Scheme  to  encourage

children  to  top up their parent's CPF account as  early  as

possible, rather than to drag it over a long period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of grandparents, I think it will be very

difficult to impose such a time bar.  If you do impose such a

time  bar, then very few grandparents will be able  to  enjoy

the benefit of this top-up.  Because, if the age limit is 65,

then  there  are going to be very few grandparents  who  have

grandchildren old enough to be working and earning  a  salary

and  able  to top up their grandparents' accounts before  the

grandparents  are aged 65.  So we have decided that  for  the

grandparents' top-up scheme, there should be no time bar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, we will, in fact, waive the 10-year time bar

for  the parents' topping-up scheme in the case of cash  top-up.   In  other words, if a CPF member were to put cash  into

the  parents'  accounts,  to top up the  parents'  retirement

accounts, we are prepared to waive the need to have this  10-year  time  limit.  It is not necessary.  So it can  be  done

away  with.  But in the case of those who may be using  their

CPF  to  top  up their parents' accounts, this needs  further

study  to  see whether if you extend the 10-year time  limit,

would  they  be able to continue to maintain such top-up  and

how  would  it  impact  on the member's own  accumulation  of

savings  for his retirement.  We need further study on  this.

For  cash top-up, we will waive the time limit.  But  in  the

case  of  transfer  from the children's CPF  account  to  the

parents' accounts, we need further study.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong also asked about the one-year time bar

for  those who committed suicide or has committed intentional

criminal act resulting in forfeiture of their insurance cover

under   the   Home  Protection  Insurance  Scheme   and   the

Dependants' Protection Insurance Scheme, and he asked whether

the  Minister  could grant exemption in some cases.   Let  me

point  out that section 36(5), as it is crafted, states  that

"the Board shall not be required to make any payment if death

is  by  suicide."  And with this amendment, the result  of  a

court  conviction within one year of taking up the insurance.

I  think the way the section is framed, "that the Board shall

not  be  required .", would suggest that while the dependants

cannot expect the Board to pay the insurance claim under such

circumstances,  if in examining the case the Board  considers

that  there are special circumstances, it may decide then  to

proceed  with  the  payment.  There is no injunction  against

making   such  a  payment.   So  there  is  some  amount   of

flexibility on the part of the Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas Thomas also supported the amendment and I

thank  him  for his support, in particular, the amendment  on

the  topping-up of grandparents' accounts, and also extending

the  definition of "related person" to a wider scope, so that

there  could  be  more family support.  He had  some  concern

about  whether,  in fact, giving the Minister  the  power  to

exempt  certain payments from attracting CPF could  become  a

loophole  that could be abused by employers.  Let  me  assure

him that we are very conscious of this possibility.  That  is

why  when  we  crafted this amendment, we provided  that  the

Minister  can  make  conditions for such exemption,  and  the

conditions  will  be  very narrow.  It will  be  specifically

focused  on long service awards and would not allow employers

to  take  advantage of this provision to seek exemption  from

CPF  for  other payments which are normally part of wages  or

salary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked, in the same vein as Mr Tay Beng Chuan,

about the CPF cut and when will it be restored.  Our position

is that we will want to restore the employer's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>

CPF  contribution to the pre-crisis 20% level as soon  as  we

can.  When we introduced the cut during the economic downturn

in  1998, we thought that it might take anywhere up  to  five

years  in order to be able to turn the economy around and  to

restore the CPF cut of 10 percentage points.  But as  it  is,

the  economy  has undergone a sort of V-shape recovery  after

hitting  the  bottom.  I think we are able to  speed  up  the

process  of  restoration.  That is why on 1st April  of  this

year, we had introduced a 2% restoration, and we have already

announced  that  on  1st January next  year,  there  will  be

another  4% restoration.  If the economy continues to  bounce

back  and  remain healthy and competitive, then  I  think  we

should  be able to speed up the pace of restoration.  And  we

definitely do not have to wait for the full five years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked whether we could try to get more non-employees, the self-employed, for instance, to benefit from

the CPF system.  We have already, for some years, been trying

to   get  the  self-employed  to  contribute,  starting  with

Medisave.   There  is a scheme by which self-employed  people

have  to  contribute to Medisave in order to be eligible  for

various  trade  licences and permits.  It  has  worked  quite

well.   Quite a large number of self-employed people are  now

contributing to Medisave.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to point out, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that

in  fact self-employed people are constantly being encouraged

to  contribute  even  to  the Ordinary  Account  and  Special

Account  of  their CPF by way of tax incentives.   I  believe

they  are  entitled to claim, up to a certain  limit,  a  tax

exemption  on  about $14,000 a year as voluntary contribution

to  CPF.  This is one way by which we can encourage the self-employed  to  become members of CPF and  also  to  enjoy  the

benefits  provided  by the scheme.  As the  number  of  self-employed  or contract workers increases, we will continue  to

publicise  the scheme with such tax incentives so  that  more

and  more of them will voluntarily sign up with CPF and  take

advantage of the tax incentives.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas raised another point which is really not

connected  to  this  Amendment  Bill.   This  is  on  NSmen's

allowance.    NSmen are not employees.  So NSmen's  allowance

is  not  a salary or wage in the normal sense.  That  is  why

NSmen's  allowance  does not attract  CPF  contribution.   He

asked  whether  we  could increase NSmen's allowance  to  the

market wage for people of that age group.  I suggest that  he

take  it  up with the Minister for Defence at the appropriate

opportunity. I am sure the Minister for Defence will give him

a considered answer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay supported the Amendment Bill and expressed strong

support for the amendments that we have in this Bill, but  he

took it beyond the focus of this Amendment Bill.  He spoke at

length about how tripartite support was important for the CPF

scheme.  I agree with him.  Our CPF scheme works well because

we  have  tripartite support.  Employers support  it.   Trade

unions support it.  Government continues to encourage, refine

and  improve  the  system.  It is almost  an  institution  in

Singapore in our labour market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He expressed concern that employers are still facing

difficulties although the economy has recovered sharply.   We

are  aware  that  not all sectors of the economy  have  fully

recovered.   For instance, the construction sector  is  still

not  doing  as  well  as the manufacturing  or  the  services

sector.   We  also understand that some of the SMEs  are  not

doing  as well as some of the larger companies.  I hope  that

he  understands  that the CPF cut was,  in  effect,  a  blunt

instrument  to reduce cost overall across-the-board  for  the

whole  economy.   It  has  worked  in  that  it  has  allowed

companies  that  were  facing grave dangers  to  survive  the

crisis.    Now that the economy has turned around, we  should

start  to  restore the CPF as soon as we could to the  degree

that  the  economy can support without doing grave damage  to

our  own competitiveness.  I think that is what we are doing.

First, restoration of 2% in April of this year and from  next

year onwards a 4% restoration.  We

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>

believe  that  these are changes that can be accommodated  by

the    employers    without   seriously    affecting    their

competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked whether we could introduce other more

innovative  measures  to  help  employers  to  retain   their

competitiveness to moderate their wage cost.  The  answer  is

yes.   In  June this year, the NWC recommended that employers

should now start to introduce a monthly variable component in

the salary structure.  This monthly variable component, as is

explained in the NWC recommendation, should be built up  over

time  from wage increases that are being given to workers  so

that  the  next time we face a crisis, each company  or  each

sector  could  on its own start to make adjustments  to  wage

cost  without having to wait for an overall CPF cut.  If they

put  aside  2%  to 3% each year of the wage increase  into  a

monthly  variable component, over the next five to six  years

they  could easily accumulate 10% to 15%.  This 10%  to  15%,

which comprise the monthly variable component, could then  be

the  first line of defence against any sudden change or  drop

in  business sentiment and they could immediately, at company

or industry or sectoral level, make adjustment without having

to  wait  for a national consensus on CPF cut.  I would  urge

all employers to take this up seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand it, since the NWC recommendation in June

this  year, already about 140 unionised companies had already

taken  up  this  suggestion  and  had  introduced  a  monthly

variable  component  in their collective  agreements.    Many

other  companies are also in negotiation with  their  unions,

whether  it  is  company unions or industry-wide  unions,  to

incorporate such a monthly variable component.  Likewise, all

the  SMEs should also consider introducing a monthly variable

component.   The NWC recommendation was that,  if  this  year

they  are  going  to give a wage increase of  less  than  3%,

perhaps  all  the  3%  should  go  into  a  monthly  variable

component rather than a built-in wage increase.  If they  are

going  to  give  more than 3% wage increase this  year,  they

should  consider  setting  3% aside  as  a  monthly  variable

component

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>

and  paying  the balance of the wage increase as  a  built-in

wage  increase.  If all sectors do it, whether they  are  big

companies  or SMEs, I am sure they will achieve a  much  more

flexible  wage structure that will give us greater resilience

the next time the economy runs into stormy waters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok spoke in support of the Amendment Bill

but expressed reservation over the investments of the Special

Account  savings.  Let me point out that this is an  enabling

amendment.   This will enable CPF members to have  access  to

their  Special Account for investment purposes.  It does  not

mean  that  they  all have to withdraw their Special  Account

savings and to place this in the various instruments that  we

have  designated.   We will continue to caution  CPF  members

that all investments carry some risks and they should be very

careful  in  making their investment decisions.  They  should

not  rush into it, and particularly they should not  go  into

speculative  type  of  investment.   Hence,  the  classes  of

investment  instruments that can be approved for the  Special

Account  savings are much more limited compared  to  the  CPF

investment scheme for the Ordinary Account.  For instance,  a

member  cannot  withdraw the Special Account savings  to  buy

shares  on  his own account.  We will not allow it.   Neither

will we allow him to withdraw the Special Account savings  to

purchase unit trusts in the higher risk groups which are more

weighted  towards  equity, wholly or  partially  invested  in

equity.  So  there are already some measures to moderate  the

risk  exposure for the Special Account investor.  Of  course,

at  the  end of the day, as I have said in my Second  Reading

speech,  the member has to be prudent himself and to exercise

judgment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the suggestion for the Board to set up a Special

Fund Management Division and to allow CPF members to transfer

part of their Special Account into this Fund for the Board to

manage, the Board itself cannot guarantee that its investment

decision  will be that much superior or that much more  risk-free compared to any of the other approved fund managers that

are available in the market.  Yes, while it is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>

true  that if we do it as a group it will have a bigger  base

and,  therefore, can be more diversified and have lower risk,

likewise,  if  a  CPF  member were to take  out  his  Special

Account savings to buy a unit trust in one of the lower  risk

rated  groups,  one of the lower tiers of the  Mercer's  Risk

Classification, he will be, in effect, putting his money into

a  bigger pool which will allow the fund managers of the unit

trust   to  construct  a  properly  diversified  and   hedged

investment  portfolio.   So  he  will  also  have  the   same

benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is better for the CPF member to make this

decision  for  himself and to take out  his  Special  Account

savings to invest with a reliable or appropriate fund manager

that  has already been pre-approved than for him to leave  it

with  the Board because there will be no additional advantage

for the Board to try to serve as a super-fund manager for all

the  CPF  members in this sense.  We are limiting the  choice

and  the access.  We prefer to take an approach where we give

the  members  a greater option.  Perhaps, it is part  of  the

process.   Some may make mistakes and some have made mistakes

and  lost money, in the case of the CPF investment scheme for

the  Ordinary  Account savings.  Over  the  longer  term,  we

believe  that if members take a prudent and careful  approach

they  would be able to enhance their old-age savings  and  it

will  benefit them.  We believe our approach is  sounder  for

the longer term than to have the Board act as a fund manager,

as suggested by Mr Chng.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have addressed the points raised by

Members.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would

like  to ask the Minister whether he would consider extending

the  age  limit  beyond  65  years for  the  Home  Protection

Insurance  Scheme. With longer life span  among  our  people,

would he consider further fine-tuning the scheme?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my mind, the tripartism of labour-management-Government relationship is based on the basic understanding

of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>

mutual  benefit  and mutual help.  It is not   built  on  the

basis,  as  alleged by Mr Tay Beng Chuan, to put unreasonable

demand  on  the employers.  Mr Tay accused the Government  of

putting  pressure  on  the  employers  without  taking   into

consideration   their  predicament.   Can   that   be   true?

Employees  in Singapore worked very hard and made  sacrifices

during  the  crisis  to help their employers  tide  over  the

difficult times to survive the crisis.   They took a pay  cut

and  CPF  cut  to  help the companies  reduce their  business

cost.   The employers should not keep on asking the employees

to  make sacrifices whenever they are in trouble.  Should the

employers not take other measures to solve their own business

problems?   I  am  very saddened by the  employers'  lack  of

recognition of the employees' sacrifices.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Yeo, you are not speaking

on the principles of the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> But I am asking clarification from

the Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> All right. Please ask your

clarification

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like to ask

the  Minister this question.   There is a saying,  "when  you

borrow  you  must pay back."   Is it not reasonable  for  the

employers'  CPF contribution which was cut during the  crisis

to be returned to the workers, now that the crisis is over?

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> May I seek the

Minister's explanation on the cash top-up scheme for parents?

I  understand  that besides the time bar, there  is  actually

another  constraint on the cash top-up scheme, which  is  the

maximum  amount a child can top up for the parents  and  that

maximum amount is based on the Minimum Sum scheme and the age

of the parents.  I am very heartened to say that the Ministry

is prepared to lift the time bar.  My question is whether the

Minister is also prepared to consider lifting the maximum sum

allowed so that more parents, whose contributions by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>

the children have reached the cap, can continue to contribute

to this top-up scheme.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I suppose Mr

Yeo  Guat  Kwang's  point is really not  in  response  to  my

comments  on  the  Second Reading of  this  Bill.   He  asked

whether  we  would  fine-tune the Home  Protection  Insurance

Scheme.   We are, in fact, doing it by raising the age  limit

from  60 to 65.  If, in due course, lifespan goes even longer

and  people take out even longer mortgages, then we  will  of

course  look  at  it  again.  The comments  on  the  workers'

contributions  to help Singapore turn around  are  noted.   I

agree with him that the workers have made great sacrifice and

contribution.   I  think employers should take  note  of  it.

That  is  why  I said in my response to Mr Tay that  we  will

continue  to  shoot  for  a speedier restoration  of  the  10

percentage-point cut in the CPF.  As long as the economy does

well, we will try to restore the CPF cut as soon as we can.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Dr Wang, he asked whether there should be

no  limit for the cash top-up for parents.  As it stands, the

cash  top-up is to the Minimum Sum that the parents  have  to

set  aside when they retire at age 55.  There is a reason for

it, because of its tax benefit.  The Minister for Finance has

generously  allowed  such  cash  top-up  for  tax  exemption.

Therefore, there must be a limit to how much you can top  up.

If  we  say that there is no limit to the cash top-up and  it

continues to attract the same level of tax benefits, then, of

course, there is opportunity for some form of abuse.  Because

you  could put $100,000 in and claim tax relief, and then the

parents  would take it out and it will be siphoned back.   So

we  have  to  bear that in mind.  But if it  is  cash  top-up

without  tax benefit, we welcome it.  Anybody is  welcome  to

put  money into their parents' CPF accounts and not claim tax

benefit,  and  leave it to the parents to enjoy the  proceeds

according  to the rules of the CPF withdrawals.   We  welcome

any amount.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> I think the Minister is right that

there should be a limit.  But

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>

I  would like to remind the Minister that the limit has  been

increased gradually and that is tied to the retirement age at

65.   And  over time, this limit has increased.  But for  the

parents  who are still surviving, let us say when they  reach

65,  at one point it was about $30,000, now it could be about

$60,000, would he consider moving all those limits up to  the

maximum  of  $60,000,  for instance,  rather  than  unlimited

contribution, like he says, $100,000?  Of course, if he said,

like  $1  million,  obviously there could be  abuse  in  that

scheme.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, I

would like to clarify with the Minister for Manpower and also

in  response  to  Mr Yeo.  What I said just now  was  that  I

confirmed  the  strong  existence of Government,  labour  and

management tripartism in Singapore. Like the labour side, the

management side has also made a lot of sacrifices.  As far as

CPF  is  concerned, the employers had been contributing  20%.

In many countries, this 20% is like a form of social welfare.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Tay, I have given you

plenty of chances to speak but you went astray.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan:</b> Sir, I am just trying to clarify my

points.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Please clarify.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan:</b> Yes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): What I would like to say is that in this

tripartite arrangement, both labour and management have  made

sacrifices  and contributed towards the economy of Singapore.

Should  not  the  Government  also  chip  in  by  making  its

contribution and make its presence and participation felt?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minimum

Sum  is  structured on the basic needs of a  person  when  he

retires,  and it is set at the point in time when the  person

attains  the  age of 55.  So I think we should keep  to  this

same framework rather than to periodically raise this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>

Minimum Sum for the entire cohort.  Because they have to  set

aside this amount of money, and the top-up should be made  in

relation  to  what are considered basic retirement  needs  of

persons  in  that  cohort.  As I said  before,  if  you  have

children who want to make larger cash contribution, they  are

more  than welcome.  There is no rule to stop you from making

contribution  in cash to your parents, siblings, grandparents

or to any relatives' CPF accounts.  In fact, many people have

opened up CPF accounts for their spouses who are not working,

housewives,  for  instance.   Husbands  have  opened  up  CPF

accounts for their wives and from time to time put some  cash

into  it,  without  seeking  tax exemptions.   And  when  the

Government  gives  various top-ups, the housewives  therefore

benefit.  So there is no impediment if children want  to  put

in  a  higher  cash  top-up than what is  allowed  under  the

Minimum  Sum  scheme for their parents.  The problem  is,  if

they  want  to  ask for an equal tax relief,  then  it  would

create  some  distortion and difficulties.   So  I  think  we

should stay with the present arrangement as long as it is for

the  purpose of tax relief.  But if it is outright,  generous

contribution, we have no difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Mr Tay, my only response is that Government is fully

aware of the contributions on the part of the workers and  of

course  on  the part of the employers.  The CPF scheme  is  a

neutral  system.   It is a scheme whereby employers  have  to

contribute and employees also contribute.  CPF is part of the

wages,  including  the employer's portion which  is  part  of

wages.  It is not an additional ex-gratia payment made by the

employers  for nothing.  It is part of the employee's  wages.

Therefore,  when  we  cut it, we are in fact  cutting  wages.

That  is why we have to be so careful about cutting the  CPF.

That  is  why I explained to you earlier on, that  we  should

build  up  a separate monthly variable component as  soon  as

possible, so that we do not have to periodically rely on this

rather blunt instrument of cutting CPF across the board.   If

we have a monthly variable component, we would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>

have a much more responsive, flexible and targeted measure to

deal with any economic downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure him that employers' contribution to

Singapore's  economic competitiveness, to our prosperity,  is

fully noted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

<div align="center"><b>SILVER JUBILEE FUND (SINGAPORE) (REPEAL) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Community Development and Sports (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the economic crisis has now receded, there

are  indications  of a growing need for short-term  financial

assistance in the fast-changing new economy.  The  number  of

applications  for financial assistance to MCDS and  the  CDCs

has  grown  in  the past one year, despite  the  end  of  the

recession.   It is still too early to say if this trend  will

remain  or  if  there  are  more  fundamental  socio-economic

factors  at  play.  My officers will monitor any  significant

changes in the types and numbers of applications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to adapt our social safety net to meet

the  challenges of the new economy.  Fundamentally,  we  must

help   families  overcome  their  difficulties  through   job

training and re-skilling, job placement, family casework, and

their  children's early development and schooling.   However,

many  of  them will still need temporary financial assistance

to  tide  their  families  over  a  difficult  period.   Some

charities, the Community Chest, the VWOs, the CDCs and  other

groups have been providing this help.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, some aspects of our social safety net must be

re-designed  to  weather the turbulence of the  New  Economy.

Today,  apart  from  the Government funded Public  Assistance

scheme  catering mainly to Singaporeans requiring  long  term

financial  help,  two charity funds provide  relief  to  many

families in temporary financial difficulty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the 25th Anniversary Endowment Fund or 25th

AEF  for  short, which helps low-income families  in  various

ways.   Under this Fund, the Rental and Utilities  Assistance

Scheme  (RUAS) helps families in financial difficulty  obtain

waivers  of  their  rental and utility arrears  and  provides

grants  for  their  monthly payments  until  their  situation

improves.  The 25th AEF also funds the Centre-based Financial

Assistance  for  Childcare   Scheme  (CFAC)  which   provides

children   from   low-income   families   early   development

opportunities while enabling their mothers to return  to  the

workforce.  There are currently about 600 families under RUAS

and about 400 children under CFAC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second charity fund is the Silver Jubilee Fund or

SJF.    It primarily provides a basic allowance for destitute

persons,  under the Special Grant scheme. All  Special  Grant

recipients  are  non-citizens who  are  considered  Permanent

Residents.   They are mainly the elderly or  those  unfit  to

work  and without other means of support. There are currently

about 190 such cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry has been reviewing ways to strengthen

the  social  safety net for low-income families and  to  help

them  break out of the poverty cycle in the long  term.   The

25th  AEF  was  constituted in 1991 by Trust  Deed  from  the

balance   of   the  funds  raised  during  Singapore's   25th

Anniversary  celebrations. The SJF was set up  in  1935  from

funds raised during the Silver Jubilee of King George V,  and

historically  it has been managed under statute.   These  two

charity   funds  have  similar  objectives  in  serving   the

destitute  and  low-income families  in  Singapore.   Merging

these  two  funds  will bring together their  administration,

reduce overheads and ensure their combined

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>

resources  are  optimised to meet changing needs.   With  the

delegation  of  social assistance schemes to  all  CDCs  next

year,  a  common fund will streamline the approval  processes

for people to get help faster.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is therefore intending to set up a common

fund,  by pooling together the proceeds of the 25th  AEF  and

the SJF.  This new fund will be targeted at helping the needy

and  continue  to fund existing schemes such as  the  Special

Grant, RUAS and CFAC schemes.  The new fund will also support

selective  programmes run by Voluntary Welfare  Organisations

(VWOs)  for  low-income  families,  with  emphasis  on  those

programmes  that  help build their capacities  to  break  the

cycle of poverty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An endowment fund by way of a Trust Deed will be set up,

so  as  to give more flexibility in meeting the needs in  the

community.   The combined balance of these two charity  funds

is  estimated to be $44 million, while the gross  expenditure

is  expected  to  be  $2.5 million a year.   My  Ministry  is

currently  working  on  plans  to  augment  this   sum   with

Government funds.  Our plans for the new fund to uplift  low-income  families  will be announced in due  course.   As  the

first  step, however, towards the formation of this new fund,

the SJF (Singapore) Act will have to be repealed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, I decided to speak on this Bill because

it  seems to me that the Bill did not clearly set out to what

purpose or to what use the monies in the Silver Jubilee  Fund

would  be  put to.  Incidentally, we have not been  told  how

much  there is in this Fund.  I do not know why we  have  not

been  told  that.   But this is a charity, and  I  think  the

Minister recognises that this is a charity fund.  And if  one

looks  at  the preamble to the main Act, you will  find  "And

Whereas  the  subscribers to the said  Fund  agreed  that  it

should be devoted to the relief of distress in the Settlement

of Singapore:".  So there was an agreement that it would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>

be  devoted  to  the relief of distress in the Settlement  of

Singapore.  And again, if you look at section 18 of the  Act,

one  finds  that the Committee would inquire  into  cases  or

classes of distress brought to its cognizance and may at  its

discretion  grant relief or assistance out of moneys  at  its

disposal.  So in form and in nature it is a charity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister speaks in general terms about the fund

being  merged  with  the other fund in  existence,  the  25th

Anniversary  Endowment Fund, and used  to  help  lower-income

families  and to promote schemes to help them.  I  think  the

purpose and the use to which the moneys are going to  be  put

should be spelt out more clearly in this Bill.  It cannot  be

left  in  a vague phraseology that it shall be used  to  help

lower-income families.  The fund says it is for the relief of

distress - distressed families who are in need of help -  and

that  is why this fund was set up.  I am sure whoever advised

the Government on this Bill have no doubt of the doctrine  of

cypres  that  where  a charity fund is to  be  wound  up,  an

application  has  to  be  made to the  court  specifying  the

purposes to which the moneys are to be used.  And the court's

permission  is sought before the moneys are actually  put  to

any other use,  because this is a trust created and agreed to

by  those who subscribed that the moneys would only  be  used

for one purpose and, that is, to the relief of distress.   If

it  is  to  be used for anything that goes beyond that,  then

clearly  the court's permission should be sought.  The  court

would  have to decide whether these purposes accord with  the

wishes of those who set up the fund because that is the whole

essence of the trust - that those who subscribed gave it  for

a  specific  purpose, and you have got to honour that  trust,

and  not  use  it  for anything other than for  what  it  was

agreed.   So to just say, as it says in this Bill,  that  the

moneys  in  the account shall be paid into such fund  as  the

Minister  may  direct is too wide, and there is no  guarantee

that  the trust placed by the subscribers and those who  paid

into this fund will be honoured in the disposal of the funds.

poor,  the  disabled and others would not know where  to  go.

But all we want is the ability to administer a more efficient

service and therefore as I see, the whole proposal is to  try

and  bring  these two funds together so that  the  poor,  the

disabled  and others who need the fund can get it as  quickly

as possible.  It is done in a very concerted manner, and that

is  the  basic objective that we have to look at.  The Member

is  trying  to keep something which is already out  of  date.

The crux of the issue is:  would the poor get help as quickly

as   possible?   Are  there  adequate  funds  that  would  be

available to help them?  This is the basic issue that we have

to address. The repeal of the Act, Sir, is one way to address

too  many set-ups where it can be very confusing for the poor

to get the help required.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill to repeal the Silver Jubilee

Fund  Act.   I see that there is little fund left for  it  to

continue.   But  with the amalgamation of this  fund  of  $44

million, many poor and disabled and those who need help could

be given the necessary support.  What I would like to know is

the fate of these 190 individuals who are now getting support

from  the  Silver  Jubilee Fund.  How is  help  going  to  be

extended to this group of people?  Will the proposed fund  be

open to families and individuals

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>

who  do  not qualify for public assistance and would help  be

accorded to this group of people?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that note, I support the proposal to repeal the

Act.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I have got one question for the

Minister.  He says that the number of applicants seeking  aid

has increased.  May I know what is the increase in the number

of applicants?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> I would like to thank Members for

their  comments.   With regard to the fears expressed  by  Mr

Jeyaretnam,  I can give a guarantee that people  in  distress

would still be helped.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You cannot use it for any other purpose.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Yes. And if it is (used for other

purpose), he can come to Parliament and question me again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question by Dr Vasoo, whether the

proposed fund can be used for those not under PA, the  answer

is  yes.  Indeed, the 25th AEF has been used for RUAS.  It is

used for temporary relief of those not under PA, but yet need

help  to pay for their arrears in rent and utilities.   As  I

mentioned  earlier in my speech just now,  the  fund  of  $44

million  would be augmented;  we will come back to Parliament

to ask for more funds to help more needy people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the 190 persons that are currently under

the  fund,  they will continue to be helped.  As I  mentioned

earlier also in my speech, for all intents

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>

and  purposes,  the number of people under the existing  fund

will continue to be helped.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Mr Jeyaretnam's question about how much

we have in the fund, the amount is $5,168,439 as at June this

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam asked for the number of people seeking aid.

Yes,  it  has  increased. Actually,  the  average  number  of

applicants for help last year, for example, was about 220 per

month.   But so far this year, it has gone up to 250 a month.

So that is the extent of increase in the number of applicants

that  we have.  We are watching this trend to see whether  it

stabilises or increases, and if they do, what are the  causes

for this increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Mr Abdullah Tarmugi].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.
