<div align="center"><b>HIGHER SCHOOL CERTIFICATE TEACHERS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Salary increment)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for

Education whether teachers with the Higher  School

Certificate, whether in Government or  Government-aided  schools  and  in any of the  four  language

streams,  are given one increment more than  those

with the School Certificate: whether some teachers

with  the Higher School Certificate have not  been

given the additional increment, and if he will put

the matter right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a

scheme  whereby  non-graduate  teachers  with  the

Cambridge  Overseas Higher School Certificate  are

given  one additional increment if they  teach  in

secondary schools and for so long as they teach in

secondary schools. This applies to both Government

and  Government-aided school teachers. This scheme

is  confined  to the English medium, because  when

the scheme was promulgated in July 1962, there was

a  dearth  of  graduates for  the  English  medium

secondary   schools,  and  it  was  essential   to

encourage Primary-trained teachers with the School

Certificate  in  this medium to  take  the  higher

qualification  of  the H.S.C. to  enable  them  to

teach in secondary schools.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no teachers in the English medium who

satisfy the requirement and who have not been paid

the  additional  increment.  There  are,  however,

teachers  in  the English medium with  the  H.S.C.

teaching in Primary schools who have not been paid

this  increment, because the requirement  is  that

they must teach in secondary schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this scheme was originated to cope with the

shortage  of  graduate  teachers  in  the  English

medium,  there  are, therefore,  teachers  in  the

other  media who do not qualify for the additional

increment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Finance

if  he knows how many Singapore Sweep tickets have

been sold up to a latest convenient date; and what

percentage   of  the  proceeds  is  collected   by

Government and what percentage is retained by  the

Singapore Turf Club.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore Sweep is

run  by the Singapore Turf Club. According to  the

Singapore  Turf  Club,  2Â½  million  tickets  were

printed  for  the first draw and all  the  tickets

have been sold. The Singapore Turf Club has agreed

to hand over to the Government the entire proceeds

from  the sale of tickets after deducting  running

expenses,   payment   of   prizes,   and   agents'

commission. The sum which the Singapore Turf  Club

is deducting for running expenses is approximately

3.2 per cent of the gross proceeds of the lottery.

<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC ASSISTANCE TO</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>OLD-AGED PERSONS AND WIDOWS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Culture

and  Social Affairs if he will consider increasing

the amount of public assistance in respect of old-aged persons and widows.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, public

assistance payments are made by the Social Welfare

Department  to unemployed persons, including  aged

persons  and widows, at approved rates which  have

already been increased on two occasions under this

Government, i.e., in 1959 and 1962. These rates of

unemployment benefits, under which a large  family

can   receive  as  much  as  $90  per  month,  are

generally acknowledged to be the highest  paid  in

this  part  of the world, and it is not considered

desirable  to  increase the rates  further.  Under

this  scheme, an aged couple who are on their  own

and  have no one to provide for them, will receive

$31   per  month  and  a  widow  with,  say,  four

dependent children will receive $41 per month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, however, aware of the special needs of aged

persons   and   widows,  and  there  are   special

allowances  over  and above the public  assistance

payments  for which they are eligible. These  aged

persons  can  receive, in addition to  the  public

assistance  payments, a special old-age  allowance

of $12 per month for a single person and $18 for a

couple,  if they are 65 years old and above,  from

the  Silver Jubilee Fund, a charitable fund  which

is   also   administered  by  the  Social  Welfare

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also mention that the Social Welfare

Department  runs  Old  People's  Homes  to   which

destitute  aged  persons  with  no  relatives   or

friends to look after them can be admitted. Widows

are also eligible to receive, in addition to their

public  assistance  payments, special  educational

grants  of  $5  per  month per  child  in  primary

schools  and  $8 per month per child in  secondary

schools  from the Silver Jubilee Fund.  I  should,

however, like to assure the hon. Member that cases

of   aged  persons  or  widows  receiving   public

assistance  with  any  special  problems  will  be

reviewed sympathetically if they are brought to my

attention.

question. I would like to ask whether the Minister

intends  to  give assistance for  house  rents  to

those receiving public assistance payments.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is not

possible. If you give to one, you have to give  to

all those who receive aid from the department.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are now on Head 0601 - Ministry

of  Education.  Amendment No. (l)* Inche  Mahmud Awang.  He  is  not  present.

Mr  Sim  Boon  Woo, amendment No. (2) .



<hr size="2" noshade>

* Amendment No. (1) reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be reduced by the whole sum in respect of subhead 1002.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2116.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is encouraging to note an increase of

$200,000 for the vote for Contribution to  Lembaga

Gerakan  Pelajaran Dewasa. The  teachers  who  are

teaching   in   these  classes  are  teachers   by

profession during the day. You will agree with  me

that thousands of H.S.C. or middle school students

who  have passed their examinations are unemployed

at the moment. I am wondering whether the Minister

will give this teaching opportunity at the Lembaga

Gerakan  Pelajaran Dewasa to these people who  are

badly  in need of a job, instead of to these well-paid  teachers.  I just want to know  whether  the

Minister will consider this suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (Choa Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  wish  to ask the Minister whether  he  is

aware that adult education in Singapore is a self-liquidating  process, that is to say,  the  better

you train and the more effective



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>



you  carry out your job, the sooner you go out  of

business! In fact, by the present going,  I  think

the  Adult Education Board is doing very well, and

here I must pay a tribute to the Board. All I want

to  know  is what plans the Minister has  for  the

future of the Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, the Adult Education  Board  not

only  conducts literacy and language classes,  but

also  other extra-mural courses to cater  for  the

vocational,  civic and recreational  interests  of

the  public.  With our present trend of  education

and  the  ability  to  provide  universal  primary

education  to  all our school-age pupils,  without

compulsion, there may come a time when  there  may

not  be  a  demand for the literacy  and  language

classes conducted by the Board. But I do not think

the  Board will go into liquidation, because there

are other activities currently run by the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member for Changi that there are

large  numbers  of  unemployed  young  people   in

Singapore and that the Government should, wherever

possible, provide gainful employment for them.  It

is  in line with this policy that towards the  end

of 1964 the Adult Education Board was asked by the

Ministry   of  Education  to  consider   providing

opportunities  for employment for the  unemployed.

However, since unemployment is more acute  amongst

the  Chinese than the English medium, a pilot plan

was  implemented  in 1965 mainly directed  at  the

Chinese  medium  to replace 25  per  cent  of  its

teachers  by qualified but unemployed persons  who

have the following qualifications:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) School leavers with Chinese medium school

certificate  or Higher School  Certificates

with   the   required  minimum  educational

qualifications for recruitment as teachers-in-training;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Graduates of Nanyang University;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Experienced and/or trained teachers who

have  been  retired on grounds  of  age  or

redundancy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1966 the Board organised a short but intensive

course  to  train them. This training  course  was

conducted  by the staff of the Teachers'  Training

College  and the practical teaching was supervised

by  Inspectors of Schools and T.T.C. lecturers. An

examination was also conducted at the end  of  the

course,   and  only  successful  candidates   were

retained  in the part-time employment  offered  by

the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present there are 57 out of a total or 147

teachers,  or nearly 38 per cent, in the  literacy

and  language classes, and 75 out of 165 teachers,

or  nearly  45 per cent, in the secondary  evening

classes  who  are  recruited from the  unemployed.

Furthermore,  all the 26 second-language  teachers

in  the  Secondary  I  and literacy  and  language

classes  in the English medium also came from  the

same  source. However, part-time trained  teachers

from   Government  or  Government-aided   schools,

because   of  their  experience  and  professional

training,  are  retained in  the  Board  to  teach

senior  classes, whereas those recruited from  the

unemployed,   after  they  have  been   given   an

intensive training course, are teaching  only  the

Secondary I, II and literacy and language classes.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to replace all with this

category if the aim is to maintain the standard of

the   classes  organised  by  the  Board.  It   is

envisaged   that   in  1967  the  scheme   already

implemented in the Chinese medium will be  further

extended  to other language media and  to  recruit

about   150  unemployed  who  have  the  necessary

qualifications  to  teach  in  the  literacy   and

language classes in the English medium. It is also

planned   that   about   45   part-time   clerical

assistants  now  working in the Board  are  to  be

gradually replaced by full-time officers recruited

from   the   unemployed  who  have  the  necessary

qualifications.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like  to ask the Minister for  Education  a

question.  Will  he confirm that the  certificates

issued  by  the Adult Education Board  to  classes

like  Secondary I, II and III will be  treated  at

par with the certificates issued by the Government

or  Government-aided  schools  in  order  to  help

people who look for jobs?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The certificates issued by the

Adult Education Board for Secondary I, II and  III

will  certainly  be the same as  those  issued  by

Government or aided schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> In view of the explanation by

the   Minister,  I  beg  leave  to  withdraw   the

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2117.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the contribution to the Technical College,

Kuala  Lumpur, is reduced by $1,400 for  the  year

1967.  This is indeed quite a good sign.  But  the

Minister  for Education has stated in  this  House

that   most  of  the  students  studying  in   our

university  and  our  college are  from  Malaysia.

However,  the Malaysian Government has  not  given

any  grant to our higher educational body. I think

it  is  high  time  we  did likewise.  Should  the

Minister fail to give a satisfactory answer, I  am

not going to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, although it

is  true  that  the Malaysian Government  has  not

given  any  contribution towards  educating  their

students   at  Nanyang  University  or  Ngee   Ann

College,  nevertheless, I am sure the  Member  for

Changi will agree with me that we are not going to

follow in their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>



footsteps.  The  provision in the 1967  Budget  is

required  for payment to the Malaysian  Government

towards the cost of five students from the  Survey

Department,  Singapore,  who  are  undertaking   a

course  in  surveying  in the  Technical  College,

Kuala  Lumpur, for the year 1966/67.  The  average

cost  per student is around $1,500 per annum,  and

hence the provision.

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0601

be reduced by $100.++



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;( ++The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr. Tang See Chim and Mr. P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, recently a feeling of

uneasiness was experienced by parents of  students

in Malay schools because of the direction that the

uniform   of  girl  students  in  Malay  secondary

schools  should  be changed from  baju  kurong  to

skirt  and  blouse type of school uniform.  It  is

stated  that this type of school uniform  is  more

progressive than baju kurong. There are others who

say that Malay students are Muslims and to put  on

skirt  and  blouse is forbidden. The  Chairman  of

U.M.N.O., Singapore, Inche Ahmad Bin Haji Taff, in

wanting  to  safeguard  the  personality  of   the

students and Malay culture, has resisted the  idea

of  changing the baju kurong to skirt and  blouse.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  in  my opinion,  whether  the

students are progressive or not does not depend on

their uniform; it does not matter whether



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>



the  school  uniform is baju kurong or  skirt  and

blouse.  It  depends on the education imparted  to

them  by  the  teachers in  the  schools  and  the

encouragement  they get to study at home.  Whether

it  is  acceptable  (halal) or  forbidden  (haram)

depends  on each individual. Today there are  many

Malay   girls  who  put  on  dresses   which   are

transparent, and skin tight too. So, in  order  to

safeguard  Malay  culture  and  personality,  does

Inche  Ahmad Haji Taff himself put on baju  kurong

when  he  goes to work in the office? The attitude

of  this gentleman is like that of the mother crab

which  asks  its  baby to walk straight  when  she

herself  walks  sideways. It is  better  that  the

question of deciding on the school dress,  whether

it  is  to be baju kurong or skirt and blouse,  be

left to the parents themselves so long as there is

a  distinctive colour in the uniform according  to

the  school  the child attends. Also consideration

should be given to the extra expenditure that  may

be incurred by parents. But what is most important

is  to look into the matter of the progress of the

children's education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister, in replying to the Member for

Sembawang earlier, stated that at the moment there

are  very few qualified trained Malay teachers  to

teach in Malay secondary schools. Therefore,  with

this shortage, can Malay secondary students become

more progressive only by changing their dress from

baju  kurong to skirt and blouse? If the  Ministry

of  Education  are  aware of this  shortage,  they

should  then find ways and means to overcome  this

shortage  if they truly wish to see Malay students

progress  in  their studies. I still remember  the

Minister  for  Education during the Government  of

Tun  Lim  Yew  Hock  in  1957  stated  that  Malay

secondary schools could not be established because

there  were no teachers and no suitable  text-books

in  Malay.  But when the P.A.P. came to  power  in

1959, the then Minister for Education, who is  now

the  Minister  for  Health,  promised  that  Malay

secondary  schools would be established  in  1961,

although  he was still facing the same problem  of

teachers  and textbooks in Malay. But  because  of

the keen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>



effort  put  in,  Malay  secondary  classes   were

started in 1960, that is, one year earlier. If the

present  Minister for Education  is  to  wait  for

qualified teachers in the Malay stream to  descend

from  heaven, and likewise wait for textbooks  to

descend  from  heaven, then the intention  to  see

that  Malay  education  progresses  will  not   be

achieved.  I  would like to ask the Minister  what

plans  there are to encourage more Malay  graduate

teachers, because at present although there are  a

number  of  Malay graduates, they were transferred

or  ask  for  transfer to other jobs for  specific

reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would further like to state

that,  at  the moment, there are one or  two  pre-university  classes in the Malay  stream.  If  the

problem facing Malay secondary education cannot be

faced  by  the  Ministry, what hope is  there  for

those  in  the pre-university classes?  What  will

happen  to  those  students who  wish  to  go  for

further studies? Does the Ministry have any  plans

to overcome this problem?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding vocational education in the Malay

stream,  I  find that it is important to  increase

the  number  of vocational schools  in  the  Malay

stream  so  as  to  give  opportunities  to  Malay

students  to  study  in the vocational  stream  in

order  that they will be well equipped to work  in

factories   and  industries  which  need   skilled

workers. I hope the Minister will see to  it  that

vocational   schools  in  the  Malay   stream   be

increased  so as to enable Malay students  to  get

vocational training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding text-books, I have received complaints

that  certain schools change text-books from  year

to  year. This causes difficulties to parents  who

have  two  or  more children in the  same  school,

whereas  it  is  the  policy of  the  Ministry  of

Education  to provide opportunities  for  them  to

give   their   children  adequate  education.   If

textbooks are changed from year to year, this will

be a problem to the parents, because the textbooks

which  could  have been handed down to  the  other

children  cannot  be  handed  down.  I  hope  that

efforts will be made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



to see that textbooks in the schools could be used

in a manner that would not bring difficulty to the

parents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, education is

essential  in any society. In a developing  multi-racial,  multi-lingual, multi-religious  socialist

society like ours, however, education is called on

to  do  more than just training our young.  It  is

also   called  on  to  make  us  good  and  useful

citizens, to weld our nation together. In the past

we  lived not as a nation. We could not have  done

that  because we were then a subject race. In  the

past we lived in separate communities. Things  are

now  different.  We  are now independent  and  our

destiny  is  in our own hands. We are  responsible

for  our  own  future. We are,  however,  a  small

nation  living on a small island with  no  natural

resources. The only resources that we can boast of

are  our  own  people our skill  in  training,  in

manufacturing and in other fields.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of education, therefore, should be to

train and nurture these skills to make us good and

useful  citizens.  Education,  however,  does  not

consist of cramming up all the facts that  we  can

lay  our hands on - in being what we call a  book-worm or a walking dictionary. The aim of education

is  to make us a complete man, a man who can think

and act for himself, a man with a disciplined mind

and  a  healthy body. We can only achieve this  by

two   branches  of  education,  namely,   literary

education  and  physical education.  In  the  very

recent  past,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  our  education

system  was  defective  to  the  extent  that   we

attached  far  too  much  importance  to  literary

education  and not enough importance  to  physical

education.  A devotion to one branch of  education

to  the  exclusion of the other branch  would  not

serve   the   purpose  of  education.  Unmitigated

attention  to  physical  education,  for  example,

would produce a sort of ferocity in us, a sort  of

uncivilised harshness that we should avoid. On the

other  hand,  a mere literary education  makes  us

soft  and  dispirited, something that is not  good

for us. Ferocity, Mr Speaker, Sir, is the outcome

of  the  spirited  element in us. Proper  training

would produce



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



courage. But if that element is over-strained,  it

naturally becomes hard and savage. Gentleness,  on

the   other   hand,  is  characteristic   of   the

philosophic  disposition.  Here  again,  too  much

relaxation will result in over-softness. The right

training would produce a gentleness that is steady

and disciplined. We all know the saying: "All work

and no play makes Jack a dull boy." All class-work

and  no field activity would, therefore, take away

the  high  spirit that is in us and will  make  us

weak  and  unstable, bad tempered and peevish.  On

the  other  hand, there are consequences  of  hard

bodily exercise and high living with no attempt to

cultivate the mind or use the intellect in  study.

At first the sense of physical fitness fills a man

with  self-confidence  and energy  and  makes  him

twice  the man he is. But suppose he does  nothing

else  and  holds himself aloof from  any  sort  of

culture?  Then even if there is something  in  him

that  is  capable  of desiring  knowledge,  he  is

starved of instruction and is never encouraged  to

think  for  himself  by taking  part  in  rational

discussions or intellectual pursuits of any  kind.

And  so his mind grows feeble for lack of stimulus

and  nourishment, and deaf and blind  because  the

darkness  that clouds perception is never  cleared

away. Such a man ends by being wholly uncultivated

and   a  hater  of  reason.  Flaying  no  use  for

reasonable  persuasion, he gains all his  ends  by

savage violence, like a brute, and he lives  in  a

dull  stupor of ignorance with no touch of  inward

harmony or grace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this point, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am supported

by good authority and, with your permission, may I

quote from the Republic of Plato on "the Education

for  the  Guardians". This is the Conford Edition, Mr Speaker, Sir, at page 99 - middle of the page:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There are then these two elements in the soul -

the  spirited and the philosophic. And it  is  for

their   sake,  as  should  say,  and  not  (except

incidentally)  for the sake of the soul  and  body

that  heaven  has  given  to  mankind  these   two

branches of education. The purpose is to bring the

two  elements  into  tune  with  one  another   by

adjusting the tension of each to the right  pitch.

So  one  who can apply to the soul both  kinds  of

education blended in perfect proportion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>



would  be  master  of  a nobler  sort  of  musical

harmony  than was ever made by tuning the  strings

of the lyre.'



Therefore,  in our education system  we  must  not

only  concentrate on literary education  but  also

concentrate on what Plato calls, and I think it is

generally  called,  physical  education.  In  this

connection, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I inquire of the

Education Minister what has happened to  the  idea

of  setting  up an elite school? This  is  a  very

important subject and perhaps Members here will be

given   an  opportunity  to  consider  fully   the

question before this elite school is set up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note in the Budget that as usual

Education  has taken a lion's share in the  coming

year's  expenditure.  It is also  noted  that  the

emphasis is now shifting from primary education to

secondary education. In this connection, it may be

relevant  to  ask the Education Minister  whether,

and  if  so  when, he would take steps to  provide

free secondary education?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> That

may mean more taxes, you know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> On the question of primary

education,  Sir,  it  is  noted  that  it  is  not

compulsory,  as was remarked by the  Minister  for

Health.  Perhaps the Minister for  Education  will

note   this   and  possibly  will  also  introduce

compulsory primary education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a developing society, Mr Speaker, Sir, there

is  not only the question of general education, but

also  the  question of technical education  to  be

considered.  I  am  glad to note  in  the  Finance

Minister's  Budget  Speech that  steps  are  being

taken  to set up technical and vocational schools.

I  would like to inquire of the Education Minister

whether  steps are being taken to co-ordinate  the

education system in this respect and see  that  we

get sufficient technicians for the requirements of

our  industries.  I would also  recommend  to  the

Education Minister that he should coordinate  with

the  Economic  Development Board to see  that  the

requirements of industry for technicians are met.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, in view of what has been said by our

Prime  Minister at the opening of the Third  Asian

Teachers'  Seminar that "teachers  are  anonymous,

faceless,   listless,  etc.",  may  I  know   what

immediate  steps  the Minister  for  Education  is

taking to rectify the situation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> I wish to draw the attention of the

Minister  for Education to certain inconsistencies

in  the  matter of duties and responsibilities  of

the  principals in primary and secondary  schools.

As a new nation which is determined to build up an

identity  and culture of its own and to equip  its

young  to meet the changed conditions, we are  all

aware  that  a re-orientation in our thinking  and

action is important. In this connection, the  role

of  our  teachers and principals cannot  be  over-emphasised. I have come to understand that once  a

teacher becomes a principal, he tends to lose  all

contact with the classrooms and his students  whom

he  is  supposed  to  lead and  inspire  with  his

leadership. Instead he is bogged down  with  paper

work  by  the Ministry which tends to  reduce  him

more or less to a chief clerk.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that most of the principal's work is

to   transmit  instructions  received   from   the

Ministry  to  teachers  and report  for  frivolous

reasons  personally to the Ministry. Letters  sent

by principals to the Ministry often do not receive

proper   attention  or,  in  certain  cases,   the

principals  themselves dare  not  write  a  second

reminder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many of the large schools, principals and

senior  assistants,  who are  usually  highly-paid

Division I officers and experienced teachers, have

to  spend  most of their time doing clerical  work

which  could  be  done  by Division  III  clerical

officers.  How then can we expect our  principals,

who are no more than mere transmitting agents,  to

be  positive in their approach, to be creative and

inspire those who are under their care?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Minister for Education to

conduct a survey to find out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>



how  many  principals  and  senior  assistants  of

schools  have  to  devote their time  to  clerical

work,   and  how  much  of  this  work  could   be

undertaken  by a clerk or an executive officer.  I

would  suggest  that  all  principals  of  schools

should  be allowed to teach at least one period  a

day  in  the classes. This arrangement will enable

them  to  keep  in touch with students  and  truly

assess   the  progress  of  the  school  and   the

direction it is heading. By keeping in touch  with

their  class-room conditions, they will  be  in  a

better   position  to  understand  the  needs   of

teachers  and the general attitude and outlook  of

the student body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also understood that some of the problems

of    principals   stem   from   an    inequitable

distribution  of teachers to schools.  While  some

schools have too many teachers, thus enabling  the

teachers  to  have too many free  periods  a  day,

other schools are not adequately staffed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore urge the Minister for Education

to  give serious thought to this matter and revise

the  system so that principals of schools will  be

in  a  position to keep in touch with the students

and   project  much-needed  character   into   the

schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  we  all know  that  the  vote  for

education is the largest for next year. I have two

suggestions   to  make  regarding  education   and

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point is about the post allowance for

principals - in other words, this allowance is  to

enable  them  to look after their schools  better.

But,  in  actual  fact, the  result  is  just  the

contrary, because once a principal gets a handsome

pay with an additional post allowance, he will not

like  to lose his job and he will not like to take

steps to get rid of anti-national elements in  his

school.  He will appease these elements  and  will

not take action against them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is this. The Ministry of

Education  is  not quite efficient in  controlling

the  purchase and sale of text-books  through  the

principals - the Member for Kampong  Kembangan  has

raised the question of the purchase of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



school  text-books - because they  are  allowed  a

certain  percentage of commission on the  purchase

of text-books. This means that they can make money

out  of such transactions and they, therefore,  do

not  like  the  text-books to remain unchanged.  A

certain  number  of  them just  try  to  obtain  a

commission  on  the bills sent by the  sellers  of

text-books  without even looking into the  details

or  taking  the  trouble to find out  whether  the

books  are worth the money. This does no  good  to

our  education and nation. Why should we then give

such  a  big vote to education and waste  so  much

allowance on the principals?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I

am  an  ex-principal, I think what the Member  for

Paya  Lebar  has  said  needs  a  little  bit   of

clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my 16 years in school, I must say that I have

not  known of a single principal in English medium

schools  who  had  anything to do  with  bookshops

paying him a percentage. It might have happened in

Chinese schools - and I must say that I have heard

of that but not in English medium schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, our nation lays great  emphasis  on

education. This can be seen especially when we are

conducting  every  year  primary  school  combined

examinations   and   secondary   school   combined

examinations  with  the  object  of  checking  the

progress of students. This is very good. But if it

is   too  good,  then,  of  course,  it  will   be

excessive. There are principals of certain schools

who  are  really not good. Although some  students

obtain  over 60 per cent marks, they are asked  to

leave  school to ensure that the school can get  a

better    pass   percentage   in   the    combined

examinations.  What  is the  reason  for  this?  I

cannot understand it. If the students of a certain

school  get  worse  results than  those  of  other

schools, then there may be some reason for getting

rid of the students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member opposite me said that he had

been a principal. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



was  teaching in Indonesia before, and almost half

of  the  students in my class could  not  pass  an

examination. I gave them extra tuition and many of

them  managed to become good students.  So  it  is

against   the  principle  of  education  to   sack

students  for  poor  results,  more  so  as  these

students  have around 65 per cent marks, just  for

prestige.  You do not have to spend more  time  on

the clever students. The bad students need more of

the  teacher's time and energy. So I hope that the

Minister for Education will pay more attention  to

this  and direct principals of schools not to sack

such  students. We should not chase  them  out  of

school  but  we should ask them to come  back  and

improve their education so that they will be  able

to  get  70, 80 or 90 per cent marks.  It  is  not

right to ask students to leave school so that  the

school  can improve its passing percentage in  the

combined  examinations,  and  therefore  does  not

compare badly with other schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are approaching guillotine time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I will probably speak for five minutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make a few points. My first

point  is  this. I believe it is our intention  to

hold the Secondary IV (English stream) examination

and  mark the papers locally. This examination  is

commonly known as the Cambridge School Certificate

Examination.    Some   time    ago,    we    heard

pronouncements about the setting  up  of  a  Local

Examinations Syndicate, but up to now this has not

materialised.  I would like to know whether  plans

are already under way to carry out such a project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is in respect of the way the

Primary School Leaving Examination is held. Papers

are given to Primary VI students requiring them to

choose  the  correct  answer  from  several  given

answers.  I think this system is not a sound  one,

because a student who does not know the correct



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



answer can simply make a wild guess. I have  heard

of  cases where students simply cast lots for  the

answers. I wish to suggest that another system  be

considered  whereby school-leavers in the  primary

stream  will be examined and tested on  what  they

have studied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is this. I suggest to the Minister

concerned that the entire school curriculum should

be  revised. We are a young independent nation and

it is our intention to give equal opportunities to

one  and  all, irrespective of race,  language  or

religion.   Sir,   in   view   of   the    changed

circumstances and our objective to build a  robust

and   rugged  society  within  the  framework   of

democratic  socialist  principles,  I  think   the

entire  school  curriculum  should  be  thoroughly

revised  and that a committee, comprising  eminent

educationists, be set up so as to work out  a  new

curriculum  for all schools. By that, I  am  sure,

Sir, our objectives will be met.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> I just want to take up one point.

The  hon. Member for Punggol has talked about  the

Primary School Leaving Examination. Because I  was

closely   connected  with  the  running  of   that

examination  for  several years,  I  know  how  it

works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually I am surprised when the Member says that

the  objective  type of examination  is  not  good

because the students tend to just toss a coin  and

are sure to get a certain number of answers right.

The  objective  test  is  actually  considered  by

leading educationists in the world as the sure way

of  finding out what children know. In the marking

of a paper, for example, if there are 80 questions

set  and  there  are 4 possible  answers  to  each

question  given, if a child were to put down  just

"(1) ",  "(1) ", "(1) ", and so on as the answers  to

all  the  80 questions, well, he will get only  20

marks,   i.e, one-quarter.  But  in  the   actual

computation  of  the  results,  he  gets  a  zero;

because  if he gets 20 marks, it is equivalent  to

0.  Anyway,  the system takes too long to  explain

here,  but in the marking system where a boy  were

to  try  that sort of trick, he would get actually

nothing:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I subscribe

fully  to  all  the  sentiments expressed  by  the

Member for Choa Chu Kang, in particular, that  the

aim  of  education should be to produce a complete

man,  literate as well as healthy. On the  aim  of

education I do not think there is any controversy.

It is not really a very controversial subject. The

arguments  centre round how best  to  achieve  the

aim.  In  my  view,  if you want  to  produce  the

complete  man, one who is literate  and  sound  in

health, it depends on the system of education, the

principal, the teachers, the family and  the  home

environment. Whatever sound educational system  we

might devise, if the principal and the teachers do

not understand the aim and are not prepared to put

in the effort, then it will fail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for that matter that we are organising a

seminar of principals sometime towards the end  of

the  month with a view to getting suggestions from

them, and hoping in the process that they will  be

educated also!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Choa Chu Kang has raised the

question  of the elite school. The land  for  this

particular school has been acquired and plans  are

being  drawn  up. As soon as these are  ready  and

approval is given, an announcement will be made as

to when the work will be carried out, the basis of

admission, and so forth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While everybody will agree that it is ideal and

that  it  will be desirable to have free secondary

education, I think our present financial  position

will  not  permit free secondary education  to  be

introduced.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> We

have thousands of unemployed!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The Member for Farrer Park has

mentioned  that a teacher, once he is promoted  to

be a principal, becomes a chief clerk instead of a

principal.  If  that happens, then  I  think  that

principal  is  not fit to hold that  post  and  he

should  vacate it to make way for a more competent

person  to be the principal. As for the suggestion

that the principal should be asked



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



to teach at least a period a day, I think it is  a

sound  suggestion and I shall certainly look  into

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of principals changing school text-books year after year can only be resolved if the

parents will cooperate with the Ministry, and also

if the principals will be more responsible and not

succumb  to the temptation of commissions  offered

to  them  by the booksellers. The present practice

is  that  a  school  should not change  text-books

every  year,  but that a change can only  be  made

after  three  years and after sound  reasons  have

been  advanced  for the proposed change  of  text-books.  If the Member for Paya Lebar can  tell  me

who  is the principal who changes text-books every

year, I shall certainly deal with him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Kampong Kembangan, the

change of school uniform from the baju kurong  and

sarong  to  blouse  and skirt  is  voluntary.  The

pupils  or the parents are not compelled  to  make

the  change if they do not want to. The suggestion

was made because it was found from experience that

the  baju  kurong and sarong uniform hinders  free

movement during physical education - games. And if

we want to produce a robust and rugged generation,

it is necessary that more emphasis should be given

to  physical training, sports and games. It is for

that reason that the suggestion was made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not compulsory if the parents refuse to

allow their children to put on blouse and skirt. I

do  not think that just by changing to blouse  and

skirt, the traditional culture of the Malays  will

be  destroyed. There are many instances  in  other

Muslim  countries  where they put  on  blouse  and

skirt  but they are still a powerful nation;  they

still  have their own national identity and  their

own culture. Therefore, the argument that just  by

changing the baju kurong and sarong to blouse and,

skirt,  the culture of the race will be  destroyed

is not true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malay pre-university students can be admitted to

the   Malay  Studies  Department  either  at   the

University  of  Singapore  or  the  University  of

Malaya. They



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



can  also  enrol for professional courses  at  the

Polytechnic in the same way as the Chinese  medium

H.S.C. classes if they have an adequate knowledge

of  a  second language, which is English  in  this

instance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that there is a shortage of graduate

Malay  teachers  to undertake the Secondary  Malay

medium  classes. The Ministry has been trying  its

best  to  increase the supply by offering generous

bursaries  and scholarships to Malay students  who

are  qualified  for admission to  the  university.

Furthermore,  we have provided free education  for

Malays  from  the  primary up  to  the  university

level. In addition, other bursaries and free text-books  are  provided. We hope that by  this  means

there will be a greater number of Malays who  will

stay  in school up to university level. The Member

for Kampong Kembangan will, I think, be aware that

this is a slow process and it will take many years

before we can achieve the target.

has   made   provision   for   one   Parliamentary

Secretary.  But,  in  actual  fact,  we  have  two

Parliamentary Secretaries. Does it mean  that  one

of  the two Parliamentary Secretaries is doing the

job on a voluntary basis?



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I would like to speak on this item, but  the

Member  has taken the words out of my  mouth.,  I

have nothing more to say.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must

congratulate the Members for Aljunied and Delta on

their  very sharp eyes in detecting that the  1967

Estimates   provide  for  only  one  Parliamentary

Secretary,  but, in fact, I have the pleasure  and

privilege of having two Parliamentary Secretaries.

The  second Parliamentary Secretary, who  is  now

the  Member  for  Bukit Timah,  was  my  Political

Secretary for the last three years and he has been

doing excellent work in the Ministry. But when  it

was  time for the Bukit Timah by-election to  take

place,  and it was decided by the People's  Action

Party  to  field Mr Chor Yeok Eng as a candidate,

it  was necessary for him then to resign from  the

service   of   the  Government  as  my   Political

Secretary. With his return unopposed, I put to the

Prime  Minister the question of his  reappointment

either   as  a  Political  Secretary   or   as   a

Parliamentary  Secretary. It was then  decided  by

the  Prime Minister that Mr Chor could be another

Parliamentary  Secretary. It was,  therefore,  the

privilege of the Prime Minister that Mr Chor Yeok

Eng  be made a Parliamentary Secretary. Therefore,

he was posted to the Ministry of Health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the two Members concerned are not aware

of  the fact that the preparation of the Estimates

takes as much as eight months before it could find

itself in print. In fact, at this very moment, all

Ministries  are working on the 1968 Estimates.  So

although   the  post  of  a  second  Parliamentary

Secretary  may  not appear in the 1967  Estimates,

all  that  is  necessary  for,  the  Minister  for

Finance and Treasury to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



do is to agree to an application for supplementary

estimates. I can only assume that so long  as  the

second  Parliamentary Secretary gets  his  salary,

therefore,  the Treasury has already approved  his

post.  I am one of the fortunate Ministers  to  be

ably assisted by two Parliamentary Secretaries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1004.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in moving this amendment, I

wish  to raise two items. Firstly, I wish  to  ask

the  Minister for Health why there is a difference

in  the  publication of the results of the tenders

for  drugs  and  pharmaceutical products  for  his

Ministry.   All  other  Government   tenders   are

published  in  full  with the  quotations  of  the

successful  tenderer  and  those  of   the   other

tenderers,  whereas in respect of the Ministry  of

Health  the individual items of quotation are  not

stated in the Government Gazette.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second item I wish to raise is the open sale

of  harmful drugs in shops which is not under  the

control  of pharmacists or doctors. I am referring

to pep pills which are openly sold in shops. These

pills are reputed to restore energy and act  as  a

stimulant.  They are taken mostly  by  youths  who

wish to remain awake in the night. I was told that

these  pills  are very harmful and once  a  person

takes  them,  he becomes an addict.  I  understand

there  are cases of people taking these pills  who

have gone to Woodbridge Hospital. I would ask  the

Minister  to look into this matter as  unless  the

sale of these drugs is stopped, it may affect  our

youths.  I  understand no action  is  being  taken

because the Ministry of Health feels that this  is

a  matter  for the Customs. I believe the  Customs

feels  this is a matter for the police. The matter

is going round in circles.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

quite able to answer the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



Member  for River Valley in respect of  his  first

question,  when he states that he does not  appear

to  find in the Government Gazette the publication

of tenders for the supply of drugs to my Ministry.

I  would consider that rather odd if that  is  not

done.  If  it  is  the case of not providing  full

particulars of the successful tender,  then  there

may  be  a  reason for it. It is not  possible  to

itemise   every  tender  that  has  been  awarded,

because  certain  tenders amount to  hundreds  and

thousands of dollars and cover a variety of items.

I  would  say that, in principle, it is  desirable

and necessary that when Government Ministries make

purchases of articles or drugs where they are  put

to  open tender, the results of such award  should

be  publicised in the Government Gazette.  If  the

Member could give me further information later  on

on this subject and if there is any deficiency,  I

shall see to it that it will be rectified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his second point, he feels that there should

be  some form of control on what he calls the sale

of  dangerous drugs by indicating that  pep  pills

are dangerous drugs. I would like to be guided  by

professional officers in this respect.  If  it  is

true  that  there  are those  who,  having  had  a

surfeit  of  pep  pills,  have  been  admitted  to

Woodbridge  Hospital,  I  am  confident  that   my

doctors in Woodbridge Hospital would be the  first

to  raise  this  point with the Ministry  and,  on

receipt  of their advice, action would follow.  If

it  is  true that the control of the sale  of  pep

pills by unauthorised persons in Singapore is  now

being  made the subject of passing the  buck  from

one  Ministry to another, from the Customs to  the

police,  and  from the police to the  Ministry  of

Health and so on, then I will certainly look  into

it and ensure that at least the Ministry of Health

will  make  up its mind whether or not control  is

really   necessary  with  the  present  state   of

knowledge that we have of the pep pills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the health services in Singapore are

the best in the whole of South-East Asia. They are

highly commendable. However, we must not say  that

they  have  no  defects. Whenever we  detect  some

defects,  I hope the Minister will take  steps  to

remedy them so that our health services will reach

a stage of perfection as far as possible.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know and appreciate that the work in the

hospitals,  apart  from that of  the  doctors,  is

passed  over  to the nurses and other  attendants.

Comparatively speaking, it is the nurses  who  are

in  close  contact with the patients. Because  of

their  illness,  some  patients  are  particularly

grumpy.  This  is,  of  course,  inevitable.   The

services  performed by nurses are  different  from

those performed by other public servants. In other

words,    when    they   have    accepted    their

responsibility  as  nurses, they  must  appreciate

their  role which is quite extraordinary and  more

responsible  than  that  of  the  ordinary  public

servant. They must pay special attention to  their

patients. The life of the patients depends on  the

nurses   who   must  serve  them   carefully   and

patiently. But because of certain grumpy patients,

some  nurses  cannot do their work in  a  kind  or

patient  manner. Because of this,  these  patients

are dissatisfied with their services. These nurses

have  not  shown enough tolerance and kindness  to

the  patients who, in turn, will make  complaints,

sometimes  to Members of Parliament and  sometimes

to  other departments of Government. Of course, we

do  not  say  for a moment that this situation  is

widespread. It is not. But whether it is  or  not,

we can still say



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



that  from  the  complaints  made  by  Members  of

Parliament,  nothing seems to have  improved  very

much.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that the Member for Moulmein last year

did  make  a complaint to the department concerned

about  the  discourtesy  of  some  nurses  towards

patients or other members of the public who sought

help  from the hospitals. At that time, I remember

the  Parliamentary Secretary replied that  because

the  complaints from the public and patients  were

unspecified - no names were given, no descriptions

of  the nurses were given the department concerned

was  unable  to  take any action. So  I  hope  the

Ministry will pay attention to what I am going  to

say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My suggestion is whether some measures may be

taken to give a number to each and every nurse  in

Singapore.  In  other words,  something  like  the

numbers  shown on the police constables' uniforms.

Say, in group one you can have "E" or "B" or other

identification numbers which may be  used  on  the

nurses' uniforms. I do not think this will present

any  difficulty. If you have these  identification

numbers  on  the uniforms of nurses, then  persons

who  want  to make complaints against the culprits

can  take  down  the numbers for the  purposes  of

record and make their complaints. This will enable

the  department  concerned to take  the  necessary

action against the culprits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there is another point worthy

of  consideration. With the numbers shown  on  the

uniforms,  the nurses will realise that those  who

have made mistakes will be punished and those  who

are good will be praised by members of the public.

So  I  would like the Minister to see to  it  that

record books are placed in each and every ward  of

the  hospitals  so  that patients  are  given  the

opportunity to say good things of the good  nurses

and  make  complaints against the bad nurses,  and

awards or punishment may be meted out accordingly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan, if you want the

Minister to reply, I am afraid you have to stop.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes, I will

try  my  best  to  shorten my  speech  as  far  as

possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, the public servants in the hospitals

will  be better able to carry out their duties  so

that  members  of  the  public  will  have  closer

contact with them. This is what I am going to  say

in this respect.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, time has

already  run  out  for me. But I hope,  with  your

permission, I shall be able to answer  the  Member

as much as I can. I agree with her that one should

never  be  satisfied  with conditions  and  should

always  attempt  to improve; especially  if  there

should be any deficiencies, we should endeavour to

rectify them. It is only in this way that  we  can

progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has spoken largely on the role of

nurses,  but she has been good enough to say  that

not  all nurses are unkind. So here again  we  are

dealing  with the subject of the minority  of  any

community  who  may  not  live  up  to  the   high

traditions of this noble vocation of nursing.  She

makes  the suggestion that nurses should be  asked

to put on a number like that of police constables,

so that it will be easy for identification in case

of  complaints. But she is also wise enough to say

that  it is also possible for a patient to be able

to remember the number of the nurse who has looked

after him very well, so that there will either  be

a  bouquet or a brickbat. This is a question which

I  believe has been discussed with A.U.P.E., which

represents   the  nurses,  and  I  am   given   to

understand that there is some resistance  to  even

having  names  attached to  the  lapels  of  their

uniforms.  I  personally  think  it  is   a   good

suggestion to have tag names on uniforms.  We  are

already  making  a start with the doctors,  and  I

would  like  to pursue this matter in  respect  of

nurses  with a different colour - one  colour  for

doctors  and a different colour for nurses.  There

may be resentment to having numbers on uniforms. I

will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



endeavour to look into this matter for 1967.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I beg to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $4,574,830 for Head 0701 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0702 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have an excellent medical service in our

Republic.  We can even claim that it is among  the

best  in  Asian countries. The outpatient services

provided in the various districts are very helpful

to  citizens. The Ministry of Health has not  only

brought medical services to the doorsteps  of  our

people,  but these outpatient services  have  also

relieved congestion in the General Hospital  where

emergency  cases  could be dealt with  efficiently

and   quickly.   But  in  spite   of   all   these

improvements, there are certain points I  wish  to

bring  to  the kind attention of the Minister  for

Health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a letter dated 21st July, 1966,

signed by one Dr Ho Guan Lim, Deputy Director  of

Medical  Services  (Hospitals),  replying   to   a

complaint  I  made on 18th July, 1966.  My  letter

complained  of  a  rusty nail found  in  the  food

served to a patient in the Tan Tock Seng Hospital.

Sir,   in   his  reply  the  D.D.M.S.  (Hospitals)

regretted  that  such  a thing  had  happened  and

promised  that he would tell the hospitals  to  be

more  careful in the preparation of food. While  I

appreciate this act of the D.D.M.S. (Hospitals). I

have to quote the second paragraph of the reply:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I do not think this was deliberate. But, as you

know,  food in the hospitals is prepared  in  bulk

and foreign bodies like this may turn up from time

to  time and missed when the food is prepared  and

served.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know it was not deliberate, but I think if

careful  attention is paid to the  preparation  of

food,  definitely the presence of  foreign  bodies

can be prevented.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been

supply  of  trained  assistant  nurses  from  this

school. So much so that previous to this year, the

graduates   from   this   training   school   were

automatically  appointed  to  the  posts  in   the

various hospitals in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rodrigues, you are referring to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to make it a rule that letters of

complaint  from  Members of Parliament  should  be

sent  to  me, but I have been a bit busy recently.

So  this particular exchange of correspondence was

not made known to me until the Member read it out.

I  think  it is a fair reply given by the official

that it is regretted that a nail was found in  the

food.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Lucky.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Patients usually go to doctors

for  tonics.  They are given iron tonic  which  is

really iron in a liquid form and which does  good,

I  think,  to the human constitution. I  do  admit

that it must have come as a shock to the patient -

especially a sick and ill patient in the Tan  Tock

Seng  Hospital who generally stays in the hospital

for a fairly long time from three to six months  -

to find a rusty nail in the food. But it is always

possible,  even in the very best of  hotels  where

you may pay $20 for a dinner, to find a rusty nail

and, of course, if it is discovered, there will be

ample  apologies  from the head-waiter  downwards,

probably  with  the  manager running  out  of  his

office  to extend his apologies. These things  are

possible.  This should not be taken as an  example

of  deliberate negligence, but it should be  taken

in  the  spirit in which the letter  was  written,

that we will do our best. We are sorry that it has

happened - it can happen again, of course.  But  we

will try to see that it will not happen again, and

we  will  draw  the attention of the  cooks  to  a

complaint like this, and so forth. But I certainly

cannot guarantee that another rusty nail will  not

turn up in another hospital!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Delta has

touched a little on what I had intended to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past under the colonial regime, we had

various  staff in the hospitals - doctors,  nurses,

attendants and others. The doctors could  be  said

to  be  heads of the various departments and  they

acted  like  emperors. They were very pompous  and

the patients regarded them with fear. They did not

pay  attention  to the patients. On the  contrary,

the  patients  were ridiculed and neglected.  This

sort  of  situation prevailed in the old  colonial

days, but it was wiped out when the P.A.P. came to

power   in  1959.  The  situation  now  is   quite

different. But, unfortunately, it is not  manifest

in  all the hospitals. Some staff in the hospitals

have  again adopted the colonial type of  attitude

which   prevailed  before.  They   ill-treat   the

patients and adopt a contemptuous attitude towards

them.  There  have  been many such  complaints.  I

myself  have  received quite  a  number  of  them,

especially  from the poorer people  in  the  rural

areas.  These people seek treatment in  Government

hospitals.  Contrary to their  expectations,  they

are  ill-treated and suffer mental cruelty at  the

hands



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>



of  certain staff in the hospitals. As they are in

need  of medical attention, there is no other  way

out for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have several suggestions to make in connection

with  the  Kandang Kerbau Hospital. The  treatment

meted out to certain patients is rather unfair. We

have  read in the Press and also heard a lot about

the  ill-treatment meted out by the Kandang Kerbau

Hospital  staff.  Even  my  wife  has  experienced

maltreatment  in  that  hospital.  This  is   very

regrettable  and is the cause of  my  anger.  This

will  cast  an  aspersion on the  white  angels  -

namely, the nurses in the Kandang Kerbau Hospital!

Let  me  give some examples. This year, a pregnant

woman was warded there and she was in great labour

pains.  She was yelling for her papa and mama  and

the  nurse  cursed  her  saying,  "When  you  feel

pleasant and happy, you do not shout for your papa

and mama. Why do you now call for them?" This is a

very  awkward situation. When she felt the  labour

pangs -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In view of the time now, and, if

the  Minister is to have time to reply,  will  you

shorten your remarks, Mr Tay?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I was hoping

to  air all my views, but I will try to shorten my

speech  as  much as possible because of  the  time

limit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this patient said to the nurse on duty that it

was  about  time  for her to give birth.  But  the

nurse  told her, "You have given birth to so  many

babies. Do you not know that this is not the  time

for  you to deliver?" It was only when the patient

shouted,  "The  head of the baby is almost  coming

out," that the nurse took steps to put her in  the

labour room. So this is really a bad situation and

it is beyond my description. There have been cases

like this. When patients say to the nurses,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>



"If  you act like this towards us, we do not  care

to come here again," the nurses reply, "If that is

the  case, then it will be more convenient for  us

and  we will not have work to do. It will be  much

better for us." This minority group of people  who

are   ignorant   and  adopt  such  a  contemptuous

attitude  towards patients at the expense  of  the

paying public are not worth their salt.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tay, if your notes are an

indication of the length of what is to come, I  am

afraid I must stop you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, what I want

to  say  is that my amendment touches on  all  the

three hospitals.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tay. I have fixed 4.30 p.m. as

the  time  when the debate on this  Head  must  be

concluded.  This  means that if you  have  genuine

grievances  and  you want to hear  the  Minister's

reply, you must stop to give him time to reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I will round it

off  very  quickly. I will discard a  part  of  my

speech  and try to finish what I have  to  say  as

soon as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this sort of attitude by public

servants   is  bad  for  the  Government.   In   a

democratic society, the Government is like  a  bus

and  its servants are part and parcel of the  bus,

like  petrol.  If  the petrol  is  dirty  and  not

filtered and the engine is out of order and  needs

repairs,  it  will be bad and possibly  disastrous

for the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very

sorry to hear from the Member for Paya Lebar  that

his  wife  had  a  bad experience in  the  Kandang

Kerbau  Hospital.  I was not  aware  of  that.  He

should at least have given me some indication that

such  an unfortunate thing had taken place  and  I

would have looked into the matter. But I think his

long  complaint of what took place in the  Kandang

Kerbau   Hospital  unless  it  is   the   personal

experience of his wife - could very well be an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>



essay  written by one of his students in class  of

the goings-on in a maternity hospital, because  he

was  so  dramatic and graphic! I  do  not,  for  a

moment,  tolerate any ill-behaviour or discourtesy

on  the part of nurses and midwives towards  their

patients.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> But I think it is very

difficult for a proper investigation to be made if

the   Member   just  makes  a  sort   of   graphic

description of what took place, without indicating

the time, and the person concerned. I hope he will

take  into account the actual situation  in  which

things  happen in the Labour Ward of  the  Kandang

Kerbau   Maternity   Hospital,   which   has   the

reputation of being the largest maternity hospital

in  the world. Medical students going for training

in  Kandang Kerbau Hospital say their hair  stands

on  end when they see babies popping out every few

minutes!  They use the words "popping out".  Every

day over 100 babies are born; every few minutes  a

baby  pops  out. Can you imagine a  doctor,  or  a

midwife, or a nurse behaving naturally under  such

conditions? Naturally they are all excited and  at

their  wits' end trying to save the lives  of  the

mothers and babies.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Yong, I am afraid guillotine

time  is  now, and I must stop you. Does  Mr  Tay

wish to proceed with his amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, may I be

allowed  to say a few words more before I withdraw

my amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tay, I am afraid I cannot allow

it  because  all the other Members with amendments

will  complain  to  me that they  have  taken  the

trouble  to  put down amendments and have  had  no

opportunity  to  be  heard. But  if  you  want  to

discuss  hospitals, arrangements for a  debate  on

the adjournment are available to you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I just want

to  say  that I did mention this incident  to  the

Parliamentary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



Secretary in May, but I did not get any reply from

him.  But in view of the reply by the Minister,  I

would like to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time allotted for Head 0702 having expired,

the following amendment, standing in the names  of

Mr  Tang See Chim and Mr S. V. Lingam,  was  not

proceeded with:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0702

be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $44,088,790 for Head 0702 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0703 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0703 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to raise only one point. In my

constituency there are a few persons who carry  on

the  manufacture of gingili oil. This is done more

or  less  as  a traditional business  on  a  small

scale.  We  can  even say that these  are  cottage

industries.   Recently  the   manufacturers   have

received  letters  from  the  Ministry  of  Health

informing  them  that  they should  have  licences

under   the   Food   and  Drugs   Regulations   to

manufacture gingili oil. They are quite willing to

apply   for   licences.  But  there  are   certain

difficulties,  such as buildings, dwellings,  etc.

They  have been doing this business and living  in

the  same  building for the last 20 to  30  years.

Moreover, they are operating under licences issued

to  them by the Inspector of Machinery. One of the

major  difficulties which they now face is finding

accommodation  for their families elsewhere.  Sir,

the  Rule which insists that the place of dwelling

should be different from that of business could be

applied  to  applicants who start  their  business

after  the  coming into operation  of  this  Rule,

which I believe is from 1-1-65. But in the cases I

have  cited, could the Minister be good enough  to

consider  them sympathetically, as they have  been

there for more than 20 years?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I tend to

agree with the Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



for Aljunied that, in the determination of whether

a  factory should be licensed or not, perhaps some

exemption  may he permitted if such a  factory  is

indeed  a small one and could be classified  as  a

home  industry. But the rub is that one  does  not

know  exactly when it is a home industry that  has

done  so  well that it has become a real  factory.

However,  it is not, I think, a fair principle  to

say that just because a factory has been going  on

for the last 20 years, therefore, it should go  on

for  the  next 20 years in its old-fashioned  way.

Because  Singapore  is  fast  being  rebuilt   and

urbanised, what used to be a cottage industry  and

may  be far, far away from the city area 10 or  20

years  ago is not the same cottage industry today,

because  it  might very well be in  the  heart  of

Singapore itself, so that it is necessary to  have

some  element of control and the minimum of health

requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must, however, say that precautions have been

taken  in the Ministry of Health for the Licensing

Committee  to be composed not only of professional

officers  but,  in  fact,  to  have  a  membership

largely composed of Members of Parliament who  are

non-professionals   and   who   are   best   able,

therefore,    to    appreciate    the    political

implications  in  the implementation  of  official

regulations,  etc. It is my view  that  for  quite

some  time, the Licensing Committee of my Ministry

seems   to  have  been  somewhat  rigid   in   its

application of regulations, and I had hoped  that,

with  the  presence  of  a large  number  of  non-professionals  in this Committee, this  aspect  of

the  problem  would be looked into.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir, I am, in fact, contemplating a change in  the

composition  of  the membership of  the  Licensing

Committee to include members of the public who are

generally  affected by such licensing  policy,  so

that   there  would  be  various  viewpoints   and

opinions  expressed  in this Committee  comprising

professional  officers,  those  in  the  political

field, and also ordinary members of the public, to

ensure  that the policy that we implement will  be

found   to  be  reasonable  and,  therefore,   any

harshness in the application of regulations  might

be tempered.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with the

Minister. But the people concerned are not against

the requirements. What they are asking is that the

requirements should be the minimum. But the Health

Ministry  has  asked them to have a better  place.

This  is  more  or less a case where these  people

have been running this business for the last 20 or

30  years. They are willing to abide by the rules.

But if you ask them to take off the attap roof, or

demolish  the  old building and build  a  concrete

one,  then it is too much for them. So I hope  the

Minister will look into this case and consider  it

sympathetically.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Do you wish to proceed with the

amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> No, Sir, I beg to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr S. V. Lingam -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0703 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1201.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> I am not moving, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0703 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1901.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, I would appreciate it

if  the  Minister could advise this House  of  the

progress so far of the resiting of the hawkers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am glad that the Member for

River  Valley  has  given  me  an  opportunity  to

outline the progress on the resiting of hawkers in

Singapore. In this respect, I must, first of  all,

express  my  gratitude to him for his co-operation

and   the  part  he  himself  has  played  in  the

successful resiting of hawkers in his constituency

of  River  Valley, especially the large number  of

unlicensed  hawkers who used to  congregate  along

Killiney Road and Killiney Road Private Market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of this year we outlined the

basic  principles of the new Hawkers Code for  the

licensing  and control of an estimated  40,000  to

50,000



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



unlicensed hawkers in Singapore. We have  accepted

the  fact  that  hawking  is  a  way  of  life  in

Singapore  and  we  have  also  ensured  that  any

Singapore  citizen  is entitled  to  apply  for  a

hawker's licence so long as he complies with a few

basic principles - of not being a public menace in

respect of public health, be a problem to traffic,

whether pedestrian or motor, and flouting law  and

order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have for a start licensed more than 2,500

hawkers  in  pasar malams at 66 sites.  With  that

experience  we  then moved on  to  selected  areas

where  there  were hawkers congregated  at  street

junctions, and the Killiney Road Market was one of

the  selected  targets  where  we  wanted  to  put

matters right.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of Members of Parliament, which

also   includes  my  friend  and  colleague,   the

Minister    for   Finance,   in   the    Cairnhill

Constituency, we tackled hawkers around Koek  Road

and Newton Circus. We have up to date licensed and

controlled about 5,000 hawkers during 1966. As  we

have had something like 12,000 licences issued  to

hawkers  prior  to  the introduction  of  the  new

Hawkers Code, we can say that today we have  under

licence and control something like 17,000 hawkers.

We  still have to license, I think, another 30,000

to  40,000. In other words, another two-thirds  of

the  problem has yet to be tackled. We have  about

one-third  of  the  problem in hand.  Given  time,

patience   and   co-operation  from   Members   of

Parliament  as  well  as  from  members   of   the

Citizens'  Consultative Committees  and  from  the

hawkers  themselves, we should be able to  resolve

this problem in a couple of years. The most recent

attempt  at licensing and controlling hawkers  was

in  the  North  Bridge Road and High Street  area.

Even  just outside this House, there used to be  a

number of hawkers plying their wares on the  five-foot way. I think there is now easy access to  all

and  sundry when they shop along North Bridge Road

and   High  Street,  which,  I  think,   is   very

noticeable.  We have been able to do this  because

we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>



have   the   co-operation  of  the   Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the Minister for  Culture  and  the

Member  of Parliament for Stamford. With his  kind

co-operation,  we have been able to  persuade  the

hawkers to take alternative sites in side streets,

away  from traffic junctions and busy streets,  so

that  they  can continue with their  business  and

also allow the life of this community to go on  as

it  should.  I can say with quiet confidence  that

the  progress in the resiting of hawkers has  been

reasonably  smooth,  that we  have  achieved  some

success,  and that we hope, given a bit  of  time,

that  the  problem of hawkers in  Singapore  is  a

soluble one.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Inche Mohd. Ariff, amendment No.

(4)*.  He  is  not present. Mr Teong  Eng  Siong,

amendment No. (4) .



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr S. V. Lingam.)



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0703

be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now our Minister has said that before some

Members start their speech, they will sing praises

about the Government first, after which they  will

turn  round and criticise it. But here I will just

give my plain facts. The task of the Public Health

Division  is an onerous one. Whether our city  can

become  the  healthiest and cleanest in South-East

Asia depends on the work of this division. Why  do

I  say so? Let me give some examples. We know that

during   these  two  years  Singapore  has   never

experienced any cases of malaria or any  epidemic.

This  is  a very commendable situation.  In  other

countries epidemics are very prevalent.  It  shows

that   we  are  very  progressive  in  our  health

services.   The   rate  of   mortality   is   also

decreasing.  This shows that our medical  services

are  quite efficient. Our Health Ministry is  also

propagating  family  planning.  This  is  a   very

commendable effort. I would like to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



congratulate the Minister and the people concerned on

their achievements in these meritorious services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to touch upon the regulations

imposed  upon  the hawkers. Hawkers  are  a  major

problem  in  our  society. The aim of  controlling

hawkers  is  to put our hawker problem  in  proper

perspective.  Hawkers are also  our  citizens.  To

hawk is their right in order to make a living.  We

are  allotting sites to them. This is  in  keeping

with  our  economic policy. Hawkers in  the  Telok

Ayer Basin also have a hawkers' bazaar there. That

is  also  a way whereby a few hundred hawkers  can

make a living. It is one of the good actions taken

by Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect is about the X-ray campaign

undertaken  by the Health Ministry. For  instance,

in my Sembawang Constituency, the people have been

afforded the opportunity for free X-rays. This  is

a  commendable action on the part of the Ministry.

I hope this work will continue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to mention another matter. I

remember   that   at  the  previous   sitting   of

Parliament,  a few Members raised the question  of

cleanliness and cleansing on the island. I ask the

Minister  whether  he is considering  launching  a

cleansing campaign on a national scale.  He  might

be able to call upon all Members of Parliament and

other  people  concerned to  clean  up  the  whole

island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I hope that the Health Ministry can do

their task better next year than this year in  all

fields, whether in relation to hawkers, cleansing,

etc.,  in  order  to  maintain  our  standard  and

reputation.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lingam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> I am not speaking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would just

like  to  take  this opportunity  to  raise  three

points.  First,  a  couple  of  days  ago  we  had

occasion to hear our No. 2 Parliamentary Secretary

to  the Minister for Health. I do not know how  to

refer to him, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> One solution would be to refer to

either the more recent one or the older one.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> The recent one, Sir. He replied

to  various supplementary questions in  regard  to

the eradication of the rampant mosquito menace  in

our  Republic. Sir, up till today I  am  not  very

satisfied  with his answers. He was more  or  less

dodging  a direct answer all the time in spite  of

being  faced with a direct question.  I  hope  our

Minister  today can clarify this matter in  regard

to  the  setting up of the Anti-mosquito  Unit  to

eradicate the mosquito menace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my second point is in regard to our civil

service.  I  think this House will agree  with  me

that  our  civil service is, in fact, one  of  the

best in this part of the world. I am happy to note

that  we have one senior civil servant present  in

this House. The civil servants have rendered loyal

and  dedicated  service,  but  in  the  course  of

discharging  their  services, some  of  them  have

broken down, just as motor-car engines do. Sir,  I

understand that a number of civil servants, having

contracted sickness like cancer and heart trouble,

have to go overseas for treatment, not because  we

cannot  treat them here but because the facilities

here,  I  understand,  are  still  inadequate.  No

doubt,  we have the Institute of Medical  Research

well  in  hand. Still, life is more precious  than

wealth.  Therefore, these civil servants  who  are

seriously  sick will inevitably have to leave  our

shore  to  seek treatment elsewhere.  Sir,  I  was

wondering  whether the Minister will come  to  the

rescue  by  considering whether or not to  provide

such  civil servants passages to whichever country

they  wish to go for treatment and also allowances

for such treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point is this. I wonder whether our

Government  will  institute some  sort  of  health

insurance   scheme  for  our  civil  servants.   I

understand  there  was a case not  very  long  ago

where  a  civil  servant died as a  result  of  an

operation.  No doubt, Sir, there was no negligence

involved. But, sad to say, although his family got

some money, they suffered a bigger loss in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



monetary  returns  and  security.  So  our   civil

servants,   in   the  course  of   their   duties,

especially those who meet with a fatal accident or

who contract a dangerous illness, will not be able

to  continue  to  give their expected  quality  of

service. Therefore, Sir, I hope the Minister  will

consider  my  suggestion to institute  a  sort  of

health insurance scheme for civil servants.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Having regard to the time, Mr Lingam, is it a short speech?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> One minute, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, the Member for Punggol has

touched  on the subject of civil servants,  and  I

would like to add one point to what he has said. I

do  not  know whether I am correct or not  to  say

this here. We are getting copies of the Government

Directory.  In  that directory,  we  notice  civil

servants who have been acting in posts for so many

years.  I  cannot understand why this is  so.  Are

these officers not capable or -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lingam, are you referring to

appointments in the Public Health Division?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> No, Sir, I am touching on the civil

service



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Your remarks might be more

appropriate  under Mr Lim Cheng Lock's  amendment

to cut the Minister for Finance's salary by $10.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will touch

on  only  two  points raised  by  the  Member  for

Sembawang - hawker control and the possibility  of

launching  a cleansing campaign. He has spoken  in

very  glowing terms about the Ministry of  Health,

and  I am glad he has chosen it to be the Ministry

with which he wishes to be associated. Because  of

its  good reputation, he is adding mere lustre  to

it. I am pleased to say that he is doing very good

work in the Ministry of Health, especially in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>



assisting  the second Parliamentary  Secretary  in

hawker  control, and he has given us very valuable

advice.  I  am  sure that with his continued  good

work  we  should be able to resolve this  big  and

outstanding social problem in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his call for a general cleansing

campaign  in Singapore, I can assure him  that  he

will  be called upon very soon to lead it, because

I  gather the Public Daily Rated Employees' Unions

Federation are intent on following up their strike

ballot.  If  I  am correct, they are  supposed  to

serve  their strike notice today, or maybe it  has

already   been  served.  So  a  general  cleansing

campaign will very soon be coming, and I hope  the

Member  for  Sembawang will lead it. I assure  him

that  we  have  plans  to  maintain  more  than  a

skeleton service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now come to the three points brought up by

the  Member for Punggol? I do not think it is fair

to  say  that  the  Parliamentary  Secretary,  the

Member for Bukit Timah - he is not in the House at

the  moment, because he is now in the St. Andrew's

Orthopaedic Hospital making a short speech  on  my

behalf for the children's concert way up in Siglap

-  was  trying  to give a very evasive  answer  to

Members  who were very critical about the mosquito

"population",   which  has   also   increased   in

Singapore.  I  thought  he did  exceedingly  well.

Because the problem of mosquitoes in Singapore  is

not   just   a   question  of  exterminating   the

mosquitoes as you see them. We have to get down to

the basic causes and there are numerous causes why

we  are  having  so many mosquitoes  in  Singapore

today. Not that we are very proud about it, but it

is  a  legacy. First of all, there has been  rapid

building  development over the last five years  of

which we are all so proud, but, unfortunately,  it

does create problems. Because of the speed to  get

things  done,  other factors are sometimes  either

ignored  or  put on a very low priority,  so  that

whilst we see many beautiful multi-storeyed  flats

and  factories  coming up, many drains  have  been

blocked. So we see after every shower large  pools

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>



stagnant  water,  and  within  a  week,  we   have

millions  of mosquitoes. It is a case  of  chasing

and  closing up all these possible loopholes. This

has  to  be tackled at ground level. Then we  have

numerous drains all of which have been covered  up

to  look pretty on which to allow hawkers to hawk.

But  underneath, the drains are clogged and  there

is no flow of water, and stagnant water results in

the  breeding of mosquitoes. Then we have our tens

of  thousands  of hawkers who use  the  drains  as

refuse  dumps. They, and even our citizens,  throw

their  rubbish into these drains. I would like  to

inform  this  House  that  three-quarters  of  the

refuse  which we throw into our city garbage  dump

is  collected from the streets or dug out from the

drains.  Public  streets and drains  are  used  as

refuse  dumps.  We  have  to  educate  the   whole

population not to treat the streets and drains  as

refuse  dumps, and that takes time. Let us have  a

look  at our schools. Every school ground looks  a

disgrace with all the litter which has been thrown

by  students.  This  practice is  not  checked  by

teachers. And so it goes on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there must be a health campaign to make

everyone  pick up the litter and put it  into  the

waste-paper  basket. We have to provide  thousands

of  wastepaper baskets all over the  city.  Almost

every  home has a little garden, and in collecting

rain  water it breeds mosquitoes at the same time.

The  people complain about mosquitoes, but at  the

same  time they are breeding mosquitoes  in  their

backyard. Despite the fact that D.D.T. is  such  a

wonderful  anti-mosquito  insecticide,  mosquitoes

have become clever and now they are also resistant

to D.D.T. The few that are not killed become tough

and thereafter D.D.T. does not affect them. So  we

have    a    stronger   breed    of    mosquitoes,

unfortunately, not only in Singapore but all  over

the  world. All these, I am afraid, Sir,  are  big

problems. However, we are at the moment conducting

a  three-month pilot scheme for a selected area in

Singapore bounded by the Geylang River, Guillemard

Road, Paya Lebar, Sims Avenue, Lorong 3, Geylang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



Road  and Kallang River - an area with about 8,000

houses  - and a specific house-to-house survey  of

mosquitoes is being carried out. We should be able

to  complete  this survey this month and  then  we

will  be  in  a position to launch an  island-wide

campaign. I can then assure the Member for Punggol

that even in his constituency we should be able to

see  a reduced number of mosquitoes, but not  just

now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, coming to the civil

servants  who,  because of illness,  may  find  it

necessary - as stated by the Member for Punggol  -

to  seek  medical treatment overseas. I am  afraid

this is a matter which is not under my control.  I

think the Ministry of Finance has to come into the

picture.   As  soon  as  the  Salaries  Commission

publishes  its  findings, and if  this  matter  of

medical  benefits does not come into the  picture,

perhaps it could be taken up separately then. I do

not  think  the instance the Member has mentioned,

that  someone  having died on the operation  table

should  have had health insurance, is really  what

he wants. The way to help this particular bereaved

family   is   whether  there  is  adequate   life

insurance  or not. Health insurance  does  not  do

anything except meet the medical expenses for  the

operation,  whether the person is dead  or  alive.

But  if the poor chap dies on the operation table,

and  if  he has had some life insurance,  then  he

gets  the benefit of the life insurance,  but  not

health  insurance. Health insurance  really  means

that if you pay your premiums, and in case medical

expenses have to be incurred, like the payment  of

operation  expenses,  then the  insurance  company

pays for the expenses, which would probably amount

to just a few hundred dollars. I would say that we

would  like  to look after our civil  servants  as

well  as  we  can.  Not only can they  break  down

because  of  hard  work, but I  think  Members  of

Parliament  can  also break down because  of  hard

work.  But  I  think,  all  in  all,  we  have   a

reasonably good health service and I hope  we  can

maintain the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



high standard of health services in Singapore.

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is some months now since

normalisation  of trade with Indonesia  has  taken

place  and  an agreement signed. But I  understand

that  the  results are not up to our  expectations

and  that  there  are still restrictions,  one  of

which  is  the difficulty in obtaining  visas  for

movement between Singapore and Indonesia. I  think

the  House  would  appreciate it if  the  Minister

would enlighten us on this important subject.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, Members of Parliament have been

receiving  a copy each of the Singapore Government

Directory in which we find the names



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>



addresses  and  telephone numbers  of  many  civil

servants.  But  I have noticed that  a  number  of

these  officers seem to have been acting for years

and years in their posts. I want to know why there

have  been  no  permanent  officers  appointed  to

certain  posts for so many years. Are  the  acting

officers  not  capable  of  holding  their   posts

substantively,   or  is  it   the   intention   of

Government to keep them acting for ever?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the

Member  for  River  Valley says  that  trade  with

Indonesia has not come up to expectations, it  all

depends very much upon whose expectations and what

expectations  they are. I have said from  time  to

time  that  trade between Indonesia and  Singapore

could  be  normalised. We cannot expect  the  same

volume  of trade that we had before confrontation,

for  the  simple reason that during confrontation,

Indonesian   merchants  had  already   established

direct  contact with their sources of  supply  and

markets. Mr Speaker, Sir, the resumption of trade

with  Indonesia  could not by any stretch  of  the

imagination  come to the pre-confrontation  level.

At the moment, what we have is largely in the form

of  barter trade, and as regards that, I think  it

has  almost  reached pre-confrontation level.  But

whether  or not trade will further improve depends

very  much  again upon the situation in  Indonesia

itself  and  upon  the policies  that  are  to  be

followed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether trade will really start flowing between

Indonesia  and Singapore does not depend  so  much

upon  how  many visas could be issued by Indonesia

to  our  traders, but upon whether they could  get

over  the foreign exchange difficulties in  buying

here and whether they would be able to resuscitate

or  rehabilitate their transport, distribution and

collecting systems, so that more of their  produce

could be sent abroad.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt at all that now that the

floodgates   have   been  opened   following   the

recognition of Singapore by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>



Indonesia  and the signing of trade  and  shipping

agreements, there will be an increasing volume  of

trade   between   Singapore  and   Indonesia.   We

sincerely  hope  that  the present  Government  in

Indonesia will be able to carry out its objectives

to redevelop its country and to pay more attention

to  economic matters. That is as far as we can  do

on our side. We have tried our very best to afford

them  every facility for the resumption  of  trade

and the ball is actually at their feet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied gets the impression, just

from  looking up the telephone directory,  that  a

large  number  of  civil servants  are  acting  in

posts.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think he was referring to the

Official Directory - the blue book.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not the

intention   of  the  Government  to  allow   civil

servants to act as long as possible, but we  would

like to promote those who deserve promotion. As  a

result  of  the  extension  of  services  due   to

Malayanisation and various other factors, we  have

lost quite a large number of civil servants in the

higher  echelons,  and  therefore  quite  a  large

number  of  posts  have to  be  filled  by  acting

appointments. But the civil service being what  it

is  --  once  a  man  has been appointed,  he  has

security  of tenure -- we want to be pretty  sure,

as  far  as possible, that the man who is promoted

really deserves promotion. Promotion exercises are

carried  out from time to time. While  wishing  to

fill  these  posts  and seeing  that  every  civil

servant  should be given his due, we  are  at  the

same  time,  as a result of past experience,  very

careful when filling a high post to make sure that

the  applicant  will  shape up  well.  This  is  a

passing phase and I expect that with more and more

qualified  people coming out from our universities

and from abroad, we will be able very soon to fill

all these posts substantively by people who really

deserve them.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2005.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, subhead 2005 refers to Subsidy

to  Housing and Development Board for an amount of

over $8 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would appreciate it if the Minister could

provide  the  House with some detailed information

on this subsidy granted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a

prevalent belief that the Housing Board is  making

money because most people - and I think rightly so

-  consider that a landlord makes money  from  the

properties  he  lets  out,  and  the  Housing  and

Development  Board,  being  the  largest  property

holder  or  the biggest landlord in Singapore,  is

expected  to  make  money. But  contrary  to  this

belief,  the Board was set up not with the  object

of  making  money from properties,  but  with  the

object  of  providing the lower  income  group  of

Singapore citizens with modern housing at  rentals

well within their means. Its objective, therefore,

is  to house as many of the poorer group of people

as  possible  at a rental which most of  them  can

afford to pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the large number of houses which the

Housing  and  Development Board  has  put  up  and

rented  out,  it  is running at a  loss.  For  the

information  of  Members and the  public,  I  have

figures  here showing the amount of subsidies  for

the  various types of houses put up by the Housing

Board.  As  you  know, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  we  are

trying  to  standardise  the  rentals  as  far  as

possible so that the same rental would be paid for

one-room   units  all  over  Singapore  with   the

exception, of course, of the houses built in urban

areas,  because of the high cost of land  and  the

better  type  of construction that is required  in

urban areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what we call an emergency one-room unit which

is let out at $20 per month to Singapore citizens,

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



approximate  subsidy  per unit per  mouth  varies  from

$15.50  to $18.50, depending upon the cost of  the

structure. For what we call the standard  one-room

unit  in a suburban area where a rental of $26  is

being  charged, the subsidy per unit per month  is

$15.  For  the  improved one-room units,  some  of

which  have been built and some of which  will  be

built  in  the central area and where  the  rental

charge is $36.50 in the central area and $30 in  a

suburban area, the subsidy varies from $15 to  $18

per  unit  per month, depending upon the price  of

land  and  the cost of construction in each  area.

For the standard two-room unit in the central area

where the rent is $66.50, and in the suburban area

where the rent is $46.50, the subsidy per unit per

month  is  round  about  $9.80  to  $10.  For  the

improved two-room unit where the rent charged in a

central  area is $66.50, the subsidy  varies  from

$10  to  $15 per unit per month. For the  standard

three-room unit in a central area where  the  rent

is  $96.50,  and in a suburban area it is  $66.50,

the  subsidy  varies from $2 to $5  per  unit  per

month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, Mr Speaker, Sir, there are now over

80,000  units  let  out to the  public  under  the

management  of the Housing and Development  Board,

and the total subsidy for these units next year is

estimated  at $8 million. Therefore,  the  Housing

Board is one of the few landlords who do not  make

money  but  lose money, all for a good cause,  and

that  is to provide better housing for the  poorer

section of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have clarified the question of subsidy

here,  unless  the  Member for  River  Valley  has

further questions for clarification.

be reduced by $100*



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr Chow Chiok Hock and Mr Tang See Chim.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the last one year, our

economy   and  trade  have  improved.   Even   the

editorials in the Sin Chew Jit Poh have  commented

on this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a previous sitting, I have already given my

views  on this. What I want to know is how we  can

make  our economic development keep pace with  the

requirements  of the employment situation  in  the

next  five  years. In other words, how are  we  to

provide  jobs  not only for the tens of  thousands

unemployed,  but  also for the  50,000  to  60,000

people   who  will  be  seeking  employment?   The

Minister for Finance has told us that unemployment

is  one of our serious social problems. I say,  in

all  fairness, that he is adopting a very cautious

attitude to this question. I will quote an excerpt

from his speech:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Although we are full of confidence in the

development  and  future  of  our  economy,   this

confidence  should not be a cause for elation  and

complacency.  This should not make  our  merchants

and people think that things are all right or that

the world owes us a living. If we want to progress

and  survive,  we  must redouble  our  efforts  to

improve our economy which is not the same as  that

of  any  other country. So our economic future  is

full  of crises as well as bright prospects  which

depend  on  the  situation in  this  part  of  the

world.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I quote this excerpt from the speech of the

Minister  for  Finance to express my feelings  and

share  in  his sentiments. It shows that not  only

does he have confidence in our economic future but

he  also  worries about it. This  is  a  sentiment

which everybody can share with him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance made two points on external trade but he did not explain them in detail to this House. The first is that for the first nine months the imports amounted to about $3,000 million and the exports amounted to about $2,400 million. As a result, there is an

unfavourable balance of trade of $600 million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, we are losing $600 million worth

of  foreign exchange, although, according to  what

the  Minister for Finance has said in this  House,

there  are  about $1,100 million worth of  foreign

reserves. But if we were to lose so much annually,

then the outcome would be disastrous. So I hope he

will  think  of  ways to remedy the situation  and

reduce this unfavourable balance of trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is about the increase of external

trade. According to reports in the newspapers,  we

know  that  the  increase  in  our  trade  can  be

ascribed  to  several factors. One is  that  South

Vietnam's  trade  with  us  has  increased  to   a

considerable extent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Point of

clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If Mr Teong is prepared to give

way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I will not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> I want to ask a clarification

from him, and not from me, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If Mr Teong will not give way, I

cannot help it. Mr Teong, please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Trade between

South Vietnam and us has increased. This is mainly

due  to the fact that there is a war going  on  in

Vietnam. It is a rather abnormal situation. But  I

believe that once the war is ended, then trade  in

this  respect will also reduce. So I believed  the

Minister will agree with me when I say that if  we

want  to  rely on our trade with South Vietnam  to

keep our economy going well, then that will not be

quite reliable. Better prospects for our trade may

perhaps  to  a  great extent depend on  the  trade

between Singapore and Indonesia and East



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



European and some Afro-Asian countries. This is  a

better way out for our trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I want to suggest to the Minister

is  that in future, when our country has any trade

treaties  with other countries, we should  try  to

attain  a balance of trade. For instance, we  have

signed  trade  agreements with  Russia,  Bulgaria,

Hungary and other countries. We should see  to  it

that  we  are able to maintain a balance of  trade

with  these  countries so that we will  not  incur

losses in foreign exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I hope the Minister can inform this

House  how  much profit every year we are  getting

out  of  our foreign reserves, amounting to $1,100

million.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0801

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chow Chiok Hock? Not present. Mr Tang See Chim.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want

to  ask  the Finance Minister to clarify  a  point

that  was  left out in the Budget debate.  In  his

speech  he  enumerated certain export  incentives,

and  I  just  want to know, if he could  tell  the

House,  whether those export incentives  apply  to

exports to West Malaysia and Malaysia as a whole.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

from the Budget speech of the Finance Minister, we

can  see  that we are able to achieve  a  balanced

budget without tax increases. This, of course,  is

very   encouraging  to  everybody  in   Singapore.

However,   we  are  still  concerned   about   the

increasing  population  in  Singapore  which,   if

unchecked,   may  go  beyond  our  control.   This

population  growth is getting bigger  and  bigger,

and in order to consolidate our economic position,

we  have  all  agreed  to rely  a  great  deal  on

industrialisation in addition to  entrepot  trade.

That means to say that we have to concentrate  all

our   energies  and  efforts  on  developing   our

industries in the various fields.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in this connection, I would like to

request the Minister to give me some clarification

in  regard  to  the factories already  set  up  in

Singapore  and their manufactures.  What  kind  of

protection   is  given  to  the  manufactures   of

existing factories in Singapore? What steps has he

taken  to  see that the products of these existing

factories can have a place in a foreign market? At

the  same  time,  how is he going to  ensure  that

there  is  local encouragement for the consumption

of our own manufactures? Sir, we are encouraging a

lot   of  investors  to  come  here  and  set   up

factories. We are doing a lot in this respect. But

after these investors have come here to invest, it

appears  that their manufactures have not  reached

the  standard required. They have not  achieved  a

satisfactory quality in their manufactures. So, in

my  view, in order to instil further confidence in

the manufacturers and to prospective investors and

to   arouse   further  interest   in   our   local

investments,  I  feel  that the  Minister  himself

should think of these manufacturers by opening  up

a  better consumption market locally. He must take

all possible steps to encourage our own people  to

use our own products, because if our own people do

not  use  our  own  products, how  can  we  expect

foreigners  to  use  our products?  This  is  very

inconsistent. That is the situation that I know so

far.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that some Government departments do

not  even  encourage their officers to  buy  local

goods.   For  example,  some  articles   used   in

Government  departments may be available  locally.

For  instance, the towels, soap, and toilet  paper

in  the  Parliament House lavatories. Some  towels

are  from  China, soap from other  countries,  and

even  the toilet paper comes from a foreign  land.

These  are  very  common items  of  local  produce

available  here.  If we do not encourage  our  own

people to buy our own goods, how can we expect our

manufacturers to sell abroad? Are we  asking  them

to  put  up their shutters? So without encouraging

consumption  of  local goods, we cannot  encourage

further investment in our local industries.  So  I

hope the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>



Minister will take positive and effective steps to

encourage  further consumption of local  products.

He can put up certain encouraging slogans and give

more  publicity  to encourage our  people  to  use

local  products.  This will go a step  further  to

assist our economic development and bring about  a

brighter future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, just

now  I was privileged to hear a Member on my side,

the  Opposition side, saying that at  the  present

moment  there is an unfavourable balance of  trade

in  Singapore, which is very dangerous to  us.  We

should  take remedial action in this respect.  The

Finance Minister should have more courage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for River Valley has said that we

should  have  more trade with Indonesia.  This  is

very  true  and correct, but our Minister  in  his

reply  just  now  did  not  seem  to  have  enough

courage to open up more trade with Indonesia. I am

saying this, Mr Speaker, because I was living  in

Indonesia  for quite some time and knew about  the

conditions there. A local banker has just returned

from  Djakarta and he has spoken to me on  certain

matters.  According  to him,  the  Government  and

people  of  Indonesia would very much welcome  our

Singapore  Government to send a trade  mission  to

Indonesia to have further talks. Except  for  some

technicalities to be taken care of,  the  time  is

ripe for us to do this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am trying to say is that our able Minister

for Finance should have sufficient courage to send

someone  over there to talk with them, because  in

the past there were strong economic and commercial

ties  between  the two countries, and  trade  with

Indonesia  constituted about 30 per  cent  of  our

total trade.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, I wish to have further

clarification  from  the Minister  on  his  answer

about  the acting posts. I agree with him that  we

should have qualified people in the civil service.

But  I  was  not happy just now when he said  that

wherever possible civil servants



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



in  acting  posts should be  replaced  with

persons who are qualified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as an ex-civil Servant, I know how much it

will  hurt  a person, who has been acting  for  so

many  years,  suddenly to find himself substituted

by somebody else in the post.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that

the  Member for Sembawang has swallowed hook, line

and  sinker, the propaganda line put out by people

who  are  not favourably inclined towards  us.  He

feels  that  because Singapore has an unfavourable

balance of trade, we are in dire danger of  losing

our  external reserves. I think I did say sometime

here  that we have had an unfavourable balance  of

trade ever since we can remember, and yet we  have

still been able to increase our external reserves.

When  we  talk about the unfavourable  balance  of

trade  and the figures which he quoted, they  only

pertain  to  what we call the visible  balance  of

trade.  That  is,  items  on  which  we  can   get

statistics and to which we can point our  fingers.

But there are other items which are not taken into

consideration  in drawing up these statistics.  It

is  my  belief that from the invisible balance  of

trade,  from  earnings from the port, earnings  on

services  rendered, ship building, ship repairing,

tourists  and investments, the inflow  of  capital

from  abroad,  we have been able to  maintain  our

position, so that, in spite of the figures showing

that we have an unfavourable balance of trade from

year   to   year,  we  still  find,  with  prudent

budgetting  that we able to increase our  external

reserves.   I  quite  agree  with  the   speakers,

including the Member for Sembawang, who  say  that

we should depend more on our neighbours for trade.

Of  course, it is easier if we can trade more  and

more  with our neighbours. But, at the same  time,

we   are   casting   our   net   far   and   wide.

Unfortunately,  at  the  present  moment,   though

Indonesia represents a very large market,  because

of  conditions there and because of the  state  of

the  currency, trade with Indonesia is not as much

as it should be. Though we would like to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



sell to Indonesia, what they are interested in  at

the  moment  is how much credit we can  give.  The

Member  for  Tiong Bahru, who, from  what  I  have

heard  just now, was an ex-teacher (in Indonesia),

feels  that  with  courage we can  get  trade.  If

trading  is that simple, Mr Speaker, I think  the

courageous  elements in our society should  become

the  best traders! I can assure him that, if  need

be,  I  will lead a mission to Jakarta if it  will

serve  any  useful purpose. But this  is  not  the

appropriate  time. They have had several  missions

here,  and there are some difficulties with regard

to  regulations  which will have to  be  clarified

before  we  can really sit down and get going.  In

fact, we have already signed a trade agreement and

yet  trade is not going on as briskly as we  like.

The Member for Tiong Bahru may or may not know it,

but  quite  a  large number of  our  traders  have

already  had visas to go to Jakarta, but owing  to

the   conditions  there,  they  have  had   second

thoughts. They may be lacking in courage, but they

are  full of prudence and they are quite sagacious

businessmen. So if there is any money to  be  made

by  going  there, I am sure they  would  pluck  up

courage  to  go  there. Of  course,  the  idea  of

entering  into a bilateral trade agreement  is  to

see that trade between the two countries balances.

That  is  the  main purpose of a  bilateral  trade

agreement.  We  are not going  to  enter  into  an

agreement  with a country and say,  "We  will  buy

more  from you than we sell to you." No.  We  say,

"Whatever  you sell to us, you must buy from  us."

The  idea  of  a  bilateral trade agreement  is  a

balanced trade between the two.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang wants to know how much

we  earn  from investments of our foreign reserves

abroad.  Mr Speaker, Sir, in the revenue accounts

they are all lumped together. It is very difficult

to  separate  interest earnings  from  investments

abroad and locally. But I would say roughly it  is

in  the  region  of between $10  million  and  $11

million  annually  on  the one  thousand  and  odd

million dollars worth of foreign reserves that  we

hold.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure whether or not the Member for Delta

has  talked about the Family Planning Association,

and  whether she has heard about the progress this

Association  has made during the last  few  years.

Reports  from  my  colleague,  the  Minister   for

Health, indicate that the population explosion  is

well  contained  and the rate of increase  of  the

population, which was growing at the rate of about

4  per  cent plus after the war, has come down  to

2.4  per cent or so. Therefore, we have been  able

to  contain the terrific increase in the  rate  of

population growth immediately after the war.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what we are doing to protect local

industries, I can only assume that the  fact  that

the  toilet paper and towels in Parliament are not

locally manufactured is due to the fact that these

are  probably  stocks  that are  carried  forward,

because  directives have been sent time  and  time

again  to  every  Department  in  Government  that

preference  should be given to buy local  products

wherever   possible,  even  though  there   is   a

difference of 15 per cent in prices or more. I  am

sure,  Mr Speaker, Sir, you will personally  look

into  this question yourself so that we would  not

have toilet soap from China and perfumed soap from

France.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta asked what we have done to

aid  industrialists  whom  we  have  persuaded  to

invest  their money here. I think I have mentioned

that  we  have  already given some incentives. In

this   year's  budget  we  have  given  them  more

incentives. To see that they get at least  a  fair

share  of  the  local market, that at  least  they

would  have a chance to capture some of the  local

market, we have imposed quotas so that products of

a similar nature from abroad are either restricted

in  the quantity that can be imported here or they

have  to  pay duty on coming in here. So,  by  and

large,  the  prices  which importers  of  consumer

goods from abroad charge for their goods would  be

higher  than local goods. The rest, of course,  is

left  to  the  population themselves. They  should

realise  that  it  is  through buying  locally made

goods that we will be able to help



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



ourselves and create the employment which  we  so

much require.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the incentives for exports which have

been announced here, Malaysia will be counted as a

foreign  country. Therefore, exports  to  Malaysia

will qualify for these incentives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot agree with the Member for Sembawang when

he  says  that we are now in a fortunate, position

because  trade  has increased on  account  of  the

Vietnam  war,  but  that we cannot  depend  on  it

alone.  Quite true. We cannot depend on it  alone.

But he adds a rider and says that when the Vietnam

war  is  ended  - I do not know; I  do  not  think

anyone knows when it will be ended - there will  be

less trade. I think when the Vietnam war is ended,

if and when it is ended, there will be more trade,

because you need more goods for reconstruction and

development than for destruction. But I agree with

him  entirely that as much as possible  we  should

try  to  depend  on our neighbours. Unfortunately,

our  neighbours do not want us to depend on  them.

So  let us be independent ourselves and find other

markets further afield, and if the markets  nearby

do  come to some sort of arrangement or feel  that

it  is time that they consider that we should  co-exist,  then  well  and good, we  will  have  more

markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Aljunied thinks

that  it  is  an  insult to a civil  servant  who,

having acted in a post, is later on considered  to

be  unfit to hold that post substantively.  I  can

assure  him  that in more cases than not,  when  a

person  has been acting there, the chances of  his

getting a promotion are much better. Because of  a

lack of suitable officers at the moment, we cannot

help  but make use of a few officers for the  time

being.  But,  as  I  have said, the  tendency  for

officers  to act too long in the post is  becoming

less  and  less, because we are getting  more  and

more  qualified people from both our  universities

and from abroad.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

would like to say that I have not been tricked  by

the propaganda



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>



of  other persons. As a matter of fact, we  cannot

deny  that there is an unfavourable trade balance.

But  I  am  glad to learn, that the  Minister  for

Finance  has  clarified the  position  further  by

saying  that  this unfavourable balance  has  been

offset by income from, invisible sources, such  as

the  provision of services, shipping and  repairs,

etc.  That means that our prosperity is  a  stable

one.  In other words, it is well-rooted and not  a

superficial prosperity. In any case, Mr  Speaker,

I  believe  our Finance Minister will  agree  with

what  I have said, that is, there is a problem  to

be solved in relation to trade expansion overseas.

We  must  try to cut down our overseas investments

and  our unfavourable trade balance. If we do  not

have  an  unfavourable trade balance, we  will  be

able to earn more foreign exchange. This will go a

step  further in developing our industries.  As  a

result of this development and construction, there

will  be  more  employment opportunities  for  our

people   and  their  livelihood  will  be  further

improved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the war in Vietnam, I am not

disputing  that  we should have  any  trade  with

Vietnam. No. I remember that during the Korean war

there  was  a  lot of trade between Singapore  and

Korea.  It reached an unprecedented peak.  But  we

must  have  more reliable sources  of  trade  with

other  countries in the world. Our development  in

trade will thus be stable and more dependable  and

we  will earn more foreign exchange in future.  In

any case, I am happy with the explanation given by

the  Finance Minister. It proves that he has every

confidence  in our ability to develop further  our

economy,  industries and foreign trade.  This,  of

course, is good news to the two million people  in

Singapore. It is very encouraging to them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> The whole idea of

industrialisation  is,  of  course,  as   far   as

possible,   to  reduce  the  visible  unfavourable

balance  of trade. It is by industrialisation,  by

exporting  the  goods that we  are  manufacturing,

that  we  will be able to reduce the unfavourable

balance of trade.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is one of the main objectives of

industrialisation,  to save foreign  exchange,  to

sell  more  and, last but the most  important,  of

course, to give more jobs to our people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I thank the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0804 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I notice that the Minister for

Finance  is  very  generous  towards  the   labour

movement  in this respect -- that the contribution

to  the  Labour Research Unit is more than  double

that for 1966. I assume the increased contribution

is  to pay for the cost of staff and equipment for

the   National  Productivity  Centre   which   the

N.T.U.C.,  in  the  editorial  of  Berjuangan,  of

December   1966,   has   been   criticising    the

Government,  because of the delay in  establishing

it. I myself am surprised that trade union leaders

in  this  House  have not raised this  subject.  I

would   appreciate  it  if  the   Minister   would

enlighten us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

provision of this $428,000 has nothing to do  with

the  setting up of a National Productivity Centre.

In  fact,  the  allocation  of  $200,000  for  the

N.T.U.C. Research Unit for 1966 was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



made on the assumption that there was a surplus of

$200,000  to  be carried forward from  1965.  This

assumption, however, was not correct.  The  actual

surplus was just over $58,000. This was discovered

after  the  Estimates for 1966  had  already  been

passed  and,  therefore,  the  provision  in   the

Estimates  of  $200,000 was found insufficient  to

maintain  the  N.T.U.C. Research  Unit  for  1966.

Subsequently a grant of an additional $276,500 was

made by the Treasury. First, the total expenditure

for  the  N.T.U.C.  Research  Unit  for  1966  was

$476,500  and  not $200,000 as provided  for.  The

provision  of $428,000 for 1967 is, in fact,  less

than the sum that was provided for in 1966.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would it be

appropriate  if  I were to ask the  Minister  when

this  National Productivity Centre would come into

being and whether any funds are being provided?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I, together with the Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs,  had

the   opportunity  of  visiting  the  Commonwealth

Institute in London some time last year, I  saw  a

statue  of  Sir Stamford Raffles and a drawing  of

the  old  Chinatown of Singapore at the  Singapore

Corner.  But  I  presume this image  of  Singapore

might  have been changed due to our attainment  of

independence. If not, can the Government see to it

that  the  image  of Singapore is portrayed  in  a

manner befitting our new status?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a long

time  since  the  Member  for  Aljunied  had   the

pleasure of taking a trip to London and looking at

the  exhibits there. My reports are  that  at  the

moment    Singapore's   exhibits   comprise    the

following:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A first-class illuminated diorama of Singapore

Island  giving  a  bird's eye view  of  the  whole

territory from Clifford Pier to the Causeway;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An illuminated map of the world mechanically

operated  showing  Singapore  as  a  centre   with

flashing  lights,  indicating  the  various  trade

routes and values of goods carried; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many displays and first-class photographs in

panels   showing  racial  types  of    industries,

educational facilities, housing, population, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, Mr Speaker, Sir, we have just set up an

Embassy  in London and will ask our Ambassador  to

make a review of all our commitments there. It is

expected that by April next year, we will  have  a

full report from our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>



Embassy on the Commonwealth Institute. After that,

following this report, we will have to decide

whether it is worth while to continue to maintain

Singapore Corner or not. If it is worth while,

improvements could be made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> I beg leave to withdraw the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $8,026,850 for Head 0804 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0807 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1191.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is regarding late payment of Radio and

T.V. licences. I wish to bring to the  notice  of

the  Minister  concerned that an alleged  offender

has  to  pay  a compound fee and, in  addition  to

that,  he has to get his licence renewed from  the

date  it  expired. I will quote an  example,  Sir.

Suppose  a  person fails to renew his  licence  in

time,  say,  on the 1st June, 1966. The  Licensing

Department   sends  him  a  reminder   and   later

compounds him. But when the licensee goes  to  the

post  office, his new licence is issued  from  the

date his old licence expired. When the new licence

is  back-dated, is it right for the department  to

compound  under the present regulations?  What  is

the offence committed? Could the Minister give  an

explanation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Regulations  expressly require  that  any  renewed

licence would be dated from the date of expiry  of

the  old  licence, notwithstanding that there  has

been  a  compound of late payment or not. That  is

what  the  Regulations  say.  If  the  Member  for

Aljunied  is  dissatisfied,  he  should  move   an

amendment  to the Regulations in this  House  -  a

private Member's Bill.

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0807

be reduced by $100.*



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Tang See Chim.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, of the $590 million revenue,

the  revenue from taxes, customs, etc.,  takes  up

the  most part, and revenue from investments takes

up  about  $42  million, which  includes  property

taxes  in the rural areas. Although it is a  small

sum  to  be  derived  from the  rural  areas,  the

Government  is implementing a scheme  whereby  the

property  tax is $6 per year for an owner-occupied

attap house.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, generally speaking, the rural

people  in the lower income group do not have  the

means   to   stay   in  modern  concrete   houses.

Therefore, they need not have to pay large sums of

property tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as our Government stands for democratic

socialism, it is only right and proper for  it  to

look  after the poorer people in the rural  areas.

Under  this Head, I would like to speak  on  three

points which are relevant, and I hope the Minister

will give me a reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point relates to assessment rates of

houses  in  the  rural areas.  At  the  moment,  I

understand  the  maximum rate is 27  per  cent  in

respect of property tax. I feel it is necessary to

consider  a  reduction in the  rate,  because  the

Minister  for Finance has announced in this  House

that  the  property  tax on houses  in  the  urban

renewal area will be reduced from 36 per cent  to

12  per  cent. I have received several  complaints

from  the  people. For instance, one man with  the

surname  of Lim occupies a structure with  a  zinc

roof. The property tax on this house was $20  last

year.  But  he  received  a  new  bill  this  year

increasing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>



the  property tax to $40, which means  a  100  per

cent increase in property tax.



I  do  not  understand the basis of assessment  of

property  tax  on attap houses by  the  Assessment

Department.  I hope the Minister can  explain  why

the  property  tax on this man's  house  has  been

greatly increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point relates to the overdue payment

of  property  tax.  I have also  received  several

complaints from people in my constituency who were

fined  from  50  cents to several dollars  because

payment of property tax was delayed for about  two

or  three months. According to what they told  me,

it seems that they were not to blame. They did not

pay  property  tax  as they did  not  receive  any

notice  and  no reminders were sent to them.  This

was  probably due to the postmen who,  being  new,

were   not   able   to  locate  their   addresses.

Therefore,  there was no delivery  of  notices  to

their addresses, as a result of which they did not

know  about them and payment of property  tax  was

delayed.  The officers in the department concerned

did  not  accept the explanations given  by  these

people. Of course, according to regulations,  they

can  be  rightly  fined for  delaying  payment  of

property    tax,   but,   according    to    their

explanations, it would appear that we were rather

unfair to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the Minister for Finance

has  announced that property tax on houses in  the

urban area will be reduced from 36 per cent to  12

per  cent. I would like to ask him whether he  has

any  intention of reducing property tax on  houses

in the rural areas as well.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0807

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tang See Chim? Mr Lim.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, some Back-benchers probably think that Ministers are having

an easy time without an Opposition here, for when

they  move  amendments, they do not  give  us  the

courtesy  of  moving them under the  appropriate

heads  and  they  leave us guessing  as  to  what

subjects



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>



they are going to talk on. We have the Member  for

Sembawang  moving a reduction of $100 to  the  sum

allocated  for Head 0807 which touches  on  income

tax, estate duty, general collection section, etc.

So, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether or not

you  will  give a ruling, but I think it  is  only

fair  and customary courtesy for a Member to  move

his amendment, wherever possible, under a specific

Head if it is shown in the Estimates. That is just

by the way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid the Member for Sembawang has

completely  not  realised  or  misunderstood   the

purpose of the incentive for urban renewal  -  the

incentive we give by reducing property tax from 36

per  cent to 12 per cent for those developers  who

are  willing to participate with us in  the  urban

redevelopment  of the country. I  cannot  see  any

connection  between this incentive  to  people  to

invest and develop properties in the centre of the

city and the question of the rate of property  tax

in  the  rural areas. The $6 concession is a  very

special concession given to those people who  have

attap houses. The Member is asking for a reduction

of  27  per cent in property tax on houses in  the

rural  areas,  and  here, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  one

begins  to realise more and more that the division

between the rural and urban areas in Singapore  is

a  fictitious one, because the whole of  Singapore

is  very  fast becoming an urban area. The  reason

why the rate of property tax in the rural area  is

lower than that in the urban area is that formerly

in  the  rural areas people did not  get  all  the

services  available to those living in  the  urban

area - services which have to be paid for somehow

or  other, and payment for part of the services is

derived  from  the  collection  of  property  tax.

Therefore, there is a difference between the  rate

of  property tax in the urban area and that in the

rural area. It is a distinction which is very hard

to  see  because,  as  I have said,  Singapore  is

gradually  becoming an urban area  right  through.

Therefore,  from a logical point of view,  instead

of  reducing the rate of property tax in the rural

areas now that most of the rural areas are getting

the advantage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>



of  the  services that are available in the  urban

area,  the rate of property tax in the rural areas

should come up to that in the urban area. However,

Mr Speaker, Sir, we have many different rates  of

property tax in Singapore, and these are relics of

the old days when circumstances were different.  I

think  very  soon  we will have to  sit  down  and

really think of a way to standardise property tax.

But  with  present commitments,  as  it  were,  we

should count ourselves most fortunate that,  apart

from  the new form of assessing road tax  and  the

increase in car licence tax, we have no additional

taxation. I think all of us should heave a sigh of

relief,  instead of considering ways  of  reducing

taxation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has brought up the case of one of his

constituents  whose assessment was almost  doubled

and  he wondered on what basis the assessment  was

raised. By and large, I think there is a review of

assessment  where  the  assessor  feels  that  his

property  has been under-valued and his  criterion

would be how much rent is being paid by properties

of a similar type around that area. I think in the

case  mentioned by the hon. Member, if the  person

concerned is not satisfied - or anybody  for  that

matter  -  with the assessment raised,  there  are

procedures available to him for making an  appeal.

The  Member  has also said that it is unfair  that

some   persons  who  never  received  notices   of

assessment or whose addresses could not  be  found

were  fined between 50 cents and $5 for  delay  in

payment.  Mr  Speaker, Sir,  any  property  owner

should know that property tax is due on the 1st of

January,  and I believe there is a period,  up  to

the  15th  of March, within which he has  to  pay.

Therefore,  if  you are a property  owner,  it  is

incumbent upon you to pay your property tax within

that period.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,993,570 for Head 0807 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0809 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0809 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to touch on the Imports

and  Exports Office. I would appreciate it if  the

Minister could give this House a breakdown of  the

number of import and export permits issued by  the

Imports and Exports Office for goods imported  and

exported  by air, sea and land for the  first  six

months of this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to raise on this section

of  the  Trade Division is the delay in  obtaining

approval for import and export permits.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst appreciating the Minister's Budget

Statement   on  cutting  red  tape  and  achieving

results,  I would ask if he could look  into  this

section  and  see whether improvements  could,  be

made,  as  I  believe that this section  has  been

operating  since the shipping era,  and  with  the

movements  of  goods  by air  now  rapidly  taking

place,  this  slowness in getting  an  import  and

export permit is a hindrance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, the Member for River Valley

is asking for a very detailed breakdown of figures

of  trade. I am afraid I cannot give this to  him,

but  if  he  would  like  to  follow  it  up  with

Questions, I will be able to give it to him  later

on. Roughly, I would say that there are about -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I have the Monthly Digest of Statistics here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I would say roughly there are

about   3,000   to   5,000  inward   and   outward

declarations  a day, and I do not think  they  are

broken up as to how much are by land, sea and air.

So even if I should be supplied with these monthly

statistics by my Friend, the Member for  Choa  Chu

Kang, the figures are not available there.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally an export and import declaration will be

cleared within 24 hours. The delays are in respect

of   those   declarations  where   an   inadequate

description of the goods is given, or  in  respect

of  those  goods  where there  is  a  quantitative

restriction or quotas. In certain cases also these

declarations  have  to be sent to  the  Statistics

Coding  Section  for them to be placed  under  the

right  code for statistical purposes. In instances

of  this  nature, there would inevitably  be  some

delay,  but where sufficient information is  given

and where no reference need be made to departments

like  Veterinary, Culture, Health,  or  Police  to

ensure  that the goods imported do conform to  the

regulations for health or security purposes,  then

normally  they  would  all be  cleared  within  24

hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member requests that goods consigned by air

should  be  given  priority  for  clearance.   Mr

Speaker,  Sir, whether they come by  air,  sea  or

land,  the  goods have to conform  to  our  import

restrictions.  And  here  again  where  sufficient

details  and descriptions of the goods are  given,

they  would be cleared very quickly. So the  delay

complained  of is not due to a shortage  of  staff

but  to  certain  procedures  which  have  to   be

followed.  The Member must understand that  quotas

and  tariff  restrictions have been imposed  after

our separation from Malaysia. Though there may  be

hitches  at the moment, they are all being  ironed

out.  But  it is inevitable that there will  be  a

little  bit more delay in the case of those  goods

where there are certain regulations governing them

than in the case of other goods.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Before I withdraw this

amendment, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would again ask the

Minister  if  he  could get his  Director  to  see

whether any improvements could be achieved. If so,

I think it would benefit the business community. I

beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Tang See Chim -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0809

be reduced by $100.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>

stand part of the Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0810 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0810

be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am here, Mr Speaker, Sir, to hand a bouquet to

the  Statistics Department. This I do in spite  of

an  editorial  comment in a Chinese daily  to  the

effect  that  Back-benchers  spend  more  time  in

praising the Ministers than criticising them,  and

that  there  is no substance in what Back-benchers

said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Point of order. Will the hon.

Member for Choa Chu Kang please quote the name of

the newspaper concerned and the date?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tang, in fact, standing Orders

require you to do that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Yes. The name of the newspaper

concerned is the Sin Chew Jit Poh and the

editorial appeared in this morning's edition.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> And we are relying upon you for an

accurate translation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Yes. I happen to read Chinese,

Mr Speaker, Sir. I am not blowing my own trumpet,

but  this  in  effect would be  the  gist  of  the

editorial.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I was merely trying to draw the

attention of the House to the fact that it is your

translation of the editorial and not someone

else's.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Yes, it is my own, Mr

Speaker,  Sir. In spite of the editorial  comment,

as I have said, I am here to hand a bouquet to the

Statistics   Department.  I   think   Members   of

Parliament must be able to discharge their  duties

without fear or favour, to criticise the Ministers

where  criticism is deserved, and to  praise  them

where praise is due.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, for example, Mr Speaker, I think

the  Statistics Department is doing  a  marvellous

job. I have a copy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



of  the Monthly Digest of Statistics here with me,

and  from  what I can see the collection of  facts

and  figures  appears  to be quite  comprehensive.

This  copy,  by  the  way,  Mr  Speaker,  is  for

November  1966. We are now only in the  middle  of

December  and  we  could get  the  November  issue

within the first half of the following month  with

facts  and  figures for as recent as September.  I

think  this  is  pretty good going, especially  in

view  of  the  fact that there  appears  to  be  a

shortage of statisticians in the department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only point that I can possibly raise is that

the collection of industrial production statistics

does  not  appear  to be quite comprehensive.  The

department appears not to have caught up with  the

fast  pace of industrialisation that is at present

going  on  in Singapore. This, no doubt,  will  be

remedied by the department in time. On the  whole,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, as I have said, the  Statistics

Department is doing a marvellous job and I am here

to pay a tribute to it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot claim

any  credit  at  all  for the  work  done  by  the

Statistics  Department. It has been going  on  for

quite  some time and advantage has been  taken  of

modern  technology, as a result of  which  we  are

able  to get these statistical digests within  the

first fortnight of the preceding month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the suggestion put forward by the

Member for Choa Chu Kang will be considered by the

Statistics Department.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, from what I have

said  just  now, I think it follows  that  I  must

necessarily  withdraw my amendment. Unfortunately,

Mr Speaker, we cannot speak on any Head unless  a

reduction in the vote is moved, as this  is  under

Standing  Orders.  I  hope  the  editor   of   the

newspaper concerned will not think that because we

move  to  reduce  the  vote,  we  must  criticise.

Consequently, Mr Speaker, I beg leave to withdraw

the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,308,420 for Head 0810 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0901 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the re-registration of the

national identity card came into being, it appears

that it threw the whole machinery of the issue  of

citizenship out of gear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Tang See Chim in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>7.14 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some time back it took an average of about six

months    for   an   application   for   Singapore

citizenship  to be processed and issued.  But  for

the last one year I believe it has taken more than

a year.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes when an application is submitted, it

takes  many months before the applicant is  called

for  an interview. I think this position is  quite

unsatisfactory,   because  citizenship   is   most

valuable  these  days.  If the  process  is  being

delayed  unduly, it does affect the livelihood  of

some   of  the  applicants  who  depend   on   the

expeditious  issue of the citizenship certificate.

In moving this amendment, I would appreciate it if

the Minister would look into this matter since the

registration of the identity card is coming  to  a

close very soon.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Tang, now the

people  of  Singapore who are holders of  identity

cards issued in 1948 or 1949 and who were born  in

Singapore  could  obtain the  pink  identity  card

without  the  necessity of obtaining  citizenship.

Originally these holders were unable to obtain the

pink  identity cards. The holders of pink identity

cards  were previously rejected. I wish to  obtain

an  assurance from the Minister in charge  whether

it  is  really  necessary  for  holders  of  pink

identity  cards to obtain citizenship papers.  Are

they    still   required   to   obtain   Singapore

citizenship papers?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Tang See Chim)</b>:  If there is no

other  Member  who wishes to speak, I  shall  call

upon the Acting Minister for Labour to reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Tang, I am not the Acting

Minister for Labour, but anyway I am answering for

the Acting Minister for Labour.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The  Chairman  (Mr  Tang)</b>: You  are  the  Acting

Acting Minister for Labour then!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Tang, it is true that an

applicant for citizenship has to wait for some

time before he is interviewed and before his

application is approved. This is inevitable as

every application has to be thoroughly

investigated not only to determine the length of

residence of the applicant but also whether he

fulfils the other conditions for citizenship, such

as good character, etc. In addition, some

applicants must pass an elementary national

language examination. While we were in Malaysia,

the Citizenship Registry dealt with an average of

40 cases a day. After independence, however, there

was a rush of applications for citizenship. This

was because citizenship is essential for Housing

Board accommodation, free education and other

social amenities. The number of applications

increased to as many as 600 a day, whereas the

staff could only cope with interviewing 60 to 70

applicants a day. This resulted in the Registry

having to stagger the dates of interview of

applicants. At one stage, the interval between the

issue of an application form and the date of the

interview was as long as one year. However, in the

middle of this year, the Registry staff was

increased, resulting in the Registry being able to

cope with 140 interviews a day. At present, the

situation has improved with the Registry dealing

with about 150 applications a day, and the waiting

period for the interview has been reduced to seven

or eight months. With the completion of the

national re-registration exercise, it is expected

that the Citizenship Registry will be able to deal

with applications, more expeditiously. The

Government is fully aware of the unavoidable delay

which has taken place during the last



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>



one  year. In fact, the Central Complaints  Bureau

has  recently  made  a survey of  the  Citizenship

Registry and has submitted certain recommendations

to  facilitate the control of queues and cut  down

delays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan has raised the

question  whether persons who are issued with  the

new  pink citizenship identity cards will  not  in

future be required to register for citizenship.  I

can confirm categorically here that holders of the

new  pink  laminated identity cards are  Singapore

citizens  and,  therefore, the question  of  their

applying for citizenship does not arise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I wish to seek

some  information  from the  Minister  as  regards

today's  expenditure.  At  this  sitting  we  were

informed  that national re-registration  would  be

completed some time at the end of the year.  Could

the  House  be  informed as to the nature  of  the

expenditure  of  this sum of over half  a  million

dollars?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, I have spoken on the matter of

issuing  identity  cards  to  citizens  who   have

acquired their citizenship after getting  the  new

plastic identity cards. When a non-citizen who has

already  obtained a blue identity  card  gets  his

Singapore  citizenship,  he  has  to  get  a   red

identity  card.  In  answer  to  my  question   in

Parliament, the Minister for Labour said that  for

such  a change the fee is only 50 cents. But  even

after  the  announcement  by  the  Minister,   the

registration officer insisted on a payment  of  $5

because  he  thought it was a replacement.  I  can

show  a letter written by the registration officer

to prove this. He did not think this was a change.

He  considered this a replacement. No one will say

that the change to a red identity card from a blue

identity  card  can be considered  a  replacement.

Lately,   I  spoke  to  the  Permanent  Secretary,

Ministry of Labour, on this matter and he promised

to look into it. And now I am informed that he has

referred  it to the Attorney-General and a  ruling

has  been  made that the fee for such a change  is

only  50  cents. I am really very  happy  to  know

about  this decision. But there is one more point,

and this is the refund of money colleted in excess

from the public for such changes. I am told that a

number  of  persons,  including  the  son  of  the

Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Finance,  paid  $5 for changing the blue  identity

card for a red one. Can the Minister consider  the

refund  of excess fees collected and make a public

announcement?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The national re-registration,

although scheduled to be completed by the  end  of

this  year,  is likely to be carried forward  till

the  end  of  January 1967. Up to  10th  December,

1,184,836 persons have been registered for the

new  laminated  cards. Of this  number,  1,055,242

persons  are citizens. It is estimated that  about

50,000  more  people come forward to change  their

identity  cards.  The  sum of  $561,200  has  been

provided  for  under O.C.S.E. for permanent  staff

and  temporary clerks, who will still be  required

to  carry on with the day-to-day administration of

the National Reregistration



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



Office.  This  involves   the   re-registration of school children who will reach the

age  of 12 next year. In addition, work has to  be

carried  on to build up the various index systems,

like  the identity card serial index, alias  names

index,   Chinese   character   index,   and    the

alphabetical  index register. There  is  also  the

work  of  sorting  and matching the  old  identity

cards  against  their counterfoils to  detect  any

forgery.  A  block  vote has  been  entered  under

O.C.S.E. by   Treasury,   since   the   starting

requirements   for  the  National  Re-registration

Office  in  1967 cannot be adequately assessed  at

this  stage.  A staff survey will be conducted  in

1967  to  determine the number of permanent  posts

required. The present provision provides  for  the

payment  of $137,000 for permanent staff, $400,000

for  temporary  clerks, and $23,500  for  annually

recurrent expenditure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the point raised by the Member for

Aljunied, it is confirmed that where a person  who

has   obtained   a   non-citizen   identity   card

subsequently  obtains  Singapore  citizenship  and

applies for a Singapore citizen identity card,  he

has to pay only a fee of 50 cents, as he will,  in

fact,  be applying for a new identity card,  i.e.,

an  identity card of a different type. It is  true

that  in  a  number of cases the Commissioner  for

National   Registration  has  misinterpreted   the

Regulations and collected $5. However,  action  is

being  taken  to  refund to  such  applicants  the

excess fee collected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, action to strike was taken by the

Singapore  Traction  Company workers  recently  in

respect  of  which the union gave 14 days'  strike

notice to the employers. When the notice to strike

was  about  to expire, the strike was not  carried

out.  As  we  have  learnt, not  only  from  union

members  of  the S.T.C., but also from leaders  of

the union who made a statement, the reason for not

carrying out the strike was that the laws  of  our

Republic forbid trade unions from carrying  out  a

strike.  On this matter, I am of the opinion  that

it  is  very  essential to clarify the  democratic

policy  of  the  Labour Ministry, i.e.,  what  the

attitude of the Labour Ministry is towards  labour

unions in Singapore which wish to carry out strike

action  after  they  have duly complied  with  the

regulations  of the Labour Ordinance by  taking  a

ballot   to  strike.  If  it  is  true  that   the

prohibition  against the unions  going  on  strike

emanates  from  the Government  of  this  Republic

through the Minister for Labour, then I am of  the

opinion   that  our  labour  policy  is  not   yet

implemented fully. If the statements made  by  the

leaders  and members of the S.T.C. Union  are  not

true, then it must be clarified to the public that

the   Government  of  the  Republic,  through  the

Minister for Labour, does not prevent unions  from

going  on strike if they have a mandate for it.  I

say so, Mr Speaker, because we do not wish to see

union  leaders  making mistakes and then  shifting

the blame on to the Government and the Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>



Labour. This must be clarified and the matter

rectified so that the attitude and policy of the

Labour Ministry can be implemented properly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as I

understand,  there  is no law in  Singapore  which

forbids any union which wants to go on strike,  to

strike. However, the law does provide that in  the

case of an essential service, 14 days' notice will

be  required. Or when a case is referred  to  the

Arbitration   Court,  then  no  strike   will   be

permitted.  If  what the Member for Kampong  Kapor

has said is true, then I think the union officials

who  made the allegation to their members that the

laws  of  the  State forbid any strike,  are  just

trying  to  shift  their  responsibility  to   the

Government.   As  far  as  labour   disputes   are

concerned, the attitude of the Labour Ministry has

always  been to try to bring both parties together

to  come to an amicable settlement without  having

to  resort  to strikes; and also to see  that  the

employers  comply with all the provisions  of  the

Labour  Ordinance. I do not think it is the policy

of  the Labour Ministry to forbid any strike if it

is justified, and if the necessary procedures are

complied with by the union.

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0902

be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. I would like to know how many cases have been heard by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>



two Arbitration Courts for the years 1965 and 1966

and  how many cases have not been settled or heard

yet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for 1965 and

1966   the   two  Industrial  Arbitration   Courts

disposed  of  230  cases. Of  these,  awards  were

handed down in 116 cases, and the other 114  cases

were  settled out of court by the parties  and  by

the Registrar under the direction of the Court. As

regards  pending cases, the position  of  the  two

Courts as at 12th December, 1966 was as follows:



<pre>

                   Cases pending award      10



                   Cases currently being

                       heard and pending    52



                   Cases to be withdrawn    18

</pre>



<br><br>If the cases to be withdrawn and the cases pending

award  are not taken into account, then the number

of cases currently being heard and pending amounts

to only 52. Of these, 18 are currently being heard

by  the two Courts, leaving a balance of 34  cases

for which dates of hearing have not been fixed, in

some  instances  at the request of  the  disputing

parties.  This is a distinctly favourable position

to  carry forward into 1967. The Courts have never

been  in such a favourable position since the last

President  relinquished office on 14th  September,

1964.  These 52 cases, if roughly divided  between

the two Courts will put the current position at 26

cases per Court. This is a manageable position for

the Courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the well-being of a nation very often is

related  to the health of her people, and to  what

extent  sports  in  the  countries  flourishes  is

evidenced  in  the  various  power  bloc  nations.

Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>



as an independent Republic should regard sports as

one of its main concerns.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of a Sports Stadium Complex is

directed  towards the promotion of  sports  and  a

future  healthy  generation,  for  it  is  with  a

healthy  mind  and body that the  next  generation

will  be  able  to  shoulder the task  of  nation-building  and  to bring about a society  that  has

social discipline and its own identity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in recent weeks, there were two

international sports meets beginning -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sim, I am sure you are prepared

to give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> No, Sir. I think I will speak a

little longer -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sim, please -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Some of us have not prepared our

notes  in  respect of the Head on the Ministry  of

Culture and Social Affairs. We thought it would be

taken on Monday so that we could prepare our notes

tomorrow and Sunday.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am afraid I cannot help it. The

times given are not the times for starting but the

times  at  which I will terminate the  debate.  In

view of that and in view of the willingness of the

Minister  for Culture and Social Affairs  to  deal

with  any matters that arise, I am afraid  I  must

allow the debate to continue. Mr Sim.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> The Member for Aljunied had to

waste my time!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now I have said that during recent weeks, we

had  two international sports meets beginning with

GANEFO  and later the Fifth Asian Games in Bangkok

which is now still in progress. Singapore has  the

privilege and opportunity to participate in  these

two meets, and although the results of these games



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>



are  not up to our expectations, we have at  least

succeeded in strengthening the fraternal ties with

other  participating  countries  and  establishing

contacts with a lot of new friends. For  us,  our

participation  in these two meets is  not  to  win

medals, for we have a long way to go to attain the

requisite    standards    of    performance     at

international  level. Our participation  in  these

sports meets appeared to be merely that while  the

players sweated it out in the arena, the officials

took  it  as a vacation or sight-seeing trip!  One

example is that, apart from the experience gained,

our participation in the Twenty-sixth Table Tennis

Tournament  held in Peking 1961  was  not  at  all

exploited,  and  there appears to be  no  adequate

post-mortem,  apart  from  the  meaningless  Press

statements  issued  by the Team  official  on  his

return.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the source of the problem lies with the

leadership of the various sport organisations.  We

are  aware,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, that  there  is  a

personality  in Singapore who, by his  high-handed

manner  in  dealing with other sports associations

by  virtue of his position, is regarded by sports-loving  people  with  distaste  and  as  a  sports

"racketeer".  I have sufficient evidence  to  show

the  deplorable  state of affairs in  some  sports

organisations, particularly in three  or  four  of

them  which are under the leadership of  the  same

person.  Sir, without prejudice and reflection  on

other  sports  enthusiasts  who  are  always   the

objects of my admiration, one cannot see the logic

of  a  man manoeuvring as the President of a group

of  sports organisations whose activities  are  so

diverse - for example, the Singapore Table  Tennis

Association,  the  Singapore  Amateur   Wrestling

Association,  and  the Singapore  Amateur  Cycling

Association are under the leadership of  one  man.

The only common bond among these associations,  as

far  as  I can see, is sports and perhaps monetary

benefits.   These  associations  are  capable   of

exploiting all sports-loving people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know it is difficult for the Minister to

reply  to what I have just said in the absence  of

details and facts, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>



I am quoting this as an example to justify my fear

and  the  anxiety of the majority of  our  sports-loving  public who would undoubtedly like  to  see

whatever  donation  to any sports  association  is

properly expanded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, to support my statement, I would like to

point  out  to the Minister that the three  sports

organisations under the leadership of one  person,

I  understand, have to pay no less than $100  each

as  monthly rental for their premises which happen

to be the homes of the official or his relatives.

In  short, these three associations pay  not  less

than  $100 a month each for one and the same  room

under   the  same  roof,  and  all  the  financial

resources of these three associations are used for

his own benefit!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I regret to have to

deal with this matter at length, but for the

benefit of sports in our Republic -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sim, I am very reluctant to

interrupt you. But I must question your ability

to relate the three organisations to which you

are referring, to the responsibility of the

Minister for Culture and Social Affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is this. Some of the things you

have  said  might  reflect upon  the  conduct  and

character  of  someone outside. I  would  like  to

refer you to Standing Order 46 (1) which states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No reference shall be made to the conduct or

character of any Member or of any public servant,

other than his conduct in his capacity as a Member

or as a public servant.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether or not the person you are

referring to is a public servant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, I am referring to his

capacity as a sports official and organiser and

not as a civil servant.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> But is he a public servant?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> By profession?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> I am not able to say that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He is a public servant.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not know the person the hon.

Member is referring to. I have not heard of  these

organisations  before. But if the person  referred

to  is  a  public servant, then I  must  draw  the

Member's attention to this Standing Order, that he

cannot   refer   to  this  person's   conduct   or

character,  outside  his  capacity  as  a   public

servant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, I merely want to bring

this  to  the notice of the Minister. Although  we

have  this  Sports Promotion Officer, I  want  the

Minister to take another step further and see that

all  sports promotions do not benefit only  a  few

persons who are supposed to be sports racketeers.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sim, you must not use words

like  "racketeers"  in  the  House.  But  you  may

certainly  continue  speaking  on  your  amendment

provided  you have this particular Standing  Order

in mind.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Yes, Sir. Thank you for your

pertinent ruling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I call upon the

Minister  to set up, if it is possible,  a  Sports

Institute to train our local sports talent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What Council?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> It is an Institute not a

Council!



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> And to acquire the services of

coaches from other advanced countries in the field

of   sports,  to  offer  every  encouragement  and

incentive  to local sportsmen, and to  help  solve

the  unemployment  problem of our  local  talented

sportsmen.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Culture and Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

the  policy of Government to encourage  sports  in

Singapore  in order to enable the participants  to

reach   an  international  standard  in  as   many

sporting events as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creation of a Sports Division in the Ministry

of Culture and Social Affairs is a positive way of

helping sports organisations and individual



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>



sportsmen to achieve this objective. The  National

Stadium  Complex is to be built at a cost  of  $15

million and it will include a football stadium,  a

swimming  pool, an athletic track and a  gymnasium

all of which will be of international standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is beyond the Sports Department's duty to

direct  sports organisations, which are registered

under  the Societies Ordinance, to acquire  or  to

rent  beautiful and posh premises befitting  their

activities or their size. I think it is up to  the

organisations themselves to choose  what  type  of

premises they think they can afford.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case mentioned by the Member for Changi,

perhaps  it  is  convenient for the  three  sports

organisations, which he says are under one roof or

in one small room, -



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> In one small room



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> - because they are all run by the

same officials -



<br><br>8.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Moment of interruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

report that the Committee of Supply has made

progress on the Estimates of Expenditure for 1967,

and beg leave to sit again on Monday, the 19th of

December.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Monday, the 19th of December, it

shall be.
