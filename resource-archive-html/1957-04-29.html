<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on

Amendment to Question (27th April, 1957),



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) takes note of the Report of the Singapore

Constitutional Conference held in London in

March  and  April, 1957,  as  contained  in

Sessional  Paper No. Misc. 2 of  1957,  and

approves the points on which agreement  has

been reached; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) approves the stand of the All-Party

Delegation  in not accepting the  condition

stipulated    in   paragraph 30    of    the

Report,"-(The Chief Minister).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Amendment was, 'After "(1)" to leave out

"takes  note  of  the  Report  of  the  Singapore

Constitutional Conference held in London in March

and  April, 1957, as contained in Sessional Paper

No.  Misc. 2 of 1957, and approves the points  on

which  agreement has been reached; and",  and  to

insert-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"regretfully takes note of the Report of the

Singapore  Constitutional  Conference   held   in

London in March and April, 1957, as contained  in

Sessional   Paper  No.  Misc.  2  of  1957;   and

nevertheless    calls    for    the     immediate

implementation  of  the new Constitution  on  the

basis that all persons qualified by residence for

citizenship  shall be entitled  to  vote  at  the

first elections; and".'-(Mr David Marshall).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the words

proposed to be left out, be left out."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Mr

Speaker, Sir, this is indeed an unhappy moment in

my  life. I find myself personally attacked  many

times  by the Member for Cairnhill in his lengthy

but  rather  tiresome speech. I  am  unhappy  not

because  I  was unjustly attacked, I  am  unhappy

because my ex-leader, to whom I have given all my

loyalty,  a loyalty which he himself has publicly

acknowledged, has suffered such a mental  setback

as  to  cause him to make a spectacle of  himself

and thus lose the respect of his friends who were

his  colleagues not so long ago.  In  my  opening

speech  I  paid  a  tribute  to  the  Member  for

Cairnhill  as  the man who blazed the  trail  for

constitutional  advance  and  that  tribute   was

received with acclamation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1788</b></font><br><br>



in this House. When he was the leader  of

the  All-Party Mission to London last year,  Sir,

he  fought  hard,  he fought vigorously,  and  it

would  now appear that the mental strain he  went

through is now having its adverse effects on him.

This  is  indeed  a sad day for  me  and  for  my

colleagues.  If tears could wash away  the  shame

that  has  befallen upon us, I would weep - Sir,  I

would weep. I would not have stood up to reply to

the  attacks  if  they were just heaped  upon  me

alone;  but  when he tried to sneer at  the  good

work  of the All-Party Delegation and to ridicule

my   Ministerial  colleagues  who  were  his  ex-colleagues, I would be failing in my duty,  as  a

leader,  if  I did not stand up to reply  to  the

malignant,  to  the  scurrilous,  to  the  unjust

attacks-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Chief Minister is

becoming unparliamentary. I think I cannot  allow

the word "scurrilous".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I withdraw that word, Sir.

He  must  forgive me because I speak  with  great

emotion.  Sir,  I said I would be failing  in  my

duty, as a leader, if I did not stand up to reply

to  the unjust attacks, the unjust abuse levelled

at them by the Member for Cairnhill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, his plea for an immediate election is based

on  his  unfounded allegation that the  All-Party

Delegation has made a mess of its job and that an

immediate  election will help  to  clear  up  the

mess.  Sir,  I  cannot  see where  the  All-Party

Delegation  has made a mess of it at all.  Before

we  left  Singapore, we had a clear mandate  from

this Assembly and we have now come back with that

mandate fully satisfied. If there is a mess, Sir,

it is a mess made by the last delegation, and the

present  delegation has helped to clean  up  that

mess. He said, Sir, that the introduction of  the

new constitution could be effected by means of an

Order  in Council. He pointed out that previously

the  British  Government had agreed to  back  the

constitution  by  an  Act of  Parliament.  It  is

clear, Sir, that the mind of the hon. Member  has

been set to find fault with what we brought back,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1789</b></font><br><br>



and  on  his  fault-finding,  he  failed  to  read

paragraph  52  carefully. Paragraph 52,  Sir,  the

first few lines of the first sentence clearly  say

that  "the constitutional arrangements set out  in

this  Report will require the authority of an  Act

of  the United Kingdom Parliament". Paragraph  53,

Sir, explains the reason for the enforced delay in

introducing  this legislation'.  This  is  another

reason  why  it is not possible to hold  immediate

elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has asked whether I

would  agree  to  an adjournment of  this  sitting

without a vote being taken, and he added by saying

that we need not worry because our seats are safe.

Sir, as leader of the All-Party Delegation, I have

consulted the Parties concerned. They cannot agree

to   this   request.  Moreover,  Sir,  this   very

important  issue should not be left  undecided.  I

said  in  my opening speech that if the  motion - my

motion - is  adopted in this Assembly, it would  set

the  machinery in motion to put into operation the

first  part of my motion; and as far as the second

part  is concerned, it would be my duty to get  in

touch  with the Secretary of State with a view  to

asking  him to reconsider the condition  which  he

has himself imposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill said all this talk

about a Delimitation Committee was unnecessary, or

not  right, because he himself knew that there was

already  a  Delimitation Committee in being.  Sir,

this  is  not  so. At our sitting on  the  5th  of

March, I said that the Government would appoint  a

Delimitation Committee with representatives of all

Parties in that Committee so that the division  of

Singapore  into  51 electoral wards  can  be  done

without   any  possibility  of  Members   of   the

Opposition accusing the Government of dividing the

wards  in  such a way as to make it favourable  to

the  Party  in  power. There  was  a  Delimitation

Committee, Sir. It was a Government Committee. The

Government had that Committee going because of the

assurance  that the Government has made  that  the

general  election  would  take  place  in  August.

Singapore  had  already  been  divided   into   51

divisions.  The machinery was set  in  motion  and

electoral rolls would have been ready by  now  had

it not been for the fact that the All-Party



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1790</b></font><br><br>



Conference, after having given very serious

consideration  to  the question  of  the  date  of

effect  of the new constitution, decided  that  it

would be most unfair if all persons who will enjoy

the  citizenship rights should be deprived of  the

opportunity  of  exercising those  rights  in  the

choice  of  a  new government and  under  the  new

constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill criticised, Sir, our

demand which was agreed by the Secretary of  State

that  the  Head of State of the State of Singapore

should  be  Malayan-born. He said  that  this  was

worse  than what he had asked for. Sir,  the  All-Party  Delegation  felt that  the  Head  of  State

should  be  a  Malayan-born  and  not  a  Malayan,

because  a Malayan will include a large number  of

persons  who are not Malayan-born. Sir, he accused

us  of hastily convening a sitting for the 5th  of

March  when he was away from Singapore. He alleged

that  I was aware that he would be away. Sir,  the

All-Party Conference at its earlier meetings, when

the  Member for Cairnhill was a representative  of

the Labour Front in the conference, decided that a

special sitting of this Assembly should be  called

on  the 28th of February in order to debate on the

recommendations of the All-Party Conference.  Hon.

Members were aware that there had been some  delay

in  the  All-Party Conference in reaching finality

because  of  the misunderstanding  that  arose  in

regard  to  the  demand of  U.M.N.O.  It  was  not

possible to clear this misunderstanding until  the

1st  of  March, and therefore the earliest sitting

that  could  have been held before  the  All-Party

Delegation left for London was the 5th of March.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill said that the All-Party Delegation was inadequate. I really cannot

understand the reason for that charge.  Before  we

left,  as I said, Sir, we had a mandate from  this

Assembly. We came back with the mandate fulfilled.

Where then was the inadequacy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that on our return there was stony

silence. As an Asian, Sir, I know that Asians  are

not  boisterous in their welcome, that Asians  are

restrained   in  their  behaviour,  and   it   was

therefore to be expected that there was to be  not

much of cheering, but because there had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1791</b></font><br><br>



been  no cheering - not much of it - it should not  be

taken  to  mean that there was silence,  that  the

people  of Singapore were shocked at the agreement

reached by the All-Party Delegation. He said  that

the Labour Front had agreed to hold a mass meeting

to  welcome  the delegation back,  but  that  mass

meeting was not held because the whole theme  that

we had been playing on to achieve success was All-Party  unity. We went to London as a united party;

we  came  back  as  a  united All-Party,  and  the

celebration  should be on an All-Party  basis.  No

political Party should try to steal the credit for

the work done by the All-Party Delegation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then spoke about the publicity for the films

that were shown in the cinema halls. Since then  I

have seen those films about the return of the All-Party  Delegation  and about the  signing  of  the

Report in London, and I, Sir, must say this - that I

feel  ashamed that those pictures do  not  include

the  man  who  blazed the trail for constitutional

advance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill then criticised the

presentation of banners and the picture of a  sick

lion  to  me,  and  this  was  described  in   the

newspapers  as  organised by the T.U.C.,  but  was

later  denied by the Secretary of the T.U.C. that

it  was not a T.U.C. show. Sir, I am not concerned

whether it was a T.U.C. show or not a T.U.C. show.

It was not arranged at all. Those people are known

to  me  and  they  felt their happiness  and  they

wanted   to   display  their  happiness   by   the

presentation of banners and the picture of a  sick

lion.  That picture, Sir, is hanging in my office,

and  I  have been gazing at it, and I did not  see

that  the lion is a sick lion. But I do say  this,

Sir,  that lion should have been presented to  the

Member  for Cairnhill when he returned last  year,

as  he  was  the  man  who blazed  the  trail  for

constitutional  advance. I do not  deserve  it  at

all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill then alleged, Sir, that

we  want  to continue in office right  up  to  our

natural life, and in fact he went to the extent of

alleging  that he believed that we would  want  to

continue beyond our natural life because, the  way

he read it, paragraph 54,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1792</b></font><br><br>



if we are good with the Governor, we may remain in

office for many, many more years; because,  as  he

read   paragraph   54,  he  said   the   date   of

introduction  of the new constitution  would  rest

with the Governor. Sir, it is usually the Governor

who sets the date for the elections, but because I

was   thrilled  by  the  unity  of  the  All-Party

Delegation,  because  I was  thrilled  that  in  a

national  issue all political Parties in Singapore

could  be  united, I felt that it  would  be  most

unfair if the Government were to take advantage of

this practice. I said that as the new constitution

is  the  result  of  the  united  efforts  of  all

Parties, it should be the Parties in this Assembly

who   should  decide  on  the  date  of  the  next

election,  which would be the date of introduction

of  the  new  constitution, and I  would  be  most

surprised  if  the  Governor, after  receiving  an

Address from this Assembly, would not take heed of

that Address.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill, Sir, asked us to turn

back the clock. He gave an account of his previous

campaign. He said, "Then there was great shouting,

there  was great activity, and now there is  stony

silence.  And  yet  these are  the  same  people."

Surely,  Sir,  all that great shouting,  all  that

great  excitement, all that great  activity  could

only  have  been as a result of the activities  of

the  political Parties in this Assembly. We became

wiser  after the event. We say if there is  to  be

unity,  and  as  unity  was  the  only  means   of

achieving  success, no political Party should  try

to  create a situation whereby unity might not  be

possible.  It  is  as a result  of  experience  we

learned out of the last campaign, and if we gained

by  that  experience, surely  no  one  should  now

criticise that we should be just as foolish as the

last delegation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he referred to what he said was an attempt

by the previous Governor, Sir John Nicoll, who had

suggested  an easy way out for him, and from  that

he seemed to feel that he was justified to draw  a

parallel  with  the condition  laid  down  by  the

Secretary   of   State.   He   said   unscrupulous

politicians  will  not take the  consequences  and

they will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1793</b></font><br><br>



therefore  "pass  the buck" to  the  Secretary  of

State.  Sir,  this Government has been  in  office

since  June last year and this Government has  not

shirked  its duty towards the people of  Singapore

when  it  took  drastic action against  subversive

elements.  We did it because we felt that  it  was

needed of us, and we will continue doing it if  it

is needed of us. We do not have to hide behind the

cloak of any colonial official.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill then spoke bitterly

about   our  crawling  on  our  bellies   to   the

Federation. I am indeed very happy to read in  the

Press  that  our friends the Federation  Ministers

did  not  pay much attention to this because  they

are   aware  that  the  representatives  in   this

Assembly - when  I say the representatives  in  this

Assembly, it is perhaps with the exception of  the

Member for Cairnhill - have the best of goodwill and

friendship  for the Federation and they  too  have

the  best  of goodwill and friendship towards  us.

Had it not been for their co-operation, had it not

been for their assistance, as I said in my opening

speech,  the Internal Security Council  could  not

have  been  brought into being and without  it  we

could  not  have reached agreement  on  the  whole

issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill then criticised what we

have  brought  back  as tiga suku  busok  merdeka.

Maybe  it is busok because we brought it back,  it

would  not  have been busok had it been otherwise.

Sir,  let  us try to examine what we have  brought

back,  in  the  light  of  what  the  Member   for

Cairnhill  would  himself have accepted,  although

his delegation had advised him not to do so. First

of  all,  I would like to repeat in this  Assembly

that   what  we  went  to  get  is  what  we  were

instructed  to  get.  There  was  this   All-Party

Conference  planning strategy, and the Member  for

Cairnhill was a representative of the Labour Front

on this conference. He was with us right up to the

22nd  of  February when we held our fifth meeting.

Up  to that time we had already disposed of almost

everything   except  two  points - the   demand   of

U.M.N.O. and the date of introduction of  the  new

constitution.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1794</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr D. S. Marshall (Cairnhill):</b> And Internal

Security Council.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> The composition of the

Internal Security Council was discussed at a  very

early meeting-



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Composition of?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> - and it was agreed that it

should  be three-three-one. Then on 25th February,

I  received a letter from the Member for Cairnhill

tendering  in his resignation as a Member  of  the

All-Party Conference, because he felt that he  had

lost  the confidence of the Labour Front.  It  was

after  the  Labour  Front annual conference,  Sir,

that the Member for Cairnhill felt that he had  to

take such a line. I replied to him and appealed to

him  that  he should continue to sit in this  All-Party Conference so that we could have the benefit

of his advice but he thought otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, why did the last Mission fail? We all know

it, it  is worth recounting here because of  what

has  already been said and because the  public  is

now  puzzled by all these speeches that have  been

made  in  this  Assembly. The last Mission  failed

because  of  the demand of the British  Government

for  a Defence and Security Council and loaded  in

such  a way that every time the British Government

won and with such wide powers that the Defence and

Security Council could interfere in the day-to-day

administration of Singapore. In the very words  of

the  Member  for  Cairnhill, Sir,  he  said,  "The

intention of Her Majesty's Government is to retain

complete  imperial  powers  over  Singapore  which

would remain a colony." Those were his very words,

that  Singapore should remain a colony subject  to

these  day-to-day overriding imperial  powers  and

that was why he was so resentful. That was why  he

was in such a rage, and quite rightly so. I was in

the  same  rage but then he himself  explained  to

this  Assembly,  Sir, last June  why  he  felt  it

necessary   to   take  upon  himself   to   reopen

negotiations  with  the  Colonial  Office   on   a

constitution  which  he  described  as  "Christmas

pudding with arsenic sauce". We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1795</b></font><br><br>



went  to  that memorable tea party,  Sir. I  went

although I squirmed and this is all what I get for

my loyalty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That proposal, Sir, last year for a Defence and

Security  Council  with  a  British  Chairman  was

unacceptable and should remain unacceptable and it

was  because  the All-Party Conference  felt  that

unless   a  compromise  was  found  out  of   this

difficulty,   there  could  be  no   success.   We

therefore  said to ourselves, "Must we  give  that

decisive power to the British Government?" We said

no  in 1956 and we still say no in 1957. But  then

how  should  we get out of it? Then we thought  of

bringing   the   Federation  into  this   Security

Council.  We  say  that insofar  as  the  internal

security  position of Singapore is concerned,  the

Federation of Malaya is more closely interested in

this  situation than the British people could ever

pretend  or hope to make out a case. What  is  the

power of this Internal Security Council, Sir? What

was  decided  in  London was  that  this  Internal

Security  Council should be kept informed  of  the

internal security situation day by day in the same

way that the Defence and Security Council proposed

by  H.M.G. last  year  also  wanted  to  be  kept

informed and this Internal Security Council  would

only  take  a  decisive vote when a dispute  arose

between  the Singapore Government and the  British

Government.  It  would be left to  the  Federation

Minister to cast his vote after listening to  both

sides  of  the  case  and cast  his  vote  in  his

absolute discretion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill then turned to the

paragraphs on internal security. He read out to us

paragraph 26 (ii):

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"to maintain the efficiency of all organs of

the   Singapore   Government  concerned   with

internal security;"



<br><br>and he tried, Sir, by his eloquence, to prove that

"maintain" means "control". I have, Sir, looked up

three dictionaries (Websters, Chambers and Oxford)

and  I found that "maintain" means "support". This

Internal   Security   Council   with   the   three

Governments sitting on it will do all they can  to

help to support the maintenance of the organs of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1796</b></font><br><br>



the  internal  security. What greater  measure  of

internal  security can there be than to have  this

in the new constitution?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill, Sir, again touched on

this   thorny  subject  which  he  felt - and  quite

rightly  so - rather strongly. "Singapore should  no

longer  be  under  the  control  of  the  Colonial

Office." I share that strong feeling with him  but

when I take into consideration the undeniable fact

that  even  if it were to be the Colonial  Office,

the Commonwealth Relations Office or any office in

the  British  Cabinet,  it would  still  mean  the

British Government but we are trying to fight for,

shall   we   say,  freedom  against  the   British

Government,   not   the   Colonial   Office,   the

Commonwealth  Relations  Office  or   what   other

office - I  do not know the setup there - and  it  was

decided in the All-Party Conference (and he was  a

member then) that while we could press for it,  we

should not make an issue of it. Where then have we

failed?  Where then was the inadequacy as  alleged

by him?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill, Sir, said, "It is

simple.  Let  us have the elections quickly  by  a

simple amendment of the Elections Ordinance."  Why

he  said that is because he was under the mistaken

belief - and  he  has  many  beliefs - that  this  new

constitution could be introduced by  an  Order  in

Council. Paragraph 52 clearly says that it has  to

be   backed  by  an  Act  of  the  United  Kingdom

Parliament and paragraph 53 states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;". . .it would not be possible to introduce the

necessary  United Kingdom legislation  during  the

current Session of Parliament;"



<br><br>but  the  British Government had  promised  to  do

their best to introduce it at the next Session and

this  will be, I think, in November. It is not  so

easy-



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I wonder if I could draw the

attention-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it on a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Chief Minister will give

way.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1797</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I thank the Hon. the Chief

Minister,  Sir.  May I ask him to  read  the  last

sentence of paragraph 54 to which he is referring?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I am afraid that the

Member  for Cairnhill is still suffering a  mental

strain.  I  have not said paragraph 54 at  all.  I

said paragraphs 52 and 53.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Read the last sentence of

paragraph 52.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> After the Act has been

passed, then it would be contained in an Order  in

Council. Before the Act has been passed, how could

it  be contained in an Order in Council! Sir, I am

not  a lawyer. I am just a poor ordinary clerk and

sometimes  I  do find difficulty in  understanding

the English language. "You can introduce elections

in  three  months  by the simple process  of  just

going  through the identity cards and  anyone  who

has  ten  years  residence could  be  put  on  the

electoral  roll."  Never mind  about  citizenship!

What  is loyalty after all'! Put them on and  when

you  have  the new constitution in,  then  go  and

check up on their loyalty and if they do not  want

to be citizens, out they go but by then they would

have voted and put in people who might not want to

be  citizens of Singapore. We would then be  in  a

real  quandary. It has been pointed out, Sir, that

the  identity  card  system  came  into  being  in

October 1948. That could not be ten years but then

the   Member  for  Cairnhill  amended  it   rather

quickly.  "It  could be nine years.  It  could  be

eight years." But I have been advised, Sir, by the

Statistics Department that it will take from  five

to  six months to sort out all the identity  cards

and  then  to  get their machines into  action  to

produce   the  electoral  rolls  and   after   the

electoral rolls have been produced, it would  take

about four months under the Elections Ordinance - if

not  four months, 101 days - for the electoral  roll

to  be  open  for  inspection,  objections  to  be

received and all sorts of procedure. Five  to  six

months  plus four months will be nine  months.  It

could not be three months.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1798</b></font><br><br>



But   then   if   you   said,   "This   Government

particularly myself has broken my word to him when

I  assured him in this Assembly and in a  personal

letter  that  the  Government would  have  general

elections in August 1957," I was aware that such a

criticism would be levelled at me and that was why

at  the  sitting on the 5th March, I made it  very

clear to this Assembly that if there was to be any

delay in the elections beyond August, the Assembly

must  take the full responsibility. I do not  want

to  continue  in  office  unnecessarily  as  Chief

Minister, Sir. I have said almost everywhere and I

say  in  this  solemn  hall that  to  be  a  Chief

Minister  is to suffer more than a human being  at

times  can bear. I do not want it but the interest

of  the  people of Singapore demands that I should

make  this sacrifice. I am happy to make it and  I

will make it and no ridicule levelled at me by any

Member  in this Assembly will deter me from  doing

my  responsibility to my people. I have been doing

public  work  for nine years. My  house  has  been

invaded  from  morning to night.  I  held  it  all

quietly.  I  did not have to hold a weekly  public

session   with   members   of   the   Press    and

photographers to show that I was really doing work

for  the people of Singapore. I do not have to  do

that, Sir. Deeds count and not words. Deeds count.

I  am indeed, Sir, most ashamed that I should give

way  to emotion. I have never done that. But  this

is much too much.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from all that I have said, it is therefore

evident  to  this  Assembly  that  I  oppose   the

amendment.



<br><br>10.47 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

listened very carefully to the various speeches in

this  House.  Sir, you said that this  is  a  very

important  debate,  a  debate  which  should  have

solemn  silence with no interruptions and with  no

jeering.  Unfortunately, in the past few days,  we

have  been  disturbed in that manner.  It  is  not

becoming to the dignity of this Assembly. We  have

heard  very  powerful oratory from the Member  for

Cairnhill, the eloquent speech from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1799</b></font><br><br>



Member   for   Tanjong  Pagar  and  from   various

speakers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, there are three issues involved in the

debate on the amendment: if we got merdeka, should

we  have accepted it?; if not, what could  be  the

consequences?;  and  elections.  Now,   Sir,   the

mandate  to the previous All-Party Delegation  was

for  full  self-government, that is, merdeka,  and

that   delegation  could  be  called  the  Merdeka

Delegation;   but,   Sir,   the   last   All-Party

Delegation  went to London to seek internal  self-government and not merdeka, it is a fallacy and it

is  wrong  to say that it was a Merdeka delegation

or  that  we  got  merdeka. We have  not  received

anything of that sort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this platform, I have said very often

that the colonial power is not going to give self-government  on  a  silver tray to  the  people  of

Singapore.  Also  before the delegation  left  for

London,  I  said that our demands were  reasonable

and  that the United Kingdom should grant them but

though  the members of the delegation were  honest

and  sincere  in standing by the mandate  we  gave

them,  yet  the  colonial power - the  master  of

diplomats (the Colonial Secretary) - sent them back

with their hands and feet tied. Now. Sir, what did

we get? Yes, we got high-sounding names like Chief

of  State,  Commissioner  for  Britain  and  Prime

Minister but who gets the real power? If  you  go

through these paragraphs, Sir, at every stage  the

Chief of State has to consult the Commissioner for

the  United  Kingdom.  The  Commissioner  for  the

United  Kingdom  is a name but actually  it  is  a

British Resident according to the sense I make out

from  this  Report.  New names  do  not  make  any

difference,  it  is the substance that  makes  the

difference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, on top of this, there is a suggestion

of  an  agreement on the subversive paragraph  but

the  All-Party Delegation says that it is  not  an

agreement. Now, Sir, according to British justice,

no one is guilty unless he is proved to be so. The

best thing is to bring these people to trial.  The

public  do  not  know what has been  going  on  in

privacy or in camera. We do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1800</b></font><br><br>



know. Possibly, the Government does know. Sir,  on

the  other  hand, do you really expect the  United

Kingdom  to give up Singapore? I do not think  so.

Supposing you were in their shoes, would you do it

as  a  colonial  power?  Singapore  is  the  most

strategic  place  in South-East Asia.  The  United

Kingdom has Gibraltar, Malta, Aden - of course, they

will  have to get out of Trincomalee - and the  only

place  in South-East Asia for the defence of their

territories and their economic position and  White

Australia  is Singapore, and then do you  mean  to

say that they will leave Singapore? Personally,  I

never  expected  it. Yes, they will  if  they  are

forced  to do so. Now, Sir, how can we force  this

colonial power to do so? We can do so with  unity,

with a struggle, and if we fight as one nation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> And justice.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> May I have the hon. Member's

indulgence, please?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Sorry.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> India has done it with 80 years

of struggle, fights, gaols, deaths, and so on, and

they  succeeded.  They even boycotted  the  Cripps

Commission when that great statesman first came to

India. Well, that is history. Are we in that  same

position? Is Singapore largely populated and  with

a  wide  area? That is not so. What  is  our  past

history?  It  is only 130 years old  and  we  only

heard  a  few  names which were in  the  political

field  before 1955. We are just beginning  and  we

are proud of that. Sir, if what we have got is not

satisfactory,  what  are we to  do?  Personally  I

think - and  I said this in the last  debate  when

the previous delegation returned empty-handed - that

we  should have accepted what was offered  to  the

maximum. We should have taken advantage of it  and

things  would  have been different. We  would  not

have  the  sad  spectacle of  the  colonial  power

running  this Government or the Government running

the  government  with the aid  of  ex-officio  and

nominated Members. That would have ended long ago.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1801</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the only alternative is to accept what

is offered. England is in no position to refuse us

even if we were to refuse to accept the subversive

paragraph.  She dare not. Do not forget  that  the

British  people are the only white people left  in

South-East  Asia.  Look from  Suez  to  Japan.  Of

course,  you  have  America  holding  an  economic

stronghold  and  even  fighting  Britain  in  this

sphere. They will give in. They try to hold on  as

long as they can; even for a year, a month, a  day

or even for a single second but it is in our hands

whether we should allow them to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the new constitution provides for 51

elected  representatives but the elections  should

be  held in a democratic way. Britain allows  free

elections in that country but not here. But  there

is  a  remedy: it is only for the first  elections

and the first elections can be held - I will come to

that - as  early  as possible and you  can  dissolve

your  Assembly  within six months  or  within  six

days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we started with the Rendel Constitution in

April  1955.  Within two months,  the  Member  for

Cairnhill, who was the Chief Minister then, put up

a  strong fight and made the Colonial Office  give

way  in  many  respects. Also, the United  Kingdom

conceded    further   talks.   Now,   Sir,    this

Constitution  lays down that it  shall  not  stand

beyond four years but that we can reopen the talks

any  time  we like within the four years, provided

the  right people are elected to the Assembly, not

self-seekers, and if they have got the will to  do

it, they can resign and say, "Look here, U.K., you

continue. You want this again." This can  be  done

and  I  think that that is the shortest way.  Even

the P.A.P. has watered down their past demands.  I

do  not  think  that  the  ex-Chief  Minister  was

responsible for the last failure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. was backing the Chief Minister at

that  time. They were not satisfied with  anything

less  than that and they did not accept less  than

that,   but  now  they  have.  The  only  possible

explanation is that they consider this the maximum

and will try for more later



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1802</b></font><br><br>



on.  I  think this is a diplomatic way of  getting

things  done as we are just a new nation with  new

citizenship rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on internal security, I think we must

accept  the  present arrangement as  being  better

than  the one offered last year, because  we  have

three-three  membership  on  the  Council  with  a

Minister  from  our  neighbour  and  friend,   the

Federation, having the casting vote. As the people

of  the  Federation and Singapore are one and  the

same, I am sure the Federation Minister will  take

the side of Singapore and not the colonial power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, even after this provision, I do not

think   we  are  getting  real  freedom  at   all.

Definitely  not.  You  will  never  get  it,   for

Singapore  is  a strategic base to  England.  They

will  try  to  keep  Singapore  by  one  means  or

another. But there is a way out, the only way, and

that  is to merge with the Federation. It  is  the

only  way;  there  is no other.  We  do  not  know

whether   the   Federation   has   a   gentleman's

understanding with the United Kingdom or a written

agreement  which  lets  the  Federation  get   its

freedom  but leaves Singapore in British hands.  I

do  not  know; nothing has been disclosed. But  in

diplomacy,  everything  is  possible.  And  it  is

possible that even if we merge, England will still

demand  the use of Singapore for defence  purposes

but  in  other  respects - external affairs,  trade,

culture, internal security - we will be quite  free.

I  think it will be more becoming to do that  than

to remain in their hands, as we will be even under

the  new  constitution, because at every step  you

will have to consult the British High Commissioner

stationed  here,  and accept his advice.  Even  in

trade we will not be free. Why should this be  so?

They  will  control internal security and  defence

and external affairs. Why should they also have  a

say  in  trade?  This city exists  on  trade.  Why

should  we  have to consult the United Kingdom  on

it? And why should we also have to concede control

of cultural relations?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is, as I have said, no other

alternative in hastening the end of this  colonial

period. I must say that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1803</b></font><br><br>



there  is  a lot in what the Member for  Cairnhill

and  the Member for Tanjong Pagar said. We may not

agree  with their political views in some respects

or in many respects, but some points they make can

be  for the common good of Singapore and there  is

no  reason  why  we  should not  accept  them.  On

citizenship and immediate elections, for  example,

I  personally do not think that if the  Government

have  the will to hold elections quickly, we  need

wait beyond the end of 1957. We are now at the end

of  the  fourth  month of the  year  and  we  have

therefore  a full eight months left. If Government

want   to  hurry  and  if  all  the  Parties  want

Government to hurry, they can hold elections  very

easily. The Member for Tanjong Pagar mentioned six

months  for  the registration of voters.  How  can

this  be done? Of course there are 250,000  people

involved and there will be 51 constituencies,  but

you have a powerful Chinese Chamber of Commerce to

help  you out. I would suggest that the period  of

six  months can be cut to three or four.  If  that

can  be done, I think elections can easily be held

on  1st  January,  1958.  I  think  this  will  be

accepted by all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, let us read paragraph 54 on page 15:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was the view of the Singapore Delegation

that  elections under the extended franchise which

would result from their citizenship proposals  set

forth in paragraph 50 must precede the coming into

force of the new Constitution. We therefore agreed

that an exact date for the introduction of the new

Constitution  could  not  be  determined  at  this

stage, but that it should be brought into force on

a date after the 1st January, 1958."



<br><br>The  first  condition is that elections should  be

held before the new constitution comes into force,

and  it can be after 1st January, 1958. Cannot  we

set our hearts and minds - I think that will satisfy

everyone - to  work  so that we can  hold  elections

early  in 1958? (That is in January, not April  or

May, as  envisaged  by  the  Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar.)   I   am  sure  that  when  the  All-Party

Delegation  meet  again, they will  consider  this

point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1804</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, personally I am very unhappy about the

present Government. It is not a democratic one.  I

thought that during the Marshall period (not  that

I was against the Member for Cairnhill personally)

because  when votes were taken, there  were  three

Officials and four Nominated Members to say "yes";

but  they  carried  on although  they  were  in  a

minority.  Yes, you should shorten your  time  for

nomination and new elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Government expenditure has been top-heavy,

with so many Ministers and Assistant Ministers.  I

am  talking on the amendment, Sir, on the question

of  immediate  elections. Now, Sir, the  Hon. the

Chief  Minister, in the debate in which he  got  a

mandate,   said - as  he  says  even  now - that   his

Ministers  were feeling the strain  of  office.  I

cannot  understand  what  this  strain  is.  Three

Ministers   went  to  London  in   the   All-Party

Delegation,  and  while  they  were  absent,   the

Minister for Health also left Singapore for Japan.

Four Ministers were away at the same time.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I really cannot see how

those  remarks  are relevant to the motion  before

the   House,  which  is  in  connection  with  the

amendment moved by the Member for Cairnhill.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I will explain that very

easily.  The  amendment reads "nevertheless  calls

for  the  immediate  implementation  of";  I  want

immediate implementation of what we are given, and

that is what I am talking about, Sir. Why?-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That does not make the

Member's  remarks  in order  or  relevant  to  the

motion. The whole amendment must be read together.

The  whole  amendment  is to  insert  "regretfully

takes   note  of  the  Report  of  the   Singapore

Constitutional Conference, and nevertheless  calls

for   the  immediate  implementation  of  the  new

Constitution." I cannot see how the fact that  the

present Government, in the view of the Member,  is

top-heavy, has anything to do with the  Report  or

the amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1805</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I do not want to argue

with  the Chair at all, but what I still hold  is

that  if  my comments do not apply in that  case,

they  definitely do on the remarks  made  by  the

Hon. the  Chief Minister in this  debate  today,

that  he is not anxious to continue very long  as

Chief  Minister - and the Hon. the  Chief  Minister

meant his colleagues together with himself.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please continue on the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, my suggestion is this:

Form  an  interim government between now and  the

next  elections, an interim government  with  the

minimum  number  of Ministers  and  no  Assistant

Ministers. That will save the country  a  lot  of

expenditure, and one of their main tasks will  be

to  see  that  the  elections  are  held  at  the

earliest possible moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on citizenship for residents who have lived

here  for seven or ten continuous years, I  think

identity  cards, passports and other  records  at

the  Chinese Protectorate (I do not know  whether

it  is called by that name now) will provide  the

details required for registration. They have  the

records  of alien Chinese and others,  and  these

can  easily be compiled if there is a will to  do

so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was told by my legal adviser when I was

an active businessman that a lawyer wins half his

case by courtesy and goodwill, and the other half

by   legal  argument.  During  the  debate  which

unfortunately has taken an exciting turn  in  the

last  three  days, a challenge was  made  by  the

Member  for  Cairnhill. I hope he meant  that  he

will  oppose the Member for Tanjong Pagar at  the

new   elections  and  not  at  an  immediate  by-election.  Perhaps he made his challenge  in  the

heat  of the moment, when we are all apt  to  say

things  we  never intend to. In many  debates,  I

should at times have been the person most hurt by

the  remarks  of  the Member for Cairnhill,  but,

Sir, I never took them to be personal ones. As  I

said, sometimes we never mean  what  we  say  in

excitement.  I  take what is good  and  best  but

ignore the others. If a by-election



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1806</b></font><br><br>



does  not  take  place,   a   lot   of

expenditure will be saved to the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the end of my speech, I offer the

opinion  that,  in  order to  end  this  colonial

farce,   we   have   to   discard   the   present

constitution as early as possible. The  only  way

is   not   to   put  off  arguments,   as   again

consultations  may have to take  place  with  the

United  Kingdom, entailing more delay. We  should

accept  what we have obtained and fight for  more

while  we  see to it that elections are  held  as

early as possible.



<br><br>11.18 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Friday was indeed

a  sad day for us on this side of the House,  for

we  saw  one who began by doing so much good  for

Singapore  now trying to tear up something  which

his   colleagues   had   achieved,   instead   of

congratulating  them on their success.  Sir,  the

Member for Cairnhill on Friday set himself up  as

a  champion of the "decent inarticulate people of

Singapore", but he failed to tell us, or  produce

any  evidence to show, how these people  conveyed

to him their opinion that it was "tiga suku busok

merdeka"  which the delegation brought back  from

London,  that  the mission had sold Singapore  to

the  British  colonialists - "sold  the  people  to

continued  colonialism", those  were  his  words.

Therefore,  in  the absence of any evidence  that

such  an  opinion  has been  expressed  by  these

"decent  inarticulate people", it must be assumed

that it is rather presumptuous on the part of the

Member  for Cairnhill to set himself  up  as  the

sole   champion  of  the  people  of   Singapore,

ignoring the fact that there are 24 other elected

representatives   in   this   House   who   think

otherwise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Why not wait till the by-election?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the Member for

Cairnhill  is a brilliant lawyer and, as  is  the

practice  with  any  brilliant  lawyer  when   he

addresses a jury - a group of laymen - he started off

his arguments with a barrage of words. He built a

vast edifice of words but what does



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1807</b></font><br><br>



that  vast  edifice hold in genuine, valid  arguments?

Sir, when I heard him for the first hour and a half, I

thought,  "We are sunk; the mission must  have  really

failed." Hearing him admonish the delegation on  their

failure,  Sir, I never expected to find that,  instead

of  producing a lion of a case, he could bring  out  a

mouse,  a  mouse  created by his own  fancy,  a  mouse

existing only in his own imagination. Sir, I am not an

eminent lawyer like the Member for Cairnhill. I am not

a  lawyer at all, but perhaps at this time, it is more

to my advantage that I am not, because I do not let my

imagination run wild.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member quoted extensively from the two

Reports,  the one presented by the present  delegation and  the other by last year's delegation. At the  time

the  Member  spoke, I did not have last year's  Report

with  me, but having been a member of that delegation,

the  facts  stood out very clearly in  my  mind.  Sir,

there  are  13 Members of this Assembly  who  were  in

London  in  April and May last year, and they  do  not

have  to  read  reports  to remember  what  transpired

there.  They  went through heart-breaking moments  and

the  memory of every single moment and day stands  out

vividly  in  their minds. But just out  of  curiosity,

Sir,  I dug up last year's Report to compare what  the

Member  for Cairnhill said with what is contained  in

the Report. And this is what I found.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first attack of the Member on the present Report

was  on  the internal security arrangements. Paragraph

26 (i) on page 6 was read out:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"to consult on all questions of policy relating to

the maintenance of public safety and public order;".



<br><br>The Member for Cairnhill did not dispute that. He said

he was happy to consult, to learn from anybody. But he

hotly disputed paragraph 26 (ii) :



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"to maintain the efficiency of all organs of the

Singapore    Government   concerned   with    internal

security:".



<br><br>And  the  basis of his criticism that the mission  had

sold the people of Singapore to eternal colonialism (I

am  not  sure whether he used the word "eternal")  was

because the Internal Security Council



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1808</b></font><br><br>



was  to maintain the efficiency of all organs  of

the   Singapore  Government  concerned  with  internal

security. Now, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill also told

us  about his talk with Sir John Nicoll, when Sir John

tried  to  persuade him to let the colonial  officials

pass  the  Emergency Regulations so that  the  elected

Members  would not get the blame from the public;  the

Member mentioned before once in this Assembly that  he

refused   to  hide  behind  the  skirts  of   colonial

officials.  That  same argument he has  now  used  for

refusing  to accept the paragraph indicating that  the

United  Kingdom  Government does not  wish  subversive

elements  to  take part in the first  elections.  Here

again,  his  argument is that it is the  duty  of  the

elected representatives of the people of Singapore  to

ban  subversives  from standing for election,  but  he

cannot accept a ban imposed by the colonial power.  He

cannot  accept an imposition from the colonial  power,

neither  can  he accept hiding behind  the  skirts  of

colonial  officials. But if you look at the Report  of

last  year's  mission, Sir, this is exactly  what  was

offered and what the delegation, led by the Member for

Cairnhill, was  prepared to  accept.  If  the  United

Kingdom  Government had agreed then  to  a  Federation

Minister  sitting  on  the Consultative  and  Advisory

Council,  last  year's  delegation  were  prepared  to

accept  Orders in Council made by the colonial  power,

not  by, for example, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,  who

is  to  be  a Malayan. Our mission, Sir, has therefore

achieved something more. On the point which the Member

for  Cairnhill  has been arguing about all  the  time,

that  this Internal Security Council is going to force

us  to acts which we do not like, Sir, if we are going

to  face  our responsibilities squarely, it is  better

for  us  that the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, who will  be

Malayan-born,    and    not   the    United    Kingdom

representative, should carry out all acts required  in

the  interests  of  internal security.  I  put  it  to

Members:  Which is less evil? Is it better for  us  to

carry  out  those acts ourselves, or is it  better  to

give  the powers to the United Kingdom Government,  as

agreed to by last year's delegation?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1809</b></font><br><br>



Then, Sir, on paragraph 26 (iii), it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"to ensure equal access by both Governments to

the   services  of  these  organs   and   to   all

information at their disposal."



<br><br>This,  says  the Member for Cairnhill, means  that

colonial spies can pry into our affairs. But  what

was  offered  to  and, in fact,  accepted  by  the

mission  of  last  year? Footnote  (iii)  of  last

year's Report, page 69, reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The arrangements proposed in paragraph (14) are

on  the  understanding that, the High Commissioner

would  have  on  his staff a Liaison  Officer  who

would  have  unrestricted access to the  Singapore

Police  Force and such other facilities  as  would

enable  him  to  keep  the High  Commissioner,  as

Chairman  of the Defence and Security Council,  in

day  to  day  touch  with  the  internal  security

situation"-



<br><br>not external defence, Sir. So what is provided for

in  the present Report, paragraph 26 (iii), is  in

fact  a  lesser  evil than the provision  in  last

year's  Report, a provision which would have  been

accepted  had  the  United  Kingdom  agreed  to  a

Federation Minister as the balancing power sitting

on   the   Council.   Last  year's   Report   said

"unrestricted access"; the present Report says "to

ensure equal access".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Cairnhill attacked paragraph

40  of  the present Report, page 10. In  cases  of

external defence,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;". . .the Chairman of the Security Council would

also  have the power to advise the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara  to  reserve  the Bill  for  Her  Majesty's

pleasure,  and  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  should

then be obliged to do so."



<br><br>The  Member  attacked  this provision  as  another

instance  where the colonial power  had  the  last

say.  Sir, the same provision is contained in last

year's  Report, in paragraph (22) of  Annexure  L,

page 69:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The High Commissioner normally to exercise his powers in

respect  of assent to bills in accordance with the advice of

Ministers, but  to  be  required to  reserve  for  Her

Majesty's  pleasure any bill which in the  opinion

of the Defence and Security Council-"



<br><br>mind  you,  the  "Defence and  Security  Council",

which  was to have been a body weighted in  favour

of the United Kingdom-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1810</b></font><br><br>



"prejudices   the   exercise  of   Her   Majesty's

Government's  responsibilities  in  the  field  of

external defence and external affairs."



<br><br>So  there again you have the offer that was  given

to  us.  On  the  advice  of  the  United  Kingdom

weighted body, all Bills which they considered  as

touching   upon  external  security  and  external

defence   would  have  to  be  reserved  for   Her

Majesty's  Government's pleasure. In  the  present

case,  of course, the advice is given by a Malayan

weighted  body,  a  body on which  the  Federation

Minister  holds  the balance of  power.  Which  is

better - I put it to you?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, we come to the contention: in the last

constitutional talks there was no  such  thing  as

internal  security. That was purely  a  matter  of

external defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you look at the last delegation's Report

(Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 31 of 1956) at page  52,

Annexure I, paragraph (3) (c) says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The preservation or restoration of public

safety  or  public  order and the  maintenance  of

essential supplies and services, to the extent  to

which  they  relate  to  matters  referred  to  in

paragraph  (a) or paragraph (b) of this definition

or   to  external  affairs  as  defined  in   this

subsection."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And paragraph (a) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The provision, construction, maintenance,

security,  staffing, manning and use of  defences,

equipment,  establishments and communications  for

the naval, military or air security of any part of

the   Commonwealth   (including   the   State   of

Singapore)."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph (b) says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The organisation, armament, control and

discipline of, and the furnishing of supplies  to,

and  transportation  of naval,  military  and  air

forces  of  the  Commonwealth (other  than  forces

raised by the State of Singapore)."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Sir, means that in every Bill there could

have  been control exercised by the United Kingdom

High   Commissioner  or  by  the  United   Kingdom

Government  on the advice of a Council  which  was

weighted with United Kingdom interests. Sir,  that

is not only my opinion, but that is the opinion of

the  ex-Chief  Minister himself and of  the  whole

delegation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 72 of last year's Report, paragraph 3

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The suggestion that Her Majesty's Government

should  have  overriding powers  to  legislate  by

Order in Council and emergency



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1811</b></font><br><br>



regulations through their High Commissioner in the

extremely    wide    fields    indicated,    after

consideration by the Defence and Security  Council

on  which  they have the majority vote, is  wholly

repugnant to the Delegation...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then at page 14, at the top, it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The general reservation of Imperial Legislative

Powers covered practically every field of activity

in the territory...".



<br><br>And  here  now  we  are  trying  to  differentiate

between  the  Internal Security  Council  and  the

External  Defence  and Security  Council  and  why

there should be an Internal Security Council;  but

what  in  fact was the Council that was mooted  at

the  last  meeting was an all-controlling  Council

which  controlled  both.  That  was  the  deciding

factor  on  borderline cases of what comes  within

internal  security and what impinges  on  external

defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member's arguments have all the

time  been based on what was offered and that  the

present delegation had got far less than what  was

offered. But of course the Member will not  forget

those  memorable days, especially the  day  before

the  talks  broke down, when he called  a  hurried

meeting  at No. 10 Carlton House Terrace  and  put

his  idea  across that the talks  could  still  be

saved if we agreed to a new proposal, and that was

that   the  Federation  Minister  should  be   the

deciding  voice  on  this  Council.  He  will  not

forget,  Sir, how he went and begged the Secretary

of State to accept this proposal and how anxiously

we  waited  for  him to hear the  result  of  that

meeting.  Sir,  if  the  Secretary  of  State  had

accepted  that proposal, it would not  have  given

something  more  than what the present  delegation

has  achieved. In fact, we would still  have  been

given  something less. We would then  have  had  a

Council  which  was  weighted  by  the  Federation

Minister as it is now, but a Council that is  only

advisory, whereas now the Council is executive. It

carries out what it thinks should be done. In  the

other  case,  the  Council would still  have  been

advisory.  The executive power to carry out  would

have  been  with the United Kingdom Government  to

make  Orders in Council above our heads and  above

the heads of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1812</b></font><br><br>



elected  representatives. Then again the  Advisory

Council  might  give  advice  which  is   to   our

interests  but  which  is not  to  United  Kingdom

interests  and the United Kingdom would not  carry

it out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no one disputes the fact that what the

present   delegation   has   achieved    is    not

independence.  No one says it is independence.  In

fact,  the delegation never set out with the  idea

of  achieving  independence,  as  the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar has clearly pointed out.  In  fact,

one  of  the most bitter arguments which the  last

delegation  had  was  wherein  lay  the  sovereign

power, as the Member for Tanjong Pagar has told us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill recounted that

there  were  three independent countries - Honduras,

the   Lebanon  and  Paraguay - which  were  slightly

larger than Singapore in population and there were

many independent countries which were smaller than

Singapore  in population, and there were  so  many

other independent countries which had less revenue

than Singapore has, and therefore there was a good

case  for Singapore to be independent amongst  the

nations of the world. But one thing the Member for

Cairnhill forgets, Sir, and that is size. Size  is

very  significant, Sir, when it comes to  thinking

of independence. Size matters because your economy

is  governed to a large extent by the size of  the

land  you  have. Without land you  cannot  have  a

basic  economy, and without a basic  economy,  you

cannot  carry  out the functions  of  a  sovereign

State.  You will not have the resources to provide

for  your  own defence. There are a lot of  things

which  are  required  of a  sovereign  State,  and

therefore  our  destiny should lie towards  merger

with  the Federation. Sir, we are an island  which

has  been  politically cut off from the  mainland,

and the only way we could achieve independence  is

by  merger with the Federation and nothing  should

be  done  to  jeopardise the  chances  of  such  a

merger. This constitutional advance is not an end.

It  is  only a transitional stage until such  time

as,  by  merger,  Singapore becomes  part  of  the

Federation. Sir, we are today in a very ridiculous

position, a small speck on the map, a tiny  island

of  225  square miles having a government  of  its

own;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1813</b></font><br><br>



having  Ministers.  It is a ridiculous  situation,

Sir, I suggest. By right we should be part of  the

Federation.  If  it  had not  been  for  political

necessity of the United Kingdom - I do not know what

they  had in mind - we would probably have been part

of the Federation by now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill also mentioned

that   it  is  fashionable  now  to  become   pro-colonialists.  It is not so, Sir. It  was  perhaps

fashionable  before  to go  star-gazing,  Sir,  to

dream  of  things which, due to our limitation  of

size  and population and resources, we could never

achieve.  The fashion now is to be more practical,

to  get  what  we  can manage,  and  to  work  for

something  more,  and that can  only  be  done  by

merging with the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was an attack made by the hon. Member

on  the  appointment of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

being  a  Malayan-born.  I considered,  Sir,  that

"Malayan  born" offers a much smaller  field  than

"Malayan".  First  of  all,  there  is  no  proper

definition  yet of what and who is  a  Malayan.  I

read  in  the Press yesterday of somebody,  not  a

Malayan  in  the real sense of the word,  who  has

been here for 32 years and who has amassed a great

amount of wealth, a million dollars, or perhaps it

was $5 million, and he derided all this talk about

merdeka;  and  yet  that man can  claim  to  be  a

Malayan, because he has been here for 32 years. If

the delegation had said "Malayan", the field would

have  been  more wide open than it is  at  present

when the delegation has accepted "Malayan born" as

the  guiding factor. The Member for Cairnhill  was

afraid  that  under  "Malayan born",  Her  Majesty

could  appoint  a European who was not  a  genuine

Malayan,  but the same thing could happen  if  the

word  had  been "Malayan" and not "Malayan  born".

There are so many Europeans who are Malayans,  but

our  guiding principle is a ten-year qualification

for citizenship -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Sir, the argument was not that the

word should have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1814</b></font><br><br>



"Malayan",  but that it should have  been  on  the

advice of the Singapore Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the Member for Cairnhill

has  had experience as Chief Minister and he knows

full  well that these are legal phrases  and  that

normally it is the practice always to consult  and

get advice from the Government concerned. That  is

so  even  in  smaller things and not only  in  big

things  like appointing a Head of State. There  is

always consultation, and advice is asked for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also mentioned that the Colonial

Office was repugnant to us and I admit that it  is

so  to all of us, but I must remind him that  when

he  brought  up  a motion on this subject  at  the

Labour Front annual conference I queried the  word

"acceptable" (he used the phrase "not acceptable")

and  said  that it should be changed to desirable,

and  he  made  it clear that the word "acceptable"

was  to be regarded flexibly and not to be carried

to  the point of breaking down the talks, and then

I withdrew my objection, so that I do not see that

that  is  a  point on which he could now criticise

the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last word, Sir. The hon. Member mentioned

that  Singapore could be put under the control  of

the  United  Nations. Sir, at this time  when  all

Asians  are  looking  with  interest  to  what  is

happening  in Egypt, which is trying to  keep  the

Suez  Canal Zone free from international  control,

that suggestion from the Member for Cairnhill does

not come at the right moment. What would happen if

you  had  international control  in  Singapore?  I

would  not like to think of it. Perhaps the Member

for  Tanjong Pagar has aptly described what  would

happen. Sir, I therefore oppose the amendment.



<br><br>11.45 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   the  debate  in  this  Assembly  today   is

concerned with two questions. These are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Has the All-Party Constitutional Delegation

to  London  abided by the principles contained  in

the All-Party



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1815</b></font><br><br>



White  Paper which was presented before this House  at

the last sitting in March?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Does this House support the stipulation by Lennox-Boyd that detainees under the Public Security

Ordinance cannot take part in the first election under

the new constitution?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first question, Sir, if a study is made of the

White   Paper  drawn  up  by  the  All-Party   Merdeka

Conference  and  the  report of  the  results  of  the

constitutional conference in London, it  can  be  seen

that  there has been no essential departure  from  the

mandate  which this House gave the mission  before  it

left  for  London, excepting, of course, the notorious

restriction on detainees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the Rendel Constitution, Sir, the

concessions  which  have been  made  by  the  Colonial

Office at this second Merdeka Conference represent  an

advance.  However, it must be clearly recognised  that

the  results achieved do not in any way mean  that  we

have  achieved  independence, as  the  Federation  has

done.  No  State  can be independent so  long  as  its

external  defence and foreign affairs  are  under  the

control  of  the imperial power. Further, as  long  as

external  defence  is  in the hands  of  the  Colonial

Office,  then  there will always be the argument  that

the preservation of internal security is pre-requisite

to   the  maintenance  of  external  defence.  It  was

precisely this point which caused the breakdown of the

first  Merdeka  Conference. Under these circumstances,

Sir, the best possible solution was the setting up  of

an Internal Security and Defence Council consisting of

three  Singapore  Ministers, one Federation  Minister,

and  three British members. It has been quite  obvious

that  the consent of the Federation Government to  sit

on  this  Council was a vital factor in the successful

conclusion   of   Singapore's  second   constitutional

conference  and preventing a repeat deadlock  of  last

year.  For  us  in Malaya, Sir, this  gesture  of  the

Federation Government is a happy omen. The time is not

distant  when  Singapore and the  Federation  will  be

united as one independent country.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1816</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the net gain of the second Merdeka

Conference?  It is this, Sir. In future this  Assembly

will be filled with the elected representatives of the

people, a Cabinet to be drawn from our own people, and

with power to formulate policies on internal affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we come to the second problem which faces

this House today. If we believe in a democratic system

of  government, then we cannot accept the  restriction

on   political  detainees  taking  part  in  the  next

election.  We oppose the last-minute clause thrown  by

the  Colonial Secretary at our Merdeka Delegation.  We

oppose it on principle, Sir. It is undemocratic. Until

a  man's guilt is proved in a court of law, we  should

not  penalise him in this way. As far as  I  can  see,

what  the Colonial Office has offered us is a  durian.

The  fruit inside is the new constitution. The  thorny

skin  outside  is the restricted clause  on  detainees

taking part in the next election.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> What about the smell?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Good smell. Does the Colonial

Office expect us to eat the skin as well as the fruit?

We  decidedly  will not eat the skin.  Sir,  my  Party

therefore   support  the  stand   of   the   All-Party

Delegation and oppose the amendment of the Member  for

Cairnhill.



<br><br>11.52 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam (Pasir Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

anyone  who has been listening to the eloquent  speech

made by the Member for Cairnhill, has watched the fine

performance  made  by  him  before  this  House,   and

subsequently heard his arguments torn to shreds bit by

bit,  would possibly have come to the conclusion  that

the  Member for Cairnhill might have been reciting the

dialogue of an act instead of making a speech  on  the

motion before the House. Unfortunately, Sir, his power

of  reasoning  does  not equal  his  art  of  oratory,

otherwise  we  would have been spared  the  ordeal  of

hearing his four-hour speech of distorted views.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have not over-ruled the word

"distorted" up to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1817</b></font><br><br>



now, but in this context I think I must do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> I respectfully withdraw it.

Sir.  The  delegation  has obtained  all  that  is

required  in the mandate, and although the  Member

for Cairnhill was with us in five out of the seven

meetings  held by the All-Party Merdeka Conference

called  by  the  Chief  Minister  to  discuss  the

mandate  for  the  London  Delegation,  I  do  not

recollect  an instance where he had put  up  those

points  which he made in his speech,  nor  had  he

opposed the agreement reached. Neither have I seen

any   statement  voicing  his  opposition  to  the

mandate  since his return from Borneo.  Since  the

hon.  Member wishes us to believe that he  has  so

much of the interests of the country at heart, why

did  he  not return to Singapore on or before  the

5th of March?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I was never told.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Anyway, he should have known

about  it. He should have given to this House  his

expert  opinion. Instead he chooses to blame  this

House  for not lengthening the debate to suit  his

personal convenience. In this respect, Sir,  I  am

reminded  of a page in the history of China  of  a

man  by  the  name of Ju. He lived in China  3,000

years ago. This man was entrusted with the duty of

alleviating  the flood of the Yellow River  Basin.

It  took him ten years to complete the job. During

this  period he passed his house three  times.  He

could  have  taken the opportunity  to  visit  his

family,  but  he did not. He considered  that  his

duty  towards the State should supersede  that  of

his  own,  and  yet here we find  the  Member  for

Cairnhill  today  choosing  to  go  to  Borneo  in

Singapore's  hour  of need to  seek  for  personal

gain.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know how that is

relevant  to the motion. The fact that the  Member

for  Cairnhill goes to Borneo or any part  of  the

world cannot have any relevance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> I was replying to the Member

for Cairnhill, Sir, the reason for doing it. Is he

the  man whom he purports to be, or is he the  man

who says in his heart, "I, the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1818</b></font><br><br>



Cairnhill,  the first Chief Minister of Singapore,

leader  of the 1956 delegation to London,  willing

to  stoop  at  the feet of Nehru, and have  shaken

hands  with Chou En-lai - I do not agree  with  the

agreement.  How  dare the present Chief  Minister,

who has untactfully admitted in public that he was

a  clerk,  and  will be a clerk all his  life,  do

something  which I did not do." All this,  Sir,  I

can  sum  up in two words - sour grapes, and nothing

else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of last year's delegation, I would

like  to  congratulate the Chief Minister and  the

members of his delegation for the good work  done.

They have succeeded where we failed. This success,

Sir,  I  understand, has been due to the  complete

unity in the All-Party Delegation in London, and I

hope this unity will prevail in this House on  all

future issues of national importance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Party is also glad to note that, in spite of

paragraph  30  of the Report, the  delegation  has

signed  the  Report instead of coming home  empty-handed  or  called a Press conference  and  begged

Lennox-Boyd  to open the negotiations again.  They

do  it  because  they are realistic.  They  do  it

because, unlike the Member for Cairnhill, they  do

not  believe in miracles in this atomic age.  They

believe  that  a  small house is  better  than  no

house, although everyone of us would like to  live

in a palace if we could afford one.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Otherwise in a pig sty.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Even that is better than no

house. Apart from this paragraph 30 of the Report,

I  think  the  constitution  which  we  have  been

promised  not the only one we could ever  hope  to

get  from Britain today, but a very practical  one

for Singapore at this stage of development - an area

of 235 square miles with a population of one and a

quarter  million. So until the merger of Singapore

with  the Federation is a fact, we might be forced

by circumstances to leave the question of defence to Britain. We, the Alliance in Singapore, will do

our  best to make such a merger possible and  will

leave   no   stone  unturned  to  remove  whatever

obstacles there are in the way.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1819</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to this paragraph 30, of which we have

heard  so  much lately. I do not see what  Britain

and  the Government of Singapore could expect from

it.  The  imposition of this condition by  Britain

will only create heroes out of those who are being

detained - that is in the eyes of a section  of  the

people only -

<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Martyrs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> But after close examination,

these  so-called heroes, or martyrs  as  what  the

Member  for  Cairnhill has just said, may  not  be

heroes  after all. They may be rogues in  disguise

seeking for personal gain. In saying this, Sir,  I

am  not  doubting the wisdom of the Government  at

all in issuing those Detention Orders. In fact,  I

am one who always advocates for it. What I mean to

convey  to  this House is this: that  we  are  not

frightened to fight the election side by side with

them, and if they are hypocrites or imposters,  we

can  always expose them, for we believe that right

will ultimately triumph over evil.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question on which I would like to touch is

the  question  of  residential  qualification  for

citizenship.  Although  this  question  has   been

agreed to by all Parties concerned, including  Her

Majesty's   Government,  but  in   view   of   the

recommendations  of the Reid Commission  published

lately,  I  wonder  whether the  Government  could

bring  the  matter  in  line with  the  Federation

today - that is, eight years instead of  ten.  If  a

man  is  considered fit enough to be a citizen  of

the  Federation, there is no reason why he  should

not  be fit for Singapore. Numerous editorials  in

the Chinese Press have been clamouring for such  a

reduction,   and   I  hope  the   Government,   in

consultation  with all the Parties  concerned  and

Her  Majesty's Government, will do their  best  to

accede  to  the request. For the reasons  which  I

have  just explained, I oppose the amendment moved

by the Member for Cairnhill.



<br><br>12.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

distressed that the debate that should  have  been

concerned with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1820</b></font><br><br>



triumph  of  the All-Party Delegation in  bringing

back  a new Constitution for Singapore, should  be

in  danger  of being remembered as the tragedy  of

the  Member for Cairnhill. Let me dwell first, and

at  greater length, on the triumph, at the risk of

some inevitable repetition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister has rightly and

properly  emphasised that this is not a Government

motion  which  the Member for Cairnhill  seeks  to

amend,  but an All-Party motion. That  is  of  the

greatest importance. The major Parties - the  Labour

Front,      the      Liberal-Socialists,       the

M.C.A.-U.M.N.O.-Alliance, the P.A.P. (I put them in

alphabetical  order) - reached  agreement   on   the

policy  to be adopted in London, submitted  it  to

this  Assembly  for unanimous approval,  including

the  Member for Changi, went to London and brought

back   what  is  virtually  a  hundred  per   cent

acceptance -



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> - of the mandate given to it. For the

first  time  in these few years we as an  Assembly

have  shown  that  when national  matters  are  at

stake, wise leadership can produce and maintain  a

united  front.  Sir,  one of  the  characteristics

which  have made the British parliamentary  system

workable in Britain is this ability to rise  above

party  when  national  honour  is  paramount   and

national solidarity essential. The success of  the

All-Party   Delegation  is   evidence   that   the

democratic  system  can  work  in  a  multi-racial

Singapore  as  well as in homogeneous  Britain.  I

believe  this  to  be  a matter  of  the  greatest

significance for the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that two months ago the

possibility of success was assailed by three grave

doubts: firstly, the deep concern of the Malays as

to their position in a future Singapore; secondly,

whether  Britain  could possibly accept  a  three-three-one Security Council; and, thirdly,  whether

a  Malayan-born  as  Head  of  the  new  State  of

Singapore would be conceded.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1821</b></font><br><br>



First  of  all, diplomacy and good  sense  on  all

sides  resolved the not unreasonable  perturbation

of  the  Malays before the conclusion of the  All-Party Conference, and I do not think enough credit

has  been given to the Malay leaders for the  part

they played, nor to the national party unity which

helped to influence them. At all events, the first

section  of the Report after the declaration  that

Singapore shall be known as the State of Singapore

protects  Malay and minority interests.  Let  that

not lightly be forgotten.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Her Majesty's Government accepted the

principle  that  Singapore Ministers  should  have

"full responsibility for maintaining internal  law

and order and preventing subversion" in section 24

of  this Report which the Member for Cairnhill has

sought to ignore or belittle. And furthermore  Her

Majesty's  Government accepted the principle  that

in  cases  of  doubt the Federation representative

should  be  the deciding voice. On  this  point  I

agree  with  the Member for Tanjong Pagar  and  my

colleague  the  Member for Paya  Lebar  that  this

decision  may  well be of historic importance  for

Malaya  and  for South-East Asia,  and  reveals  a

perspicacity of which we are all as yet not  fully

aware.  For  I  believe with my hon. Friends  that

there  has been forged with the Federation a  link

the  strands  of  which  are  at  present  largely

invisible;  and it is on this point alone  that  I

would  accept  the fact that our new  constitution

must  be  delayed,  if absolutely  essential,  for

about another year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because in another year the new State across the

causeway  will be eight months old, and I  venture

to  suggest  that  by  then the  attitude  towards

Singapore  at present prevailing in some  quarters

there may be beginning to change. And in two years

from  now,  as  the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  has

pointed out, general elections will be held in the

Federation.  So  our  gratitude  must  go  to  the

Federation  for the part they have played  in  our

Security  Council. May I at the same time  suggest

this to the Hon. the Chief Minister - that he should

not press the question of a merger with undue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1822</b></font><br><br>



haste?  Through  his diplomacy  he  has  laid  the

foundation-stone     in     having      Federation

representation on the Security Council.  Let  that

stone have time to settle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third hurdle was establishing that the Yang

di-Pertuan   Negara  should  be   a   Malayan-born

representative  of the Queen to be recommended  by

the   Singapore   Government  to   Her   Majesty's

Government. The Member for Cairnhill made  foolish

play  with  the idea that Her Majesty's Government

will  impose Englishmen born in this country on  a

self-governing Singapore. I do not believe for one

moment  that  any Englishman, however  Malayan  he

might  be, who understands the trends of the times

in  Asia, would accept this notion as feasible  or

appropriate. And so let us give credit  where  it

is  due. Her Majesty's Government has agreed to  a

Malayan being appointed Yang di-Pertuan Negara  in

a  not fully independent State as a completely new

departure.  That is another reason why  this  All-Party  motion should be regarded as a triumph  for

the  unity  of  the All-Party Delegation  and  the

unanimity of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to what I have dubbed "the

tragedy of the Member for Cairnhill", and on  this

matter,  Sir,  I  promise to be as  brief  and  as

relevant as possible, because, Sir, it is  out  of

this tragedy that I hope will arise the victory of

democratic   principles   in   Singapore's   short

parliamentary history which he, for one, has  been

in  danger of destroying. Nothing has happened  in

the  last  week  which is more shocking  than  the

Member   for   Cairnhill's  repudiation   of   the

colleagues  whom he once led and on whose  loyalty

he  once  relied, a loyalty which we are told  was

strained   to  breaking  point.  The   P.A.P. is

concerned  with  the accusation  levelled  against

them,  that  they  double-crossed  the  people  of

Singapore;  they are well able to deal  with  that

themselves.  But what I am concerned with  is  the

setting   up   and  preservation   of   reasonable

standards  of conduct in Singapore's parliamentary

and  public  life.  Without  such  standards,   no

constitution, however liberal, can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1823</b></font><br><br>



survive. And so I find exceedingly distasteful the

holier-than-thou attitude in which the Member  for

Cairnhill is seeking to introduce in this House an

anti-corruption motion at this particular time.  I

will say no more than that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment calling for the immediate

implementation   of  a  constitution   which   the

proposer calls a fraud, and the seconder does not,

is  an  insult  to the intelligence  of  the  hon.

Members  of  this House. I repudiate  it  and,  in

doing  so,  I shall vote for the All-Party  motion

forged   out   of  national  unity  and   national

determination  for the future prosperity  of  this

country. I shall vote for the triumph and not  for

the tragedy.



<br><br>12.11 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

one  Honourable Minister said that  Friday  was  a

very  sad day, a sad day indeed for the Government

especially  when they were met with  guns  booming

over his head from his own side. It reminds me  of

those  days in Singapore when we tried to  put  up

our  defences  in front and guard  our  sea  coast

properly,  and then the attack came  from  behind,

from Johore, which was not guarded at all. It  was

a very sorrowful state of affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Friday, however, we should recollect what was

more  interesting. We had the Member for Cairnhill

talking  for four hours. The Chinese Press  called

it  "great fun". I read a translation. The Chinese

Press  said there was crying, wailing and laughing

for  four hours. "We had great fun." But I was not

convinced, Sir, that those four hours did any good

to  Singapore. Those four hours were more like  an

act  staged  for  the benefit  of  the  people  of

Singapore, to appeal to their hearts, to  stir  up

their emotions, rather than make them think,  make

them  use their heads to decide what was  good  or

what was bad. I listened very patiently I did  not

interrupt,  as  did at least one Member  interrupt

whenever  other  Members spoke.  I  listened  very

carefully and I summed it up when I was  asked  my

opinion as to what I thought



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1824</b></font><br><br>



about  it.  I said, "Yes, it was very interesting.

It was just like a very large sponge cake," and  I

said that if we reduced it to size to see how much

substance we could get out of it, it would be like

the  size  of the cube of sugar which I showed  in

the  C.P.A. room. All that substance during  those

four hours! It was very disappointing, Sir, It was

indeed a good way of wasting time. It was indeed a

good  way  of wasting other people's useful  time.

The way how the debate was not allowed to continue

after  the  motion of interruption  was  again  an

obstructive move, a move-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think any hon. Member is

entitled to comment on the conduct of another hon.

Member if he acts strictly within his own Standing

Orders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Thank you for your guidance,

Sir.  We  will go on to other relevant things.  It

may  not be the conduct in this Assembly,  but  it

may be the conduct in connection with the office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this year the Merdeka Mission went to

London  with  a very much reduced membership,  not

13,  not that unlucky number, but five. It did not

go  in  little batches - some going in the  morning,

others in the afternoon; some by one plane, others

by  another - but  they went all  together,  as  one

single delegation. One hon. Member wanted to  join

the  delegation. Unfortunately, however, the  All-Party  Conference thought otherwise, and I suppose

that  has some bearing on this debate here, making

it more prolonged than ever. I have always thought

that  man in this world should not look at himself

and try to shower honours on himself, but whenever

another man can do something good and worth  while

for  other people, we should give him the  credit.

This  personality cult should not  be  allowed  to

disturb  what is good for the whole of  Singapore.

It  should be removed so that the people here  are

more  national conscious than self-conscious.  The

attitude of "I was not there; therefore it  cannot

be  good"  must  never  happen  here.  Leaders  of

Singapore should always set



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1825</b></font><br><br>



good  examples to those whom they want  to  follow

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was one of the members of last year's

delegation. I was one of the unlucky 13. Of course,

this  year  I went as one of the five  members.  I

suppose  those who were on last year's  delegation

as  well as this year's delegation can compare the

difference - the   difference  in  leadership,   the

reasonableness of the one who led us this year. We

could also note the difference in the calibre, the

steadfastness  on the one hand, knowing  where  we

were going and actually getting there, and on  the

other hand, the change of opinion from day to day,

from hour to hour. In fact, last year I never knew

what  surprises would be sprung on me. There  were

so  many things to do and we were kept very  busy.

We  had  the Merdeka Conference: we had  the  all-delegates'  conference; we had the Party  leaders'

conference;   we   had   the   Party    delegation

conference, and I suppose added to that a host  of

other conferences. We never knew at that time when

we  were supposed to sleep. Sometimes we might  be

called  up at ten o'clock, sometimes early in  the

morning,  sometimes late at night. Of course,  the

most  memorable one was at about two or three a.m.

and I had to say no to that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of leadership, Sir, is not one which

should be able to get the person concerned a great

deal of publicity in the newspapers, but one which

should give the maximum to the people whom he  has

proclaimed and sworn to serve. Of course this year

we  also have heard strange things, but last  year

we  went with a "very brave Chief Minister, a very

brave  leader", a leader who said, "I will  resign

if  I  cannot  get  what I want."  I  just  cannot

recollect  how many times that was  said.  I  kept

counting that every time, so that during the  last

days when a reporter asked me, "What are you going

to do if such a resignation should take place?", I

scratched my head and replied that I had heard  it

so many times, let me see that happen first.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have allowed a great deal

of  irrelevancies but I think that this particular

discussion of what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1826</b></font><br><br>



happened in London last year is becoming much  too

detailed to be relevant to the motion before us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  was  just comparing what we have got this  year

with  what we got last year. My theme was  whether

we  have got more or whether we have got less.  We

were  accused of getting less this year, so it  is

up  to us to tell the Member for Cairnhill that we

did  not  get less. We got a Christmas  cake  plus

something  else - the arsenic sauce, of  course,  we

left aside - until we have come to this Assembly  to

ask  whether  we should accept that; so  that  the

whole  theme then has been a matter of comparison.

The  leadership  last  year, Sir,  was  ferocious,

brave-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>2.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, last week,

reference was made to a number of animals, such as

the  lizard  of Cairnhill, made repeatedly  too  a

very   long   time  ago,  and  the  chameleon   of

Cairnhill. There was also the mouse with  Tolley's

brandy.  I find, Sir, that the Mission that  tried

to  get - as the Member for Cairnhill said - more than

what  the  Mission got this year tried a trick  on

the  lion. The mouse with two pegs of brandy  went

up  to  the  lion and said, "I will  bash  you  to

death." When the lion turned round and roared, the

mouse  did  not  ask,  "Where  is  the  lion?"  He

scurried into his hole. It reminds me rather, Sir,

of  a  more vivid illustration. Some people quoted

Chinese stories; others preferred Shakespeare, and

so  on,  but  I  have a simple story from  English

story  books  which is of a Malayan  character.  A

party that is going out lion hunting usually has a

pack  of  thoroughbreds to assist  them  in  their

work,   but   they  always  take   along   a   few

mongrels - one  or  two - in order  that  these  brave

little things might go forward barking at the  top

of  their  voices and when they detect  the  prey,

they  make  the  most of it. Now, that  was  their

usefulness.  However, when the lion  turns  around

and  roars,  then the mongrel - we call it  "pariah"

here - will  scuttle with his tail behind  his  hind

legs. I was just reminded of that story.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we come to the part of the motion that was

left  out  about the subversion clause.  You  have

heard  the Member for Cairnhill saying that he  is

for putting all subversives behind bars.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1828</b></font><br><br>



"Everyone here sheds crocodile tears", but  he  is

for   their  not  coming  out  to  contest   their

elections! I remember, Sir, that he, as the leader

of  the  Labour Front, in his proclamations during

the  elections,  said that that  Party  wanted  to

abolish  the Emergency Regulations. The  Emergency

Regulations were removed but in their  stead,  the

Preservation of Public Security Ordinance came in.

He  should  know that that was a better substitute

because, in essence, it seemed to have more effect

than the Emergency Regulations. Here is a conflict

of principle. The Party under him went against the

mandate he gave to the people and he was party  to

it.  Now,  he feels that they must be  allowed  to

contest elections and that this condition would be

much  better  done  by  the  Singapore  Government

itself  and  not imposed from without.  "Singapore

must  do  that!" So we will see how Singapore  did

that.  Last  May, there was a bloody riot.  People

were  killed and Singapore was turned  into  great

disorder.  [Interruption]  In  May  1955,  Sir. I

correct  myself.  That was  during  the  Hock  Lee

riots.  The then Chief Minister took stern action.

He  brought many people whom he suspected were not

doing  Singapore any good behind  the  bars.  Yes,

Singapore  must do it and the then Chief  Minister

did  it; but out came the unions, out came all the

other   organisations,  out  came   everybody   in

Singapore  and  they  stamped  their  feet.  These

elements    were   let   out,    and    let    out

unconditionally. Where, Sir, is the principle that

Singapore must do it and must do it under the then

Chief  Minister?  I find that there  is  too  much

contradiction in all these talks. At one time,  it

is  good  and at another time, it is not good!  At

one  time, something must be done one way  and  at

another  time, it cannot be done the same way!  It

is  very,  very difficult to understand, Sir.  The

illustration I have just given is a very good one.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Worthy of you.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Now, Sir, let us come again to

the  reception the people of Singapore had for the

Mission. The credit, of course - if there is so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1829</b></font><br><br>



much credit to give - goes to the Chief Minister. As

part  of  the  Mission, the leader gets  the  most

credit. I do not envy him. I think he deserves all

the  credit  he gets. The people of Singapore  did

not  come with banners and with brass bands. There

were  no  prancing lions along the  route  of  the

Merdeka Mission. However, there were no clashes on

the  padang,  not  like  the  clashes  at  Kallang

Airport. No words of dissension were said  before,

during and after the Mission as compared with  the

Mission last year. "The people were silent." I  do

not  think  that  that was quite right,  Sir.  The

people   were  very  happy.  I  could  see  smiles

everywhere,  and  I  would  like  the  Member  for

Cairnhill  to  know, Sir, that in the  East  here,

people are not just that expressive.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Is the Federation not in the East?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> They do not go in the street

embracing  and kissing one another to  show  their

love for one another. This is a thing of the West.

If  they  happen to be disappointed, as they  were

during the Japanese occupation of Malaya, they did

not  weep  or wail or gnash their teeth  or  stamp

their feet to show their disapproval. It was  just

silent  hatred.  You have to live here  very  long

before  you  can  know the real  feelings  of  the

people by observation. You have to look into their

eyes.  You have to look into their facial features

before  you can tell what they feel. As  a  person

who  knows this country and the people well enough

and  understands their traditions and cultures,  I

say  that the people rejoiced at the time when the

delegation returned. For a man, Sir, who  was  far

away  from Singapore and was not a witness at  the

scene  to  say, "Oh, that reception was poor,  the

people  were not happy. They were stonily silent,"

let  us  find out how much truth there is in  that

statement. How much can we believe it when  it  is

not first-hand news, not even second-hand news but

probably third-hand news?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the padang, as the Minister for Education

said,  there were a few boos. Yes, a few organised

boos for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1830</b></font><br><br>



Minister  for Education but a large proportion  of

the  people were just quietly happy. They approved

of what the delegation did. Their rejoicings could

only be known by any stranger outside this country

joining them in their small talk, although we know

it by observation. They were absolutely happy. The

majority of the people of Singapore are not of the

hooligan   type  who  wave  banners,   shout   and

misbehave themselves on the street. They are  just

quiet,  gentle, peace-loving people. In this,  the

Member for Cairnhill has erred. He has interpreted

it  wrongly and I know, no matter what he says the

people  of  Singapore know their minds. They  know

how  to  think with their heads and they  are  not

carried  away by emotion. In this House,  Sir,  we

too  must be credited with some ability to  think.

Orations that are good enough for juries  and  for

the masses who are roused by emotion should not be

used  here. We must be credited with brains to  be

able  to  be  here  to discuss things  sanely  and

quietly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill is very unhappy about

the  delay  in the coming elections. "It  must  be

done  very fast. It should be done in two  months'

time. We should make use of the identity cards and

then  ask these people to vote. You can do  it  in

two  months. You can do it in three months." I  do

not  know whether he said two or three months. But

it  is  a very short time. I suggest that we could

have  done it in a much shorter time and we  could

have had the elections today or we could have been

in  the  midst of an election today if the  advice

tendered  to  our then leader were accepted.  What

was  offered  last year was definitely  less  than

this year. We will say ten or fifteen percent less

but  still  there  was that offer.  We  advised  a

little  quiet and a little patience in order  that

negotiations could be carried on again sanely. The

talks  would not have broken down and if the talks

had not broken down, then today we would have been

having  an  elected  Assembly  consisting  of   50

Members. It was for 50 Members last year, Sir, and

we  would  not  now  be urging the  Government  to

shorten  the  period for the coming elections.  Of

course, it is said that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1831</b></font><br><br>



we  should give the people who are eligible  their

citizenship  rights. "We should give  them  voting

rights. We can prepare legislation for it. We have

that  ready.  We should introduce that  rightaway,

and in three Readings, we will get it over." If my

memory is correct, when I put the question to  the

Member  for  Cairnhill, who  was  then  the  Chief

Minister,   he  should  have  come  forward   and

introduced  that  Bill. As leader  of  the  Labour

Front and as the Chief Minister of the then Labour

Front   Coalition  Government,  he   should   have

introduced  that Bill in this Assembly.  We  would

have  been  saved all the trouble  of  wanting  to

introduce   it  now.  Mr  Lennox-Boyd   came   to

Singapore  in 1955 and after he left,  he  made  a

statement  in  the  Press  that  the  formula  for

citizenship  was agreed to and it was  within  the

power  of  the  Government to carry that  out.  We

waited,  waited  and  waited  and  we  found  that

nothing was done. No move was made until even June

or  July  last  year.  Now,  there  is  a  hurried

move - for we are persuaded to believe that there is

a  genuine  desire to give the right of voting  to

these  people rightaway. I cannot see how the  two

can  tally. Action and words at one stage  and  at

another  all go against one another. There  is  no

argument  in that at all, Sir. I wish that  people

are  more  genuine  when they put  forward  suggestions.  I wish that those who profess to  want  to

help the people and give them a better deal should

come out sincerely and do things instead of saying

things. Because of all this, Sir, I feel that  the

Member for Cairnhill is arguing against himself at

every  turn, on every point. I cannot see anything

right in the amendment. I oppose that amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, it has not been my practice to  jump

up  every  now  and  then to speak  unless  it  is

incumbent  upon  me  to  do  so.  I  have   always

endeavoured to emulate the wise old owl



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1832</b></font><br><br>



who  sat on the old oak tree, but listening to the

oration   of   the   Member  for  Cairnhill,   the

inconsistent balderdash-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am getting a little tired of

unparliamentary language and the hon. Member  must

know  that "balderdash" is unparliamentary. Please

withdraw it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> As it pleases you, Mr Speaker, but

listening  to the "inconsistencies in  support  of

the amendment".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill once asked me to withdraw

a  remark I made in this House about his proneness

in changing his conscience. I did not withdraw it.

I  do not withdraw it. In fact, I repeat it. I  do

not,  as  a  rule,  indulge in  personal  attacks.

Personal  attacks, unless justified,  are  weapons

which  should be below the dignity of a Member  of

this  House  to use, but one cannot remain  silent

when  our Chief Minister who, when the Member  for

Cairnhill  was Chief Minister, chose to  call  him

his  loyal friend and praised him to high  heaven,

but  now because our Chief Minister has done  more

in  the  few months than the Member for  Cairnhill

did  in 18 months; who did not create crises every

day  nor called upon his Ministers daily on  self-created  impending crises; who has led the Members

of  the Government calmly and steadily, instilling

that  feeling  of  confidence  in  the  people  of

Singapore  which  was missing immediately  before:

who  is an adept in strategy and does not have  to

kneel  at  the  feet of Nehru; who  knew  what  he

wanted  when he went to London this time with  the

All-Party  Delegation and got what  the  All-Party

Delegation  wanted in accordance with the  mandate

received from this House - perhaps in bitterness or

in aspiring to regain the power he wielded in this

House  in  those  days, the Member  for  Cairnhill

chooses to attack unfairly and unjustly - one cannot

then remain quiet. We are accustomed in this House

to  his  histrionics but the Member for  Cairnhill

has  certainly excelled himself this time  in  his

theatrical    abilities,   although    at    times

pathetically.  The  Member for Tanjong  Pagar  has

dealt with the fallacies of the arguments launched

by the Member for Cairnhill in detail and dealt



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1833</b></font><br><br>



with  the statements so loosely made by the Member

for Cairnhill effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of elections, Sir, any

suggestion  that  the Government  is  deliberately

holding  up is not true. The Government was  quite

ready   to   hold  the  elections  in  August   in

accordance   with   the  assurances   given.   The

Government proceeded to divide Singapore  into  51

divisions. The electoral roll was prepared. It was

the   All-Party   Delegation   who,   on   careful

consideration,  decided otherwise and  the  matter

was  brought  to  and debated in  this  House  and

received  unanimous approval. The reason  for  the

delay  was obvious. Do we want to give the 200,000

persons to enjoy the citizenship rights that  have

now  been  won for them and with those rights  the

opportunity   to  elect  a  new  Government.   The

decision on that point was unanimous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the date for these elections,

the time estimated by the Member for Tanjong Pagar

appears quite reasonable but Government will bring

about elections at the earliest opportunity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Member of the All-Party Delegation who went

to  London  last  May  and  knowing  exactly  what

happened, I can thoroughly endorse what the Member

for Tanjong Pagar has said. Yes, I went to the tea

party at Mr Lennox-Boyd's house after the failure

of  the  talks and so did our Minister for  Labour

and  Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock). We went as loyal

colleagues of the then Chief Minister and  as  the

only  Labour  Front Ministers there  to  give  him

cheer  although  we  knew  the  undesirability  of

reopening  the talks and what the ultimate  result

would   be.  He  knows  perfectly  well  that   in

accepting  collective  responsibility  how   loyal

every  one  on these Front Benches was in  lending

him  support. Is it not therefore a shame for  him

that  in  criticising the Clerks  Employment  Bill

which  places  the ceiling of $500  as  a  clerk's

salary,  when his attention was drawn to the  fact

that he as Chief Minister approved the Labour Code

which placed the ceiling at $400 he so glibly  and

shamefully put the blame on the shoulders  of  the

Minister for Labour-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1834</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There again, I think the hon.

Member  has erred by using the words "glibly"  and

"shamefully". Please withdraw those two words.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> As it pleases you. Mr Speaker, but

by  laying  the  blame  on the  shoulders  of  the

Minister  for Labour and Welfare, is it  therefore

not  understandable  that  when  he  tendered  his

resignation from the Labour Front, it was accepted

unanimously by the Central Committee?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my opinion that this amended motion was

brought  without any sane, reasonable and  careful

consideration. The arguments in support of it have

been  proved by more than one Member of this House

to  be fallacious. I naturally oppose it. Even the

seconder  who  feebly seconded the  motion  openly

disagreed  with  most  of  what  the  Member   for

Cairnhill   had   said.  He  probably   does   not

appreciate the significance of the original motion

but  says  that  he  seconds,  the  amendment  for

reasons of his own, which are by no means clear to

me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I first intended, Mr Speaker, Sir, to sit

quietly  and  vote  against  the  amended   motion

without  any  speechifying  but  now  I  find   it

necessary  to do so and in defence of the  attacks

so maliciously made.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the hon. Member also

withdraw the word "maliciously"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> As it pleases you, Mr Speaker, "so

wrongly made".



<br><br>2.59 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohamed Sidik bin Haji Abdul Hamid (Assistant Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Education (Inche Mohamed Sidik bin Haji Abdul Hamid):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we have been sitting here for the last  five

days  and  since last Friday we have been debating

on  the motion of the Hon. the Chief Minister  and

on  the  amendment  to  the motion  of  the  Chief

Minister by the Member for Cairnhill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you may remember at the last March sitting

that  the  All-Party Delegation  before  going  to

London  received  a  mandate from  this  House  to

proceed  to  London  for a  discussion  of  a  new

constitution for Singapore under the leadership of

the  Chief Minister. The All-Party Delegation have

done their best



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1835</b></font><br><br>



with sincerity and honesty, fighting for what they

had been asked to do and they have brought back to

us  what we wanted and they have tabled the Report

here  today  for our approval to the  points  they

have agreed upon with the British Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the debate, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill

has  objected  to the motion put up by  the  Chief

Minister  and moved an amendment to his motion  in

this House. Honestly, I believe, Sir, that the All-Party  Delegation have done what  they  have  been

told to do and returned to Singapore with what  we

have  asked  for.  To  my  surprise,  the  British

Government had imposed, in the second part of  the

motion,  a condition to prevent subversive persons

from taking part in the coming Singapore elections

under  the  new constitution. Sir, we have  proved

that  we  are  capable of fighting the subversives

ourselves.  As you will remember, Sir, during  the

riots  in  1956, we proved to the  world  that  we

could fight the subversives. I stand firmly behind

the  All-Party  Delegation for not  accepting  the

condition imposed by the British Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I come to the second part of the motion,

that  is,  the  amended motion by the  Member  for

Cairnhill.  He wanted this Government  to  have  a

general  election  as early as  possible.  I  have

heard  the views of several Members in this  House

that   it  is  impracticable  to  have  a  general

election within two or three months. I do  support

their  views,  Sir. I do not wish  to  further  my

speech  any more because I know that other Members

wish to speak too. Therefore, before I conclude my

speech, Sir, I strongly oppose the amendment.



<br><br>3.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this has been a

sad and exhausting session of the Assembly. It  is

sad  for  me personally, because it has  been  the

break   with  a  fairly  lengthy  association   in

politics with a man for whose abilities I have had

the greatest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1836</b></font><br><br>



admiration  but whose abilities are, I am  afraid,

being  wasted and stultified through acting  on  a

too hasty assessment of political realities; and I

have  been very unhappy during this debate to hear

the Member for Cairnhill exposing himself in every

aspect  to  attack,  showing  weaknesses  in   his

argument again and again and, at the same time, so

putting  his arguments and so allowing his oratory

to  flow,  that it was impossible for  Members  of

this  House - whatever  their  personal  feelings - to

refrain  from attacking him in reply.  It  is  not

enough that as Members of the House we should know

that he is wrong. We may know it, but we have  got

to give the answers so that everybody may know it;

and  in the process the hon. Member has had to  be

stabbed  again  and again by the  hard  points  of

facts.  We  have heard a great many facts  already

and I think I ought to give one or two more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a lengthy reference to the stony silence

of  the  people of Singapore on the return of  the

delegates  from  London which has been  contrasted

with  the glorious enthusiasm of the merdeka rally

at  the  Kallang  Airport a year  ago.  When  that

merdeka rally was first discussed, I warned  those

with  whom I was discussing it that it could be  a

very  dangerous occasion, and that to bring 10,000

or 20,000 or 50,000 people into a large open space

of  that  sort  meant that you had a  crowd  which

would be difficult to control. If you added to  it

impassioned  speeches, glamorous  flags,  all  the

arts  of rousing public feeling, stirring  up  the

crowd with music and songs and dances, cheers  and

catchwords  and cries of merdeka,  you  would  get

people  excited and you would get - not  a  rational

and  serious approach to the real problems  before

you - but  rather an emotional approach which  would

be  liable to explode into emotional action. Well,

we  got away with that rally very much better than

I  feared  we  might have done. In  fact,  if  the

platform  had not fallen down and if  it  had  not

rained   and   if  we  had  provided   alternative

loudspeaker facilities from the Airport  building,

so that the speeches could have been heard, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1837</b></font><br><br>



rally would probably have gone off all right,  and

there would have been no trouble. But there was  a

series of mishaps and difficulties and we did have

a  little trouble. Now, I think, Mr Speaker, that

for  the  record, I ought to make this  point.  In

connection with the merdeka rally, the Member  for

Cairnhill made a most savage attack on the  Press.

I  have my own disagreements with the Press.  Even

this   morning,  one  English  language  newspaper

carried  banner headlines across the  page  of  an

announcement  whereas the other  English  language

newspaper carried a front-page story contradicting

it. The Press sometimes gets its political wires a

bit crossed. In trying to make head or tail of the

Singapore political scene - which itself  does  not

always make either head or tail - it sometimes  gets

into  a bit of a muddle, but, on the whole,  I  do

not  think that the Press does it on purpose. They

do   their  best  in  a  difficult  situation.   I

certainly   do   not  think  that   the   Press - or

Singapore - is  benefited by accusing the  Press  of

slimy  hatred, or of dishonesty, or of deliberate

perversion  and  distortion of the facts,  because

that  sort  of attack lays us open to  the  danger

that freedom of the Press might be lost. We need a

Press which is free and which can criticise all of

us  when  we do wrong, and sometimes criticise  us

when we do right. If the Press is free, it must be

free  to be unfair as well as to be fair. It  must

be  free to do wrong as well as to do right.  That

is  the  meaning  of freedom. You  can  have  your

choice  between  whether you do right  or  you  do

wrong  and  it is up to you to choose. Of  course,

there  has  to be sonic limitation on freedom.  No

man  is free to commit murder - and the Press is not

free  to  commit libel. But within the  limits  of

what  can be tolerated, everybody should  have  as

much freedom as he can and we should tolerate  the

Press  and  should encourage it  to  write  freely

about the activities of our politicians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Cairnhill was the prime

mover  in holding a rally at Kallang Airport,  but

after  the collapse of the platform and the rather

unsuccessful speeches that were made from the  old

Airport building, he left



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1838</b></font><br><br>



the  scene and retired to his seaside house. I did

not  leave  the  scene - because  I  had  foreseen

trouble. And I felt that it was just as well to be

on  the spot, because at that time the old Airport

building  fell within my portfolio as the Minister

for  Communications and Works,  and  I  also  felt

myself that I was responsible for the building. So

I stayed around and when the trouble started I was

well  placed to see what was happening. I did  see

what was happening, and I do not think that in any

significant degree the Press did misrepresent  the

facts, as far as one can know what the facts  are,

when  dusk  is falling and the light is  not  very

good,  and  when  there is  a  confused  crowd  of

people, and it is difficult to tell precisely what

they  are  doing.  But I should like  to  give  my

personal  testimony to the reasonable  objectivity

and reliability of the Press reports at that time.

I  think they did their best except, I think,  for

one  reporter  serving a newspaper that  does  not

come  out  in  Singapore who, I  believe,  made  a

rather wild report. But our local papers, I think,

did a very honest and reasonable job. In point  of

fact,  I wrote to the then Chief Minister at  that

time  to  say  that  I thought  they  had  done  a

reasonable  job and that they had been  reasonably

accurate.  I  wanted  to get that  mentioned,  Mr

Speaker, and I would like to say that, having that

memory  of  the merdeka rally in my mind,  I  felt

that  the return of our successful delegation  was

not an occasion for too much flag flapping and too

much  stimulus to crowd emotions. I remember  very

well on the night of the merdeka rally, when I was

trying to contact the then Chief Minister, I  went

to  his  flat  overlooking the Cathedral  and  the

Padang. And from his flat as I was telephoning,  I

looked  out  of the window and there was  a  large

procession  returning  from  the  Kallang  Airport

marching  along  the road towards Chinatown.  That

procession  in  itself could have led  to  further

trouble. Luckily, it did not. It was persuaded  to

disperse  but it could have been a further  danger

to us all. Now, if we had anything of that sort on

the  occasion  of  the return  of  the  successful

Merdeka  Delegation,  it  would  have  been,   Mr

Speaker, a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1839</b></font><br><br>



disaster for Singapore. We all know how vulnerable

our  prosperity  is. We cannot  live  on  what  we

produce.  We  can  only live on  the  services  we

render to our trading partners, and if our trading

partners are frightened of us, then they will  not

trade through us. Consequently, when it fell to me

to  serve  as Chairman of the All-Party  Committee

which  was  planning the reception of the  Merdeka

Delegation,  I was anxious that it  should  be  on

sober  and realistic lines and that the people  of

Singapore  should  have an opportunity  of  seeing

their  returning delegates and welcoming them  and

hearing what they had to say. After all, they were

only  returning with an agreement. The actual step

forward has not been taken. It is only agreed that

we  shall be able to take the step forward in  due

course when the Constitution has been brought into

operation. It did not seem to me to be an occasion

for  too many shouts and excitement because, after

all,  shouts  and  excitement will  come  in  more

appropriately on whatever day is finally fixed  as

Merdeka  Day (or perhaps we should say "tiga  suku

merdeka  day"?).  I think those who  were  present

during the reception to the Merdeka Delegation can

well  be satisfied that it was a sober and sincere

one, in which the people joined with their leaders

in  recognizing  the responsibilities  falling  on

them  in  greater  measure as  they  went  forward

towards greater freedom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have never subscribed to the view that

sincerity  is proven by loud shouts and waving  of

hands in the air. To me, sincerity is a matter  of

doing hard work. If a man will work hard, then  he

is  sincere in the cause for which he is  working.

The  number  of fine words he uses or speeches  he

makes  are  not in themselves proof of  sincerity.

Certainly  I do not think the people of  Singapore

need  to demonstrate the sincerity of their desire

for the responsibilities of freedom by loud shouts

and  crowd  scenes. They can show their  sincerity

more  by  solid national effort to make sure  that

Singapore is a better, happier, cleaner and  finer

place, by the work of the whole nation, not by the

work of only a few leaders.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1840</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, they say that the elephant

never  forgets. If that is true, then  the  Member

for  Cairnhill clearly is not an elephant  because

sometimes he does forget. Many points have already

been  made about how he forgot what was  fixed  in

legislation   when  he  himself  was   the   Chief

Minister,  about what he was willing to accept  in

London a year ago but which he now regards as pock-marked. We have even heard that, whereas last year

he  regarded anyone contesting elections under the

Rendel  Constitution as one of the  most  advanced

lepers to be found, he takes a different view this

year.  Perhaps it is not necessary to  stress  too

heavily  or too lengthily on his lapses of memory,

but  there  is one point which has not been  dealt

with and on which I ought to touch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like, Mr Speaker, to give one reason

(I do not think it has yet been dealt with in this debate)  why  this  Merdeka  agreement  should  be

accepted  and  should be acceptable: it  preserves

the  existing link with Great Britain.  I  am  not

thinking  primarily of the political  link - offices

in   Whitehall  and  that  sort  of  thing.  I  am

thinking,  Mr  Speaker,  of  the  commercial  and

economic link. Singapore, as everyone knows, is  a

small place with a small population. There is  not

much  point in saying that Singapore has a  larger

revenue  than  Panama or a larger population  than

Newfoundland, and that the latter is  a  Dominion.

After  all,  if you have the choice of  living  in

Panama or Singapore, I am sure you will prefer  to

live  here.  The Member for Cairnhill listed  many

small countries as being free, independent nations

whilst  Singapore  was crawling in  the  "colonial

muck". Well, I think that, economically, Singapore

is  far  better  off in the "colonial  muck"  than

other  small countries are with their freedom  and

independence; and in Singapore, there is  probably

also  a good deal more freedom for the individual.

I  do not know places well, but I looked up a  few

references  during the last few days (I  will  not

bother  to  quote them now or else my speech  will

never come to an end!) but it is sufficient to say

simply  that Singapore has the highest per  capita

income and the highest standard of living



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1841</b></font><br><br>



of  the  countries in South-East Asia. This  is  a

very considerable achievement, which has been made

under  colonial  rule;  an  achievement  made  not

because of colonial rule, but because of the  fact

of  Singapore's geographical position and  because

of  the economic links which have been built up in

140 years of trading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is essential, Mr Speaker, that we should

maintain our trading connections. If we can create

new  ones, that is all for the better. If  we  can

create  so many new and secure trading connections

that  we  do  not need the old ones, then  we  can

abandon the old ones. But we cannot abandon any of

our  existing  trade  without immediately  causing

suffering  to our people in Singapore. We  need  a

stable  currency  because  people  buy  and   sell

through Singapore, and make use of our banking and

insurance  services,  and  all  the  other  skills

accumulated  here  which are our greatest  assets.

People  need  to have confidence in  the  currency

which   they  use,  and  it  is  of  the  greatest

advantage to us that we should have a Singapore or

Straits dollar which is stable and recognised as a

reliable  currency  in which you  can  trade,  and

which  will  not suddenly let you down.  For  that

reason  alone, we must retain our links  with  the

sterling  area,  at least until we have  something

else ready. If we can ever find something else, by

all  means let us consider it; but as long  as  we

have  not  got an alternative, we must retain  the

situation which has given us a reliable currency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, the general pattern of our

trade links us up with the rest of the free world,

in  particular the sterling area. I remember,  Mr

Speaker,  that  in  an  earlier  debate  in   this

Assembly,  I  dealt with similar  questions  about

Singapore,  and I would like to remind Members  of

my  remarks  and  of the alternatives  before  us.

Singapore   cannot  stand  alone.   It   must   be

associated with one of the big power groups in the

world. Whether militarily or economically, we have

to  be  linked  with someone. What are  the  three

power  groups?  There  is  the  United  States  of

America and those associated with it; there is the

Commonwealth of Nations; and there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1842</b></font><br><br>



the  Communist  bloc from Eastern  Europe  to  the

shores  of China. We have to choose between  these

three;  there is no other major grouping to  which

we can belong or with which we can associate. I do

not  think that there will be any marked advantage

in  transferring our association with  the  United

Kingdom to the United States - if one is the  frying

pan,  then the other might be the fire. If we have

to  choose between these two groups, there will be

no  particular  point  in  leaving  Whitehall  for

Washington   (In  fact,  this  is  not   practical

politics  and nobody is considering it). The  only

alternative to Whitehall and Washington is  Moscow

and  Peking, and here, Mr Speaker, I should  like

to  develop a short geographical argument because,

in  thinking about the present Merdeka  agreement,

we   have   to   look  beyond,   to   our   future

constitutional    progress    and    our    future

relationship with those around us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you will conjure up in your mind's eye, Mr

Speaker,  a large map of the world with the  North

Pole  at  the  top,  you  will  find  that,  going

southwards, you immediately get out of the ice and

snow  (in fact before you get out of the  ice  and

snow),  you run into Russia and China. Long before

Communism dominated that large part of the  world,

academic teachers called geo-politicians developed

the theme that there was a heart-land in the world

and  that  whoever ruled that heart-land  would

ultimately rule the world. This heart-land is  the

vast  area from Eastern Europe across to the China

coast,  the  area  now  held  and  controlled   by

Communism.  In  many  ways, Communism  is  a  very

appropriate  form of government  for  these  large

territories  where previously  there  had  been  a

complete breakdown in government and a high degree

of  inefficiency;  and it may well  be  worth  the

while  of  the  people living there  to  sacrifice

their  freedom in order to have stable governments

which will carry out economic development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now around this enormous heart-land with its

tremendous   wealth  in  population  and   natural

resources, there lies a fringe running from  Japan

down to the Philippines, Borneo, Vietnam,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1843</b></font><br><br>



Siam,  Burma, India, Pakistan, through the  Middle

East countries of Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Jordan

and  Israel,  through Greece round to Italy,  till

you  come  to  Britain and finally to Scandinavia.

These  countries form a narrow fringe around  this

enormous   solid  bloc  under  Communist  control.

Anybody  who ponders on the strategy of World  War

III  can  see that - well, I will leave the question

of  military strategy alone, Mr Speaker, I do not

think  it  is highly relevant to this argument - but

what  is  relevant to the argument is the strategy

of  trade  until World War III takes place,  which

please  God  it never will. If Singapore  were  to

fall  within  the  Communist  heart-land,  if  its

boundaries reached forward to envelop Siam, Malaya

and   Singapore,   we  will   lose   our   present

advantageous trading position and enter  a  period

of   poverty   and  suffering.  This  is   because

Singapore  now lies centrally to the  fringe-lands

of  the  free, non-Communist world: it is able  to

trade  because  it lies centrally to  the  natural

trading  routes. If you pick up a  map,  you  will

see,  converging  on Singapore, the  sea  and  air

routes  of world trade and world movement. Because

of  this, we live; without it, we die. If we  fall

into  the Communist sphere, we shall no longer  be

central  to the world and there will be no  reason

why  trade should pass through Singapore. Hongkong

is  a  different case altogether.  It  is  outside

Communist  China but at any time it can  be  taken

into  Communist  China, although if  both  parties

wished,  it could always remain a valuable trading

position  because  it lies so close  to  the  vast

areas of China. But if Singapore falls within  the

Communist  empire, there will be no reason  why  a

merchant should trade from here except in  so  far

as he trades with the free world, and even then he

will   find  it  more  convenient  to  trade  from

elsewhere.  I  cannot imagine that goods  will  be

sent   from  Leningrad  to  Canton  by   sea   via

Singapore. If we fall within the Communist empire,

we  should,  by that single fall, lose  our  trade

almost  wholly and totally, quite apart  from  the

fact that there will then inevitably be embargoes,

blockades and other cold war devices inflicted  on

us.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1844</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, until there are changes in the

international world of politics, it  seems  to  me

inevitable that Singapore should retain its  links

with  its old trading partners and, in particular,

with  the  sterling area and the  Commonwealth  of

Nations. The time may come when other choices will

be available, and we should all be looking forward

to  them, continually examining new possibilities,

because   it   is   by  willingness   to   examine

possibilities  that  we can  hope  to  expand  our

trade.   But  until  we  have  found  a   definite

alternative, it will be most unwise to abandon our

present connections. What we can do is to maintain

them, to live freely and prosperously within them.

To  be  a  trading partner is a happy  and  useful

thing,  and there need be no stigma of colonialism

or  imperialism,  because if we are  an  efficient

trading  centre  we  serve  our  friends  and  our

friends serve us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of our trading functions, Mr

Speaker,  is  that  we are a  shop,  or  a  public

market,  if  you  prefer it. To us come  customers

from  all  over the world. They come  because  our

market is well placed. We are a convenient shop on

a  corner site with main roads all around us,  and

so  the  customers come. But it is not  absolutely

essential for them to come here; and if  our  shop

is  continually closed to business and  you  never

know  when it is going to be opened or not, people

will come less often. If our shops are closed by a

strike  or  riot, or through emotional  outbursts,

then  the  ships which normally come to  Singapore

will   go  elsewhere,  and  once  they  start   on

different routes, they will perhaps tend  to  stay

there.  Once  they  build  up  a  connection  with

another port, with new agencies, new crews and  so

on,  they will, through the sheer inertia of daily

life,  be reluctant to come back to Singapore.  If

we  look  forward to expanding our  shop,  getting

more  customers, we must be certain that  we  have

peace  and  good order at home. Customers  do  not

like  the shopkeepers suddenly beginning to  fight

one  another,  nor do they like to get  beaten  up

incidentally.  As  an international  sea  and  air

port,  we  cannot  afford to let  visitors  remind

themselves that one of their countrymen was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1845</b></font><br><br>



killed here last year and feel quite unhappy about

coming  here. Well, fortunately on the whole,  our

name   has  remained  good  in  spite  of  certain

incidents,  but  there is  a  limit,  and  a  very

dangerous  one, to the tolerance of the people  we

need  as  our customers. As long as they can  make

profit,  people who trade will seek to make  them,

but  they are not going to risk their capital  and

profits  in  a  place where they do not  feel  any

confidence  in the stability of the government  or

the stability of the currency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, we all know the saying about a bull in a

china  shop.  I  have  said that  the  Member  for

Cairnhill  is clearly not an elephant because  his

memory  is not always perfect, but we may  perhaps

compare  him  with a bull in the  Singapore  china

shop, because he has ideas which are not likely to

preserve  all  the contents of that shop  in  good

order.  The Member wants immediate election  very,

very quickly, without proper preparation and based

on  a  curious "half-baked" register which is  not

properly drawn up. His original idea, I think, was

to  have  elections in August, to be  followed  by

further  ones  two  years later  based  on  a  new

register.  Sir, we cannot afford to have continual

elections in a place like Singapore. Once in  four

years  is  clearly as much as you want - five  years

perhaps - because  every  time  an  election   is

pending, customers coming to Singapore look around

and  say,  "Well, I think I will  wait  until  the

election  is over and see who has come into  power

before  I put down my hundred thousand or  million

dollars" - in  building a factory or  a  new  office

building, or in the other money transactions which

are  necessary for us to do our trade. If we  live

under  the  permanent  shadow  of  new  elections,

people  will  say, "Well, I think I  will  put  my

money  in  Canada, where I know I can get  a  very

good  return; it has a booming economy and is  the

place  where I feel I can be sure things are going

to  go  on  quietly and nicely."  If  we  want  to

compete for the trade of the world, we have got to

satisfy our trading customers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the fact that too frequent elections

will  inhibit investment, there is the  fact  that

every election is naturally



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1846</b></font><br><br>



a  time  when people make fiery speeches  and  get

excited, and there is also the danger to  which  I

referred at considerable length just now, that  in

the  end we shall perhaps get people turning  from

throwing hard words at each other to throwing hard

stones.  In  our elections in 1955,  for  example,

there were occasions when crowds turned out to  be

mixed ones of supporters of different Parties, and

on  at least one occasion, a leading member of the

Labour Front received an urgent telephone call and

had  to hurry out to a rural area where he had  to

interpose  bodily  between  two  small  groups  of

people  already  at the stage of insults  and  who

probably  would shortly have come to  blows.  That

threatened  violence was avoided, but the  history

of  elections in Britain shows that there  was  an

enormous  amount of violence at election time  and

quite  frequently  large numbers  of  people  were

killed.  Well, Britain could stand that 150  years

ago, but Singapore cannot stand it today. That  is

another  reason why we want an election  which  is

properly  prepared  for by  serious  Parties  with

serious  programmes  really  concerned  with   the

welfare  of Singapore: we do not want an  election

to be fought on an emotional issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do want to make this point - which perhaps

I   am  labouring  a  little  bit  too  much.  Mr

Speaker - that  if we want trade to  come  here,  we

have  to  show  ourselves to be  a  sober  trading

community.  I  remember being  very  struck  by  a

situation  at  the  Naval Base sometime  ago.  The

Union  there  had proposed a strike because  there

was  some  question of redundancy. I  made  a  few

enquiries  very informally and gathered  that  one

reason  for the redundancy would lie in  the  fact

that not so many ships were coming in for dockyard

facilities.  And of course the more strikes  there

are at a dockyard, the fewer will be the number of

ships  to be docked there. Obviously, nobody  will

plan to send his ship into a dockyard and find  he

cannot  get it out again six weeks after  the  due

date  because all the workers have been on strike,

or  plan to send it in on a certain date and  then

find he cannot send it in on that date because the

dockyard is closed. People



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1847</b></font><br><br>



will send their ships elsewhere, and the more  you

go  on  strike,  the  more you will  decrease  the

amount of work to be done and increase redundancy.

The   same  applies  to  almost  everything  else.

Strikes  are sometimes necessary, and  it  is  the

duty  of  good trade union leaders to decide  when

they are so and must be staged, and when they  are

unnecessary and can be avoided. But as in  war,  a

strike   always  leaves  both  sides  worse   off.

Individual  strikers  may sometimes  win  personal

gains,  but  the  country as  a  whole  will  have

suffered a loss of wealth. The wealth may  or  may

not  have been redistributed to some extent to the

benefit of workers, but the total amount of wealth

to be distributed is less.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I argue for a sober approach to our

political   problems,  for  absence  of  emotional

excitement which can sometimes lead to violence, I

am  not  arguing for trade in the sense of  profit

for  the orang kaya, the millionaires, but in  the

sense  of  providing  the daily  rice,  the  daily

livelihood, of workers. Singapore must  trade.  If

we  do  not  trade, we starve, and  the  first  to

starve will be the poorest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, I ought to turn to one point

which  has  not  been  fully  cleared  up  in  the

previous speeches. I refer to paragraph 39 of  the

Report on the Constitutional Conference this year.

Perhaps  I had better read it, as Members may  not

have copies in their hands:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Requests by Her Majesty's Government for action

to  be taken by the Singapore Government which  in

the view of Her Majesty's Government was necessary

for  the  discharge of their responsibilities  for

external  affairs  or defence  would  consequently

fall to be discussed in the Inter-Governmental Committee."-



<br><br>that is the consultative committee-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We do not expect any practical difficulty in

determining  what are matters of external  affairs

or  defence. We agreed, however, that it should be

open  to  the Government of Singapore  to  request

that any matter should be referred to the Internal

Security Council to decide to what extent,  if  at

all, it  lay within the functions of the Council.

Except  to the extent to which the Council decided

that  a  matter was one of internal  security,  it

would  be  the duty of the Government of Singapore

to  give  effect  to  Her  Majesty's  Government's

requirements."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1848</b></font><br><br>



Now, paragraph 40 is connected with this. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Conference further agreed that if the

Singapore  Government were to fail  to  carry  out

their   duty   to  meet  such  requirements,   the

procedure  mentioned in paragraph  27  (k)  (which

relates  to the implementation of requirements  of

the   Internal   Security   Council)   should   be

applicable in this case also. When the requirement

related   to   a   Bill   before   the   Singapore

Legislature,  which in the view of  Her  Majesty's

Government  would prejudice the discharge  by  Her

Majesty's  Government  of their  responsibilities,

the  Chairman of the Security Council  would  also

have  the  power  to  advise the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara  to  reserve  the Bill  for  Her  Majesty's

pleasure,  and  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  should

then be obliged to do so."



<br><br>Now,  Mr Speaker, I would refer to the Report  in

Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 31 of 1956. On  page  69,

in  Annexure L, "Constitutional Proposals  by  the

United    Kingdom   Government", are   mentioned

proposals offered by the Secretary of State and to

which  the  Member for Cairnhill referred  in  his

speech.  Proposal  No. (22)  on  the  Constitution

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The High Commissioner normally to exercise his

powers in respect of assent to Bills in accordance

with the advice of Ministers, -"



<br><br>normally  he  would  act  on  the  advice  of  the

Minister -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"but to be required to reserve for Her Majesty's

pleasure  any  bill which in the  opinion  of  the

Defence  and  Security  Council  prejudices   the

exercise    of    Her    Majesty's    Government's

responsibilities in the field of external  defence

and external affairs."



<br><br>I  am sure, Mr Speaker, that your fine legal mind

penetrates  fully  through  the rather  cumbersome

wording  of these paragraphs and I do not want  to

take  up  an undue amount of time in dealing  with

them.  The  point I am seeking to  put  across  is

this:  that in the offer of 1956, the question  of

these  Bills  being  reserved  for  Her  Majesty's

pleasure  was  to  be decided by the  Defence  and

Security Council, on which the colonial power  had

the effective strength; what has been secured this

time  is not less than what was offered last year,

in  fact, it is very much more, because it is open

to the Government of Singapore to request that any

matter should be referred to the Internal Security

Council.  If  the Singapore Government  says.  "We

want



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1849</b></font><br><br>



this,   please,  to  go  to  the  internal

Security  Council," then it must go  there

and  that  Council  will  decide  to  what

extent, if at all, that matter lies within

its functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Except to the extent that the Council

decided  that  the  matter  was   one   of

internal security, it would be the duty of

the Government of Singapore to give effect

to      Her     Majesty's     Government's

requirements."



<br><br>In  other  words,  the  Malayan-controlled

Internal   Security  Council  can   decide

whether  or  not a Bill is to be  reserved

for  Her Majesty's pleasure. The power  of

decision  in the 1956 proposals  lay  with

the colonial power; in the 1957 agreement,

it  lies with Malayans sitting together on

the Council as brothers in a common effort

for    the   prosperity   of   the   joint

territories   of   Singapore    and    the

Federation  of  Malaya.  This  is  a  most

important  and significant gain over  what

was offered in 1956, and one for which  we

should  be heartily thankful to  the  All-Party  delegates. It is a gain of fact  in

that  it gives an additional guarantee  of

the  freedom  of action of the Government,

and  also  serves  as a guarantee  of  the

close  association of the two territories.

We    do    not   expect   any   practical

difficulties  in  determining   what   are

matters  of  external affairs or  defence,

but if there is any doubt, then it goes to

the  Internal Security Council, and it  is

most  desirable that the two  territories,

Singapore  and the Federation,  should  be

closely  linked together in  the  work  of

relating  themselves to the  world  around

them. They should not regard themselves as

separated  at home or abroad: they  should

stand  side by side with regard  to  their

internal   problems  and  also  to   their

external  problems. If they do  not,  then

gradually or rapidly, our national  wealth

and  our national aspirations will go down

and  the  future will become  increasingly

dark  and  dangerous.  We  need  all   the

friends we can get and, above all, we need

our  friends  in the Federation,  and  one

important aspect of this agreement is  the

extent  to  which it makes necessary,  and

provides  opportunitites  for,  friendship

between the two territories, friendship to

be  expressed in a practical  way  in  the

daily  affairs of life - not in words,  like

the  ones  I  am now uttering, which  pass

over the heads of those around and are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1850</b></font><br><br>



lost,  but in the actual work of  deciding

on   particular  problems,  getting   down

together and seeing whether our minds move

on  the same track or not. That is the way

in  which  you  learn to  understand  true

character, when you work together and  can

make a judgment on the basis of your work.

And that is what I hope we shall get as we

work  together  with  the  Federation   in

implementing  this  agreement.  We   shall

understand how their minds work: they will

understand how our minds work. And because

we   understand,  we  shall  come   closer

together.   We  shall  see  each   other's

problems, and see our own problems through

the  eyes of others, and the way  will  be

opened  for a considerable advance towards

our  great objective (which I hope is  not

too   far  off) - merger  between  the  two

territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not take further time on this

point,   Mr   Speaker.  I  have   perhaps

stressed  my  points at undue  length,  to

express   my   firm  rejection   of   this

amendment  and my firm acceptance  of  the

original motion.



<br><br>3.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, may I refer you once more to

the  motion  standing in the name  of  the

Hon. the Chief Minister? He asks:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) takes note of the Report of the

Singapore  Constitutional Conference  held

in  London  in March and April,  1957,  as

contained in Sessional Paper No.  Misc.  2

of  1957, and approves the points on which

agreement has been reached.'.



<br><br>Sir,  I  ask you to compare that with  the

amendment,  which  asks  the  Assembly  to

"regretfully"  take  note  of   the   same

Report,  and then "nevertheless calls  for

the  immediate implementation of  the  new

Constitution.".   Sir,   why    ask    for

implementation - immediate    or     delayed

implementation - when you do not approve  of

the  points  on which agreement  has  been

reached? It does not seem logical to me at

all, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like, Sir, after hearing such

long speeches, to enumerate one by one the

various changes that will be brought about

when   the  new  constitution  comes  into

force.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1851</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Today, Sir, this island of Singapore is known, or

is  described,  in  the statute books  of  the  United

Kingdom and in the various Ordinances of Singapore, as

the  "Colony  of Singapore". When the new constitution

is   brought  into  force,  the  word  "Colony"   will

disappear,  and the word "State" will replace  it.  It

will  not then be the "Colony of Singapore",  but  the

"State  of  Singapore". That is one of the new  things

that will be brought about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The number of 32 Members in this Assembly will be

increased   to  51,  with  the  following   additional

changes: the three ex-officio Members will go and  the

four  Nominated Members (including myself)  will  also

go.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) My third point, Sir, concerns the Executive. The

term  "Chief  Minister" will be  changed  into  "Prime

Minister"  and  the functions of the  Chief  Secretary

will  he  transferred to an elected Minister, and  the

portfolio  of  the Financial Secretary  will  also  be

transferred to an elected Minister. Then the office of

the  Attorney-General  will be  discontinued  and  his

functions   will  be  distributed  as   follows:   the

ministerial responsibility of departments assigned  to

the Attorney-General will be transferred to an elected

Minister.  So,  Sir, when we get the new constitution,

these three official posts will disappear entirely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Then we have another change, Sir, number four,

regarding  the  Head  of  State.  Last  year,  through

muddled  thinking,  if I may say  so,  Sir,  the  word

"Governor-General"  was  used.  There  cannot  be  and

should  not be a governor-general when there  is  only

going  to be one Governor. The term "Governor-General"

is  used  only  when  there are governors  of  various

States and one is made the "general" of them all. This

year (I do not know how it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1852</b></font><br><br>



came about, but I suppose through the influence of the

Hon. the  Minister  for Local Government,  Lands  and

Housing,  Inche Abdul Hamid bin Haji Jumat)  the  term

"Yang  di-Pertuan Negara" has been brought  in.  That,

Sir,  will also be a new thing. We shall also have  as

representative   of   Her  Majesty's   Government,   a

Commissioner.   A  Commissioner  will  represent   Her

Majesty's Government and the Yang di-Pertuan Negara - we

are   getting   quite  used  to  this  expression - will

represent Her Majesty the Queen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another change, Sir, concerns the Singapore Internal

Security  Council, consisting of three representatives

from Singapore, three from the United Kingdom and  one

from  the Federation of Malaya. We do not have it now,

but  we  shall  be having it when the new constitution

comes into force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, then, Sir, I come to a doubtful point, and that

is  paragraph  30  of  the Report where  the  Colonial

Office-



<br><br>4   p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Moment of interruption. Further

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Tomorrow, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remaining items on the Order Paper read, and set down

for tomorrow.
