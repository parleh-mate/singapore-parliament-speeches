<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Reappraisal of relations)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Low Yong Nguan</b> asked the Minister for

Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour, in view of

the  rapid changes taking place in Southeast  Asia,

if he will consider a more realistic reappraisal of

relations with the People's Republic of China.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

though  I  agree  with the hon. Member  that  rapid

changes  are taking place in Southeast Asia,  there

appears to be no change as yet on the part  of  the

People's Republic of China towards the Republic  of

Singapore. Members of the House are no doubt  aware

that  the policy of the People's Republic of  China

towards Singapore is that it does not exist  as  an

independent state and that it is, as far as  it  is

concerned,  a  part of what the Chinese  Government

refers to as Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This being so, I do not see how Singapore could

consider   a   "more   realistic   reappraisal   of

relations" with a country which, for reasons of its

own, considers that the State of Singapore does not

exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the policy of the Singapore Government

has been, as has constantly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>



been   reiterated,   to  be   friendly   with   all

governments which are ready to be friendly with it.

But it is extremely difficult to be friendly with a

government which appears to believe that the  State

of Singapore does not exist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan (Crawford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker. Sir, I have two supplementary questions to

raise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has said

that   basically  the  attitude  of  the   People's

Republic  of China towards us has not changed.  But

if we continue to do things like letting the Taiwan

Government's  trade representatives  conduct  their

business  in  Singapore,  how  can  we  expect  the

People's  Republic of China to change its  attitude

towards us?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, what kind of attitude will our

representatives in the United Nations adopt towards

the  question of admission of the People's Republic

of China?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I think the Member is aware that

in  regard to trade between countries, the question

of  recognition does not enter into the picture. We

do  trade  with  the  People's  Republic  of  China

despite  the  fact that it does not  recognise  us.

Similarly  we  do trade with the Taiwan  Government

despite  the  fact  that  it  does  recognise   our

existence. So I think trade has nothing to do  with

the question of recognition.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to our attitude towards the People's

Republic  of  China in the United Nations,  if  the

Member will read the back numbers of newspapers, he

will see that we have made our position clear -that

we  are  for  the admission of China to the  United

Nations. But, unfortunately, in the United  Nations

this  question is not decided on its merits.  There

is  a lot of political manoeuvring going on. So the

questions are invariably phrased in such a  way  as

to  compel us to take sides on what are essentially

big   power  political  struggles  in  the   United

Nations. So we always say that in principle we  are

quite   prepared  to  support,  as  we  have,   the

admission  of  China  to the United  Nations.  Once

having  decided  on  that, we  shall  consider  the

question of the status of Formosa.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  a further supplementary question. The Foreign

Minister   has  said  that  trade  and   diplomatic

recognition are two separate matters. But  I  would

like to know this. We have trade contacts with  the

Taiwan Government in the five years since we became

independent.   But  have  we  any  trade   contacts

officially with the People's Republic of China?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like the Foreign

Minister to clarify is this. In the United Nations,

do  we  adopt  the  attitude that,  as  a  tactical

measure, we avoid facing the important question  of

recognition  of  the People's Republic  of  China's

right  of representation? If we do, I cannot  agree

with this attitude.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> In regard to trade again, if the

Member  will go around Singapore, I think  he  will

find that a lot of trade is going on with China. He

can buy goods from China. I think we have a perfect

understanding on that score. Even American tourists

come here and buy cheap goods from China.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to our stand in the United Nations, as

I  have  already said, we are for the admission  of

the People's Republic of China to the United



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>



Nations.  There  are  some  140  nations  who  have

different  views, and therefore this  question  has

never really been decided on a straightforward  yes

or no.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would

like  to  ask  the  Minister to  make  a  clear-cut

statement  in  this connection. Since we  recognise

the  People's Republic of China as the only logical

representative of China in the United  Nations,  is

he  of the view that the People's Republic of China

is  the  only  government which can  represent  the

Chinese people in the United Nations? Maybe as  the

Minister  for  Foreign Affairs  he  finds  it  very

difficult  to  make a clear-cut  statement,  but  I

would like to ask him to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is this: since our

independence,  have  we  established  any  official

trade  links,  directly  or  indirectly,  with  the

People's Republic of China?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think no

Foreign  Minister ever gives any direct answers  to

questions which are not necessarily in the interest

of Singapore. The Member will agree that any answer

that  I  give should not be in the interest of  the

People's Republic of China, but in the interest  of

the  people  of  the Republic of Singapore.  So  my

answer  is  that  we recognise that  the  seat  now

occupied by the representative of Nationalist China

should  be  occupied by the representative  of  the

People's  Republic  of  China.  As  to  who  really

represents  the people of China, I have never  been

there;  I  have  never consulted  the  700  million

people of China. So it is not for me to say, and it

is not for the Member to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to trade links, we have lots of trade

links. Goods are coming here from China. They  have

a bank here. I think that is concrete evidence that

whatever the theory might be, in practice there are

considerable trade relations which, may I add,  are

by  and  large  to  the advantage of  the  People's

Republic  of China. They sell to us more than  they

buy from us, which is not a bad situation to be  in

for even the People's Republic of China.

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FUND DEPOSITS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Payment of property tax on Housing Board flats)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee</b> asked the Minister for

Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour if he  will

consider introducing amending legislation to  allow

owner-occupiers  of Housing and  Development  Board

flats   who   are   unemployed  or  in   straitened

circumstances  to  utilise their Central  Provident

Fund  deposits for the payment of property  tax  on

their flats.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, owner-occupiers

of  Housing and Development Board flats are already

favourably treated in that they are allowed to  use

their  Central Provident Fund deposits  towards  an

initial  down  payment and monthly  instalments  on

their  flats. It would defeat the essential purpose

of the Central Provident Fund - which is savings  -

were  this  advantage  to be  extended  further  to

enable  contributors to use their  C.P.F, deposits

towards  payment of property tax. To allow them  to

withdraw  money for this purpose would be conceding

to  Housing  and Development Board flat  owners  an

advantage not enjoyed by other property owners  who

may be equally hard pressed in regard to payment of

property tax.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, my question is framed in such a way that I  am

asking  whether this facility can be extended  only

to   owner-occupiers  who  are  unemployed  or   in

straitened circumstances. I agree with the Minister

that it should not be done for all owner-occupiers.

In  my meet-the-people sessions, I have come across

people  who  had utilised their C.P.F, deposits  to

purchase a Housing Board flat and, after a year  or

so, they found themselves out of a job, and because

of age and other circumstances, they were unable to

obtain any alternative employment and so were in no

position to pay the property tax.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, I repeat that the

principle of the Central



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



Provident Fund is saving. Buying a house is another

way  of  saving  - providing for yourself.  But  to

allow the C.P.F, deposits to be used either to  pay

property tax or to sustain yourself conflicts  with

the principle of the C.P.F.

<div align="center"><b>IRON RAILINGS ON</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ROAD-DIVIDERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Measures to discourage use by pedestrians)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  if he will consider measures to discourage

pedestrians  from climbing over the  iron  railings

erected  on  road-dividers  wherever  a  pedestrian

overhead  bridge  nearby  has  been  provided   for

crossing a road.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Acting Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are at present

23  pedestrian overhead bridges in the Republic. In

order  to encourage pedestrians to use the  bridges

when  crossing the roads, iron railings  have  been

erected   on  road-dividers  under  ten  of   these

bridges, and the P.W.D, has plans in hand to  erect

railings  under  the  remaining  bridges.   Besides

erecting  these fence-type obstacles to  discourage

persons  from  crossing the road at random,  police

personnel   are   posted   at   overhead   bridges,

especially  during  the road safety  campaigns,  to

persuade pedestrians to make use of the bridges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no provisions in the law at present to

enable  the  police to take action against  persons

who  cross a road where an overhead bridge has been

constructed. We may have to consider a law for  the

control of jay-walkers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>AGAINST TEACHERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Prior consultation with teachers' union)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b> asked the Minister for

Education whether it is the present practice of his

Ministry  to consult the union of a teacher  before

disciplinary  proceedings with a view to  dismissal

are  instituted against him, and, if  not,  whether

consideration  will  be  given  to  adopting   this

practice.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, disciplinary proceedings with a

view  to  dismissal  are regulated  by  the  Public

Service  (Disciplinary Proceedings) Regulations  in

the  case of teachers in Government schools and  by

the    Schools    Regulations   and    Grant-in-Aid

Regulations  under the Education Ordinance  in  the

case of aided-school teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Service Commission is the final

authority  for  the  former  and  the  Director  of

Education for the latter. In both cases there is no

provision  for  the  union  of  a  teacher  to   be

consulted  before  action  is  taken.  The  extreme

penalty  of dismissal is not exercised lightly.  It

is  resorted  to  only when the offence  is  severe

enough to justify its imposition and when there  is

sufficient  evidence after thorough  investigation.

The  Ministry  is  of  the view  that  the  present

regulations provide adequate safeguards  against  a

miscarriage of justice, and there is no reason  for

changing them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  can  the  Minister  say  how   many

teachers who were sacked have been re-employed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, I do not have the figure

with  me, but if the Member wants it, I can  supply

it to him later.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  merely  want to know whether there are  teachers

who have been re-employed after having been sacked.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as I

am  aware, there were 11 cases of dismissals. I  do

not think there is any case of reinstatement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I know of several teachers who have been reinstated

in their posts after having been sacked. I can give

examples.  From  this, we can see  that  the  final

decision  rests with the Public Service Commission,

and  it may not always be correct. I would like  to

stress that the authorities concerned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>



should  consult  the  union of the  teacher  before

disciplinary proceedings are taken against him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, if it is a question of

dismissal  by the Public Service Commission,  then,

as  far  as  I  am  aware, none of  them  has  been

reinstated.

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT-AIDED SCHOOL TEACHERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Payment of gratuity on retirement)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b> asked the Minister for

Education  if  the  Government  will  consider  the

payment of a gratuity to a teacher of a Government-aided school on retirement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, aided-school

teachers are members of the Central Provident Fund.

The  Government makes a monthly C.P.F, contribution

at  the  rate  of eight per cent of  the  officer's

total  emoluments.  The rate of  contribution  will

eventually be raised to 10 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On retirement, the aided-school teacher receives

his  C.P.F, benefits instead  of  a  gratuity  and

pension  payable  to a retired Government  teacher.

Aided-school  teachers who leave the service  prior

to  their retirement age are allowed to retain  the

Government's share of the C.P.F, contributions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the recent increases in the rate of

Government  C.P.F, contributions  to  the  present

eight  per  cent (with expectation of  an  eventual

rise  to  10  per cent), aided-school  teachers  on

retirement receive a reasonable sum of money by way

of  superannuation  benefits,  if  in  addition  to

C.P.F, contributions, a gratuity is given to aided-school teachers, their superannuation benefits will

be  much more than the super-annuation benefits  of

Government teachers.

<div align="center"><b>CERTIFICATES OF SUITABILITY</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Particulars, and review of policy)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Low Yong Nguan</b> asked the Minister for

Education  (a)  what are the figures,  as, at  the

latest  convenient  date,  of  (i)  the  number  of

applications  for Certificates of  Suitability  for

admission  to  the various institutions  of  higher

learning  in the Republic; (ii) the number rejected

and  the reasons therefor; and (iii) the number  of

Certificates  granted  and subsequently  withdrawn;

and (b) whether he will carry out a complete review

of  the  policy on the matter having regard to  the

students' inherent right to higher education.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, up to 24th

July,  1970,  a  total of 13,311  applications  for

Certificates  of  Suitability  had  been  received.

Breakdown   figures  by  institutions   of   higher

learning are not kept, as most applicants apply for

admission to more than one institution in a  single

application.  Only seven cases out of  a  total  of

13,311  applications,  or  0.053  per  cent,   were

rejected   on  security  grounds.  The  number   of

certificates granted and subsequently withdrawn  is

nil.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The requirement of the Certificate of Suitability

under  the provisions of the Internal Security  Act

is  to  ensure that institutions of higher learning

are   not   turned  into  a  hotbed  of  subversive

political activities which are not conducive to the

pursuit  of knowledge. As explained by the Minister

of  Defence  in a press statement issued  in  March

1967, the Government adopted this requirement  with

two objectives in mind. The first was to prevent  a

high   concentration   of   Communist-indoctrinated

students   collecting  together   in   a   tertiary

institution   with  the  intention  of   not   only

controlling  the  students'  activities,  but  also

intimidating  the teaching staff  and  in  the  end

taking over the running of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



institution.  The  second  purpose  was  to   deter

students from getting mixed up in Communist  United

Front activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, however, like to make an observation on

the  so-called "students' inherent right to  higher

education". The primary consideration for admission

to   a  higher  institution  of  learning  is   the

possession of academic standards acceptable to  the

institution  concerned. This implies that  not  all

students  who  seek admission can be admitted  even

though  they  may  have the minimum qualifications.

Furthermore,  the number of students  that  can  be

admitted  to  an  institution  of  higher  learning

depends   on   a   number  of  factors,   such   as

accommodation, staffing and finance, which in  turn

depend  on  the  economy of  the  country  and  its

manpower requirements. There can, therefore, be  no

inherent right to higher education for anybody.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the "students' inherent right to

higher  education" is a stirring  slogan  which  is

often used by politicians and political parties  in

their  struggle for political power. However,  once

power  is seized, no party ever honours it, whether

it  be in a western democracy or a Communist state,

for  the  simple reason that it is only  an  empty,

albeit catching, slogan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent sitting of Parliament, the Member for

Crawford  made a pertinent point that the  days  of

slogan  shouting  were over. I am  afraid  the  so-called   "students'  inherent   right   to   higher

education"  is  precisely the  type  of  empty  and

meaningless  slogan  shouting so  deplored  by  the

Member for Crawford.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I

ask  my  supplementary questions, I would  like  to

point  out  that  I do not shout empty  slogans.  I

believe in the students' right to higher education,

and I believe in what I am saying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to clarify a few

questions.  Firstly, in view of so much talk  about

the  political  stability that is existing  in  our

country, are the grounds enunciated by the Minister

and  on  which  we  base  the  whole  question   of

Certificates of Suitability still valid?  Secondly,

we have just been informed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



by   the  Minister  that  seven  applications  were

rejected.  Although  the  Minister  has  said  that

breakdown figures by institutions are not kept, may

I  know  whether  the  seven  rejected  cases  were

citizens or non-citizens, and can the Minister  say

for  which  institution  of higher  learning  these

cases  applied?  Thirdly,  the  Minister  has  made

mention  of  the minimum qualifications  for  entry

into  an institution of higher learning. With  such

licensing  of  right  to enter  an  institution,  I

wonder whether it is also one of the qualifications

to  be  found suitable by the licensing  authority,

apart from the required academic qualifications?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

have the facts regarding the citizenship status  of

the  seven  cases which were rejected  on  security

grounds.  But I can supply the information  to  the

Member for Crawford in due course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grounds for the introduction of the

Certificates  of  Suitability are  still  valid  in

spite  of  the  political stability of  our  state.

Maybe  the relatively peaceful conditions that  are

prevailing  in  our  universities  is,   in   large

measure, due to the existence of the Certificate of

Suitability requirement.

<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap</b> asked the Minister for

Education  if  his Ministry is satisfied  that  the

number  of pre-university classes in Malay  schools

will  be  sufficient to meet the  demands  as  from

1971.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ghazali Bin Ismail (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Inche Mohd. Ghazali Bin Ismail) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

admission  to  our pre-university  classes  in  all

language  streams  is  based upon  the  applicants'

performance in the relevant public examination  for

Secondary   4  pupils  as  well  as  their   extra-curricular  activities. According to our estimates,

sufficient places will be available in and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



after  1971  for  all candidates  who  possess  the

requisite  qualifications  for  admission  to  pre-university classes in the Malay stream.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Parliamentary

Secretary clarify why the pre-university classes in

the Malay stream are for Arts and not for Science?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ghazali Bin Ismail -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ghazali:</b> Sir, no provision is made

for  the  Science  stream in pre-university  Malay-medium classes because, firstly, in the early years

of Malay secondary education, Malay-medium students

normally  offered  General  Science  as  a  science

subject. It was, therefore, felt that the provision

of  a  Science stream could be considered only when

the  Malay  stream students were able  to  do  pure

sciences up to Secondary 4 level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, at present the students in Secondary 3

and  Secondary 4 at the Sekolah Menengah  Tun  Seri

Lanang   study  their  pure  science  subjects   in

English. These students can therefore be eventually

channelled  to  the  English-medium  pre-university

classes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the

Parliamentary Secretary why the Malay  stream  pre-university classes are only in the Sang Nila  Utama

Secondary  School. Will the Minister also  consider

the  setting up of Malay pre-university classes  in

the Ahmad Ibrahim Integrated Secondary School? This

is  because in the Sembawang area, there  are  many

Malay  stream  students. If pre-university  classes

are established there, it will be convenient to all

of them.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ghazali Bin Ismail -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ghazali:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to have

more than one centre would mean the redeployment of

staff resources concentrated at the Sang Nila Utama

Secondary  School  to  the  second  centre.  It  is

considered  that this would not be advisable  if  a

high  standard of performance of the pre-university

students is to be achieved. Furthermore, I think to

date the need to open another pre-university centre

for Malay-medium students does not arise.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Low Yong Nguan</b> asked the Minister for

children  a  sound ethical foundation  through  the

inculcation  of  the principle of  loyalty  to  the

state,  social  awareness and civic  consciousness.

The  current accent on extra-curricular  activities

with  particular emphasis on sports promotion opens

up  further opportunities for character  and  moral

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a male reaches the age of 18, he will

undergo  a  period of national service. During  his

training  in the Armed Forces, heavy emphasis  will

be laid on developing patriotism, discipline and  a

sense of responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who do not fall within the ambit of

school    or   national   service,   the   People's

Association    organises    healthy    recreational

activities for the population as a whole,  and  for

youth  in particular. The People's Association  was

established as a statutory body in 1960 to  promote

group    participation   in    social,    cultural,

educational  and  physical  activities.   Community

centres were built all over the Republic to provide

facilities  for these activities. Staff  were  sent

abroad   to   broaden  their  experiences   through

attending   training  courses,   work   camps   and

conferences. In 1964, the Youth Leadership Training

Centre was set up to fill a long-felt need for  the

training   of  youth  leaders.  In  the  activities

organised   by  the  People's  Association,   youth

participation  has  always been encouraged  with  a

view   not   only  to  developing  their  character

potential, but also to fostering in them a sense of

national identity and a dedicated spirit of service

to the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other organisations, like the Council of Social

Service,  the  National Youth  Leadership  Training

Institute, the Outward Bound School, and the  youth

organisations    affiliated   to    the    People's

Association, also cater for the promotion of  youth

activities and training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be seen that youth activities are being

encouraged  in  many  diverse  ways  by   different

departments  in  the  Republic  according  to   the

various  needs  of  youth during  their  successive

levels of development. It would not be possible  or

necessary, therefore, for a single organisation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>

is  not  acceptable to both the World Bank and  the

Asian  Development Bank which do  not  wish  to  be

involved as debenture holders. Therefore, power  to

borrow direct must be provided.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jurong Port, with its five berths, started

operation  in early 1966 and the cargo handled  has

now passed the one million-ton mark. It is expected

that, with the rapid development of Jurong Town and

with    the   increasing   number   of   industries

established,  the  cargo handled will  increase  by

about  20 per cent per year for the next ten years.

The  Port  has  now reached full occupancy.  It  is

therefore  necessary that it be  expanded  to  cope

with  the  future  demand. The expansion  which  is

planned  involves the reclamation of Pulau  Chichir

to  make  available 40 acres of land, extension  of

Berth  No. 5 from its present 465 feet to its  full

length  of about 900 feet, and connection of  Berth

No. 1 to Pulau Chichir by a causeway to provide for

2.400  feet  of additional deep-water wharves.  The

total cost of this expansion is about $30 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the large sum involved, the Jurong

Town   Corporation  has  applied   to   the   Asian

Development  Bank for a loan of about $25  million.

Negotiations   for   this  loan   have   now   been

successfully  concluded, and the President  of  the

Asian Development Bank will be in Singapore to sign

the  Loan Agreement on the 4th September, 1970. The

early passage of this Bill is therefore necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  view  of the very substantial amount  of  money

that is required to develop the port facilities  of

the Jurong Town Corporation, I am just wondering if

the Minister can tell us what arrangements will  be

made to ensure that there is no duplication of  the

services  that  are already being provided  by  the

Port  of Singapore Authority. Or, as time goes  on,

could there be a conflict of interests between  the

two  Authorities  as regards the type  of  services

that can be rendered?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the problem of

duplication  of  services has been  very  carefully

considered  by  the World Bank which  finances  the

Port of Singapore Authority, and also by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



Jurong  Town Corporation, which is now  asking  for

this  loan  from  the Asian Development  Bank.  The

World  Bank,  in its loan to the P.S.A.,  specified

that  there should be consultation with them before

any  expansion  of  port services  is  effected  in

Jurong.  In  this particular case, they have  given

their   approval  for  this  loan  by   the   Asian

Development Bank to proceed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also suggest that, because the Jurong

Port  is  now being administered by the  P.S.A, on

behalf  of  the Jurong Town Corporation,  in  fact,

there  will  be  no  duplication in  practice.  The

nature  of the cargo handled by the Port in  Jurong

is  also entirely different from the kind of  cargo

which  is  being  handled in the P.S.A, area.  The

Jurong  Port  handles, in the  main,  bulk  cargoes

which  are  intended  for the Jurong  New  Town.  I

therefore consider that there will, in practice, be

no duplication at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the law now stands, trust funds may only be

invested   in   what   is   known   as   authorised

investments, which are listed in section 4  of  the

Trustees Act, 1967. There is, amongst other things,

specific  prohibition on the  investment  of  trust

funds  in  the  form of loans to a company,  unless

that company is an approved company which satisfies

three conditions, namely:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) its ordinary share capital is not less

than S$5 million;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) it has paid a dividend at the rate of not

less than 5 per cent per annum for each of  the

last  three  years prior to  the  time  of  the

investment; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the total amount of the borrowings of the

approved  company  from all  sources  does  not

exceed  two-thirds of the amount for  the  time

being secured to the approved company from  its

borrowers.



<br><br>It follows, therefore, that in order to qualify as

such, a company must have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



been  in  existence  as  a  Singapore  incorporated

company for not less than three years prior to  the

time  of the investment, assuming, of course,  that

it  has  straightaway paid a dividend of  not  less

than  5  per centum for the very first year of  its

incorporation.   Indeed   a   company   which   has

reconstructed itself for the sole reason of seeking

to qualify as an approved company, or a new company

which  has taken over another company qualified  as

an approved company, may be caught by reason of the

exclusionary  provisions. In order,  therefore,  to

accommodate  such  companies which  may  heretofore

have  been properly enjoying the status of  trustee

investment companies and have been excluded  merely

because of the technical requirements of section  3

of  the Act in respect of the status of an approved

company, the proviso in section 4 (2) (b) has  been

introduced. The Government recognises the need  for

the  prohibition at present contained in section  4

(2)  (b) ,  the  object of which  provision  is,  of

course,  to ensure that such a company is  a  going

concern  and has made profits sufficient enough  to

allow  it  to declare a reasonable rate of  return.

This  general  rule  is  thus  preserved,  but  the

proviso accords a flexibility which was missing and

which was not envisaged in the Act of 1967. It  may

be  said,  therefore,  that the  present  amendment

proposed  in the Bill merely removes the  technical

impediments  in  the  way of  former  reconstructed

companies   but  leaves  untouched  the  safeguards

contained in the Act of 1967. Companies which  have

been  amalgamated or been subject to reconstruction

but  which are essentially the same as their former

selves,  as  it  were, will not  be  thus  unfairly

prejudiced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendment as now proposed is to remove

any  doubt whatsoever that a company which has been

reconstructed  and amalgamates with another,  which

other company has heretofore enjoyed the status  of

an approved company, or has taken over the whole of

the  business and assets of a company which on  its

own has attained the status of an approved company,

would  after  such reconstruction and amalgamation,

or   taking-over  or  merger,  be  deemed  to  have

satisfied   the   principal  conditions   of   this

shall not operate if this new company fails to  pay

a  dividend at the rate of not less than  five  per

cent  in  respect  of its full  financial  year  of

operations  or  indeed in respect  of  any  of  its

subsequent years. It has been thought necessary  to

introduce this further amendment in order to ensure

the  viability  of such a company  so  long  as  it

wishes  to  continue  receiving  trust  monies   as

investments.

<div align="center"><b>LAND TITLES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before this House, as Members will

note,   is  a  rather  technical  one.  I  propose,

therefore,   to  confine  myself   to   the   major

amendments proposed therein. These amendments  are,

in  the main, designed to bring more lands that are

approved for development under the Ordinance and to

bring  the  Ordinance into line with the provisions

of  the  Land  Titles (Strata) Act, 1967,  and  the

Planning Ordinance, 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill is designed to hasten the

pace  generally of conversion to the Torrens System

of land registration by empowering the Registrar of

Titles  to  bring unregistered land, in respect  of

which  permission to develop has been granted under

the Planning Ordinance, 1959, under the control  of

the Ordinance by issuing a qualified certificate of

title  in  respect  thereof.  The  registration  of

conveyances  can  thus  be  effected  more  quickly

without survey being finalised. This provision will

have  the  beneficial effect of enabling purchasers

of  units  of new housing estates and,  in  certain

circumstances,  owners  of flats  to  obtain  their

title   deeds   with  a  minimum  of   delay,   and

immeasurably  assist landowners  who  wish  to  use

their  title deeds as security for loans to finance

commercial or industrial undertakings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 deals with implied easements for the

passage  of water, electricity, drainage,  gas  and

sewerage  in each lot of land forming part  of  the

same  housing estate. The purpose of this amendment

is  to  resolve the difficulty in carrying out  the

existing  provisions of the Ordinance  relating  to

notification of easements on certificates of titles

where cross-easements in respect of all lots  in  a

housing  estate  are  required  to  be  created.  A

similar  provision  appears  in  the  Land   Titles

(Strata) Act, 1967, which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>



has satisfactorily solved the difficulty under that

Act with regard to flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 amends section 112 of the Ordinance.

The  existing provision in section 112 (4)  of  the

Ordinance  does  not  specify the  cases  where  an

application to remove a restriction could  be  made

to  the land. The applicant, therefore, has to rely

on  common law cases. The provision now under  this

clause  will enable the court to remove restrictive

covenants   on  the  application  of   any   person

interested  in land where, by reason of the  change

of  user  of  such  land, the  continuance  of  the

restriction will impede development for  public  or

private purposes, or where the removal thereof will

not  materially injure the person entitled  to  the

benefit  of the restrictive covenant. Provision  is

also  made  for  compensation to  be  paid  by  the

applicant to any person entitled to the benefit  of

the restriction. This will thus allow landowners  a

reasonable opportunity of developing their land  in

line  with  any  planning user that is  imposed  by

Government.  This  amendment  will  meet  in   some

measure the representations of the Law Society  for

the  enactment of legislation for the discharge  or

modification of restrictive covenants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 amends section 127 of the Ordinance and

provides  that  claims may be brought  against  the

assurance fund constituted under section 123 of the

Ordinance  only if the Registrar or any  member  of

his  staff  can  be held liable for  any  omission,

mistake or misfeasance in the bringing of such land

under  the  provisions  of  the  Ordinance  or   in

registering any instrument.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment that relates to the assurance

fund occurs in clause 7 which amends section 33  of

the   Ordinance   dealing  with  applications   for

possessory titles. Under the existing provisions of

the Ordinance, any applicant for a possessory title

may be required to contribute to the assurance fund

such fee by way of indemnity, not greater than  two

per  cent  of  the  value of  the  land.  Sir,  the

Explanatory Statement to the Bill is incorrect  and

misleading to the extent that it suggests that an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



applicant  is required to contribute. This  should,

of  course,  read "may be required to  contribute".

The  issue of a title to a possessory owner of land

exposes  the Government to claims for the  recovery

of  damages against the assurance fund under clause

17 of the Bill. Such claims will normally depend on

the  prevailing  market value of the  land.  It  is

considered  that the present rate of two  per  cent

may be inadequate. In certifying a title that rests

on   adverse  possession,  the  assurance  fund  is

exposed  to  a  greater degree of  risk  than  with

regard  to  other  forms of  certification.  It  is

relevant that a person with a possessory title  is,

by  virtue of subsection (6) of section 33  of  the

Ordinance,  deemed to be a purchaser of  value  who

thus acquires many of the benefits conferred by the

provisions   of   the   Ordinance   dealing    with

indefeasibility  of  title.  It  is   proposed   to

increase this rate to five per centum which is  the

present rate required to be paid under Rule  43  of

the Land Titles Rules, 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 confers power upon the court to rectify

the land-register in certain circumstances, that is

to  say,  where two or more persons have by mistake

been   registered  as  proprietor   of   the   same

registered estate or interest in the land  that  is

registered,  or  where the court is satisfied  that

any  registration or notification has been obtained

through  fraud,  omission or  mistake.  At  present

there  is  provision  under  section  131  of   the

Ordinance  for rectification only by the  Registrar

where errors have occurred in the land-register.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendments to which I have referred up

to  this  point  cover the new  concepts  of  major

importance  that  are sought to be introduced  into

the  Ordinance. The other amendments which are  not

without  importance are intended either  to  remove

anomalies, for example, clause 19, or to strengthen

and  improve  the administration of  the  Ordinance

(clauses  3,  4,  5, 8 and 16), or to  protect  the

interests  of the Government (clause  12),  or  the

interests of the legal profession (clause  9).  The

remaining amendments have been explained briefly in

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



Explanatory  Statement to  the  Bill  and  do  not,

therefore, call for any special comment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, which has been drafted in close

consultation with the Law Society of Singapore, has

benefited   considerably  from   its   advice   and

suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill constitutes a workable piece of land

legislation and will help to ensure that the law in

force  in Singapore in relation to the registration

of  titles to registered land keeps pace  with  the

changing  needs of our rapidly developing and  fast

industrialising society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Constitution in

order  to ensure that Bills affecting "the  defence

or  security of Singapore or which relate to public

safety,  peace or good order in Singapore"  can  be

introduced into this House and made law without the

need   of  further  scrutiny  by  the  Presidential

Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the law now stands, Money Bills (as defined by

the Constitution) and Bills certified as urgent  by

the  Prime  Minister may be made law without  prior

consideration thereof by the Council. In respect of

Money  Bills, provisions in the Constitution itself

exclude  their consideration by the Council.  Bills

certified  as  urgent  by the Prime  Minister  are,

after  their having been made law, referred to  the

Council for its opinion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members may therefore ask why the  need  for

this  amendment. Recently the Presidential  Council

considered the Enlistment Bill (Bill No. 17/70).  I

understand that among other arguments against  some

of  the  provisions, there was one that Ministerial

discretion  was  so  wide  as  to  be  possible  of

discrimination.  In this case, a  majority  of  the

Council upheld an interpretation of the legislation

which did not cause the Bill to be referred back to

the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it brought home to the Government the

realisation  that  it  could  have  been  extremely

difficult  to  explain, either to the  Presidential

Council, or in this House, sensitive issues  as  to

why  exemption  or  deferment of  call-up  for  any

person  or  group of persons would not  be  in  the

national  interests.  On  matters  of  defence   or

security,  there  are times when a Minister  cannot

give  his  reasons. For example, a person aged  18,

otherwise fit and eligible, might have to  be  left

out of the armed forces because he is known to have

pro-Communist  or  other extremist  tendencies,  or

that he comes from such a family.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had envisaged these teething problems when the

Presidential  Council  Act  was  passed.  When  the

President formally swore in members of the Council,

he had this to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`From the experience of the workings of your

Council  and  of  any teething  problems  that  may

arise,   amendments  to  the  law   governing   the

Presidential Council may be necessary.'



<br><br>This  has  been  found to be the  case  in  a  Bill

relating to defence and security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally it would have been the President who

would  certify such a Bill. But as the Presidential

Council  advises the President, it has been thought

more appropriate that the Prime Minister should  so

certify.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps in conclusion, Sir, it may be useful if I

were to recall what was said in this House when the

principle of a Presidential Council was agreed  to,

namely,   that  this  Council  cannot   limit   the

sovereignty  of  Parliament. It  is  not  a  supra-Parliamentary body overseeing this Parliament. Only

the  Courts can interpret what has been legislated,

and only the electorate can bring about a change in

the legislative policies of this Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House will recall that in

December  1968 the Environmental Public Health  Act

was passed. This Act was brought into operation  on

the  2nd January. 1969. Since its enactment,  great

strides  have  been  made  by  the  Public   Health

Division  of  the Ministry of Health to  raise  the

environmental health standards in our Republic and,

in particular, the problems of public cleansing and

littering  in public places have to a large  extent

been resolved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have now before you a Bill seeking to amend

the  Environmental Public Health Act of 1968.  This

Bill  is  the  result of a thorough review  of  the

various  provisions  of the Act  and  is  aimed  at

strengthening  some of the existing provisions,  as

well  as  providing for some newer health  problems

which were not envisaged during the drafting of the

principal   Act.  The  primary  purpose   of   this

amendment Bill is to effect further improvements in

the  field of environmental health based  upon  the

experience gained since the Act came into operation

some 20 months ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a determined effort put in both by the

Government and the people, Singapore has attained a

high  standard  of environmental health.  Singapore

now  enjoys  the  reputation of being  one  of  the

cleanest  cities in the world - a  fact  which  has

been acknowledged and acclaimed by various visitors

to Singapore. However, Singapore has a highly built-up urban environment where living space is becoming

more  and  more congested as we build  upwards.  We

cannot  therefore  afford to  relax  standards.  We

should strive for even higher standards so that our

people can enjoy even better living conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important amendment in the Bill is clause 11

which  seeks to repeal the existing section  56  of

the  principal  Act to enable the  Commissioner  of

Public  Health or the Director of Public  Works  to

require  the  owner or occupier  of  any  house  or

building  or  such parts thereof, which  is  in  an

unclean,  grimy, neglected, unkempt  or  insanitary

condition, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>



cleanse  and  paint  or  lime-wash  internally   or

externally  or both internally and externally  such

house  or  building.  A  new  section  56A  further

provides,  in the case of rent-controlled premises,

for  the owner to recover from the tenant the costs

and  expenses incurred in executing any work within

the  interior of the controlled premises  in  equal

instalments  over  a  period of  24  months.  These

provisions are necessary if some of the older parts

of  Singapore not yet designated for urban  renewal

or  redevelopment  are not to  deteriorate  further

into unsightly slums. This is particularly true  of

the  rent-controlled premises whose owners  do  not

deem  it  economic nor have any desire  to  prevent

them   from  becoming  dilapidated,  resulting   in

ugliness and insanitation. This is contrary to  our

objective of making Singapore a clean and beautiful

city. Under the new provisions, such buildings will

have  to  spruce up for both aesthetic and sanitary

reasons.  Some may consider that this is an  unfair

requirement on the part of Government being imposed

on  owners  of  property; but in  a  compact  urban

society, certain norms of conduct will have  to  be

observed for the greater good of the members of the

community  as a whole. I wish, however,  to  assure

hon.  Members  of this House that the powers  given

under   this   section  will  be   exercised   with

discretion and in a reasonable manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of problems, such as the removal of

nightsoil  and  domestic  refuse  in  new   housing

estates,  have  been  encountered  when  developers

allowed the occupation of these estates before they

had   completed  the  sewerage,  drainage  or  road

facilities. This can now be dealt with under clause

4  whereby  the Commissioner of Public  Health  can

require  the  developer to provide at  his  expense

such   services   as  may  be   required   by   the

Commissioner for a specified period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 seeks to prohibit the use of human

excreta  for the purpose of manuring potted  plants

in  domestic  premises, as this practice  not  only

results in creating a smell nuisance, but can  also

spread disease.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our declared policy on the control of water

pollution  and  its  eventual  elimination,  closer

attention  must  be  directed  to  the  problem  of

dumping  refuse  and garbage into streams,  rivers,

canals  and  drains, as well as  the  pollution  of

reservoirs, lakes and catchment areas. This will no

longer  be  dealt with by the issue of notices  and

summonses as formerly provided under subsection (2)

(c) and subsection (3) (d) to (g) of section 50  of

the  principal Act which is an extremely cumbersome

procedure. The amendment proposed by clause 6  will

bring  this problem within the ambit of section  26

to  enable speedier enforcement action by means  of

"ticketing". Further, enabling provisions have been

incorporated so that "ticketing" action may also be

taken   against   any   person   contravening   any

requirements in respect of public cleansing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summons action against hawkers operating in

prohibited areas provided under section 38 will now

be  amended  to "ticketing" action similar  to  the

existing  provisions of sections 40 and 41  of  the

Act  which  are  applicable  to  unlicensed  stall-holders and itinerant hawkers. This is provided  in

clause 8.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medical Officers of Health and Public Health

Engineers  will  be empowered by  an  amendment  to

section  57  to  deal with the  problem  of  wasps,

hornets  and  other insects which  are  capable  of

stinging.  This  is laid down in  clause  12.  This

problem will now be handled by my Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 deals with the problem of stagnant

water  due  to  inadequate  drainage  arising  from

existing  subdivision of land without  the  setting

aside  of  drainage  reserves with  its  consequent

health  hazards.  This  will  be  resolved  by  the

proposed amendment to section 76 which will  enable

the  Commissioner of Public Health  or  the  Public

Health  Engineer to require owners to  provide  the

necessary  drains and, if necessary, to carry  such

drains through adjoining lands or lots which happen

to lie in the line of natural drainage.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 empowers the Commissioner or any

Medical   Officer  of  Health  or   public   health

auxiliary  at any time to enter into,  inspect  and

search any premises used or believed to be used for

the purpose of offensive trades.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have tried to highlight all the important clauses in the amendment Bill. I have no doubt of the necessity of these proposed amendments to strengthen the hands of Government in dealing with the problems of environmental health. However, what is more important is the people's

understanding   of   these   provisions   and   the

objectives of a better environment which they  seek

to  achieve.  I  have every confidence  that,  with

understanding,  our people will  again  give  their

active    support   and   co-operation    in    the

implementation  of  the  measures  that   will   be

undertaken  under the amended Bill,  and  we  shall

advance  a  step  further  towards  improving   the

quality of our environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

<div align="center"><b>BANKING BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law regulating banking in Singapore at

present   is  substantially  the  Malayan   Banking

Ordinance of 1958 which was modified in April  1967

only  to  empower  the  Singapore  Commissioner  of

Banking to administer this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



law.  At  that time, a draft Banking Bill had  been

prepared  by  the International Monetary  Fund  for

Singapore  but it was considered that, in  view  of

the  impending change in the monetary system caused

by  the  redemption of the Malayan dollar  and  the

issue of the Singapore dollar, there would be  some

advantage in avoiding unnecessary changes in  other

parts  of the system and, therefore, in maintaining

the  status  quo of banking in Singapore  vis-a-vis

Malaysia. Now the redemption of currency issued  by

the  Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and

British Borneo, has all but been completed, and the

Singapore  dollar is firmly and fully  established.

Moreover,  the banking legislation in Malaysia  has

also been amended. It is therefore appropriate that

we  should now enact our own legislation to include

modifications which would overcome the shortcomings

of the present legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banking Bill now before Members incorporates

the   basic   features  of  the   current   Banking

Ordinance, but it also introduces a number  of  new

provisions,  the  most  important  of   which   are

designed  to  ensure  better  and  sounder  banking

practices   and  to  better  safeguard  depositors'

interests. They include restrictions on the  amount

a   bank   can  grant  to  a  single  customer,   a

prohibition from engaging in trade, restrictions on

the  extent  a bank can acquire equity capital  and

immovable  property,  and on the  amount  of  loans

extended   for   the  purpose  of  purchasing   and

improving immovable properties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More comprehensive definitions appear for "bank"

and  "banking business". A new concept of  "capital

funds"  has  been  introduced  so  that  a  healthy

relationship between a bank's lending power and its

net  worth  in  Singapore is  maintained.  "Capital

funds"  mean,  for  a  bank whose  head  office  is

situated  in  Singapore, its  paid-up  capital  and

reserves  and,  for  a bank whose  head  office  is

outside  Singapore, the net head office  funds  and

such  other  liabilities as  the  Commissioner  may

decide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the current legislation, the operation of a

bank in Singapore requires



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



a licence. The minimum capital requirement has been

raised  from $2 million to $3 million. In the  case

of  a  foreign bank, this has been raised  from  $5

million  to $6 million with a requirement that  the

net  head  office funds in Singapore should  be  at

least  $3  million.  At present foreign  banks  are

required   to  hold  $2  million  approved   assets

locally.   It   is   not  considered   that   these

requirements  will  cause any difficulty  to  banks

already licensed, but a transitional period of  two

years, which can be further extended by approval of

the Minister, is being provided for compliance with

the requirements. It is further proposed to require

banks  and  their  branches  to  pay  licence  fees

annually.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at present, certain statistical statements

will   be   required   to  be  furnished   to   the

Commissioner and the Chief Statistician. Every bank

shall also send to the Commissioner particulars  of

all  advances, loans and credit facilities  granted

to  any of its Directors, any firm in which any  of

its  Directors  is  a partner, or  to  any  related

corporation,  etc.  The Commissioner  may  prohibit

such  further grants of advances, loans  or  credit

facilities  or  impose restrictions on  the  grants

unless  he  is  satisfied that these would  not  be

against  the  interests of the  depositors  of  the

bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V of the Banking Bill spells out

restrictions  on  certain  types  of  business  and

prohibitions  on others. These prohibiting  clauses

are  new  and are designed to safeguard depositors'

interests.  They  have  been  recommended  by   the

International Monetary Fund, and are found  in  the

banking  laws  of  a  number  of  other  countries.

Briefly,  they are that no bank will be allowed  to

grant  to  any single customer any credit  facility

which  is at any time more than 60 per cent of  its

capital funds, though this can be increased to  100

per  cent  with  the approval of the  Commissioner.

Again,  no  bank shall grant any advance or  credit

facility  against the security of its  own  shares.

Unsecured facilities to any Director, any  firm  in

which any of its Directors is a partner, or to  any

related  corporation, etc.,  would  be  limited  to

$5,000.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



Unsecured facilities to its employees would also be

limited,  nor will a bank be allowed to acquire  or

hold equity capital or other undertakings exceeding

in  the aggregate 40 per cent of its capital funds.

Provision is made, however, for the Commissioner to

approve any shareholding in any corporation set  up

for   the  purpose  of  promoting  development   in

Singapore.  To prevent speculation on  property,  a

provision  has  been  made  that,  apart  from  the

properties used as banking offices and for  housing

its employees, no bank shall be allowed to purchase

or  acquire immovable properties exceeding  40  per

cent  of its capital funds. Loans extended for  the

purpose   of  purchasing  or  improving   immovable

properties are limited to 30 per cent of its  local

deposits   and,   with   the   approval   of    the

Commissioner, up to 60 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No bank will be allowed to do trading on its own

account.   Whilst  this  provision  has  not   been

specifically  spelt out in the present legislation,

banks in Singapore do not in fact undertake trading

on  their own account and it is envisaged  that  no

difficulty will be encountered with this  provision

which is common to most other banking laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are transitional provisions to enable banks

which have, before the date of coming into force of

the    legislation,   entered   into   transactions

prohibited  under  this  law,  to  liquidate   such

transactions or bring them within the law. In order

to   allow  some  banks  time  to  adjust  to   the

requirements  of  the  new  Banking   Act,   I   am

introducing  an  amendment to the Bill  which  will

enable  the  Commissioner, if he is satisfied  that

such  time is required for adjustments, to grant  a

grace  period  not  exceeding  two  years  to   any

particular  bank  from the provisions  of  sections

25,27  and  28  of  this Bill  (i.e.,  restrictions

covering   loans  to  a  single  borrower,   equity

investment and immovable property).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the current legislation, there will be

provisions to require banks to keep minimum  liquid

assets  in  Singapore  and  to  maintain  statutory

reserves



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>



with   the   Accountant-General.  There   is   also

provision  to  allow  control  over  banks  on  the

regulation of interest rates, discount, commission,

and  other  charges of banks. The Commissioner  may

also make recommendations on credit policy and,  if

these  are  not  complied with,  the  Minister  may

impose  such  directions as may  be  necessary  for

their implementation. Inspection of books, accounts

and  transactions  of  a bank under  conditions  of

secrecy  is  also  provided for. The  Minister  may

direct the Commissioner to make an investigation of

any  books, accounts, and transactions of any  bank

if  he  believes  the bank is carrying  on  unsound

business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner and the Minister are provided

with  the necessary powers to take over the control

of  a  bank if it is unable to meet its obligations

or  is conducting its business to the detriment  of

its  depositors.  The duration of control  is  laid

down and within this period the bank is required to

co-operate with the Commissioner. The Commissioner,

with   the  approval  of  the  Minister,  may  also

prohibit any bank from carrying on banking business

if   he  considers  it  in  the  interests  of  the

depositors of the bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill introduces the concept of numbered

accounts,  that is, accounts which are identifiable

only  by number or code word. No bank shall operate

numbered accounts except with the approval  of  the

Minister  who may attach conditions, qualifications

and  limitations.  The owners of numbered  accounts

shall only be known to senior officers of the bank.

Provisions  are  made for absolute secrecy  on  the

part   of   bank   officials  and  no   information

concerning the identity of the owner of a  numbered

account shall, be given, unless the account  holder

permits it or he is declared a bankrupt or  a  suit

arises between him and the bank or when the account

holder  is required to do so by order of  the  High

Court  made  for  special cause  in  any  civil  or

criminal proceedings.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new provision has been added prohibiting

disclosure  of information relating to the  affairs

of  the  bank's customers to any person or body  of

persons who are not resident in Singapore or to any

foreign  Government  or organisations,  unless  the

customer permits it or he is declared a bankrupt or

the information is for the purpose of assessing the

credit-worthiness of the customer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for the appointment of

approved    auditors   and   their   duties,    the

establishment  of a Clearing House, bank  holidays,

priority  of  deposit liabilities, disqualification

of  Directors and employees of banks,  offences  by

Directors, and power to compound offences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also provided that the operation of the

Companies Act, 1967, shall not be affected by  this

legislation  though,  in  case  of  conflict,  this

legislation will prevail. The legislation will also

not  apply  to  the  Post Office  Savings  Bank,  a

registered  co-operative society, a licensed  pawn-broker, or a licensed finance company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I should like, in conclusion of my explanatory remarks, to say that this Banking Bill has received consideration over a considerable period of time, that consultations have been held during its preparation with the Association of Banks and others interested regarding its

provisions, but responsibility for the Bill in  its

final  form  of  course remains with  my  Ministry.

Since  its publication, a number of representations

from banks have been received and I can assure them

that  every consideration has been given  to  their

representations and that it is not  my  purpose  to

administer  the law in any way which  will  curtail

the  effectiveness of the banking system. While the

Bill  would provide powers for the Commissioner  to

have   tighter   control  over  banks   and   their

activities,  the modernisation of the  banking  law

should  cut down unsound practices and so  work  to

the  general  interests of depositors, the  banking

system and the public at large.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I will ask only one or two questions. I  have

been  given to understand that the control  of  the

banking business in Singapore has been very strict.

After  the  passage of this Banking Bill,  can  the

Minister say whether new licences will be issued to

`the  banks  in  Singapore? If so, what  conditions

should be complied with?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, under the law

the  Minister  is empowered to issue new  licences.

The  practice over the last few years has been  not

to  issue any further licences because obviously we

have too many banks in Singapore. If there are very

good  and  sound reasons why more banks  should  be

licensed - if, for example, in certain branches  of

banking  there  is any inadequacy - then  obviously

such applications will be entertained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not consider that the present minimum

requirement  of  $3  million  is  a  very  adequate

qualification for banks in Singapore.  It  will  be

imposed on the present banks and there should be no

difficulty  for most of them to meet  this  capital

requirement.  But I do not consider  that  any  new

application  with  just  $3  million  will  be   an

adequate reason for a new licence to be issued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 33 accordingly disagreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Clause 33 -



<pre>

"Relief from       33.-(1) Any bank  whose  opposed  head

 limitations     office  is  situated  outside  Singapore

 by sections     may apply in writing to the Commissioner

 25, 27, 28      for  an order relieving that  bank  from

                 the restrictions  or limitations imposed

                 by sections 25, 27 and 28 of this Act in

                 interests    of   the   creditors    and

                 depositors of the bank.



                    (3) An order made by the Commissioner

                 under  subsection (1)  of  this  section

                 shall  be  effective for such period  as

                 cease  to  have effect on such  date  as

                 may  be  specified in the  order  except

                 that  no  order  may be  made  which  is

                 expressed  to have effect for  a  period

                 longer  than two years from the date  of

                 the coming into operation of this Act.



                   (4) The Commissioner may make an order

                the coming into operation of this  Act.".

                                      - [Mr Hon Sui Sen]

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought up, and read the First time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the clause be read a. Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of this clause is to provide relaxation from the provisions of clauses 25, 27 and 28' which are based upon the capital funds concept; that is to bring in

restrictions  related  to  the  head  office  funds

rather  than  the paid-up capital and  reserves,  a

concept more common in other legislation elsewhere.

In  my  view,  there  should be  no  difficulty  in

foreign  banks transferring, if necessary, some  of

their-working capital funds as additional funds  to

Singapore  in order to continue their  business  in

Singapore in conformity with the provisions of  the

clauses I have mentioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have received representations from the

Association of Banks and the International  Chamber

of Commerce on behalf of some of their members that

these   clauses  are  unduly  restrictive  in   the

carrying  on of their banking business. One  answer

to  this,  may  well be that the local  banks  will

welcome  the  opportunity to take on  the  business

which  they  are  unwilling to do  by  bringing  in

additional funds. It can be contended by the  local

banks that the amendment I have introduced can lead

to   unfair  discrimination  against  them  because

foreign banks can, on the face of it, expand  their

business  to the detriment of the business  of  the

local banks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, because of the fragile climate in

which  I  am  told  the industrial  and  commercial

growth  is  nurtured,  I  have  by  this  amendment

allowed  for  relief to be considered  on  specific

application  by  any  bank  whose  head  office  is

outside  Singapore,  but only  for  the  first  two

years.  The bank must, however, show that any  such

relaxation is, really necessary and will not be  to

the detriment of depositors.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, as a result of historical factors,

the  various monetary functions normally associated

with  a  Central Bank are currently being performed

by   a   number  of  Government  departments   ;and

agencies. For instance, the responsibility for  the

currency issue lies with the Currency Board,  which

is a statutory authority. Then, the Commissioner of

Banking  and the Commissioner of Finance  Companies

is  responsible for the regulation and  supervision

of banks and finance companies, whilst the Exchange

Control  Department is responsible for all  matters

concerning    foreign   exchange.   Finally,    the

Department  of Overseas Investment in  my  Economic

Development   Division  is  responsible   for   the

management  of  the Government's  external  assets,

while the Accountant-General is responsible for the

sale of Treasury Bills to banks and other financial

institutions, the raising of domestic loans and the

management of the clearing house system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite clearly, the task of co-ordinating and

directing    the    policy   of   these    .diverse

organisations makes for a full-time occupation  and

while  the  present  system of ad  hoc  control  by

committee has worked reasonably well up to now, the

increasing   complexity  of  modern   banking   and

monetary   management   makes   it   necessary   to

streamline the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>



system. Apart from rationalising the structure  and

organisation of the system, the bringing  together,

under  one single authority, of all these different

organisations  will enable a coherent  and  uniform

policy to be developed for all monetary matters. In

addition, it is hoped that with the passage of time

will  come  the development of greater professional

expertise.   This  is  vital  for   the   efficient

functioning of a modern monetary system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore proposed in the Bill now before

the  House  that  there  should  be  established  a

Monetary  Authority  of Singapore,  comprising  the

departments  I  have  mentioned  with  the   single

exception  of the Currency Board. It is considered,

for  the  time  being,  that  the  currency-issuing

functions  of the Board should remain with  it  and

that  the  Board should continue as an  independent

and  separate  statutory authority.  The  automatic

mechanism  of the Currency Board with its  100  per

cent  external assets backing has been and will  be

of  great  psychological importance in  maintaining

confidence  in  the  Singapore  Dollar.  Thus   the

operations  and  the  assets backing  the  Currency

issue  will be unaffected and will continue  to  be

clearly  identified.  The Monetary  Authority  will

therefore  for the time being have no  note-issuing

functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to discuss in some detail the

provisions of the Bill for the establishment of the

Monetary  Authority of Singapore. Part  II  of  the

Bill provides for the establishment, capitalisation

and  administration of the Authority. Clause 3 sets

up   the   Authority  as  a  body  corporate.   The

authorised  capital of the Authority  will  be  $30

million,  while the paid-up capital  will  be  such

amounts  as may be approved by the Government  from

time to time. This is laid down in clause 5. Clause

8   provides   for  a  Board  of  seven   directors

comprising  the Minister for Finance, who  will  be

the  Chairman,  the  Permanent Secretary  (Economic

Development) of the Ministry of Finance,  who  will

be  the Deputy Chairman, the Accountant-General and

four other members who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>



will  be  appointed by the President. Of  the  four

members   appointed,  one  will  be  the   Managing

Director  of  the Authority. The Managing  Director

will    be    entrusted   with    the    day-to-day

administration  of  the  Authority  and   will   be

answerable to the Board for his acts and decisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is envisaged that the staff of the departments

which  I have named earlier will be transferred  to

the  Monetary Authority. Clauses 17 to  20  of  the

Bill   provide  for  this.  It  is  intended   that

employees from these Government departments will be

transferred to the Monetary Authority on  terms  no

less  favourable than those that they are  enjoying

with  the  Government. The value of  their  pension

rights will be safeguarded in any Authority pension

or  provident fund schemes, The Authority shall act

on  the advice of the Public Service Commission  in

regard  to appointments, promotions and termination

of  employment, dismissal and disciplinary  control

of its employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 (1) will enable the Authority to take

over  the  powers  of  the  Government  under   the

Banking,  Finance  Companies and  Exchange  Control

Ordinances. It is further envisaged that it may  be

necessary in future for the Authority to administer

other  functions in any specified law  relating  to

banking, investment or other financial matters, and

provision for this is made in clause 21(2) .



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be necessary to transfer to the Authority

certain  assets  and liabilities of the  Government

arising  out  of  statutory  requirements  in   the

banking  and  finance companies legislation.  Banks

and finance companies are required to maintain,  as

part of liquidity requirements, a statutory reserve

with the Accountant-General based on 3� per cent of

their   deposit   liabilities.  This   amounts   to

approximately  $120 million. As the Authority  will

now be responsible for these matters, clause 21 (3)

provides  for the transfer of liabilities  together

with their matching assets to the Authority.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 outlines in detail the powers of the

Authority, e.g., it may accept deposits  of  money;

issue  demand  drafts; purchase and sell  gold  and

foreign  currencies; purchase  and  sell  Treasury'

Bills  and  Government securities, etc.  Clause  23

lays  down the general principles under `which  the

Authority's funds may be invested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Authority in its functions as banker and

financial  agent to the Government will  mainly  be

responsible for the managing of the external assets

of   the  Government,  undertaking  the-issue   and

management  of  Government loans  and  of  Treasury

Bills. In this capacity, the exercise of powers  by

the Authority will remain subject to the respective

legislation  pertaining  to  these  subjects.   The

Treasury  Bills  issue  will  be  made  under   the

Treasury  Bills Ordinance, the issue of  registered

stock will be made under the Development Loan  Act,

while   the  investment  of  Government's  external

assets  will be subject to the Financial  Procedure

Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 26 to 40 contain miscellaneous and

transitional  provisions  which  provide  for  such

matters  as  the  financial year of the  Authority,

submission  of  annual  accounts,  powers  to  make

regulations, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  establishment of' a  Monetary  Authority

represents    a   welcome   tidying-up   operation,

gathering  together a number of important  monetary

and  exchange  activities  hitherto  exercised   by

disparate   authorities.  The  inclusion   of   the

Minister  for Finance as Chairman of the  Board  of

Directors  will ensure close co-ordination  between

fiscal  and  monetary policies. The'  Minister  for

Finance   is   also  Chairman  of  the   Board   of

Commissioners of Currency. It is not quite clear to

me  why the functions of the Currency Board are not

being  brought within the purview of  the  Monetary

Authority  or vice versa. The Finance Minister  has

mentioned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



that it is desirable to maintain confidence in  the

currency  that we have at present. But I  do  think

that we can still retain the automatic features  of

a   currency  issue  while  yet  unifying   matters

relating to monetary policy, since control  of  the

currency  issue is intimately related  to  monetary

policy in general.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a general comment, I think Singapore has been

eminently  sensible in not following slavishly  the

adoption   of  institutions  elsewhere.   In   most

countries,  the  Central  Bank  exercises  monetary

authority  autonomously and often not synchronously

with fiscal policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to welcome the establishment of a Monetary Authority of Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know

whether  I  need answer the Member for Whampoa!  He

welcomes   the   establishment  of   the   Monetary

Authority.  His remarks on the automatic  mechanism

being  possible  also under the Authority  are,  of

course,  accepted. This is quite  possible.  But  I

think  in the circumstances in which we operate  in

Singapore  and in the South-east Asian area,  which

has  had  some  experience of "banana"  currencies,

there  is,  as I have explained, some psychological

importance  in  showing  that  our  money  is  well

controlled under the Currency Board which does  not

allow  for  any manipulation of the note  issue.  I

think this is important.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Hon Sui Sen].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



Sir, I beg to move the motion standing in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section

4   of  the  Foreshores  Ordinance  (Chapter  246),

approves  the  reclamation by  Government  of  that

portion of the foreshore and sea-bed containing  an

area  of  approximately 1,306 acres from  Bedok  to

Tanah  Merah Besar as delineated on the plan marked

"LAND  OFFICE  RECLAMATION  PLAN  1/70"  which   is

deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the fourth phase of the scheme for the

reclamation of the foreshore and sea-bed along  the

east coast of our Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third phase of the reclamation scheme, which

was  approved by this House in 1967, was originally

envisaged  to cover an area of 306 acres  from  the

Singapore  Swimming Club right up  to  the  end  of

Tanjong  Rhu  and from Nicoll Highway to  Elizabeth

Walk. This area has now been amended to cover 289.5

acres  only - 125 acres from the Singapore Swimming

Club  to  the end of Tanjong Rhu, which is expected

to  be  completed in October this year,  and  164.5

acres  from Nicoll Highway to Elizabeth  Walk,  the

contract for which has already been awarded and the

reclamation of which is expected to be completed in

early 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government now proposes to reclaim a further

1,306 acres of the foreshore and sea-bed from Bedok

to  Tanah  Merah Besar. A copy of this  reclamation

plan is deposited in the Library of this House  for

the information of Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this phase of the reclamation, which will

also  be  undertaken by the Housing and Development

Board  as agent of the Government, is estimated  to

cost  $35 million. Some 405 acres of land at  Upper

Changi Road are being acquired to provide fill  for

this reclamation. Work on the reclamation, which is

expected to take four years to complete, will begin

in early 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No firm decision has been made on the proposed

utilisation  of  the  reclaimed  land.  This  will,

however,  be  made by the planners, in  conjunction

with other authorities, at a later stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>5.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a fairly lengthy

Ministerial statement was made by me on 22nd  July,

1970, consequent upon the presentation of the White

Paper  on the Reorganisation of the Motor Transport

Service  of  Singapore, now on record  in  Hansard,

Vol. 30, No. 4, it will therefore be superfluous to

repeat what has already been said previously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will, however, be pertinent for me to comment

on  certain important developments, since the White

Paper  was published six weeks ago. It would  be  a

mild  statement if I say that the White  Paper  had

stirred   some  public  interest  and   discussion.

Reorganisation   of   any   kind   is   disturbing,

especially  for those who will be affected  by  its

recommendations  and will be  required  to  make  a

change  or  an  adjustment to their former  way  of

life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I wish to express my thanks and

appreciation  to  my Parliamentary  Secretary,  the

Member   for   Tampines,  and   the   Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Culture, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



Member  for Stamford, for their kind assistance  in

producing, at short notice, the Chinese translation

of  the White Paper, the official version of  which

was printed in English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was thus possible for Members of Parliament,

who  are more conversant with the Chinese language,

to be supplied with a proper Chinese translation of

the  contents  of the White Paper, as  well  as  to

obviate the possibility of confusion in the Chinese

press,  which may occur through variations  in  the

interpretation   of   the   text    by    different

translators. I should like to take this opportunity

also   to   thank  the  Chinese  press  for   their

wholehearted co-operation in printing  the  Chinese

version of the White Paper (in instalments) over  a

number of issues, namely, the Nanyang Siang Pau (11

issues), the Mm Pao Daily (nine), the Sin Chew  lit

Poh (seven) and the Shin Mm Daily News (four). This

responsible   action,   of   which   I   am    most

appreciative, on the part of the Chinese press  has

ensured  that the large Chinese reading public  are

aware  of  the actual contents of the White  Paper,

and  thus puts a stop to those who, for reasons  of

their  own  selfish interests, are opposed  to  the

principles  of the White Paper and are bent  either

on  misinterpreting, confusing or  frustrating  the

public outcry for a long-overdue reorganisation  of

the public transport service of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That reorganisation will proceed is clear. As to

details of implementation, some adjustments can, of

course, be made provided there are good reasons  or

any  new  information is brought to light, when  it

would  be  foolish and unreasonable not  to  accept

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite many press reports of supposed

unhappiness  over  the implications  of  the  White

Paper,  only  four petitions have been received  so

far, and will be given due consideration:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Singapore Lorry Owners Association

of 1lB, New Bridge Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a letter dated 8th August, 1970, the then

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Finance, and now Minister of State for Finance,  in

his capacity as legal adviser, forwarded a petition

from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>



the  Singapore  Lorry  Owners Association  claiming

that  "70  per  cent of the vehicles owned  by  the

members are over 15 years old".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Singapore School Transport Association of 40B Lorong 17, Geylang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their appeal was dated 14th August, 1970, and I

have  agreed  to meet their representatives  in  my

office on Saturday, the 5th of September. I may add

that  the Association's premises are located in  my

constituency of Geylang West.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Taxi Transport Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their appeal was dated 20th August,



1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter, signed by the President of the

Chinese   Chamber  of  Commerce,  was   dated   1st

September, 1970, and was received at my  office  at 5.00 p.m, yesterday. The appeal was stated to be on

behalf of:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Singapore School Transport Association;

and,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Pro-tern Working Committee for the

protection  of the livelihood of School  Taxi-drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already said that the Singapore School

Transport  Association  will  be  meeting   me   on

Saturday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the so-called "Pro-tem Working Committee

for the protection of the livelihood of School Taxi-drivers",  may I refer to the press release  issued

by  my  Ministry yesterday, which was published  in

some newspapers this morning but not in all papers.

May  I,  with your permission, Sir, read the  first

part  of  the press release which has relevance  to

this so-called Working Committee? I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With reference to an undated open letter in

Chinese purporting to be issued under the hand of a

certain  Ng  Eng Lam, as spokesman of a  "Committee

for   the   Safeguard  of  School   Taxi   Drivers'

Livelihood"  whose identity is unknown,  there  is,

however,  on police records, one Ng Eng  Lam  (NRIC

0665851  B), whose last known address is Block  61,

270A  Stirling  Road, Singapore 3,  has  had  three

previous convictions for operating `pirate'  taxis,

and is currently



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



wanted by the Police, under a warrant of arrest  in

respect of a road accident.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Singapore School Transport

Association   has   informed   the   Ministry    of

Communications  that none of its  members  has  the

name  of  Ng Eng Lam; neither has Ng Eng  Lam  been

authorised to represent its interests.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the time for Backbenchers to speak

up on the contents of the White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament approves the proposals of

the  Government on the Reorganisation of the  Motor

Transport Service of Singapore as set out in  Paper

Command 21 of 1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, on the 22nd July of this year the Minister for

Communications  introduced a  White  Paper  on  the

Reorganisation  of the Motor Transport  Service  of

Singapore.  This  Paper,  which  contains   several

thousand  words,  enumerates the  various  problems

facing  our public transport service. It also  very

frankly  discloses  the various shortcomings  which

the  Ministry  of Communications has faced  in  the

past.  For  instance,  in its foreword,  the  Paper

gives   three  possible  reasons  for  the  present

unsatisfactory   state  of  our  public   transport

service, namely:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(a) Lack of definite policy in the past, with ad-hoc decisions being made as and when problems

arise



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Lack of continuity in the incumbent of the

important post of Registrar of Vehicles  (ROV).

Since  1959  (11  years ago)  there  have  been

eight  officials filling this post. This  state

of   affairs  is  certainly  not  conducive  to

proper management of the Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) More financial support is needed to recruit an

adequate number of qualified staff, to  provide

proper  facilities and equipment to enable  ROV

to   perform,  implement  and  to  enforce  its

multifarious duties.'



<br><br>On this point the White Paper specifically mentions

that   the  income  of  the  Registry  of  Vehicles

totalled   $60   million  in  1969,   whereas   the

expenditure was only $1.2 million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with the three reasons given. In fact,

the  situation in the R.O.V, in the past was rather

chaotic.  At the same time, it is only a branch  of

the  Ministry of Communications which  has  control

over it. The Ministry of Communications was set  up

only in

1968.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This White Paper also proposes several measures

to  rectify  the situation, the most  important  of

which  are to improve the services of buses, taxis,

school taxis and school buses, the amalgamation  of

bus companies, and the eradication of pirate taxis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important measure is the anti-pollution

campaign  which is aimed at maintaining the  health

of  our  two million people. This should merit  our

support and attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper also proposes to impose an age

limit for various kinds of public vehicles, and  to

purchase  a  further number of  buses,  taxis,  and

other vehicles which will involve an expenditure of

$50 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all these measures we can see that the White

Paper  is  a significant and historic step  in  the

reorganisation  of  our public  transport  service.

Sir,  these measures will have far-reaching effects

on  those who are engaged in the transport service.

The reorganisation plan is expected to be completed

in   three  years,  and  as  it  will  affect   the

livelihood  of tens of thousands of our  people,  I

suggest that the Minister should carry it out  with

the  utmost care and tact. In implementing  it,  he

should formulate good, practical and proper methods

and  regulations  in  order to improve  the  public

transport  system. At the same time, he should  try

to  bring about a better transport system that will

help  our  people  and promote our  industrial  and

commercial     development.    Furthermore,     the

reorganisation plan should not adversely affect the

livelihood  of  the  workers  and  others  who  are

engaged  in the transport service. If it is carried

out   in  this  way,  everyone  will  support   the

Government   in  its  far-reaching  and  farsighted

reorganisation of the public transport system.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to touch on the introduction of

the  age  limit of taxis. According  to  the  White

Paper's proposals, the age limit of taxis is set at

seven  years.  In other words, if  taxis  are  over

seven years old, they will be delicensed. With this

stipulation,   within  the  three  years   of   the

implementation of the plan, about 30  per  cent  of

the  present 3,800 taxis, or 1,200 taxis, will have

to  be replaced. Undoubtedly this measure will have

very  serious  consequences  for  taxi  owners  and

drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have received a memorandum from the

Singapore  Taxi Drivers' Association,  representing

the  labour  side, and also a memorandum  from  the

Taxi  Transport Association, representing the  taxi

owners,  complaining  about  their  problems.   The

Singapore Taxi Drivers' Association thinks that the

age  limit  of  taxis should be set at  ten  years,

because taxis are better cared for and looked after

than   private   vehicles.   The   Taxi   Transport

Association  also holds the same opinion,  and  has

advanced  very good reasons to support  this  view.

The  first  reason is the cost of a  taxi.  At  the

moment,  the  majority of taxis are of  the  Morris

Oxford  model.  The  cost of a taxi  together  with

accessories is $9,500. On top of it, there will  be

an  expenditure  of  at least  $5,000  to  pay  for

licence  fees,  tyres,  insurance,  inspection  and

repair charges, etc. And the yearly income is about

$6,000.  Balancing out, the yearly profit  will  be

not  more  than  $2,000. If a taxi  is  de-licensed

according to the seven-year stipulation, then after

depreciation  of  $1,000 per year  and  payment  of

interest,  if it is acquired on hire purchase,  how

can  a  taxi owner or driver make a profit  in  the

end?  There  are  also some taxis of Mercedes-make.

The  cost  of such a taxi and accessories  is  more

than  $15,000. If we set a seven-year limit on this

make  of taxi, it means that every year there  will

be  a  depreciation loss of $2,000. Thus these taxi

owners  will  not be able to make a profit  out  of

their cars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is the emission of excessive

smoke.  According  to figures given  in  the  White

Paper, out of 1,413 buses, there were 515 cases  of

smoky



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



exhausts.  Of the 6,652 lorries, there  were  1,828

cases  of smoky exhausts. Of the 3,816 taxis, there

were 894 cases of smoky exhausts. From a comparison

of  these figures, we can see that there were fewer

cases  of  taxis with smoky exhausts than buses  or

lorries.  This goes to prove that taxis are  better

maintained than other public transport vehicles. In

addition, taxis have to undergo inspection twice  a

year.  If  a taxi is found to be in poor condition,

it  will  not be allowed to operate. From this,  we

can  see  that  taxis are subject  to  very  strict

controls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the complaints by these Associations concern

the   livelihood   of  several   thousand   people.

According to statistics, 4bout 1,000 new taxis will

be  made available to taxi drivers to own their own

vehicles.  For  instance, recently  the  Government

licensed  600 taxis which belong to this  category,

and they were bought on hire-purchase terms or from

loans from finance companies. If the seven-year age

limit  is imposed, then the taxi owners will  incur

an  unnecessary loss. At the same time,  this  will

also   adversely   affect  the  proposed   Workers'

Transport Co-operative, to which the Government has

given a $6 million loan. In the end, the Government

may  not be able to get back the money loaned  out.

Who then is going to pay for it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is the saving in foreign exchange.

At  the  moment, there are no locally  produced  or

assembled taxis. So the purchase of every new  taxi

will  incur a loss in foreign exchange. If  we  can

extend  the age limit, we will not lose any foreign

exchange  but instead will be able to provide  jobs

for those people in the taxi business. In addition,

according   to  the  White  Paper,  the   Transport

Advisory Board has proposed the age limit of  taxis

to  be  set  at 10 years. Of course, this  has  the

concurrence  of the representatives of  the  people

concerned. I believe this proposal is of  practical

value,  and in view of the valid reasons  given.  I

think the Minister should carefully reconsider  and

change the age limit to ten years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to touch upon the increase in

the  number of taxis. According to the White Paper,

the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



intends  to issue 1,200 new taxi licences,  200  of

which  will be for special taxis. On this  question

the   Taxi   Drivers'  Association  has,   in   its

memorandum,  put  forward a different  proposition.

According to the Association, our transport  system

at  the  moment is already in a state of confusion.

There  are  various  kinds of taxis,  for  example,

ordinary taxis and SZ taxis. And if there is to  be

another  kind of special taxi, then it will  create

further  confusion,  especially  to  tourists  from

abroad.  Therefore, the Association  suggests  that

these  200  taxis should also be allocated  to  the

proposed  Workers' Transport Co-operative.  If  the

Government decides to increase the number of  these

special  taxis to serve passengers, then,  in  that

case,  the marking of this type of taxis should  be

different. For instance, a different colour  should

be  painted on the top of these taxis in order  not

to mislead the passengers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Taxi Drivers' Association is also of the

opinion  that  at the present stage no  more  taxi-driver licences should be issued because there  are

now more taxi-driver licences than taxis. There are

14,000 taxi-driver licences, whereas the number  of

taxis is only 3,800. Hence, many taxi drivers  with

licences  do  not  have any taxis  to  drive.  They

cannot   do   anything  but  stay  at   home.   The

Association proposes that in the process of setting

up   a   Workers'   Transport   Co-operative,   the

authorities  should  take  into  consideration  the

ratio  of the number of taxi drivers to the  number

of taxis before any decision is made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association has also made a new proposition

regarding  the  retiring age of  taxi  drivers.  It

thinks that any taxi driver on reaching 60 years of

age   should  be  allowed  to  continue  with   his

occupation provided he is certified by a Government

doctor to be healthy and fit for his job. There  is

no need for a grace period of three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think most of the propositions have merit. The

White  Paper  is  aimed  at  improving  the  public

transport service of Singapore. On the other  hand,

the  Government  has  the  duty  to  safeguard  the

livelihood of the taxi-drivers. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



should  try  to  avoid causing any difficulties  to

their   livelihood  when  the  new   measures   are

implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to touch upon the replacement of

overage  goods vehicles. According to the Table  of

Statistics  in the White Paper, of the 6,652  goods

vehicles, about 30 per cent of them, namely, 2,200,

are  already  15  years old and  they  need  to  be

replaced.  On this point, I am of the opinion  that

the  replacement should be carried out  in  stages,

because  goods vehicles are very important  to  the

transport  industry,  to  our  prosperous  building

industry, and the Port of Singapore Authority. They

are also necessary to importers and exporters. They

cannot carry on their business without them. At the

moment,  there  is  no plant for locally  assembled

goods  vehicles. Therefore, the new  vehicles  will

have to be bought from abroad. As a result, we will

lose a lot of foreign exchange. I therefore suggest

that  the  replacement of goods vehicles should  be

carried  Out progressively so as not to affect  the

business  of  those sectors in industry  which  use

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next I come to the setting up of vehicle

factories,   either   Government-owned   or   joint

ventures. According to the White Paper, in  the  3-Year  Plan, it is necessary to buy 900 buses  at  a

cost of $31.5 million, and 2,400 taxis at a cost of

$20.7  million. The total equipment cost  is  about

$50 million. In addition, there will be an increase

of  450  school buses, and a total of  2,200  goods

vehicles  will  need to be replaced. Undoubtedly  a

very large sum of investment will be involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its conclusion, the White Paper also points

out that this is a great challenge to the people in

the transport industry. First, there is a very good

opportunity for investment in the transport service

and,  as  a  result, the drivers and  other  people

involved will have better jobs. If the White  Paper

is  not  wrong, there will be about 6,500 new  jobs

created. Second, the motor industry, especially the

locally-assembled  vehicle  industry,   will   have

greater opportunities open to it. Third, the  local

banks, finance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



companies and the Development Bank of Singapore can

also  avail themselves of the opportunity to  enter

this field. It is correct to say that it is a great

challenge  to  all  of  them.  I  feel  that  given

determination and spirit, the commercial firms  and

the  industrialists should be  able  to  set  up  a

vehicle  assembly plant. It can be  set  up  either

with   private   capital  or   capital   from   the

Government. The Government can even set up its  own

local  vehicle assembly plant. In partnership  with

the  private  sector, it can set up a jointly-owned

car  manufacturing factory which  can  assemble  or

make  various kinds of vehicles. It is  no  problem

for  the Government to get the money to do  so.  At

the  same  time, we have people with the  necessary

expertise  to set up such a factory and manage  it.

This     will    provide    long-term    investment

opportunities  which will save  a  lot  of  foreign

exchange  and also provide more jobs for our  local

citizens. So it is like killing two birds with  one

stone.  I hope the Minister will seriously consider

this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next I come to the question of the administrative

system  in the Ministry of Communications. I  think

it   should   be  unified.  In  addition   to   the

reorganisation of the public transport service  and

the purchase of more vehicles, there is also a need

to   have   enough  public  officers  and  adequate

equipment to cope with our requirements.  The  most

important  point is that the administrative  system

should  be unified. At present the system works  on

this  basis.  The  R.O.V, is  responsible  for  the

issuance  of vehicular licences and the  collection

of vehicular taxes. The Traffic Police is in charge

of  traffic regulations and the testing of drivers.

The  Car  Parks Division is in charge of car  parks

and  taxi stations. But this division is under  the

Ministry  of National Development. This triumvirate

set-up will necessarily give rise to confusion  and

will  affect the efficiency of the public transport

service.  The three departments should  be  unified

into  one  in  order to do away with the  confusion

obtaining at the moment in the various departments.

I  feel that all matters relating to transport  and

communications should be under the Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



Communications. Not very long ago  I  suggested  to

the  Minister  that  these  departments  should  be

merged  into one and the Minister took a favourable

view  of my suggestion. Now I will repeat here that

the  Minister should merge together all the various

departments   which  now  deal  with   the   public

transport  service. Hence, the R.O.V., the  Traffic

Police,  the  Car  Parks  Division  and  the   road

building  section should come under one department.

Under  a  unified management, a unified  policy  on

public transport will not only be achieved but,  at

the  same  time, it can also better cope  with  the

problem of public transport in our country. We  can

achieve a double result with less effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the increase in taxis, I feel that the

Ministry  of  Communications should  lay  out  more

parking  lots for them in order to enable the  taxi

drivers   to   pick   up  their   passengers   more

conveniently. I also feel that all car parks should

be open to taxis as well. This will enable the taxi

drivers  to take their lunch or to rest  there.  At

the  moment, foreign imported cars and other  kinds

of  vehicles  can park in the car parks.  Only  the

taxis   cannot.  What  is  the  reason   for   this

discrimination? If the taxis are allowed to park in

the  car  parks, they are prepared to  pay  parking

fees. After all, they are also local citizens.  Why

should   there   be  discrimination  against   taxi

drivers? It is really difficult to comprehend  this

situation.  I  hope  the  Minister  will,  in   the

reorganisation  of  the public  transport  service,

take   the   necessary  measures  to  remedy   this

unreasonable situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, the various proposals enumerated in

the  White Paper not only create a new task for the

people in the transport industry but they also pose

a  new challenge to all the people. They will  have

to  adapt  themselves to the new situation  brought

about   by  this  reorganisation.  Of  course,   to

reorganise in tow the public transport service is a

very  onerous task. However, I believe  that  under

the  spirited  and  experienced leadership  of  the

Minister for Communications, the programme will  be

smoothly carried out.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, however, like to remind the Minister of

several points. First, the reorganisation should be

carried  out  with the utmost care, and sympathetic

consideration should be given to the livelihood and

difficulties   of  the  people  affected   by   the

reorganisation. The reorganisation should also  not

adversely  affect the development of  our  commerce

and  industry and the livelihood of the  people  in

the transport industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, there is the attitude of

Government  servants. Recently, I received  certain

complaints  about  the  discourteous  and  arrogant

attitude of public servants towards members of  the

public.  If  this is true, I urge the  Minister  to

look  into  this  problem and see to  it  that  the

officers    concerned   carry   out   their    work

efficiently. Public officers should understand that

they  are servants of the people and their salaries

come  from the taxes paid by the people. Therefore,

they  should  serve  the people  courteously.  They

should  not  abuse  their powers and  embarrass  or

oppress  the  people, especially now  that  we  are

carrying  out a large-scale reorganisation  of  the

public  transport service. Public  servants  should

maintain  a fair and just attitude in carrying  out

their   duties.  Only  thus  can  this  large-scale

exercise  receive the full support and co-operation

of  the  people, and the objectives  of  the  White

Paper achieved, so that in the 1970s we can have  a

completely  new  and  efficient  system  of  public

transport.



<br><br>6.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the

publication  of the White Paper, quite considerable

public  interest  and concern  have  been  aroused.

Apart  from the proposed age limits of the  various

types of vehicles, two other areas have caused most

concern. One of these is the all-out action against

the  pirate  taxis  and  the  other  is  the  total

abolition  of  SCH taxis. Whilst it may  be  argued

that  it is not the duty of the law to protect  the

illegal,  one cannot help but sympathise  with  the

plight   of  those  who  have  been  compelled   by

circumstances to resort to pirating  on  the  road.

These so-called pirates, I submit, Sir, have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



been  the  by-products of our own  restrictive  and

unrealistic  taxi licensing system  and  a  totally

inefficient  public  transport  system  which   has

failed  miserably  to cater for the  needs  of  the

travelling  public and, as a result, has encouraged

the  growth of the pirates. Now that the ills  have

been  diagnosed  and the cures prescribed,  I  feel

that  we  should not ignore altogether  the  useful

albeit  illegitimate,  contribution  made  by   the

pirates and the legitimate contribution from  those

operating  SCH  taxis.  Accordingly.  I  feel  that

certain  special arrangements ought to be  made  to

commence  registration of all those who  have  been

engaged  in  pirating and in the operation  of  SCH

taxis   with  a  view  to  finding  them   suitable

alternative employment opportunities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Member for Sembawang, I am concerned,

Sir,  about  the  fate of the 2,200  goods-carrying

vehicles  which  are more than 15 years  old.  Sir,

whilst  a grace period will be allowed in the  case

of  other  vehicles that are to be  phased  out  on

account  of age, there is no indication as  to  how

the 2,200 overage goods-carrying vehicles are to be

phased out. There is no recommendation anywhere  in

the  White Paper. Sir, I do hope that this does not

suggest immediate replacement and that a reasonable

grace  period  will  be allowed  during  which  the

vehicles should preferably be submitted to  regular

stringent inspection by the authorities in view  of

the  fact  that  these vehicles  are  the  greatest

offenders  on  the road in terms of air  pollution.

Whatever the grace period finally decided upon,  it

should  be sufficiently long to allow for  adequate

replacement so as not to disrupt our commercial and

industrial activities. The tremendous expansion  in

both   sectors,  I  understand,  has   considerably

increased the demand for lorry service. Calculating

on  the  basis of an average price of  $20,000  per

lorry - although some lorries may cost a lot more a

total  of  $44 million is required to  finance  the

replacement  of  our  complete  fleet  of   overage

lorries.  Bearing in mind that a  great  number  of

these lorries are owned by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



individuals of no substantial means, I am  doubtful

whether   they  will  be  able  to  find   adequate

financial   support   to   effect   the   necessary

replacement within a short period. I feel sure that

this  point  has not escaped the attention  of  the

Minister  and that the programme drawn up to  phase

out   these   goods-carrying   vehicles   will   be

reasonable  and sufficiently flexible to  ensure  a

smooth change-over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, I would like to touch upon

the proposed merger of the 10 Chinese bus companies

and  the establishment of three separate companies.

Sir,  the  ultimate  success of  the  comprehensive

changes  proposed  for the entire public  transport

system hinges largely upon the successful operation

of  the three new companies. Their performance will

therefore be watched most closely by all concerned.

And  as it must be the first occasion locally where

a  fairly large number of companies go into  merger

together, their success will inspire others both in

commerce   and   industry  to   undertake   similar

exercises  in  order  to  obtain  the  benefits  of

economies  of  scale. I sincerely hope,  therefore,

that in structuring the management of the three new

companies,  those  concerned at the  top  will  not

hesitate to introduce modern management techniques.

In particular, it is important that they appreciate

and accept the need for professional managership to

ensure efficiency in management.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a sound management without the co-operation

of   the  workers  will  however  not  give  us  an

efficient  bus  service. And  as  far  as  this  is

concerned,   I   have-no  doubt  that   our   union

colleagues  will see to it that union  members  are

made  to realise their responsibility to the public

and   will  co-operate  to  the  utmost  with   the

management  in  bringing  about  an  efficient  bus

service to the people of Singapore. Speaking of the

union,   Sir,  I  am  reminded  that  the  proposed

Transport   Co-operative  will  be  given   certain

privileges and will therefore be playing  a  fairly

important  part  in  helping  to  bring  about  the

changes   envisaged.  As  such,  they   should   be

organisationally   prepared   and   competent    to

undertake



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



the  task  ahead.  May  I  ask  the  Minister  what

arrangements or preparations are being made by  the

union in this connection?



<br><br>6.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phua Bah Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications (Mr Phua Bah Lee)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, since our independence, owing  to

the  growth of our economy and the increase in  the

indices  of  income  of  our  nationals,  the  high

purchasing   power  of  the  people  has   directly

stimulated   the   prosperity  of   our   transport

industry. Therefore, more effective control of  the

increasing number of motor vehicles has become  our

pressing task at the moment. Certain parts  of  the

regulations and laws are no longer adequate to meet

the  present  transport conditions.  On  the  other

hand, in order to match urban renewal, there is the

need   systematically  to  link  up   the   various

satellite  towns, industrial districts and  housing

estates.   This  entails  the  reorganisation   and

readjustment  of  the public transport  service.  I

quote paragraph 1.1 of the White Paper:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Good and efficient communications form the life-blood of any modern economy. As Singapore takes

justifiable pride in being the fourth busiest  port

of  the world, we must not allow its progress to be

retarded by a lagging Public Transport system.'



<br><br>This correctly explains the important position  the

public  transport industry occupies in our national

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the White Paper proposes certain

measures which will not only help solve the present

problem of public transportation, but also, at  the

same  time,  serve  as guiding principles  for  the

future  in  this  field.  From  the  ratio  of  our

population  to  vehicles, it can be seen  that  the

majority  of our people are making use of buses  as

their  chief means of communication. But what  kind

of  service is now being rendered by the present 11

bus  companies to our people? There are buses  from

three  or  four bus companies running on  the  same

service routes, whereas on other service routes the

passengers  have to wait for a solid half  an  hour

before a bus comes along.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there is an inadequate number of

vehicles  whose  service  is  irregular   and   not

punctual,   causing   long   queues   of    waiting

passengers.  We can read many complaints  from  the

public   in   the  newspapers  about  this.   This,

therefore, has indirectly helped the development of

pirate taxis. Bus companies and taxi operators have

complained   about  pirate  taxis   robbing   their

business.  But  they  themselves  will   not   take

positive  steps to improve their own services.  The

cause  of this situation lies in the fact that  the

11  bus  companies lack a unified organisation  and

management and they do not show the common sense of

responsibility.  They  manage  their  own   affairs

separately  and  their business is based  on  their

personal  interest.  As for the  safety,  time  and

convenience   of  passengers,  it  is   not   their

business.  Thus, on the one hand, they  are  making

use  of  overage  vehicles to extract  the  maximum

possible  profit, and, on the other hand, they  are

causing  unnecessary  waste  by  duplicating  their

services along some service routes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this situation, the Government

proposes  to reorganise the 11 bus companies.  This

has become an important subject in the White Paper.

The  Government  proposes  to  amalgamate  the   10

Chinese  bus  companies  into  three  district   or

regional  companies.  It  also  proposes  that  the

Singapore  Traction Company should also  reorganise

and  readjust itself and be turned into the  fourth

district company so that, through division of  work

and co-operation, the various bus routes throughout

our  country will form a complete link-up. Thus  in

the  fields of management and service, it  will  be

easier  to  adjust, rectify and  organise.  At  the

moment, the 10 Chinese bus companies have completed

their  initial  stages of amalgamation.  I  believe

this  exercise  will soon be completed.  I  welcome

very  much  the  judicious  decision  and  the  co-operation of the Chinese bus companies to help  the

Government carry out this reorganisation plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next come taxis which occupy the second position

in  our  public transport service. According  to  a

conservative



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>



assessment, the total intake for taxis  every  year

is  not less than that for buses. From this we  can

see  that  the profit for taxis is quite  high.  At

present, the number of taxi licences is limited  to

3,800. This limitation has become fatal to the taxi

industry,   because   it  has   not   only   caused

speculators to hoard taxi licences by various means

in  order  to fetch better prices on selling  them,

but  also,  at  the  same time, it  has  indirectly

fostered   the   development   of   pirate   taxis.

Therefore, in order to remove the anomalies that at

present exist with the taxis, we should assess  the

services rendered by them and adjust their number.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we come to the school taxis and pirate

taxis.  First,  the school taxis. They  are  pirate

taxis  in  a  different form. The main  reason  for

their  existence is the poor bus service,  and  the

fact  that  school buses are not  widely  used.  In

order to ensure the safety of school children,  the

Government decided to legalise such "pirate"  taxis

in  the  past. In this way school taxis  have  come

into  being. They are marked differently  with  SCH

plates  and  have to pay S24 a year in addition  to

the  fee  paid by private cars. However, they  make

use  of this legal cover illegally to accept  fares

along  the  road, Their practice is to  take  other

passengers in addition to school children. This  is

against  the  original intention of the  Government

when  it legalised this kind of taxis. The SCH taxi

drivers   themselves   have  also   infringed   the

principles and the conditions under which they were

registered.  Therefore,  the  Government   has   no

alternative but to take strict measures to  replace

them with school buses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pirate taxis pose a serious problem in our public

transport service. The operators are infringing the

law  by accepting fares along the road. Even  their

car discs are secured through illegal means. At the

same  time,  they are using overage  cars  in  poor

condition  to serve the passengers. What they  want

is  only to get fares from the passengers. They  do

not care for their safety. It has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>



shown that the passengers of pirate taxis who  lost

their  lives as a result of accidents did  not  get

any   compensation.  This  is  very  pitiful.   The

Government allows free competition in commerce, but

pirate taxi operators and school taxi operators are

engaged in unequal competition. The Government  has

a duty to protect the interest of taxpayers just as

it  has  the  duty to take measures to protect  the

interest  of legitimate businessmen from smugglers.

The  Government  has tried its  best  to  eradicate

pirate  taxis, but the anomalies and ills  existing

in  the public transport service plus the fact that

people  want a quicker and more convenient  service

have   created   favourable  conditions   for   the

existence of the pirate taxis. Their operators make

use  of  this need as a pretext for their legality.

if  we legalise pirate taxis, the existence and the

service  rendered by buses and ordinary taxis  will

become  meaningless.  Also,  public  transport  and

order  on  the  road will become  unmanageable  and

chaotic.  The eradication of pirate taxis not  only

ensures   the  safety  of  passengers,   but   also

safeguards  the  rights of people who  are  legally

operating buses and taxis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards anti-air pollution, this is a problem

that we will have to face seriously in view of  the

introduction  of  the anti-air pollution  campaign.

All  engines  emit some kind of waste  gases  which

will  directly  affect the health of human  beings.

This   matter   does   not   have   any   political

implications. Whoever you are, your health will not

be  less  affected  by the air  pollution,  In  our

country,  air  pollution  is  caused  less  by  the

existing new factories than by the exhaust of motor

vehicles. In busy commercial districts and  densely

populated  areas,  the  problem  is  more   serious

because  the  smoke emitted by motor  vehicles  has

even impeded the growth of trees and plants. We can

therefore  gauge the degree of its seriousness.  In

the final analysis, the cause of this situation  is

mainly due to diesel cars. Not all cars emit  black

smoke. Of the diesel cars, the worst offenders  are

public transport vehicles and overage vehicles.  In

the case of the former, for example,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>



buses  and lorries, the cause is excessive loading.

In  the  case of the latter, it is their  unlimited

period  of use. The latter include pirate  and  SCH

taxis, taxis, and some other vehicles. The emission

of  black smoke is obviously due to lack of  proper

maintenance. This should be attended to. To control

this  situation,  we  have stipulated  that  public

transport  vehicles  should be inspected  regularly

and  should  keep up to the required standards.  We

will  also  raise the tax on private  diesel  cars,

which include SCH cars. On the one hand, this is to

discourage  the purchase of diesel cars as  private

cars.  On  the  other hand, this  is  to  curb  the

development  of pirate taxis as well  as  keep  the

number  of diesel vehicles to a minimum. The  fines

on  vehicles emitting smoke will also be increased.

This  will  make  car owners pay attention  to  the

maintenance of their vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, all laws and stipulations should be

effectively carried out by executive organisations.

Without  them,  there will be no  achievement.  The

efficiency of the Registry of Vehicles is not up to

the  required  standard. The  R.O.V, is  weak  and

ineffective.   Many  tasks  properly   within   the

province  of the R.O.V, have not been carried  out.

Some  other  departments are carrying out  some  of

these  tasks. Even some minor tasks are not carried

out.  In this way, the authority of the R.O.V, does

not go beyond its threshold.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the R.O.V, there is a lot of confusion and

inefficiency. This is mainly due to a  shortage  of

staff  and  equipment.  In order  that  the  R.O.V.

should play an effective role, we should strengthen

the  staffing  position and also give  it  adequate

authority  and  equipment. Only  thus  will  it  be

possible   to   help  in  the  reorganisation   and

development   of  the  public  transport   service.

Judging  from  the  above, we  can  arrive  at  one

conclusion;  that is to legislate and, through  the

executive  bodies, to implement the  reorganisation

of  the  public transport service. The  results  of

this will, of course, be:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Better organisation and more regular working

conditions for those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>



people  engaged  in  the public transport  service.

This will provide more jobs for our citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) After the reorganisation, more vehicles will

be needed for the transport service, thus providing

more   investment  opportunities  in   the   public

transport  service which, in turn, will generate  a

new   source   of   strength   for   our   economic

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Improvement in our environmental hygiene and

the  safeguard of our health will be an  undeniable

fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) A better, more direct and time-saving public

transport  service  for the  broad  masses  of  our

people will emerge.



<br><br>6.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  recent  years the public transport  service  in

Singapore  has  posed  a very serious  problem.  In

order  to  solve it and to ensure that there  is  a

smooth flow of traffic in our streets in Singapore,

the  Government  has  set up a  Transport  Advisory

Board  for a comprehensive survey and study of  the

transport service system in Singapore. The  efforts

of this Board have culminated in the White Paper on

the  Reorganisation of the Motor Transport  Service

in Singapore. From the aims and views of this White

Paper,  we  all agree that the premises  have  been

well established and most encouraging and worthy of

our  support.  On the one hand, the proposals  will

ensure  that traffic will flow freely and  smoothly

in Singapore so that it does not become a hindrance

to  our  economic development and progress. On  the

other hand, the proposals will also ensure that the

public  will be given a time-saving and  convenient

means of transport to move around. Indirectly,  the

proposals  will  ensure control  of  air  pollution

caused  by  public transport vehicles.  There  are,

however,  certain provisions which are  either  too

strict  or far from being perfect. These  will  not

only  affect those who are involved, but will  also

cause  the  people  affected  to  make  unnecessary

sacrifices. Therefore, careful consideration should

be given to see that proper adjustments are made.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to deal with the

question of school taxis. Some four years ago,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in view of the growing  problem  of

pirate  taxis in Singapore and the fact that pirate

taxis   do   play  an  important  role  in   public

transport,  the Government decided to issue  school

taxi  licences for these vehicles in order to  make

good  the inadequacies of transport for our  school

children.  Accordingly a lot of people applied  for

these licences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From statistics released by the R.O.V, in June

this  year,  of the various classes  and  types  of

vehicles  registered, there are 1,127 school  taxis

and school buses, the majority of them being school

taxis.  This figure is more than double the  number

of  buses  owned by the Singapore Traction Company.

Therefore, it can be seen that so long as there are

solutions,  popular  support  is  certain.  At  the

moment,  we  cannot simply write off  the  licences

that  were  issued four years ago and  require  the

licence  holders  to  switch  over  to  mini  buses

overnight, or within the time of 11 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain illogical restrictions

mentioned  in the White Paper. For example,  school

taxis  are not to be transferred. At the time  when

these  licences were issued, the applicants had  to

go  round  raising  money to  buy  their  vehicles,

diesel cars for example. And up to now many of them

have still not yet paid up their loans. But now the

Government  require them to raise another  loan  to

buy  a  new mini bus. The previous loan not  having

been  fully paid up, who in their right senses will

lend  more money to these people? Furthermore,  the

existing  school  taxis will  be  given  the  death

sentence because of the increase in diesel tax. Who

will buy diesel vehicles for private use?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the passengers of school taxis are mainly school children. Because there is a limit to the fares from school children, school taxi drivers are only able to make enough money to keep body and soul together, quite apart from having to maintain their vehicles. Little did they

realise in the early days



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



that,  by the 1st of December this year, they would

have  to  pay 50 per cent more in diesel  tax,  and

another  50 per cent by the 1st of July next  year.

This increase in diesel tax will undoubtedly be  an

unbearable  burden on them. This-is quite  a  cruel

and heartless measure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the question of pirate

taxis.  The  existence of pirate taxis  is  a  fait

accompli.   The  Government  has  been  continually

taking action against them. But I think that in the

course of such action they have adopted a policy of

closing  one  eye to it. This-could not  be  denied

because  we can see that over the years the  public

transport  system in Singapore has worsened.  There

have been complaints about the inadequacies and the

chaotic  state  of public transport.  And  what  is

preposterous  is the claim by a bus company,  which

operates in busy city areas, that it is running  at

a  great  loss, to the tune-of millions of dollars.

And  this  claim is made at a time when many,  many

passengers have to queue up for a long time for its

buses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These inadequacies and the unsatisfactory state

of  affairs  give rise to the existence  of  pirate

taxis.  To some extent, these pirate taxis help  to

solve-the   transport  problem  of   commuters   in

Singapore.  The  people  have  been  served   quite

satisfactorily  by  these pirate  taxis  which  ply

between  housing  estates and  industrial  estates.

Rain  or  shine, the people get the  services  they

need  at very moderate rates of fares. Judging from

the  present  situation, buses do get  crowded  and

overflow  with passengers at some time.  There  are

people who are not prepared to wait for a long time

for buses during the rush hours. So they take taxis

or  pirate  taxis  which normally  operate  between

housing  estates  and industrial estates.  Although

the fare of pirate-taxis is slightly more than that

for a bus, that is to say, a difference of 5 or  10

cents,   on  the  whole,  pirate  taxis  play   the

intermediary  role  between  taxis  and  buses   in

serving  the  need of passengers. So while  we  are

diversifying our public transport system,  I  think

there is room for the pirate taxis. Plans



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



for  proper control can be executed to legalise the

existence  of  pirate  taxis,  which  are  a   fait

accompli. Operators or drivers of pirate taxis  and

school  taxis  have taken loans  at  high  interest

rates  to  buy their diesel vehicles  in  order  to

provide  this  wonderful service to people  in  all

walks of life. They have to sweat and toil to  earn

their living and to look after their families. Over

the years of operation, they have gained experience

and know their business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conscionable people have full sympathy for this

kind  of  illegal operation. Why cannot we  try  to

help  them  solve  their  problem?  Why  cannot  we

discuss with them to find a proper solution? It  is

regrettable that this is not being done. And to  do

away with all this illegal operation by persecution

and  police action will not solve the problem.  The

more  you arrest them, the more you will find  them

on  the road. And if you take stricter action,  you

will  probably drive them to desperation, and  that

will  lead  to  unthinkable  social  problems   and

consequences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, my view that certain routes

should  be  designated for the operation  of  these

pirate  taxis,  so  as to give  the  operators  and

drivers  a  means of livelihood. This will  be  the

best  method. Alternatively, we can classify pirate

taxis  as  second-class taxis.  I  think  they  are

prepared to talk things over, and are also prepared

to  accept all reasonable arrangements that we  can

suggest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, next I would like to deal with taxis. In the White Paper the Government has decided to issue 1,200 new taxi licences. At the moment, there are about 14,000 taxi drivers to 5,000 taxis. This ratio, I think, is a comfortable one, and taxi drivers do not have to worry about

having  no  taxis  to  drive.  They  will  not   be

unemployed   in  view  of  the  number   of   taxis

available. Undoubtedly this decision is  good  news

for many taxi drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately the White Paper also proposes to

impose an age limit of seven years for taxis.  This

means that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



a  taxi  has  to be replaced every seven  years.  I

think this is a waste of money. If we assume that a

new taxi costs $12,000 and the money is obtained by

way  of a loan at the rate of, say, 10 per cent per

annum,  the  interest  will amount  to  $1,200  per

annum,  capital  and interest to be payable  within

seven  years.  This  means  that  every  month  the

instalment will come to more than $200, quite apart

from  expenses on maintenance, road tax, insurance,

and  other incidentals. With all these items  taken

into  account, every month a sum of more than  $300

will  be  involved. And if after  seven  years  the

vehicle  is still in good and serviceable condition

and  yet  has to be replaced, will that  not  be  a

loss?  If  the vehicle is -to be sold as a  private

car,  I  think  very few people will be  interested

because  of the increased tax on diesel  cars.  Why

cannot  we extend the age limit of taxis? By  doing

so  we can, on the one hand, save a lot of money in

foreign exchange for the country, and, on the other

hand,  we will enable the taxi operators to earn  a

few  dollars more, so that they will be in a better

position to buy a new vehicle the next time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also stated in the White Paper that because

a  taxi  is put to hard use, it is on the  run  for

almost  24  hours in two shifts. I  think  this  is

purely  guesswork.  As far as we  understand,  most

taxis  do  not run about in the streets after  1.00

a.m.  They are all parked in petrol kiosks or  such

other  places  until at least 6.00  a.m, or  later

before  they are on the road again. And during  the

period  when  they are supposed to be in  use,  the

taxi  drivers also take time off for rest.  You  do

not expect them to keep on driving for 12 hours  on

end. It is, therefore, clear that the actual time a

taxi is being used is between 12 and 15 hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of buses which are to serve the same

purpose,  an  age  limit of 17  years  is  proposed

without any good reason being given. Why cannot the

age of a taxi be about half that set for a bus?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is clear that the public transport service of Singapore is in a very serious state. While we agree to the proposals in the White Paper for a comprehensive reorganisation, the Minister for Communications should emulate the Housing and Development Board, which has

successfully  solved the housing  problem,  in  the

solution of the public transport problem.



<br><br>7.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, permit me

to  comment  on certain points emanating  from  the

statement by the Minister for Communications on the

subject   of  the  reorganisation  of   the   motor

transport service of Singapore consequent upon  the

presentation  of the White Paper to  Parliament  on

21st July, 1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst agreeing that the broad outline of the

principles   in   the   White   Paper   is    sound

theoretically,  I do not think certain  details  of

the  plan  are near enough to what I would  call  a

realistic approach. The Minister for Communications

has  emphasised,  as one of the guiding  principles

under  which the White Paper is drawn up,  that  it

would be a simple yet workable plan and capable  of

immediate  implementation. But from what  I  gather

from  the existing condition in our motor transport

system,  I  would rather say that the dimension  of

the  problem is far greater than what the  plan  is

able  to  solve and certain proposed steps  do  not

deal realistically with the existing problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper aims at weeding out all pirate

taxis within a period of one year, and in order  to

take the full brunt of the unemployment problem due

to this measure, it has proposed to create over the

next   three   years  not  less  than   6,500   job

opportunities  under the plan. If my estimation  is

not  wrong,  there  are  at least  7,000  to  8.000

genuine  pirate taxi drivers in Singapore.  When  I

say  genuine drivers, I mean those whose livelihood

depends



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



solely  on driving pirate taxis. I understand  that

there are some drivers who drive pirate taxis  only

part-time. The question now is this. How  can  this

tremendously large number of drivers,  whose  means

of earning their livelihood is suddenly terminated,

find  alternative employment? The White  Paper  has

proposed to create 4,150 job opportunities  in  the

first  year of the plan. In respect of numbers,  it

will  not  solve the problem. It will be  worse  in

terms of vocation and the suitability of these  men

to fit into new jobs. These men who have spent many

years behind the steering wheel will be faced  with

difficulty   in  getting  adapted  to   their   new

employment. Does the White Paper include a training

programme  for these people similar to  that  which

the  Naval Base workers are now undergoing?  Whilst

we  all  believe in the benefits of a  law-abiding,

disciplined, tightly-knit and organised society, we

must  not  achieve  this object by non-humanitarian

methods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to raise is with

regard   to  taxis.  Anyone  with  some  power   of

observation  can  easily see that the  increase  of

1,200  taxis, of which 200 will be special  tourist

taxis,  is  far  too small a number to  offset  the

shortage in our public transport system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imposition of the age limit for taxis at

seven  years appears to me to be too short a period

to  be  justified economically. Any taxi owner  can

tell you that running a taxi at, present is not  as

profitable a business as it is thought to be,  with

the  present high rate of road tax to be paid every

year and owners having to spend a considerable  sum

of  money  on  repair  bills in  order  that  their

vehicles  can pass the inspection of the  Registrar

of  Vehicles. If every owner has to make  plans  to

replace his vehicle every seven years, he will find

that  it  will be unprofitable to run  a  taxi  any

more. In order to continue his business he may have

to  demand  extremely high charges from the  driver

who hires his taxi. The final result is that it  is

the  public who ultimately pays the bill. If  every

taxi has to undergo a mechanical inspection at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>



the  Registry of Vehicles annually and  has  to  be

proved  serviceable and safe. I do not see  why  an

unrealistic  age  limit should be  set  for  taxis.

After  all, even a three-year old vehicle  can  be

found  unserviceable if the owner does not properly

maintain  and service it. I would like  to  propose

that  this  age  limit  be  lengthened  to  a  more

realistic period and that the mechanical inspection

of  public  transport vehicles at the  Registry  of

Vehicles be strictly enforced. In this way, I think

we will come nearer to a more realistic approach to

ensure that the public transport vehicles are  safe

for use and that they are economically feasible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Communications has already pointed out that these measures will affect the livelihood of a few thousand people. Owing to their wide social and economic repercussions, we would like him to give more careful thought and consideration before

implementing them.

irrefutable.   But   some   of   the   details   of

implementation leave room for some comment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In discussing this matter with some of my

constituents  one  feature  that  seems  to   evoke

objection  is  the  age  limit  to  be  imposed  on

vehicles. That there is some public consensus  with

regard to this has been indicated by the number  of

times  this  matter has been adverted to  by  other

Members in, this House. Many people are of the view

that  the road reliability of a vehicle depends  as

much  on  how  it is used and looked  after  as  on

simply  its age. It could be agreed that  we  would

like  to encourage owners and the drivers of public

service  vehicles  to  keep  their  vehicles  in  a

constant  condition of roadworthiness.  This  being

so,  stress should be laid on periodical inspection

of  vehicles  on  the basis of reasonably  exacting

standards.  Therefore,  if  vehicles  fulfil  these

standards, it may be possible to extend  their  age

limit  to  the  number  of years,  where  relevant,

originally  recommended by the  Transport  Advisory

Board.  In  other words, it would  be  possible  to

extend  the  lease of life of vehicles  beyond  the

limit  decided upon by the White Paper  up  to  the

limit  recommended by the Transport Advisory Board,

provided  that  such  vehicles  pass  the  required

inspection  test.  I wonder if the  Minister  would

deem  it feasible to have a lower and an upper  age

limit  for  vehicles,  a lower  limit  after  which

inspection  is more stringent, and an  upper  limit

beyond which the type of vehicle concerned will not

be allowed to operate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to refer to is the

position  of  school and pirate taxi drivers.  This

again  is another matter that has been referred  to

frequently in debate. Whatever the moral strictures-one  may  level  at the pirate taxi drivers,  they,

together with the school taxi drivers, still pose a

social  problem.  We  note in  the  White  Paper  a

comment that those associated with pirate taxi



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



operations  are  well  advised!  to  contemplate  a

meaningful  change  of occupation.  May  I  add  my

appeal to that of the Member for Jalan Kayu and the

Member  for  Anson that it might  be  possible  for

additional help, counselling and registration to be

given  to such people so that they may be relocated

to useful occupations?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find the White Paper's reference to "the

Republic's   aim   of  building  a   law   abiding,

disciplined, tightly knit and organised society for

Singapore"  most gratifying indeed. I think  it  is

essential  to  link this concept  with  traffic  on

Singapore roads. I would like to emphasise  a  view

that  has been expressed in this House before, that

seemingly the highways in Singapore constitute  the

last  bastion of a buccaneering disregard  for  the

law. This disregard is not confined to pirate taxis

-   the  highways  generally  remaining  the   last

stronghold  of  indiscipline,  disorganisation  and

indifference to others. May I express the hope that

the  problem  of  the standard of driving  will  be

attended   to  with  due  regard  being  given   to

enforcement  of the rules of the road.  It  may  be

useful if this White Paper is followed by a no less

significant declaration really to clean up  traffic

conditions   resulting  from  a  low  standard   of

driving.



<br><br>7.14 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I

would like to endorse my support, in principle,  of

this White Paper on the Reorganisation of the Motor

Transport Service of Singapore which was tabled  in

this House recently. Sir, may I refer to page 19 of

the White Paper under paragraph 6.11 Pilot Scheme -

Taxi  stops.  I wish to make a comment  on  taxi

stops  and  on the provision of special  slops  for

taxis  in  busy  streets.  I  would  say  that  the

conversions  of the present parking lots  and  taxi

stands to what are to he termed "taxi stops"  is  a

little  harsh  on the taxi drivers and,  therefore,

they  should  be abolished. I would like  give  two

reasons  for  the  abolition of these  taxi  stops.

First, it would only inconvenience



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



passengers  if  they are to alight at  these  stops

when  they are carrying large sums of money to  and

from  banks.  Similarly, it would cause unnecessary

inconvenience to the old, young and  the  sick  and

also  to  those who carry bulky parcels.  Secondly,

the  system is bound to cause confusion to tourists

who visit our country for the first time. Sir, taxi

drivers  are from time to time asked to  give  good

service  to the tourists. I submit that  taxis  are

not the only vehicles which cause congestion on the

streets. Privately-owned vehicles equally create  a

nuisance  by picking up and discharging  passengers

at places convenient to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in page 19 of the White Paper, paragraph

6.12   concerns  the  age  limit  for   taxis.   My

colleague, the Member for Sembawang, has taken  the

trouble  to go through the memorandum of  the  Taxi

Transport  Association and I wish to support  their

claim  that  the  age  limit  of  taxis  should  be

extended to 10 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister to clarify another

point. What will happen to the licence of an  owner

taxi  driver who dies or has passed the  retirement

age?  Can  the licence be passed on to the next-of-kin  so  as  to  ensure that no disruption  in  the

family's livelihood takes place?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope that the above suggestions and queries will be considered and answered.



<br><br>7.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, with urban development and the growth

of  population, it is quite natural that  transport

will  become an attendant problem. Big  cities  all

over  the  world  face transport problems  of  this

nature.  We  all  know  that transportation  is  an

essential factor in our daily routine. Everyone has

to  travel  daily.  So the earlier  we  solve  this

transport problem, the better it is for our people.

It means that they will be able to enjoy the fruits

of  a  comprehensive  and well-organised  transport

system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the problems facing Singapore at

the moment as a big city are quite natural.  As early as

ten years ago when the Government started



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>



planning  for urban renewal, adequate thinking  was

not given to the question of transport. That is the

reason  why  we have traffic jams at  present.  The

transport  service  is  not  satisfactory.   Public

transport  is inadequate and this has  led  to  the

growth  of  pirate  taxis. This  situation  is,  of

course,  an  anomaly and should be  rectified.  The

bold  and  far-sighted Minister for  Communications

presented  to  this  House a  White  Paper  on  the

Reorganisation  of the Motor Transport  Service  of

Singapore  last month. The White Paper  shows  that

the  Ministry  of Communications is  determined  to

overhaul the public transport system within a short

period of three years so that a lot of time will be

saved  for  the  public.  The  intentions  and  the

determination of the Minister are praiseworthy.  Of

course,   the  present  transport  system   is   an

accumulation  of  past ills and a  continuation  of

past   maladministration.  The  reorganisation   is

therefore timely and necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this plan of reorganisation, I am afraid that

the  people  who will be greatly affected  are  the

5,000  pirate and school taxi drivers. If  each  of

them has to support four persons, then about 20,000

people  will be affected by the reorganisation.  On

the other hand, the White Paper also shows that  in

the    reorganisation,   about   6,500   new    job

opportunities will be created. On the face  of  it,

it  is not difficult for the pirate taxi drivers to

switch  employment,  but there are  other  problems

which  require consideration and solution. Sir,  it

is  a fact that pirate taxis have been in existence

for  more than a decade. This shows that they serve

a  public  need and that there is value  for  their

existence. All these years, pirate taxis have  been

providing  an  essential transport service  to  our

people,  particularly the middle, and  lower-middle

classes. The fares they charge are reasonable. They

take  our workers to factories and offices, and  in

the newly-developed housing estates, they perform a

very important service. In new housing estates,  it

takes  time  before  buses can operate.  So  pirate

taxis  provide the only reasonable and  cheap  form

of transport for the estate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>



residents.  Furthermore,  they  have  also  made  a

valuable  contribution to our city  and  industrial

development.   Take,   for  example,   the   Jurong

industrial town. In the early days, there  were  no

buses  and  there  were very  few  factories  which

provided  transport for their workers.  The  pirate

taxis  were  the  only means of transport  for  the

workers.  It  is undeniable that they have  made  a

contribution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper says that after July next year

pirate taxis will not be allowed on the roads. What

will  happen  to the 5,000 pirate and  school  taxi

drivers? The employment and livelihood problems  of

these  people should receive priority consideration

of our popularly elected Government. Sir, all human

beings have their own dignity and self-respect.  If

there are other ways out, they will not take to  an

occupation  which  is  considered  illegal.  So  in

handling  the pirate taxi problem, the Ministry  of

Communications  must not only look into  the  legal

aspect  but also the humanitarian aspect. Tolerance

is  the key word to a problem of this nature.  When

our  country  is  prospering, we must  ensure  that

everybody has a share in the prosperity. We do  not

wish to see part of our population living below the

standard  of  the majority of the  people.  We  are

practising democracy and our Government is  elected

by  the people. So the livelihood of the people  is

the   responsibility  and  the  obligation  of  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I propose that the Ministry of Communications should set up a special committee for the conversion of the employment of pirate and school taxi drivers. All these problems are worthy of consideration. The people concerned should not just be written off. This is not the way for an

elected  government  to do  things.  We  must  take

positive  steps and adopt a positive  attitude  and

regard   pirate  taxi  drivers  as  part   of   our

citizenry.  So for the conversion of the employment

of  pirate and school taxi drivers, I think we  can

give  them special priority for the application  of

legal taxi licences or bus drivers' licences.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister for Communications will

give consideration to my proposals.



<br><br>7.26 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to make some observations on the proposals set

out in the White Paper on the Reorganisation of the

Motor  Transport Service of Singapore as  contained

in Paper Cmd. 21 of 1970 and for which the Minister

for  Communications  has moved  this  Motion.  Sir,

though  I share many of the views expressed  by  my

colleagues,  the Backbenchers, however,  I  do  not

agree with quite a number of them. The question  of

public  transportation  is indeed  a  very  complex

problem  and, therefore, this White Paper  is  most

welcome and a move in the right direction if we are

to have a more meaningful and more efficient public

transport service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I refer to bus services? I think the

amalgamation  of the 10 Chinese bus companies  into

three regional groupings is a correct move, because

many  of these bus companies have a fleet of  buses

ranging  from  slightly more than 10 to  more  than

100,  and they ply along a multiplicity of  routes.

So  I hope this amalgamation will not duplicate the

routes, as I note that such routes will have to  be

rearranged.  I  feel there should  be  several  bus

termini  in  the  city at which the  commuters  can

catch a bus home. In other words, those buses going

to  the  city  will  have their  terminus  at  such

termini.  This, Sir, I believe, will help  to  ease

traffic  congestion during the peak hours, although

I  admit that this may entail some inconvenience to

those commuters who have to rely on the buses. This

is   a  possibility  into  which  the  Ministry  of

Communications can look, because I have  seen  such

arrangements  carried  out  quite  successfully  in

several European countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the increase in the bus fleet from

the  present number of 1,339 to 2,000  by  1973,  I

believe this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



increase  will not be sufficient to meet the  needs

by  1973, because the number of commuters will have

increased  by  then. Therefore,  I  would  like  to

suggest  that there be a yearly assessment  of  the

immediate  needs rather than that  an  estimate  be

made  of how many buses will be needed in the  next

three  years. I think it is quite necessary to  set

up  a  Road  Transport Authority, as  mentioned  in

paragraph  13.3  (g)  on page  30  of  the  Report.

Paragraph 13.3 (g) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Omnibus Services Licensing Authority

Ordinance,  1956  is  to  be  amended  to  give  it

additional  and wider powers like a Road  Transport

Authority so that the reorganisation of our  Public

Transport service can be a success.'



<br><br>I  fully  agree  with  this,  Sir,  and  hope  this

Authority,  when  set up, will provide  the  public

with an efficient public transport service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the chapter in the

White Paper that deals with Mini School Buses. This

is  on page 16, paragraph 5.5. I would like to seek

clarification  from the Minister for Communications

on  the  type  of such buses and how many  students

each  can  carry. I bring up this point  because  I

believe that the scrapping of SCH taxis, which have

been  carrying children to and from school,  is  an

unwise move. As far as I know, these SCH taxis have

been  per, forming a social service for  the  many

parents  whose children are in the primary schools.

These  children  cannot, like the secondary  school

students, queue up for the buses. Therefore, it  is

only  right  that such mini buses replace  the  SCH

taxis.  In  other words, the holders  of  SCH  taxi

licences and drivers be given the priority to  own,

and  be  encouraged to own, mini buses  instead  of

letting  the bus companies operate both the  school

buses and the mini school buses. Whilst I agree  to

the scrapping of the SCH taxis, I would like to see

that they be replaced by mini school buses, because

the  mini  school buses will be able to carry  more

children  than  the  ordinary SCH  taxis.  This,  I

believe,  will be most welcome to the many  parents

who have to rely on SCH taxis.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the subject of pirate taxis. It is

interesting to note from the White Paper that  "the

majority  of the 6,800 private diesel vehicles  are

believed to be operating as `Pirate' taxis." It  is

also  pointed out in paragraph 7.8 that "all  those

now associated with `Pirate' taxi operations for  a

living are well advised to contemplate a meaningful

change of occupation, over the next eleven months .

. .". I must repeat this, that I share the views of

several  Members  on this matter.  Although  it  is

stated  in  paragraph 7.7 that there  will  be  job

opportunities numbering no less than 6,500, I  fail

to  see the point that before 1st July, 1971, these

pirate  taxis  would have to be off the  road,  and

therefore  the operators would have to rehabilitate

themselves  in  a  much more meaningful  change  of

occupation,  because it cannot be denied  that  the

projection  of  6,500 jobs to be  created  will  be

spread over three years, and in 11 months more than

5,000  illegal operators will be off the road.  How

does  one equate the two? In this instance, I would

be most grateful if the Minister for Communications

would care to clarify.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some other points to be considered. One

is  that if these pirate taxi drivers should choose

to become bus drivers or lorry drivers, and if they

do  not  possess the necessary licence to  drive  a

heavier  class  of  vehicles, they  would  have  to

undergo and pass that examination. Should they wish

to apply for a taxi driver's licence, they ought to

be  successful in the application. Here I am  happy

to  note  that  the White Paper clearly  sees  that

"there  is no reason why licences for taxi  drivers

should  not  be  freely  issued  hereafter  to  any

citizen who is competent and able enough to qualify

for  such licence." But even if such issuance  were

to  be  relaxed,  I  believe it  would  undoubtedly

increase  the number of taxi drivers.  Here  again,

another  problem will be faced, and that is whether

or  not we will have sufficient taxis for them.  It

is noted that the number of taxis will be increased

from  the present fleet of 3,800 to 5,000.  Of  the

1,200  taxi  licences  to be issued,  200  will  be

reserved for special taxis. I do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



think  this  number of 1,000 taxi  licences  to  be

issued  to  the  N.T.U.C.'s Transport  Co-operative

will be adequate to meet the needs, since 5,000  or

more  pirate  taxis will have to be  off  the  road

before 1st July, 1971, and if they decide to switch

to  the  occupations which I mentioned just now.  I

would like to refer the Minister for Communications

to  the  statement  he made in this  House  on  9th

April,  1969. This was in reply to the question  by

the  Member for Bukit Panjang, who is not here. The

Minister agreed "that pirate taxis, though  running

illegally, are performing a form of social function

in   providing  an  element  of  public   transport

service."  This is contained in Hansard,  Vol.  28,

No.  12, col. 940. Sir, I think his Ministry should

assist in the rehabilitation of pirate taxi drivers

in  this respect. But let me hasten to add, lest  I

be misconstrued as being mischievous by quoting the

reply out of context, that I wish to reiterate that

I  am firm in my view, because the Minister further

states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As the adequacy and efficiency of the public

transport  services  improve,  there  should  be  a

consequent  decrease in the number of pirate  taxis

running on the road.'



<br><br>In my view, Sir, the position has not changed since

then.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the stipulation that the taxi

drivers'  age  limit be 60 years with  a  grace  of

three  years, I would make a humble request to  the

Minister  to consider extending it to  65.  Sir,  I

make this request because I have been approached by

some  elderly taxi drivers who have pointed out  to

me  that  they have large families and  that  their

children  are either in school or are  not  earning

enough   to  help  maintain  their  families,   and

therefore,  they drive taxis in order to supplement

their  income. I earnestly hope that  the  Minister

will  sympathetically consider  my  request.  These

drivers  have  also emphasised that if  they  could

afford it, they would not want to work beyond  that

age,   but   it  is  because  of  their   financial

circumstances  that they have to  continue  driving

taxis.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several of my colleagues have made the point that

the  age limit for taxis should be set at ten years

as recommended by the Transport Advisory Board, the

Chairman of which is the Parliamentary Secretary to

the Minister for Communications. Instead, the White

Paper  has accepted the recommendation of the  1966

Committee  of Review, i.e., that the age  limit  be

set  at  seven years. Sir, I just wish to know  the

criterion  behind this decision,  and  perhaps  the

Minister can enlighten this House on how the figure

"7"  has  been  decided upon. Sir, I am  told  that

seven  years is an insufficient period  to  recover

the   high  costs  involved  in  buying   a   taxi,

maintaining  it, paying due taxes, etc.  The  limit

need to be extended to ten years, which would be  a

sufficient period, so that by the eleventh  year  a

new  taxi  could  be purchased.  Otherwise  in  the

eighth  year  a new taxi may probably  have  to  be

acquired  through hire purchase. Sir, I am positive

that  some transport associations have made written

representations to the Minister on this matter, and

I  can  only  hope that he will carefully  consider

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noted that the age limit for public service

buses   and  school  buses  is  17  and  20   years

respectively.  It is perfectly pertinent  to  point

out  here that the statement "subject to change  of

engine  every five years" in respect of such  buses

is,  I  think, ambiguous. What I wish  to  know  is

this: does it mean that after every five years  the

engine must be completely changed to a new one,  or

does  it  mean that the engine should be overhauled

or  reconditioned? Perhaps the Minister would  care

to clarify.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I fully support the recommendation

that  there should be an increase in staff  in  the

Registry  of Vehicles. But I feel that the proposed

increase is hardly sufficient to deal with problems

of such magnitude facing the Ministry and to ensure

that   the   public  gets  an  efficient  transport

service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I close, Sir, I would like to seek further

elucidation  from the Minister on "the  preliminary

study  of  possible  new measures"  by  two  senior

officials   from   the  London   Transport   Board.

Reference to this is contained in Hansard, Vol. 29,

No. 4, col. 167, dated 22nd December, 1969:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Two senior officials from the London Transport

Board  have already submitted "a preliminary  study

of  possible  new  measures to improve  and  expand

Singapore's mass transport facilities".'



<br><br>This  was  the reply by the Parliamentary Secretary

to  the Minister for Communications to my question,

and it goes on to say that the:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`report is being examined by officials from my

Ministry  and those from the Ministries of National

Development and Finance.'



<br><br>I wonder whether this report will be published, and

if so, when. I have asked this because, and again I

quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`a team of United Nations advisers attached to

our State and City Planning Office have in the past

two  years  been studying and assessing Singapore's

long-term needs in public transport, including  the

long-range  aspects  of providing  a  mass  transit

system for Singapore.'



<br><br>I  hope  this report is forthcoming because I  note

that  the  White  Paper  states  that  a  transport

consultant from South Australia `has been appointed

with terms of reference as stated therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I sincerely hope the Minister

will clarify the points I have raised.



<br><br>7.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

only a short comment to make on the seven-year  age

limit  of  taxis.  There  would  appear  to  be   a

consensus  that it will cause hardship.  I  endorse

the  point raised by the Member for Katong  that  a

properly-maintained taxi may well last beyond seven

years, without causing undue pollution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if the seven-year age limit for taxis is

imposed,  then I think the Minister might  want  to

consider allowing taxis to raise their fares beyond

the first mile or other than for the first



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



mile.  I  think it is only fair that  the  cost  of

pollution  control should also be partly  borne  by

the  travelling public and not solely by  the  taxi

owners.



<br><br>7.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

not   only  do  I  support  the  proposals  of  the

Government  on  the  Reorganisation  of  the  Motor

Transport Service of Singapore, but I also wish  to

congratulate  the  Minister for  Communications  on

taking  such bold and imaginative steps to  improve

the  present transport service. This move is timely

as  the  service  at present has  numerous  defects

resulting    in    considerable   discomfort    and

inconvenience to the travelling public. It  can  be

expected that the radical move as evidenced in  the

White  Paper  is  likely to bring  about  attendant

problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of my colleagues in this House have made

valuable  observations on the different aspects  of

the  proposals as contained in the White Paper, and

I  do  not  therefore propose  to  comment  on  the

details  of these proposals. However, I would  like

to  make some observations on the points raised  by

the  Member  for Jalan Kayu. He has mentioned  that

for  a bus service to be efficient, there must  not

only be sound professional management but also  the

co-operation  of  the  bus workers.  I  would  have

thought  that  to improve the bus  service  and  to

increase the comfort of the travelling public it is

not  only  necessary to have sound management  with

the  full  co-operation of labour, but that  it  is

also important that the travelling public should co-operate by showing more orderly behaviour, such  as

queueing up for a bus and not scrambling for places

in   the   bus  when  it  stops  at  the  terminus,

particularly during peak hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the co-operation and conduct of

workers  necessary  to  ensure  an  efficient   bus

service, the Member for Jalan Kayu can rest assured

that  the N.T.U.C, is always conscious of its  role

to  exhort  the  bus  workers to demonstrate  their

courtesy to the travelling public.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> We hope that the travelling

public will also co-operate to ensure their comfort

and convenience while travelling in buses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point raised by the Member for Jalan Kayu

with  regard to the intention of the Government  to

issue  1,000 taxi licences to the proposed Workers'

Transport  Co-operative  of  the  N.T.U.C.,  I  can

assure him that every effort will be made to ensure

the success of the Co-operative. The N.T.U.C, is at

the  moment  finalising the steps  to  set  up  the

Workers' Transport Co-operative, and they  will  be

made known at the appropriate time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the many underlying social objectives

behind  the proposal of the N.T.U.C, to  start  the

Workers'  Transport Co-operative,  let  me  mention

just  one. This is to give a stake to the many taxi

drivers in the Republic to help them own their  own

taxis. We hope that in turn they will give a better

and   more  courteous  service  to  the  travelling

public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> That is most reassuring, Sir!



<br><br>7.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am most

grateful  to my colleagues on the opposite  Benches

for  their  valuable comments on  the  Government's

very controversial White Paper. As I have mentioned

earlier this evening, any plan of reorganisation is

somewhat  disturbing because it  upsets  people  in

their  usual  way  of  life. But  the  business  of

government  is  to  govern, not  harshly  but  with

firmness and reasonableness, and many Members  have

indicated that we should also be sympathetic. I see

no  reason  why in the reorganisation consideration

should  not  be given to problems which  may  arise

therefrom  or which may not have been  foreseen  in

the  White Paper. I think .a man must be a fool  if

he  thinks  he has the answers to all the problems.

But it was necessary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



to table this White Paper to make it known  to

all  and sundry that something at last is going  to

be done about road transport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall attempt, to the best of my ability, to cover all the points that have been raised today by no less than 11 Members. I shall follow the order in which the points have appeared in the White Paper, beginning with the bus service, and followed by a discussion of the other subjects.

I  think  it  is useful to touch, first,  upon  the

point  raised by the Member for Jalan Kayu when  he

said that he welcomed the proposed amalgamation  of

the  10  Chinese bus companies into three companies

as  a  step  in  the  right direction  for  merging

smaller  companies  into  larger  units,  and   the

importance    of   introducing   modem   management

technique.  He ended up with the hope that  similar

contributions would come from the workers,  a  hope

to  which  the  Member for Moulmein responded  very

well.  We  do have to get the co-operation  of  the

management,  labour  and  members  of  the  public,

because  in any change of system or reorganisation,

there will be some upset here and there during  the

transition period, but with a little give and take,

an  understanding of the larger interests, and  the

ability to withstand certain inconveniences  for  a

time, all will ultimately enjoy the benefits  of  a

much improved public transport service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move on to the Member for Punggol's comment

on   the  establishment  of  more  bus  termini  in

Singapore. May I draw his attention to page  11  of

the   White  Paper,  paragraph  4.5  Study  to   be

conducted  on co-ordination and rationalisation  of

bus routes. The White Paper has been tabled for one

month  now. There is a paragraph which says that  a

"transport consultant has been appointed . . , with

the  following terms of reference: -". If  he  will

look at sub-paragraph (f) , this is one of his terms

of reference:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Determine locations and number of bus terminus

reported;'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> On a point of clarification,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> The terminus I referred to is

one   where  all  buses  would  forgather  and  all

commuters would go to that place. It is not just  a

question of whether we need more termini. It  is  a

sort  of central station. I hope that clarifies  my

point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Both the Member for Punggol

and  I  are laymen. I think we can leave it to  the

experts  to  suggest  how  we  can  implement   the

recommendations. What I wanted to say was that this

point   has  not  been  forgotten.  It   is   being

considered,  and when the report is  available,  it

will  be  tabled for discussion, if necessary.  The

Member  for  Punggol then dwelt upon the  necessity

for  the  establishment of  a  road  authority.  He

referred  in  this case to page 30, paragraph  13.3

(g) :



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Omnibus Services Licensing Authority

Ordinance,  1956  is  to  be  amended  to  give  it

additional  and wider powers like a Road  Transport

Authority so that the reorganisation of our  Public

Transport service can be a success.'



<br><br>Work is going on in the Ministry to suggest various

amendments  to the legislation and a Bill  will  be

forthcoming before this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member enquired further whether a change of

engine  for  a bus every five years as required  in

paragraph  3.9 (e) meant a new engine.  The  answer

is,  of course, yes. I believe that covers most  of

the points on the bus services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now come to taxis which seem to have been

given  considerable attention. The point  that  has

generated considerable interest, as I can  see,  is

the  imposition of the age limit for taxis at seven

years.  First of all, I would like to reply to  the

comment by the Member for Whampoa when he said that

it  would be fair to pass the cost of paying  close

attention to air pollution to the public by raising

taxi  fares.  I  think we should be  very  hesitant

about raising fares, because it will, in turn, mean

a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>



rise  in  the cost of living all round. We actually

did  that when we increased the taxi fare  for  the

first  mile from 40 to 60 cents on the 1st of July.

I  think that is about as far as we can go  at  the

moment.  A  good  many  Members  the  Members   for

Sembawang, Paya Lebar, Anson, Punggol, and Katong -

all say that this limit of seven years seems to  be

somewhat hard. They suggest, why not go back to  10

years  as  recommended  by the  Transport  Advisory

Board?  As  the Transport Advisory Board  has  done

very  good  work and has assisted me in  this  very

difficult  task  of trying to put the  Ministry  in

good  shape, I would be very hesitant not to accept

its  recommendation  in this respect.  But  if  the

Members  will be good enough to refer  to  page  8,

paragraph 3.9 of the White Paper, I have given  the

reason  why  we  have put the age  limit  at  seven

years,  although the Transport Advisory  Board  did

recommend ten years for the life of a taxi. The sub-paragraph reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As TAB's [Transport Advisory Board's]

recommendations were made one month before the Anti-pollution  campaign  was  launched  by  the   Prime

Minister,  it will be necessary to make adjustments

to  the recommendations of TAB in order to meet the

higher  standards  of performance  and  maintenance

demanded under the Anti-pollution campaign. It  has

therefore  been  decided that TAB's recommendations

be accepted with.variations: --`.



<br><br>Why  seven years? There was already a committee  as

far back as 1966 which recommended that the life of

a  taxi  should be seven years. We are  already  in

1970.  I think we should have the courage to accept

the  recommendation of four years  ago  that  seven

years  is adequate. In fact, if we go back to 1959,

no  taxis which were more than five years old  were

allowed  on  the  road.  So  there  is  already   a

concession made to taxi owners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the economics of it, I will just give

a  simple arithmetical calculation to show  whether

the  owners of taxis are really made to pay such  a

heavy  price  to  replace their taxis  after  seven

years. I believe it is generally accepted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>



that a taxi is let out on hire for about $25 a  day

- one morning shift and one night shift.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> It is about $22.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Let us say $25 for easier

calculation,  otherwise it might be  a  little  bit

difficult. If it is $25 a day, then for one year  -

let us say, instead of 365 days it is 350 days - it

means that if my calculation is correct, it will be

$8,750. In other words, the capital cost of a  taxi

is  recovered in one year and the owner is  allowed

to use it for seven years. I do not think I need go

any further on that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, it is just common sense that the older

the  vehicle, the more the repair bill, and it will

not be worth while having an old taxi that will not

be  on  the road earning money but in the workshop,

and  the  owner  has to pay $400 or  $500  for  the

repair bill. It is cheaper to sell it and get a new

vehicle  and  earn money. I am afraid Members  have

forgotten the economics of the proposition and have

not checked the calculations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on now to the special tourist taxis. I

believe the Member for Sembawang has suggested that

the  200 taxis should not be farmed out but  should

go  to  the N.T.U.C.'s Transport Co-operative.  The

N.T.U.C, will  have its hands full  looking  after

1,000 taxis. So it is better to allow the other 200

taxis  to be let out on tender. May I say that  the

special  tourist taxis will be of a more  luxurious

type, air-conditioned, bigger in size, with a 2,000

c.c, engine,  and probably costing not  less  than

$10,000  per taxi. Fifty of these taxis  will  cost

half a million dollars and 200 taxis will be a cool

$2 million investment, so much so that we are going

to put them out to tender in four separate lots.  I

think  it  is  not so easy to have half  a  million

dollars  invested in 50 taxis at one time. I  think

the  allocation of 1,000 taxis to the  N.T.U.C, is

enough to keep them busy for some time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the age limit for taxi drivers at 60

years,  if  the  Member  will  refer  to  page  19,

paragraph   6.10   of   the   White   Paper,    the

recommendation of the Transport Advisory  Board  is

to  introduce an age limit for taxi drivers  at  60

years with a grace period of three years, and  this

has  been accepted by me. I think it is a bit  hard

for  me to reject this recommendation. Members like

me  to accept what the Transport Advisory Board has

suggested. This is one of the recommendations  that

it  has suggested and now that I have accepted  it,

they  say it is not good enough. I prefer to  stick

to what is in the White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has made the suggestion

that  taxis should be allowed to use car  parks.  I

see no reason why they should not be allowed if the

taxi  drivers pay for it. Of course, a taxi  driver

cannot just go to a public car park, parks his taxi

for  free, and goes for his meal. But if  he  parks

his taxi in the public car park and is prepared  to

pay  the regular 20 or 40 cents, I personally think -



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> They are not allowed to do

that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I will look into this matter.

I  cannot  see  the  logic of  it.  It  is  a  good

suggestion  which I am prepared to follow  up  with

the party concerned. In this respect, of course, it

is  true  that  the  Car Parks  Division  is  in  a

different  Ministry, and I will have to seek  their

co-operation to agree to this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now answer the question why it is not in

my   Ministry  as  proposed  by  the   Member   for

Sembawang. He said that the Traffic Police and  the

Car  Parks  Division  should also  come  under  the

Ministry of Communications. That is the prerogative

of  the Prime Minister. I am only the Minister  for

Communications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu asked about the

progress of the N.T.U.C.'s



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>



Transport  Co-operative. I  think  the  Member  for

Moulmein  has  answered him adequately.  Since  the

Member  for  Moulmein has spoken  on  it,  I  shall

proceed with other matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Changi has raised the question of taxi stops. This is a pilot scheme and, like reorganisation, there are inconveniences arising from it. People are not accustomed to stopping at certain designated places. It is a little upsetting. Originally, it

was  intended  to  operate this scheme  along  four

streets. This is stated in page 19, paragraph  6.11

of the White Paper:

<pre>

          `(a)    Cecil Street.

           (b)    Raffles Place.

           (c)    Robinson Road.

           (d)    Shenton Way.'

</pre>

Since  then the scheme has been extended to another

three streets, i.e., Collyer Quay, Raffles Quay and

Finlayson  Green. There are, in all, 16 taxi  stops

in seven streets. It is a matter of opinion whether

or  not  this  scheme is a success. Those  who  are

inconvenienced will say that it is not  a  success.

But  many people have said that it is a jolly  good

idea.  They  know  where to get  a  taxi.  Because,

believe  it  or  not, there are some  taxi  drivers

operating  in  Raffles  Place  who  have  made  our

citizens angry. They just cruise around looking for

foreign  tourists  and  refuse  to  take  our   own

citizens  who are prepared to pay for it.  Now  the

people  can stand at a taxi stop and jump into  any

taxi that comes along. I think it is time that taxi

drivers who refuse to take fares and, instead, look

for  foreign visitors, should be pulled up and have

their  licences  suspended.  I  have  given  strict

instructions  that this should be  followed.  So  I

think  this  pilot  scheme  should  be  allowed  to

operate. Of course, the usual story will be,  "What

about  those who are sick?" Not every one is  sick.

We  cannot take individual cases and put them up as

examples. I have been assured by the Traffic Police

that if it is a sick person who is being taken by a

taxi  to  a dispensary, no action will be taken  by

them. Of course,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>



they will probably take down the number of the taxi

concerned,  and  if an explanation  is  given,  the

incident  is  forgotten. That  assurance  has  been

given  to  me. So I see no reason why,  because  of

that,  we  must  do away with taxi stops.  We  must

think of the whole and not of the part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards confusion caused to foreign tourists,

I  do not think it is so. If they come from certain

countries  in Europe, this is their system.  It  is

time  that  we learned that what is being  done  in

Britain  or  in the United States need not  be  all

right  for  Singapore. There are many things  being

done   elsewhere,   not  in  the   English-speaking

countries, where wonderful ideas can be picked  up.

We, in Singapore, should learn from others if it is

a good point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the point of legalised taxis, in case the

owner  of a taxi retires because of age, how  shall

we  deal  with  his  taxi  licence?  I  think  this

question has caused worry to some people, and I  am

prepared  to consider that the taxi licence  should

continue  with the owner until he dies.  It  should

not  be part and parcel of, shall we say, the man's

property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the real meat of the debate is on pirate

taxis.  I  think we have to be clear in  our  minds

when  we  talk  about  this  subject  and  not  get

involved  because of sob stories, sympathy  and  so

on.  First  of all, we must get down  to  the  root

cause  of  this. Surely our approach to  the  whole

problem  is  that pirate taxis came into  operation

because  of  the  inadequacy of the  bus  services.

Since  this is a White Paper produced to reorganise

the  public  transport service to improve  the  bus

services,  our approach should be, "Yes, how  shall

we  go about it to improve the bus services so that

there will be less opportunity for the pirate  taxi

driver to operate?" The approach should not  be  to

look  at  the  other side of the problem  and  say,

"Poor  fellows,  what shall we do with  them?"  The

Member  for  Paya  Lebar even suggested  that  they

should  be  legalised and given special  routes  to

operate. This is doing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



just  the  opposite. In other  words,  he  wants  a

continuation  of  the present situation  by  giving

them the status of legality.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  would like to clarify what I said just now. What

I meant was that we should legalise pirate taxis so

that  the  pirate taxis drivers can  still  earn  a

living. For instance, the Speaker of the House  was

an  adviser to the Singapore Ex-political Detainees

Association which looks after the rehabilitation of

its  members. The White Paper does not provide  for

the rehabilitation of pirate taxi drivers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, 6,500 jobs

are  being created and pirate taxi drivers will  be

given  an opportunity to take up these jobs. I  see

no   reason  why  they  should  be  given   special

treatment. Here is the opportunity. Here is the way

out.  Shall  I  put it this way in discussing  this

problem  without stirring up emotion?  Supposing  a

man  gets  cheap cigarettes because they have  been

smuggled into Singapore without paying the tax.  Do

you  raise a hue and cry if the person who smuggled

them in is caught and sentenced? Or if the owner of

a car will not buy petrol from an authorised petrol

kiosk  but pinches it from the British Army  -  the

petrol  is blue in colour and he is caught,  fined,

or  his  car  is confiscated. Do you speak  on  his

behalf? Do you pity him because he was only  trying

to  get cheap petrol? Surely any responsible person

will say, "Well, he asked for it; he got it."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this reorganisation, the N.T.U.C, will be

forming  a  co-operative. They welcome  the  pirate

taxi  operator  as a member of the co-operative.  I

think  it  is $50 a share. Do you mean to say  that

his  taxi  is worth less than $50? If he  means  to

change,  he should join the co-operative.  Or  even

the  SCH  taxi  operators, if they really  want  to

change, it can be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bus companies themselves realise that they

will have to increase their bus fleet. According to

the  White Paper, it is not less than 300 new buses

each year for the next three years. Each bus



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



can  employ  five people. These bus  companies  are

prepared to employ any pirate taxi operator or  SCH

taxi  driver interested in a legitimate job. So  we

have the N.T.U.C, and the bus owners coming forward

to  say, "Let us get together to make this  plan  a

success."  This is where I think the suggestion  of

the  Member for Jalan Kayu is a sound one.  We  are

prepared  to  register  them  if  they  will   come

forward.  Not  many  people are  prepared  to  come

forward   and  say,  "Yes,  I  am  a  pirate   taxi

operator."  I  hope the Member for Paya  Lebar  can

assist  in  this  registration.  The  pirate   taxi

operator should not just turn up and say that he is

a  pirate taxi operator. We want to have more facts

than  just  that.  I  am  prepared  to  conduct   a

registration campaign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a bus drivers' training school and are

prepared  to increase the intake from 50 each  time

to 150. It is a 5- to 6-week course. Bus companies,

too,  cannot  get  qualified bus  drivers.  We  are

prepared to step up the enrolment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the point raised by the Member for

Punggol,  we  will step up the issue of  vocational

licences  for  those wishing to  switch  over  from

illegitimate driving as pirate taxi operators or as

SCH operators to legitimate employment. We will  do

all  that. But we cannot concede and give them this

and  give them that. Some Members say they are poor

fellows. They are not poor. They may appear  to  be

poor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol says that the plan is

offering 6,500 jobs but that it is over a period of

three years. Therefore, we appear to be harsh if we

ask  the pirate taxi operators to stop in a  year's

time.  But  if the Member will look into the  White

Paper again at page 23, 4,150 jobs are likely to be

created in the first year. This is no small  number

of  job opportunities. A good number of pirate taxi

operators are doing it part-time and earning a  few

extra  dollars.  But the number of people  who  are

making a living out of it could very well be 4,000.

I do not know. It has yet to be seen.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of

clarification.  I am not saying  in  any  way  that

taking  them off the road in 11 months' time  is  a

harsh  move. I am all for the eradication of pirate

taxis. Let me make my stand very clear.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> But what I am afraid is this:

can  the  Ministry  of Communications  within  this

period  absorb  the  more than  5,000  pirate  taxi

drivers - let us not argue about the figure  -  and

will  the  job  opportunities created  by  the  bus

companies, the N.T.U.C., etc., be sufficient?  Just

now  the Minister has mentioned the training of bus

drivers at 150 each time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> It is a 5-week course.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Yes, a 5-week course and the

intake  will be increased from 50 to 150.  This  is

welcome news and I am happy to hear it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I think I can now move on to

the  SCH  taxis. It is most unfortunate, Sir,  that

the  SCH  taxis  have got involved in  pirate  taxi

operations.  They started off quite  well.  When  I

took  over the Ministry two years ago, some of them

came   to   see   me  because,  as  I   said,   the

Association's  premises are in my constituency.  It

was  at the meet-the-people sessions that they came

to  see  me and I was told that some SCH taxis  had

been nabbed by the police and they asked whether  I

could  do  something for them. That was in November

1968.  My  answer was, "If the police have  already

nabbed them, I am sorry I cannot do a thing. But  I

will  advise  the Traffic Police  to  lay  off  and

instead go after the pirate taxis proper. They have

got the SCH licences. Lay off until such time as  I

can  decide  on their fate." And as stated  in  the

White  Paper, Sir, at page 21, paragraph  7.3,  you

can  see  the  figures of pirate taxi  arrests.  In

1968,  1.156 pirate taxis were arrested;  in  1969,

958, which is almost a thousand. But in 1969/70, no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>



SCH  taxis were arrested because I told the Traffic

Police  to  leave them alone until a  decision  had

been made. The relevant paragraph reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The absence of arrests of SCH School Taxis for

1969/70,  was not due to exemplary conduct  of  SCH

Taxis  but  the  fact  that in  November  1968  the

Ministry [which is really myself~ requested Traffic

Police  not to harass SCH Taxis, pending a decision

which  would  be  decided under this reorganisation

plan.'



<br><br>Unfortunately,  because of  this,  they  just  took

advantage  of the situation and merrily went  about

pirate  taxi-ing proper. The majority of them  were

not   taking  school  children.  They  were  openly

driving up and down the road. They thought the  SCH

plate  gave  them  protection.  That  was  a   very

ridiculous  state of affairs. Two weeks ago,  after

the White Paper was published in the Chinese press,

I had to instruct the Traffic Police to carry on as

they used to. So the SCH taxis, which are operating

openly now as pirate taxis, are being nabbed.  That

is why we hear of people running around and sending

petitions here and there supposedly in the name  of

the   Committee   for  the  safeguarding   of   the

livelihood  of  SCH  drivers'.  They  are  not  SCH

drivers.  They are pirate taxis operating  as  such

but  with SCH plates. These things have been  going

on,  with  transfers of SCH licences at a  cost  of

$2,000   a  licence.  By  buying  an  SCH  licence,

therefore,  they  have a legal  way  of  conducting

themselves as pirate taxi operators. This is  where

we  have got to be very clear in our stand. We must

differentiate  between  the  genuine  SCH   drivers

taking school children from home to school and from

school to home and those who brazenly drive up  and

down   the  busy  streets  picking  up  passengers,

stopping  at bus stops and doing things like  that.

This  state  of affairs cannot go on.  The  Traffic

Police will pick them up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has asked whether SCH taxi

drivers will be encouraged to own and operate  mini

school  buses. The answer is "yes". In fact,  there

are  at least 150 of the 900 SCH licences which are

mini  buses  or  station wagons, and the  operators

have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



been asked to change their licence to an SCB plate,

which  is a school bus or a mini school bus series,

and  the  N.T.U.C, is also about  to  operate  such

buses.  They are vans and station wagons,  but  not

ordinary  private cars. So long as  they  have  SCB

plates, we can keep a watch on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the goods vehicles. As I mentioned

earlier,  we  received a petition  from  the  Lorry

Owners'  Association.  I  think  the  Members   for

Sembawang  and Jalan Kayu are concerned that  there

is  no  indication as to how the phasing  out  will

take  place. It stands to reason that  it  will  be

phased  out  gradually  over  a  period  of   time.

Naturally, the oldest vehicles will first  have  to

be  changed to new ones. You find a lot of these 25

years  old  rickety vehicles breaking down  in  the

heart  of town, causing traffic jams and so  forth.

There  is no doubt that we do not want an immediate

change  of all lorries that are more than 15  years

old.  We  will  first pick out those that  are  the

oldest, and gradually come to those approaching  15

years for the change-over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few miscellaneous questions. I have

already  answered the one posed by the  Member  for

Sembawang,  that  the Traffic Police  and  the  Car

Parks  Division should come under the  Ministry  of

Communications. Logically they should, but I am not

in   charge  of  the  demarcation  of  duties   and

responsibilities. That is the responsibility of the

Prime Minister. Perhaps if the Member for Sembawang

will   write   a  letter  to  the  Prime   Minister

suggesting this change-over, he might agree, but  I

think  I  have  enough on my plate. I would  prefer

looking  after my Ministry as it is, for  the  time

being.  This reorganisation plan will give me  more

white hairs than I have now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also raised the question

of  the  discourtesy of the ROV, staff. Since  1959

the   P.A.P.   Government   has   never   tolerated

discourtesy  in  Government  departments.   It   is

sometimes  possible that a member of the staff  may

have  had  a bad night, e.g., a scolding  from  his

wife for going



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



home  late,  and turns up for office the  next  day

with  a  sour face. This can happen. It is  humanly

possible.   As   a  rule,  we  do   not   encourage

discourtesy.  If  a  member of  the  public  has  a

genuine  complaint and is able to say that "I  came

to  the R.O.V, one day and was treated badly by  so

and  so", we will look into it and have the  Public

Service  Commission take action on  it.  There  are

disciplinary  rules.  One  must  be  definite   and

specific in making a complaint. If it is a  genuine

case,  we  will look into it. But it is  not  quite

fair to tar everybody with the same brush.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol says that he agrees to the

increase  of  staff for the R.O.V. I am  very  glad

that  he  supports the Ministry's request for  more

staff. On the other hand, he says that he does  not

feel  that  the increase is adequate.  I  wish  the

Minister for Finance thinks the same. I would  like

to  say  this. If the Member will turn to page  28,

paragraph 12.2 (b) Enforcement Section of the White

Paper, he will see that in 1962, the original staff

of  the  R.O.V. Inspectorate was 45. Lower down  in

the third paragraph, it is now suggested to recruit

"80  additional men for the Traffic Police  (to  be

attached  to  ROV.)". The Member  says  it  is  not

enough, but 80 additional men represent 50 per cent

of the present establishment of the Traffic Police.

There  are  only 160 men in the Traffic  Police  at

this  moment. And asking for 80 men is  asking  for

one-half  of  the  present establishment!  This  is

already  a  big  mouthful, and  if  I  can  get  80

additional men, I think I am very lucky.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol then refers to the report

of  the  two London Transport officials. He  quotes

the  Hansard of 1969, which is a year ago, and also

mentions the fact that in another reply a  team  of

U.N, advisers  have  been in the  State  and  City

Planning Department for the last two years  working

on a mass rapid transit system. If he will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



again  refer to page 34 of the White Paper, section

Ii, under the title Reports and documents etc.,  he

will find item (5) of section II which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Rail Transit Plan for Singapore, May, 1968 by P.

E.  Garbutt  and  F.  S. P. Turner  of  the  London

Transport Board (Restricted).'



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Why not have the report

published?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Unfortunately, the report is

not for circulation but for study by the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item (7) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mass Rapid Transit Study Monograph No. 8 June

1969,    State   and   City   Planning   Department

(Restricted).'



<br><br>May  I  say this - that in the White Paper  passing

mention  was made of mass rapid transit. Since  the

World  Bank has expressed an interest in conducting

a   feasibility  study,  we  hope  that  when  this

feasibility   study  is  completed  and   it   does

recommend a mass rapid transit system, then perhaps

by  the  1980s  we  will be able to  travel  either

underground or overhead. By then, we will  be  able

to  have  a  proper  public transport  system  with

improved bus services on the road and some form  of

mass rapid transit either underground or overhead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament approves the proposals of

the  Government on the Reorganisation of the  Motor

Transport Service of Singapore as set out in  Paper

Command 21 of 1970.
